RESEARCHERS DISCOUNT A WELFARE EXODUS
When Mayor Giuliani predicted that many poor New Yorkers would move out of state as a "natural consequence" of the welfare cuts he is championing, there were cries of outrage from advocates for the poor. But perhaps more telling, demographers, economists and poverty experts who have researched the migratory patterns of welfare recipients say the Mayor is simply mistaken. National studies by independent researchers have consistently found that differing levels of welfare benefits are seldom the primary motivation behind a move. A1.
Finally it is out in the open, the assumption behind New York's new, get-tough welfare policies: they might tempt the poor to leave town. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick, B4.
 
 NEW YORK CITY
 
A NEW SHIELD FOR A NEW ERA
Just before midnight yesterday, housing police officers in the Melrose section of the Bronx fastened a plastic plate high on the wall behind the station desk bearing the shield of the New York City Police Department. For the officers there, the act symbolized a merger that would forever change the structure of law enforcement in New York City. B3.
 
MOURNING A BUSINESSMAN AND FRIEND
Yesterday, five days after Thomas Cuevas, 55, was killed in what was apparently a robbery, old friends and people who had never met exchanged similar stories about him at Park Abbey Funeral Chapel in the Bronx. Hundreds of people, from gang members to legislators, filed past the body of Mr. Cuevas and paid their respects to his daughter and son. B3.
 
REBUILDING, AGAIN, AFTER AN ARSON FIRE
When an arson fire tore through the 90-year-old synagogue of Congregation Derech Emunoh in the Rockaways last July 12, Stuart Nadel responded with tools and paint brushes and an ardor for saving it from the ravages of urban decay. After a suspected arson fire early yesterday ripped a gaping new hole in the synagogue's roof, Mr. Nadel, now head of the congregation's restoration effort, said he had no choice but to keep rebuilding.

ACTOR HAS A HEART ATTACK ON STAGE
Audience members at the final preview performance of "On the Waterfront" at the Brooks Atkinson Theater said they thought at first that it was part of the plot: an actor fell forward onto the stage during a tense scene several seconds before the curtain closing the first act. But as the dialogue stopped and the performers on stage crouched around the fallen actor, Jerry Grayson, it became apparent that something was wrong. B3.

WELFARE LIMITS SET IN HARTFORD
Averting a contentious battle over changes in the state's welfare system, Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Hartford have agreed on a plan that would establish the nation's strictest time limit on how long people can remain on the welfare rolls. The plan would also make Connecticut the second state in the nation with a two-tiered welfare system. B4.
 
SEX OFFENDERS BARRED FROM PROGRAM
Signaling his support for harsher measures against sex crimes, Governor Pataki has signed an executive order prohibiting sex offenders from participating in a new program for nonviolent felons. The order means that people convicted of nonviolent sexual offenses cannot be assigned by judges to a highly intensive probation program. B4.
 
HOSPITAL FACES RETURN OF DEFICITS
Long Island's only public hospital, the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, could lose $25 million a year in state aid under Governor Pataki's proposed budget, putting new pressure on the county to sell or lease the hospital, county officials say. The loss in aid would result from the Governor's plan to cut Medicaid costs by $1.2 billion. B5.
 
A.C.L.U. DISCIPLINES A RENEGADE MEMBER
In a rare move to discipline one of its own adherents, the American Civil Liberties Union voted to suspend a renegade member of its New Jersey chapter for five years for stuffing the ballot box in a 1994 election. The member, Dr. Alan Bell, has contended that the A.C.L.U., which dedicates itself to protecting individual rights, is trying to silence him because of his dissidence. B2.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Movies Finally Look on the Dark Side of War

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30

 BODY:
In a new film released in Vietnam last week, the hero, a veteran named Hung, is a crazed tramp who lives on the streets and has hallucinations that the people around him are enemy soldiers. He "fires" a bamboo pipe he mistakes for a machine gun and frightens villagers, who want him locked away in an insane asylum.
A John Wayne war epic this is not. 
 It is an odd, and remarkable, story for a film released as this country celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Communist victory in the Vietnam War.
"Of course, we could not make a film like this before," said the film's producer, Nguyen Dat Hai. He fought with the Vietcong, even though his three brothers were officers in the South Vietnamese Army and fled to the United States after 1975.
"But now we have more freedom," Mr. Hai said. "We wanted to tell the true story of the war. Even now, the veterans still suffer from a sickness of the mind. To treat this sickness there is no medicine. Only the hearts of the people can help them."
The Vietnam War inspired a number of popular films in the United States, some of which helped to focus attention on neglected war veterans.
In Vietnam, the war has been fodder for dozens of films since 1975, all dealing with the heroic aspects. Film makers dared not explore the darker side: the impact on the soldiers and their families.
With the release of Mr. Hai's "You'll Come Back" and three other recent films, that threshold has been crossed.
In "People Looking for the Past," a Communist soldier is despondent and incapable of getting on with his life after the war. He takes a journey back to a Mekong Delta battleground and along the way encounters an old girlfriend, a nemesis and ghosts of fallen soldiers.
Two other films also explore the troubled lives of war veterans.
"The films do not criticize Vietnam or the U.S.," said Nguyen The Dung, the director of "People Looking at the Past." Criticizing the Government is still not allowed, film makers say, and criticizing the United States is seen as pointless.
"We want to talk about the life of the soldier who suffers," Mr. Dung said.
The shift in direction of the war genre here reflects two changes in society: a relative openness that allows some debate over Vietnam's recent history, and the introduction of market economics.
Even though film companies are Government-owned, they are having to become self-sufficient. But all films must still be approved by censors; the title of "People Looking at the Past," for instance, was changed from "Beggars Searching for the Past" because the word "beggars" was seen as condescending.
"People are bored with the war," said Nguyen Quang Song, a novelist and screenwriter whose war film "The Wild Fields" was screened in the United States in 1988.
Indeed, an informal survey of moviegoers and customers at video shops found little interest in war movies. "We like love stories and action movies," a young Vietnamese man said. The only war movies some customers at a video shop seemed to like were American.
"We love 'Rambo,' " one man said, "even though we are not supposed to see it."
Mr. Song said: "Films about the battlefield are not popular. They do not make any money. Since the Government does not fund films anymore, we have to make films that people will see."
A film critic, Le Thu An, said people wanted to see war movies only if they dealt with the influences of the war on their lives today. "They do not want to see any more films about the battlefield," she said. "That is irrelevant. They want detail about how people go on with their lives."
Although she thinks the new direction of Vietnamese war films is a positive development, she is nonetheless critical. In "You'll Come Back," she said, "they make it so people watching the movie are afraid of the veteran, not sympathetic toward him."
Indeed, the veteran, Hung, is a pathetic character. But perhaps even more revealing are the heartless attitudes of some of the villagers and authorities.
When he is finally reunited with his family, who thought him long dead, stubborn local authorities refuse to grant him veteran's benefits. A local official snaps: "You are not the only family with a war invalid. How can we solve everything right away?"
And after the old soldier suffers a flashback and goes on a rampage, a neighbor tells the family it is unfair for them to keep this "lunatic" in the village.
The film is a true story, said Mr. Hai, the producer.
"There are many veterans like this," he said. "Many of them are badly treated. The Government cannot take care of all of them. But we make this film so people will understand their situation."

HEADLINE: Radical of '69 Donates Prize For Racial Accord at Cornell

 BODY:
In April 1969, a Cornell student, Thomas W. Jones, led more than 100 other black students in an armed takeover of the university's main student union. The explosive incident eventually forced the university president, James A. Perkins, to step down.
Now, 26 years later, Mr. Jones has surprised the campus of Cornell, in Ithaca, N.Y., by endowing an annual prize: the James A. Perkins Prize for Interracial Understanding and Harmony. 
 The first award of $5,000 is to be given on Thursday. The prize honors the Cornell student, faculty or staff member or program that contributed the most in the previous year to fostering racial understanding at the institution, which is still grappling with issues of race. Last month, the state began an investigation into allegations that some student housing at Cornell is illegally segregated along ethnic lines.
Mr. Jones himself has long reconciled with Cornell itself. By 1993, he had risen to become president of TIAA-CREF, the world's largest private pension fund, and that year, Cornell named him to its board of trustees. In announcing the prize earlier this year, Mr. Jones said it was a final reconciliation.
"President Perkins has contributed greatly to racial progress at Cornell," he said, "and is most worthy of recognition in praise. And, I want to atone, to the extent that I can, for the hurt and anguish he suffered personally as a result of the racial tensions which boiled over in April 1969."
Mr. Jones cited Mr. Perkins's "historic decision to increase very significantly the enrollment of African-American and other minority students at Cornell," saying the former university president "made a courageous and wise decision and deserves recognition and appreciation for his courage and wisdom."
Mr. Perkins, now an environmental policy consultant in Princeton, N.J., declined to be interviewed, saying, "This is going to be closing a chapter for me."
The students' armed occupation of Cornell's Willard Straight Hall lasted 34 hours, ending when the administration agreed to ask the faculty to rescind sanctions imposed against three students involved in an earlier demonstration over race relations.
But the faculty defied the administration's request, prompting 6,000 students to rally in the campus gymnasium. As 100 sheriff's deputies gathered downtown, the talk in the gymnasium mirrored the tension.
"In the past it has been the black people who have done all the dying," declared Mr. Jones, then a 19-year-old senior. "Now the time has come when the pigs are going to die, too. We are moving tonight. Cornell has until 9 to live. It is now three minutes past 8."
The faculty eventually rescinded the reprimands, but Mr. Perkins was replaced as president. Dale R. Corson, who succeeded Mr. Perkins as president in the summer of 1969, said: "Tom Jones left a legacy that wasn't the happiest in the world. I'm pleased to see this honor and the effort on Tom Jones's part to do something important for the community."
But Edward Whitfield, who helped Mr. Jones lead the demonstrations, said it was a mistake to name an award for Mr. Perkins. Reached in Greensboro, N.C., where he is now the chairman of a nonprofit economic development organization aimed at assisting minorities, he said: "I don't understand anything about his activity in the field or racial harmony that would make us want to name a serious award for him."

HEADLINE: Fire Ruins Synagogue Again, But Not Faith of Its Members

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC 

 BODY:
When an arson fire tore through the 90-year-old synagogue of Congregation Derech Emunoh in the Rockaways last July 12, Stuart Nadel responded with tools and paintbrushes and an ardor for saving it from the ravages of urban decay.
After a suspected arson fire early yesterday ripped a gaping new hole in the synagogue's roof, Mr. Nadel, now head of the congregation's restoration effort, said he has no choice but to keep rebuilding. 
 More than 100 firefighters battled the flames in the synagogue for about an hour before bringing the blaze under control at about 2:30 A.M., a fire department spokesman, Firefighter Elbert Washington, said. At one point, firefighters were ordered out of the building because their commander thought the two-story structure might crash.
"The preliminary report is that the fire was set," Firefighter Washington said, although investigators had not yet determined exactly what flammable material was used. The blaze started on a low ledge overlooking a lonely, litter-strewn lot stretching a quarter-mile to the ocean.
The police department labeled the fire a possible bias crime.
"You can listen to people and they'll tell you that," said the synagogue's President, Howard Finkelstein. "But it is not the case. If it were a bias case, they would have destroyed it. They would have ripped up the books. They would have turned over the pews."
Mr. Nadel agreed, saying that the fire was probably set by drug addicts who burglarized the temple in February, stealing electric appliances, radiators and other readily salable items, and who have repeatedly tried to break into the building since.
"Somebody has been trying to break into the back of the building since February," Mr. Finkelstein said. "They are trying to plunder the stuff from inside -- the decorations and the copper."
Mr. Nadel gazed at the twisted and blackened pieces of decorative copper cornice and a copper spire that had tumbled from the building into a yard. "There are thousands of dollars worth of copper here," he said.
The synagogue, at Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard in the Arverne section of Queens, was once the spiritual home of 2,000 worshipers. It was purchased by the city in 1978 as part of an urban-renewal project that left the neo-Georgian-style building stranded in a large grassy field that was once a warren of beach bungalows, Mr. Finkelstein said.
The congregation has leased the building from the city since and carries no insurance. He said the congregation normally uses the 600-seat structure only for Friday and Saturday prayers and for Hebrew classes and Sunday services. City workers finished repairing the fire-damaged tin ceiling of the sanctuary only three weeks ago, Mr. Nadel said.
No one was ever charged in connection with last summer's fire, and the police said they had no witnesses to yesterday's blaze. But the fire had a renewing effect on the synagogue's membership.
"After the first fire, the congregation expanded from 35 to over 200 dues-paying members," Mr. Nadel said. "The temple was dying. Now it has a growing congregation."
Indeed, Mr. Nadel said it was the synagogue's plight that prompted him to join the congregation. "I was driving by with my wife and saw the damage from the first fire," he said. "I painted and did a lot of restoration."
"Now we must simply go on."

HEADLINE: How to Succeed in the Odd Hours;
A Business Market Grows Among the Time-Deprived

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The fiercer pace of work in the 1990's, especially the longer hours for many, has been bemoaned as a grim dividend of the late-20th-century economy. It is Matthew Ryffel's bread and butter.
Mr. Ryffel, 30, an engineer who started his own one-man company this year, is an on-call computer repairman, available 24 hours a day to serve time-stressed work-at-home telecommuters, after-hours executives and anyone else who has transcended the boundaries of 9-to-5. He has fixed authors' hard-drives in the middle of the night, and reprieved lawyers caught on Saturday with their word processors down. 
 "Nobody works stranger hours than me," Mr. Ryffel, of Wyckoff, N.J., said. "I sleep with a beeper under my pillow."
His company is one of a new crop of businesses in the New York area founded to serve a growing market: the time deprived. Although round-the-clock food service and entertainment are nothing new in the region, newer companies specialize in providing the utterly mundane at times and places of convenience.
From corporate office parks where workers can get their shoes repaired or their car's oil changed or buy a new suit or a set of pots and pans without leaving work, to vendors at railroad stations who sell hot gourmet meals, to doctors who will see patients before sunrise and chiropractors who make office calls, the margins of ordinary commerce are stretching into some extraordinary territory.
"You have a bunch of entrepreneurs who see an opportunity," said William Dunkelberg, the chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business. He said he believes that the increasing number of two-income households is the driving force.
"Two people come home and they're tired, and that's it," he said. "That's what's creating all the opportunities for these new little niche firms."
There are no statistics about this market, because most of the providers are small. But economists and sociologists agree that society's changes are creating greater opportunities for any company with selling points of accessibility and speed.
The impetus, these experts say, is partly from a longer workday, but also from an odder workday, as more self-employed people and computer-connected people who work at home find their own rhythms. In addition, increases in car-pooling, encouraged by clean-air laws, have made it harder for people to run errands on their lunch hours or on the way home.
On the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, for example, the number of people arriving at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan between 6:30 A.M. and 7 A.M., before the traditional morning rush has even begun, increased 56 percent between 1989 and 1994 -- one of the railroad's fastest-growing travel times. Many commuters are also going home later. Eastbound departures on the Long Island Rail Road between 7 and 8 P.M., after the formal end of the evening rush, rose 38 percent between 1992 and 1994.
"The concept that you can't get something done at any given time of the day just doesn't exist anymore," said John Saunders, the publisher of "The New York City Business Source Book," an annual guide. "In the last five years, it seems you can get anything."
Mel Barlin's niche is the after-hours crisis.
"There's an animal in your cellar, your computer crashes, your TV or your fax machine isn't working -- any emergency of any kind, any time, that's our motto," said Mr. Barlin, who runs 1-800-All-Night, a telephone referral service in Rockland County that opened in January and serves New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The company now has 700 businesses on its list, all but a few of which are available on the fly, including Mr. Ryffel's computer repair.
But wooing and winning the exhausted consumer means being more flexible in how and where services are offered as well as when. In Maplewood, N.J., for example, the town is developing plans for a train station concierge who, for fees paid by merchants, will return a commuter's library books and video rentals, do shopping, fill a prescription at the drug store and have it all ready by the evening train.
In Parsippany, N.J., local merchants descend on the cafeteria at the Nabisco Inc. headquarters every Wednesday for vendor day -- a concept introduced last year to keep employees from running off to the mall at lunch. On a rotating schedule, businesses offering anything from picture framing to clothing, pots and pans to children's toys set up their folding shops. AT&T's company headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., has five vendors in the building every workday in rotating schedule.
"Businesses are trying to adhere to new life styles," said Brian Colburn, the president of All-in-One Cleaners, a Somerdale, N.J., company that branched out last year into corporate service, opening stores at two AT&T offices in New Jersey. "That's what's really important to succeeding in the future -- working with consumers rather than getting them to work with you."
Another factor that encourages companies to allow more commerce during the workday is that it does not cost the employer any money and looks like a new benefit.
"Give them anything but money -- that's the byword these days," said Tom Deschere, the owner of Hamilton Art, a vendor of prints, posters and frames who rides the corporate circuit, mostly in Connecticut and New Jersey.
Workers say that while there are still deep frustrations -- most government offices and banks, in particular, have yet to adapt -- the menu of options has unquestionably expanded.
Edward L. Hansen, an associate at William M. Mercer Inc., a human resources consulting firm in Manhattan, said that for years he often had the train to himself as he took the 6:09 A.M. from Hartsdale, N.Y. "Now, I'm surrounded by purposeful people running along, carrying two briefcases," he said.
Arriving at Grand Central, people too harried to enter a deli can get their rolls and coffees at one of the early morning food vendors, which Mr. Hansen likened to "drive throughs" for pedestrians.
Kathleen Luke, a lawyer for Pepsico in Purchase, N.Y., referring to the number of business services she can use on her busy schedule, said: "It's growing. It's not there yet, but it's growing."
Mrs. Luke, who said she was typically at her desk from 9 A.M. to 6:30 or 7 P.M., was interviewed just after 7 A.M. at Allergy and Asthma Associates of Norwalk, Conn., as she and her 6-year-old daughter, Lindsay, waited for Lindsay's appointment. "When the economy is not good, service people are more willing to do what you need them to do," she said.
Her husband, John A. Luke Jr., the president and chief executive officer of the Westvaco Corporation, a paper and packaging company, works even longer hours than his wife, typically leaving home in New Canaan, Conn., at 6 A.M. for Manhattan and getting home 14 hours later, at 8 P.M. Mr. Luke said the expansion of hours in businesses he needs is welcome. He also called it an inevitable result of capitalism.
"I see what's happening as a very logical, constructive response to changing demographics," he said. "Whether it's doctor's hours, the local oil company and you have to schedule a service, or lawn care, people are more responsive in the hours they will meet you."
At Allergy and Asthma Associates, which began offering 7 A.M. appointments four years ago, demand is such that early appointments are now available three mornings a week. Night hours until 8 are even busier.
"Our waiting room looks like corporate America at 7 A.M.," said Dr. Maryanne Scott, one of three physicians who run the office.
Older personal time-saving services have seen new markets develop.
"Home-based business people, downsized into their homes, need help getting started, then the mail comes in, and it piles up and they're inundated," said Linda Rothschild, owner of Cross It Off Your List, a five-year-old company that helps people get organized.
Yet, there are apparently limits to where odd-hours commerce can go.
Mr. Barlin, who runs the 24-hour referral service, said that for reasons he is still not sure of, most housepainters will not paint at night or submit to the whims of beepers.
Other services have tried and failed. Metro-North solicited a vendor in 1991 to sell dinners at suburban train stations but closed the effort as a failure after only a few months. Pepsico eliminated its corporate concierge office last year in a cost-cutting move.
Tom Yermack, the general manager at En Route, a gourmet store inside the Princeton Junction train station in New Jersey, said the limit of extracurricular commerce is that many people are too rushed or too tired or too obsessed to be bothered, even for things that will save them time.
"Once people get off that train, you can see it in their eyes," Mr. Yermack said. "They want to get to their cars and they want to get home, and that's it."

HEADLINE: Exodus Over Welfare Cuts? Researchers Say It Isn't So

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani predicted last week that many poor New Yorkers would move out of state as a "natural consequence" of the welfare cuts he is championing, there were cries of outrage from advocates for the poor. But perhaps more telling, demographers, economists and poverty experts who have researched the migratory patterns of welfare recipients say the Mayor is simply mistaken.
National studies by independent researchers have consistently found that differing levels of welfare benefits have little impact on a poor family's decision to pull up stakes and are seldom the primary motivation behind a move. Like other Americans, a single mother and her children are much more likely to be drawn to a new place by job opportunities, family ties, warm weather, better schools and safer streets than by a few extra dollars in their welfare check. 
 Rather, experts say, the Mayor may discover some unpleasant and expensive consequences of lower benefits and of a more complicated, arduous process of qualifying for Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main welfare program. While the changes may weed out some cheaters, they will also deprive some of the neediest, least competent families of benefits, they said.
"The cream of the crop can figure out a new system," said Gordon Berlin, a senior vice president of the nonprofit Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which evaluates welfare experiments. "But the people who are barely coping now probably won't negotiate the new barriers, and they're also the people more likely to slip into homelessness or whose poverty ends up causing them to neglect their children."
In recent weeks, the Mayor has said that the welfare system in the city has become much too "user-friendly," effectively inviting people to defraud the taxpayers or discouraging them from finding a job. He has said that the new policies he favors will encourage people to get off welfare and move to states where they can find work.
But experts say Mr. Giuliani overestimates the importance of welfare benefits in choices about where to live. If Mr. Giuliani were correct, they note, poor people would have flocked to New York, with its relatively high welfare benefits.
New York actually lost more poor people to other states from 1985 to 1990 than did any other state in the nation -- and many of them moved to the South, where welfare benefits are among the lowest in the nation, said William Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan's Population Studies Center.
"The bottom line is that the welfare magnet effect is almost nil," Mr. Frey said.
Even with Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed welfare cuts, the monthly combined food stamp and cash welfare benefits to a typical family of three in New York would fall by $26, to $551 a month -- enough to hurt, certainly, but not enough to prompt a move, experts say. More than 300,000 families in the city now receive A.F.D.C., a near record high.
Virginia Johnson, 35, a welfare recipient and mother of three who lives in Long Island City, Queens, said on Saturday that $26 was enough to keep her 2-year-old son, Kevin, in diapers for a couple of weeks. But she said a cut in benefits would not make her move. "Where would I go?" she said. "How can I afford the money to move anywhere? Where would the money come from?"
Nyoma Pitts, 33, another mother of three who lives in Long Island City, said she left New York City briefly, but she was looking for a job, not better welfare benefits. Now back, she said unemployment paid her more than welfare would. She added that she hoped to start a child-care business with a friend before those benefits expired.
"I don't know how they say you sit back and relax," she said of A.F.D.C. "They don't even give you enough money to sit back and relax."
Researchers echo the views of Ms. Johnson and Ms. Pitts. A fairly modest cut in benefits is rarely enough to motivate a family to hit the road, especially since the value of welfare benefits nationwide has been in a precipitous decline for more than two decades and many states -- including neighboring Connecticut -- are considering even more severe cutbacks than New York.
Both welfare recipients and researchers note that it is expensive for the poor to relocate, what with the cost of paying a mover, plus a security deposit and month's rent on a new apartment. And there are other deterrents.
Many families on welfare do not live solely on their benefits and can ill afford to lose off-the-books income by moving to a new place. Some get money on the side from friends or family members, while others find odd jobs, looking after other people's children or cleaning their homes.
"I don't think people come for higher welfare benefits unless the change in benefits in their home state is so drastic they couldn't live on them," said William Grinker, who advised Mr. Giuliani on welfare issues during his campaign and headed the city's Human Resources Administration during the mayoralty of Edward I. Koch. "Where are they going to go? Mississippi? Where is it so wonderful?"
In addition to supporting lower benefits, Mr. Giuliani last week presented a city budget that included a promise of stringent, though yet undefined, new eligibility requirements for families applying for A.F.D.C.
City budget officials said on Thursday that the new rules, based on regulations recently carried out in the Home Relief program, which provides welfare payments mainly to single, childless adults, would cause the percentage of A.F.D.C. applicants found eligible to plummet by 30 percent.
By Friday, the Mayor had begun backing away from his budget staff's position that the new A.F.D.C. rules would be based on those developed for Home Relief, and hedged on the 30 percent figure.
Westchester County is the model for the city's new policies. Like Westchester, the city began in January to conduct unannounced home visits on all Home Relief applicants to insure they live where they say they do. It also set up elaborate steps that applicants must follow -- including visits to several offices in Brooklyn and Manhattan and long waits in many lines -- that advocates said were aimed at knocking people off the rolls.
The percentage of Home Relief applicants in the city found ineligible rose to 57 percent in the first three months of this year, compared with 20 percent the previous year.
Westchester, too, found that a hard look at all Home Relief applicants more than doubled the percentage found ineligible. But when the county tested tough eligibility processes on A.F.D.C. applicants in its Yonkers office in 1993, the percentage found ineligible did not rise, said Mary E. Glass, the county's Social Services Commissioner.
"We found no measurable difference in Yonkers," she said. Her explanation for the difference in the results was that, unlike the single adults who receive Home Relief, the A.F.D.C. recipients, mostly mothers with children, are much less transient and have much more difficulty finding steady work.
Nonetheless, she said the city's welfare procedures may have become so lax that the city should test a wider-ranging eligibility process of A.F.D.C. applicants.
Miss Glass wryly recalled when the city's last Human Resources Administration Commissioner, Barbara J. Sabol, applied for welfare incognito, in wigs and sweat shirts, and then described the indignities and humiliations of the process.
Indeed, the attitude of the Giuliani administration toward welfare recipients is much less sympathetic than that of Mrs. Sabol and her patron, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Mr. Berlin, who was a social services official in the Koch years, said: "She was determined to make it a user-friendly system, and when you do that you do get more people on the rolls. Now, Giuliani is swinging in the opposite direction, trying to make it more difficult to get on."

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO ORDER A TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST TEHERAN

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
President Clinton said yesterday that he would cut off all United States trade and investment with Iran, including purchases by American companies that account for more than 20 percent of that country's oil exports, in a further effort to isolate it as an "inspiration and paymaster to terrorists".
"This is not a step I take lightly," 
 Mr. Clinton said last night at a dinner of the World Jewish Congress in New York. "But I am convinced that instituting a trade embargo with Iran is the most effective way our nation can help to curb that nation's drive to acquire devastating weapons and its continued support for terrorism."
The White House said Mr. Clinton would sign an executive order outlining the ban later this week, to take effect in 30 days. It would apply to all American companies and foreign branches deemed to be under their control but not to separate foreign subsidiaries. Moreover, it would eliminate virtually all remaining United States exports to Iran, which totaled $326 million last year -- mostly in farm, industrial and oilfield equipment -- while affecting at least "a few thousand" jobs, White House said.
But the biggest practical effect would be to end American companies' purchases of Iranian oil for resale on the world market. Already, American oil companies are barred from importing Iranian oil, but they and their foreign subsidiaries are the biggest single buyers of it, and last year bought crude oil worth about $4 billion on the open market. While that amounts to a quarter of Iran's oil exports, it is equivalent to only about 2 percent of the world's total oil exports.
The Administration has tried without success to persuade its European and Japanese allies to join in a ban, and White House officials said the President would still urge other nations not to buy the oil. But oil industry experts have said a United States ban is likely to cause only short-term and small-scale disruptions in the world market.
"American companies will find other sources of oil to meet their contracts and Iran will have no trouble finding other buyers," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. But he added that the ban would put the American companies at a slight competetive disadvantage against foreign rivals, since they will now be prohibited from buying both Iranian and Libyan crude.
Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy advisers have been urging for weeks that he adopt the embargo, over the objections of trade and economic aides. The President portrayed it yesterday as a necessary weapon in the fight against terrorism, an issue given new immediacy after the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. But the announcement was also suffused with domestic politics.
Anti-Iranian sentiment has been building in Congress, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, has proposed legislation that would not only ban trade between the United States and Iran but would also impose a secondary boycott on American trade with foreign companies that continue to do business with Iran.
By acting on its own, the White House hoped to seize the initiative, and officials said yesterday that they wanted to consult with Mr. D'Amato and Representative Peter J. King of Long Island, the measure's sponsor in the House, in hopes of persuading them that it was no longer needed. The Administration decided against extending the embargo to foreign companies that continue to trade with Iran on the ground that it would alienate allies and do more harm than good, one senior official said.
Mr. Clinton's move was also heavy with political symbolism and appeal because he made the announcement at a dinner of the World Jewish Congress honoring Edgar M. Bronfman, the patriarch of the Seagram's distilling family and a leading critic of Iran as a threat to the drive for Middle East peace, with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, sitting across the table.
As major shareholders and board members of Du Pont, the parent company of Conoco, the Bronfman family used its influence last month to press Conoco to abandon a deal under which it would have developed two large offshore oilfields for Iran. Conoco dropped the plan after the White House announced that Mr. Clinton would issue a directive blocking all such transactions on grounds of national security.
In his remarks last night, the President said the Conoco case and the new embargo showed that there are times when support for free trade and open markets must take second place to concerns about international threats.
"Many people have argued passionately that the best route to changing Iranian behavior is by engaging the country," Mr. Clinton told the dinner audience at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. "Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support that argument. Indeed, the evidence of the last two years suggests exactly the reverse.
"Iran's appetite for acquiring and developing nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them has only grown larger. Even as prospects for the peace in the Middle East have grown, Iran has broadened its role as an inspiration and paymaster to terrorists. There is nothing to suggest that further engagement will alter that course."
Before attending the dinner, Mr. Clinton shared a platform with Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Peres, at a ceremony commemorating the Holocaust and the 52d annivesary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising at the Paramount at Madison Square Garden. Mr. Clinton's new announcement brings the United States policy on Iran more into line with Israel's.
In his remarks there, Mr. Peres did not mention Iran. But he recalled the evils of Nazism and Communism to warn against the current threat of Islamic fundamentalism, which, he said, "like Communism adopted the Machiavellian slogan that ends justify means, which is a license to lie, to subvert, to kill."
The United States already limits not only most imports from Iran but also the export of sensitive goods that could be used in military technology. The White House said Mr. Clinton's decision was the culmination of a interagency review of policy toward Iran that began last November. Secretary of State Warren Christopher concluded more than a month ago that existing efforts to isolate Iran were not working, and urged an embargo.
But Mr. Christopher's recommendation met with fierce opposition from senior officials at the Defense, Commerce, Treasury and Energy Departments, who argued that curbing American trade would have little effect on Iran and could hurt American companies instead.
White House aides said Mr. Clinton made the decision to impose the additional sanctions on Friday. Once the order takes effect, officials said, the Government will make some exceptions to allow companies to keep operating while they shut down dealings with Iran. A White House aide said American corporate operations in Iran had dwindled to almost nothing in the 15 years since Washington severed ties with Teheran during the hostage crisis.

HEADLINE: Unity Is Missing as Vietnam Remembers War's End

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30

 BODY:
The Vietnamese Government celebrated the 20th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War today with bursts of fireworks and a grand parade through the streets of the city once known as Saigon, but without the spirit of unity that the Communist leadership has struggled to portray.
That Vietnam still has far to go in reuniting north and south was obvious in the barricades set up throughout the city, preventing all but Communist Party members and invited guests from watching a parade that brought together the aging soldiers who defeated a superpower. 
 There was heavy security along the parade route, apparently out of fear that opponents of the Government might use the anniversary as an opportunity for a protest in front of television cameras from around the world. There was no protest.
"I feel very happy about this anniversary and the reunification of our country, but I feel bad because I cannot get to the parade," said Nguyen Hung, 42, an English teacher, who stood across the street from the former United States Embassy here, straining to catch even a glimpse of the parade, a camera around his neck.
"The camera is useless today," he said with a smile of resignation.
Still, if the Vietnamese of the north and south have not yet made peace with each other, the country's leaders made clear today that they were interested in peace with their former enemy, the United States.
Their speeches to mark the anniversary were remarkably free of the venomous rancor about the United States that marked earlier anniversaries of the capture of Saigon -- renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the Communist victory -- and the end of a war that took more than three million lives, including those of 58,000 Americans.
Speaking from a grandstand within sight of the former Presidential Palace, where the Saigon Government surrendered on April 30, 1975, Mayor Truong Tan Sang spoke of the anniversary as "a resplendent milestone" for Vietnam but did not even once mention the United States, the archenemy of the Communist forces in fighting that lasted a decade.
On Saturday in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet recalled raids by American B-52 bombers, the massacre at My Lai and other "genocidal crimes" committed by the Americans during the war.
But at the same time, he urged the Vietnamese to "shut the door to the past and look to the future to raise our national spirit, expand international relations and work together with other countries for peace, cooperation and development."
Vietnam is eager for full diplomatic and trade relations with the United States, which last year lifted a 19-year-old trade embargo that had crippled the Vietnamese economy.
In January the United States opened a diplomatic liaison office in Hanoi but said it would not agree to full diplomatic relations until there was additional progress in determining the fate of more than 2,000 troops still listed as missing in action from the war.
Mr. Kiet was in Ho Chi Minh City today and watched the parade from the grandstand, seated alongside the legendary general of the Communist army, Vo Nguyen Giap, the "Red Napoleon" who defeated the French Army at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and was among the architects of the war against the United States and the American-backed Government of South Vietnam.
Before the parade, General Giap joined in laying wreaths before a statue of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revolutionary leader. The general was dressed in a gray uniform adorned only with the Hero of the People's Army of Vietnam medal, the nation's highest military award.
"The Vietnamese people have put this war behind them," said Michael Liscio, 52, a Navy veteran from Sherman Oaks, Calif., who was with the first American combat forces to land in Vietnam in 1965 and who today was invited to watch the anniversary parade as a guest of the Vietnamese Government.
Mr. Liscio, who last week completed a 1,300-mile, two-month run from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, said that after meeting with Vietnamese from all parts of the country, "I think there is still a difference between the people in the north and the people in the south, just as there was a difference in the United States a hundred years ago after the Civil War."
"But now these people want peace," he added. "Basically these people are not warriors -- they are warm, friendly people who want to move on."

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: DAMAGES;
For the Dispossessed, Aid With No Red Tape

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, April 30

 BODY:
Jesse Carretero was putting the finishing touches on a cabinet in his downtown store on April 19 when the explosion at the Federal Building a block away blew off the garage door. The blast also knocked Mr. Carretero off his feet and into the ranks of the thousands who suddenly found themselves without homes or businesses.
Mr. Carretero, who said the bombing destroyed his fledgling cabinet business, was among the first group of applicants to walk in the door of a temporary emergency relief center set up on Saturday by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
 Within hours, he had made the rounds, receiving $900 in vouchers from the Red Cross and a $30 medication allowance from the Oklahoma County Disaster Relief Team. He left with a stack of application forms for loans from the Small Business Administration and unemployment benefits from the state.
"Before today, I thought I was finished," Mr. Carretero said. "I had nothing to go on with."
About 500 people visited the center, in the Sheppard Mall on the edge of the city, on Saturday, and a similar crowd was there today. The center will operate as long as applications for help are coming in.
Buddy Young, regional director of FEMA, estimated that more than 300 buildings near the explosion site were affected. The damage, he said, could exceed $500 million.
Mr. Carretero said that he was not injured but that the explosion was devastating nonetheless. The ceiling of his store caved in. The windows were shattered. The half-finished cabinets were smashed to bits and buried beneath the rubble along with $12,000 worth of equipment. He said he also lost two contracts, totaling $6,000, because he could not meet their deadlines. Within half an hour of the explosion, inspectors condemned his building and shut off the electricity.
Without insurance or the income from the contracts, which he would have received last Wednesday, Mr. Carretero, 44, fell behind on his $250 rent and was evicted from his apartment today, he said. He also said he had been unable to pay $400 in child support for his two boys, Daniel, 8, and Ryan, 6, or buy medicine he needs for a heart condition.
He contemplated suicide, he said, but the thought of his two boys kept him from going through with it.
During the last two days, the people who came to the emergency relief center for help ranged from those like Mr. Carretero who had lost entire businesses to those who had no idea what the damage was yet.
Bobby G. Rumfelt, an employee with the state of Oklahoma, was hesitating when filling out a damage-assessment form at the Small Business Administration table. He told Vic Moerbe, a loan officer from the agency, that he had no idea what had been damaged in his apartment in the Regency Towers, one block east of the Federal building, because he had only been allowed back in for five minutes to collect a few belongings.
"Don't worry about it," Mr. Moerbe said. "Just list whatever you have in the apartment. We just want to get your application in early so we can take care of you as fast as we can. Our inspectors will go up on Monday morning to verify your claims."
At the center, employees from Government and private relief agencies worked to help applicants fill out forms for business and personal loans and cash vouchers, patiently explaining what programs were available and from time to time giving counseling to those who broke down when recalling what they had lost.
In one room, volunteers from the Red Cross filled out forms for those needing emergency shelter and expenses for food, transportation and medication. In another, employees from the Small Business Administration, the Oklahoma County Disaster Relief Team, FEMA's emergency housing program and the Internal Revenue Service sat ready to help. Those who lost properties can apply for a credit through the I.R.S. against last year's taxes.
For the most part, those who came in were grateful for the swift and courteous help they received.
"I can't believe how quickly the Government is taking care of our needs," said Jane Vowell, whose 1975 Buick was destroyed in the blast.
But some were frustrated with the pace.
Sitting in the Red Cross office, Esmaiel Eijadey and his wife, Sedegheh, sighed and shook their heads impatiently during their 20-minute wait. Mr. Eijadey said that although he had made all the obligatory stops and filled out the forms, help just was not coming soon enough.
"You just sit here and wait and wait and wait," said Mr. Eijadey, whose Italian restaurant half a block from the blast site was demolished. "They tell me I am going to get the money in a week or two. But I need the money now, lots of it."
Mr. Eijadey said he owed $25,000 for supplies and was pressed to pay it as soon as possible.
"The Red Cross will help you find housing and buy you food," he said. "But I don't need that. I need cars to get around and money to pay my bills. I'm not going to get it tomorrow."
Rita Kepner, a spokeswoman for FEMA, said her agency had already sent out nearly $200,000 in checks for emergency housing, averaging $1,500 per application. The Small Business Administration also was processing loan applications on the site, offering loans for businesses of up to $1.5 million, for personal property loss of up to $40,000, and for housing damage of up to $100,000.
"We are doing the best we can," Ms. Kepner said. "People have to understand that it still takes time. This is the weekend. We have to wait for the banks to open to check their credit history.
"It will take a long time for the businesses and people who lost their homes to rebuild their lives," Ms. Kepner said. "But this is a start."

HEADLINE: Pentagon Seeks to End Preference Program

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The Pentagon's affirmative action program in long-distance telephone services seemed such a triumph -- it had raised the portion of contracts with small, minority-owned businesses to 57 percent from just 3 percent within two years -- that Congress last year adopted the basic concept Government-wide.
The program was particularly admired for the way it avoided the political weaknesses of affirmative action programs for minority-owned businesses in which a certain amount of work is "set aside" for them. Instead, market forces were given a small nudge, as minority companies were given a 10 percent pricing advantage on their bids. 
 But now the Pentagon is considering shutting the program down in the face of protests by white-owned small businesses and after a report by the Defense Department's Inspector General found that none of the chosen companies were able to meet requirements set by Congress that were meant to prevent fraud.
Neither the apparent initial success nor later criticisms are that clear-cut, however, in the views of the Pentagon, the minority businesses that got the contracts or the white-owned companies that had vociferously fought to end the program.
In some ways, the fight over a small, obscure preference program mirrors the larger debate around affirmative action that is swirling in Congress and elsewhere. At a time when special efforts to aid women and members of minorities are under increasing attack, the program indicates that when the overarching goal of affirmative action meets the complex brew of conflicting Congressional mandates, arcane bureaucratic regulations and contemporary economic trends, the results are often unsatisfactory for everyone.
"I think this was pushed without a lot of thought about the implications," said David R. Smith, a lawyer in Fairfax, Va., who represents minority-owned telecommunications companies.
The short history of the program also belies two other often-voiced notions about preference programs: that without their continuation minorities would falter and that minority preferences have caused whites to suffer economically. In this case, neither notion appears to be true.
The Pentagon's proposal to eliminate the mandatory preference program in long-distance service is not final. Officials say it will be published in the next several weeks in the Federal Register. After that, the public will have 60 days to comment on it. It is sure to provoke criticism from minority-owned companies that argue that without some kind of preferential treatment, they will be shut out of a burgeoning market.
"There are not that many in this industry because of the costs of getting started," Mr. Smith said. "So if you don't have some kind of program, you're going to have zero."
The program in question involves contracts to supply dedicated telephone lines used mainly to transmit data between military bases. With the deregulation of the telecommunications industry the field has increasingly attracted small "resellers," companies that lease lines from communications giants like AT&T and MCI and then sell services to customers like the Defense Department.
According to the Inspector General's report, at least 278 contracts valued at $30.3 million were awarded to resellers between 1992 and the end of 1993.
Under the program, minority-owned companies have been given a pricing preference -- meaning that bids by their white-owned competitors are automatically increased by 10 percent.
Pricing preferences have two advantages over "set aside" programs, Administration officials said. One is that in theory there is less opportunity to create sham companies that do nothing but hand off guaranteed business, since a company would have to have the ability to make a bid that was close to competitive. The other advantage is that the discounts are less politically vulnerable than set asides, which are much more open to attack as quotas.
But while the 10 percent margin might seem relatively small, in the communications reselling market a difference of even 2 or 3 percent can be insurmountable.
"It's a very competitive industry," said Allen Smith, director of business development and product marketing for Communications Transmission Inc., a white-owned reseller with headquarters in Austin, Tex. "Fifty cents makes a difference."
"We're losing business left and right," said Craig Brooks, president of Electra, a small, white-owned telecommunications reseller based in Bethesda, Md. "We're going under. What about us? We're a small business, too."
Complicating the program, however, were rules imposed by Congress -- rules that both sides in the debate agree no small business in this field, whether owned by whites or minority members, can meet.
In order to insure that minority-owned companies are not merely acting as fronts for larger, white-owned businesses, Congress requires that for a minority-owned company to qualify for a program, the company must perform at least 50 percent of the actual work as measured by cost. In the case of telecommunications, the rule has been interpreted as meaning these companies have to have borne 50 percent of the cost of installing and maintaining the telephone lines.
In reality, most resellers do little more than act as a middleman. The telephone companies installed the lines, own them, do the billing and maintain them as part of the lease arrangement with resellers.
Spokesmen for minority-owned telecommunications businesses say the interpretation of the 50 percent rule is unfair.
"To require a small disadvantaged business to perform 50 percent of the work, when you include the cost of developing the infrastructure, is ridiculous," said David Smith. "They can't do that and still qualify for being a small business. So it's an unrealistic requirement from the get-go."
Realizing this, Government agencies -- in this case the Pentagon -- have been reluctant to enforce the 50 percent labor rule. Doing so would make it difficult to meet another Congressional mandate: that 5 percent of Defense Department procurement contracts be awarded to small minority-owned companies.
In an interview, Eleanor Spector, director of procurement for the Defense Department, said the Pentagon would not follow an Inspector General's recommendation that the Defense Department drop all such pricing preference programs -- unless it can be verified that they will be able to perform at least half of the required work. "The I.G. recommends that we eliminate it everywhere," Ms. Spector said. "His position is that we would save money and streamline the process. But if we do so we could not make our 5 percent small disadvantaged business goal."
In the end the Pentagon program, and its possible elimination, have left a bitter taste in the mouths both of officials of white companies that have been protesting the preference, and of officials affiliated with firms that have received it. Both sides say they favor policies to spur the development of minority companies. But both express disappointment over the way this particular program was handled.
"It was a great idea," David Smith said. But he said the Pentagon decided to "push it not thinking that somebody might have a problem with it."
"And that somebody happens to be other small business who have the same problems with raising capital and developing a market, but don't get the preference."
"Had more thought been put into the program before it got going," Mr. Smith said, "they could have minimized a lot of these problems."

HEADLINE: Respect for Justice System Slides, Poll Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The murder trial of O. J. Simpson has weakened Americans' respect for the criminal justice system, according to an opinion poll released today by the American Bar Association.
In a survey of 1,011 people conducted April 10-14, 45 percent said the continuing trial had caused them to lose respect for the justice system. In a poll the association took in July, when the Simpson case was still in its pretrial stages, 28 percent of the 1,011 respondents gave that reply. 
 Both polls were conducted for the A.B.A. Journal by the Gallup Organization. In each, the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
"We take these concerns seriously," Robert Cooper Ramo, the president-elect of the association, said of the latest poll's findings. "It is critical to our democracy that the American people have faith in the integrity of the justice system."
The percentage of those who said the Simpson case had caused them to lose respect for prosecutors remained about the same from one poll to the next -- 21 percent in July and 24 percent in April. But the surveys showed the defense did not fare as well: in July, 26 percent said they had lost respect for defense lawyers, but in the latest survey the figure was 41 percent.
In both polls, 56 percent of those asked said they had lost respect for the news media.

HEADLINE: An Eclipse for the Group of Seven

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Financial fire fighting and economic coordination are supposed to be specialties of the Group of Seven, as the consortium of the world's biggest industrial nations calls itself. But on both counts the recent record of these nations -- the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- is looking less than impressive.
Indeed, some economists believe that its impact is in the process of being eclipsed by a lesser-known body of industrialized and developing nations which scored an economic success last week as the Group of Seven produced another disappointment. 
 At their annual spring session in Washington last week, finance ministers of the Group of Seven's member nations fell out over the Clinton Administration's indifference toward a weak dollar, with many complaining that turbulent currency markets are endangering world recovery.
Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor of Germany, had set the tone before the talks even started by saying American policy was "not acceptable." Lawrence H. Summers, an Under Secretary of the Treasury, hit back in an interview published with the Handlesblatt newspaper just after the talks by accusing the Germans of "always saying no." Lamberto Dini, Italy's Prime Minister and Finance Minister, termed the meeting "tense."
So much for Group of Seven effectiveness. But it has been that way for a while, with the 20-year-old organization looking increasingly ineffective because it no longer reflects the financial realities of a world where the successful emerging economies of Asia and Latin America are growing almost twice as fast as those of the older industrialized nations.
When the Group of Seven tried to cope with Mexico's peso crisis earlier this year, its members immediately quarreled over the rescue package designed by the United States, with the Europeans accusing Washington of railroading them into a bailout for American investors.
At their previous meeting in Madrid in October, the group managed to provoke the most bitter North-South clash in a decade by vetoing a plan for developing nations to create more monetary reserves only to find that the third world refused to take no for an answer. Deadlock continues.
"This G-7 is not the class of '85," Lisa S. Kaes of the New York investment advisory firm of Geoffrey Bell & Company said, referring to the group's successful 1985 exchange rate accord that capped the soaring dollar during the Reagan Administration.
And it is definitely not the class of '87 -- the year the group successfully put a floor under a tumbling dollar.
Yet if last week's meeting disappointed, the gathering that immediately followed of the Interim Committee, the oddly named body which oversees the International Monetary Fund, was much more successful.
This 24-nation committee, where Group of Seven finance ministers sit with colleagues from all other regions of the world, quickly reached preliminary agreement on a plan to prevent more Mexican-style crises through stricter economic monitoring and a new safety net by the International Monetary Fund.
"The G-7 is a relic of a world divided into a rich North and a poor South that is disappearing," argued Robert Solomon, a former chief international economist at the Federal Reserve now with the Brookings Institution in Washington. "The Interim Committee better represents today's world."
Efforts to bring the Group of Seven into line with that reality are under way. Last year the Commission on Global Governance, led by Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden and Shridath Ramphal, former secretary general of the Commonwealth, proposed an Economic Security Council for the United Nations.
But the United States would never allow such a body real authority without a veto, and the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America are unlikely to accept that.
Another plan has come from Peter Sutherland, the former director of the new World Trade Organization. He favors expanding the group to include Russia, China and the fast-growing emerging economies with reduced representation for European Union nations to keep numbers manageable.
Meanwhile, as the economic gap between the group's member nations and the rest of the world narrows, its self-appointed position as guardian of the international economic system causes growing resentment and becomes harder to justify.
According to World Bank projections, by 2020 the world's seven biggest economies will be China, the United States, Japan, India, Indonesia, Germany and Korea in that order, followed by France, Taiwan, Brazil, Italy, Russia, Britain and Mexico. Today's Group of Seven is a sunset institution enjoying the late afternoon.

Moderate Outlook For Media Prices

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
In another sign that inflation is fading as a concern for advertisers, an annual survey indicated that media prices this year are expected to rise by 5 percent or less. 
 The poll, released on Friday by DeWitt Media Inc., a media services company in New York, said that 56 percent of the advertisers surveyed estimated that media prices they have paid or expect to pay this year have increased by 5 percent or less, while 18 percent anticipated the increase to hold at the 5 percent level and 22 percent pegged the rise between 3 percent and 4 percent.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Atlanta Sounds Gun For Tickets

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
While the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta are still 15 months away, fierce competition has already begun in the unofficial Olympic sports of ticket roulette, hotel price gouging and the long-distance commuter relay.
Getting tickets to at least 1 of the 542 sessions in 26 Olympic sports will be a piece of cake. Tickets go on sale today, and 11 million are available, more than the combined totals of the 1984 Los Angeles Games and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 
 And now for the fine print.
Getting tickets to preferred events, such as opening and closing ceremonies, swimming, men's basketball and women's gymnastics, will be a challenge. An even bigger challenge will be finding a hotel room in downtown Atlanta.
Olympic and consumer affairs officials are committed to keeping price gouging to a minimum. But spectators who do find a hotel or apartment or home outside the Olympic housing network will have to navigate an obstacle course of profiteers, some seeking $350 a night for a hotel room that normally goes for $79, $10,000 a month for a one-bedroom condominium and $150,000 for two weeks in a rented house.
At these Centennial Games, a road atlas may be as valuable as a ticket. Many spectators will have to commute from outlying cities, even outlying states. To alleviate the housing crunch, there are also plans to fly spectators in for the day from Chicago and New York.
Officially, the Atlanta Olympics open on July 19, 1996, and close 16 days later on Aug. 4. But the scramble for tickets begins with a mail-order phase today, when 35 million ticket brochures will be available at Coca-Cola displays at 15,000 grocery stores nationwide. Ticket brochures are also available at 335 Home Depot stores.
Ticket prices for sporting events range from $6 to $250, with tickets to the opening and closing ceremonies costing $200, $400 and $600. All tickets include transportation on local bus and rail systems. The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games is relying on ticket sales to provide $261 million of its $1.6 billion budget. To match that forecast, organizers will have to sell roughly 6.3 million of the 11 million tickets.
But what may seem like an ocean of tickets for the average fan is actually something like an Olympic-sized pool. Four million of the 11 million tickets have already been set aside for purchase by corporate sponsors, holders of broadcast rights and Olympic committees from 200 nations.
The sport with the most seats available is soccer, which will have 2.4 million tickets to sell. But there's one catch: Preliminary matches will be played in Birmingham, Ala., Orlando, Fla., Washington and Miami, but not in Atlanta. Only the semifinals and finals of the men's and women's competition will be held in Georgia -- at Sanford Stadium in Athens, 60 miles northeast of Atlanta. Another 2.4 million tickets are available for sports not traditionally popular with Americans in the Olympics -- baseball, field hockey and equestrian events.
But Atlanta officials say it is not true that most seats to the highly prized events have been grabbed by corporate sponsors. Scott Anderson, who oversees the Olympic ticket operation, said more seats have been reserved for the general public than for corporate sponsors at each session for each sport. Tickets are available for every session, he said, from the opening ceremonies to the men's basketball final.
"We have more seats available to the general public than Los Angeles had total seats available," Anderson said, referring to the 1984 Summer Games, which had 6.9 million tickets for sale.
Several people familiar with ticketing plans said that of the approximately 60,000 seats available for the opening ceremonies at Olympic Stadium, about 20,000 would be reserved for the general public. Officials also said that given the 30,000-plus seating capacity for men's basketball and women's gymnastics in the Georgia Dome, the public will have a greater opportunity to see these sports than at previous Olympics.
"There is a good possibility of getting a high-profile ticket," said Harvey Schiller, president of Turner Sports in Atlanta and formerly the executive director of the United States Olympic Committee. "If you want to go to the opening and closing ceremonies, gymnastics and swimming, I don't think you'll get all that. At the same time, if you want to see handball and also gymnastics, I think you have a chance."
He added: "It's like the Final Four. It's tough to get tickets, but after two teams lose, there are plenty available."
Atlanta officials are encouraging fans to make a wide variety of requests for tickets. They emphasize such sports as women's softball and women's soccer, at which the United States is expected to win gold medals.
For those determined to see the glamour events, $50,000 will buy a patron package that includes a pair of tickets to the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as 30 other highly coveted sessions.
Tickets will be easier to come by in Atlanta than hotel rooms. As of February, 80 percent of the 55,000 hotel rooms in the Atlanta metropolitan area had been reserved for international Olympic officials, sponsors and members of the news media.
Thousands of eventual ticket-holders are faced with the prospect of daily commutes from satellite cities such as Birmingham, Ala., (161 miles) and Chattanooga, Tenn. (120 miles).
Atlanta organizers predict that half of the expected two million visitors during the Games will be residents of the Southeast. And many of them will be able to commute from their homes. As many as a third of the expected visitors are expected to stay with friends and relatives in Atlanta. Atlanta organizers are creating an Olympic housing network for the distant traveler. Ten thousand private homes and 3,000 apartments and condominiums are now in the network, with prices ranging from $150 to $425 a bedroom a night.
As evidence of price gouging by tour operators has surfaced, Atlanta officials have reminded hoteliers of a 1994 Georgia law that allows hotels to charge no more than their 1994 rate plus 5.7 percent for inflation during the Games. Spectators cannot be forced to reserve rooms before and after the Olympics, and the price of the room must be separated from other services in any tour package, according to the law. The fine for excessive rates is $1,000 a room, officials said.
"Despite anything you may have heard or read to the contrary, this Olympic effort in Atlanta is not about how much money can be made," Billy Payne, the chief Olympic organizer, said in a speech last week.

Chart: 'The 27th Olympic Sport: A Race to Buy Tickets' Tickets for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta go on sale today. There are 11 million tickets available, more than the combined totals of the 1984 Los Angeles Games and 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
 
How to order olympic tickets by mail.
* Grab a 44-page ticket brochure from a grocery store or from a Home Depot store.
* Choose up to 16 of 542 available sports sessions. Pick two alternate choices for each session.
* Don't expect tickets to all highly coveted events such as the finals of men's basketball, swimming and women's gymnastics. Make a smorgasbord of choices, say an early round of basketball, a session of track and field and women's softball.
* Apply for some tickets in the higher price categories. If a price category is sold out, lower-priced tickets will be automatically considered.
* Apply by June 30. Your order will be included in a lottery for sessions in which there are more requests than tickets. For an additional six months, mail-order tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.
* Order tickets by check or with a Visa credit card. Include a $16 service fee with each order. Ticket orders requested by June 30 will be filled in September. Tickets will be mailed next spring.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dole's Assault on Regulations

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, made points last week with government-bashers by pushing a bill through committee that would create regulatory gridlock. Under the guise of making regulators conscious of costs, the bill would gut the ability of Federal agencies to promulgate new health, safety or environmental rules, good or bad. Any hope that the Senate would act as a restraint on House efforts to destroy the regulatory apparatus are diminishing as Mr. Dole presses his Presidential campaign.
Had Mr. Dole sought to bring common sense to Federal rule making, he would instead have started with a bill sponsored by William Roth, Republican of Delaware, which would require regulators to pay attention to costs without scuttling their ability to protect the public. The best hope now is that the Democrats will filibuster the Dole bill or the White House will veto it. 
 True, Mr. Dole can point to some needlessly costly regulations. Owners of toxic waste dumps are required to scrub their sites to the same level of cleanliness whether or not people would ever visit the area. And Federal rules pay more attention to outdoor air pollution than to indoor pollution, which can pose graver, more easily remediable, risks. Studies show that rules on formaldehyde exposure cost industry $80 million for each life saved, yet far more lives could be saved at a fraction of the cost by tightening drinking-water standards.
These examples do not prove, as Republicans claim, that the country spends too much in total on health, safety and environmental regulations. But Government does spend money in the wrong places. Smarter rules could save more lives at less cost.
The reform proposed by Mr. Dole would require regulators to perform elaborately detailed studies to show that proposed rules would likely generate more benefits -- such as lives saved or wetlands preserved -- than costs. Cost-benefit tests, where possible, would push regulators toward rules that do more good than harm. But these tests are difficult to complete. What is the value of clean air over the Grand Canyon? The Dole bill cynically builds in more than 60 steps that the cost-benefit analysis must surmount.
The show-stopper comes in the fact that every one of those needlessly detailed steps is subject to judicial review upon challenge by the regulated industry. Industry could also challenge existing regulations according to the same 60 or more steps -- an indiscriminate assault on environmental and safety rules.
Mr. Roth's bill also missteps by, for example, eliminating rules that agencies fail to review according to deadline. Yet the bill's overall direction is balanced. It would require that regulators identify and, where possible, measure the likely benefits and costs of regulation. That way the public would have an accounting of what will be gained, and at whose expense, if the rule goes forward.
Mr. Roth would rely on peer review to double check that cost-benefit analysis. There is no need for judicial oversight of regulatory minutiae. The Senate has already passed an even better backstop: a 45-day grace period during which Congress could block new regulations that it feared would be excessively costly or ineffective.
Yes, some regulations squander money that could be put to better use improving health and safety somewhere else in the economy. But there is no regulatory crisis. Congress has time to make constructive changes. Mr. Roth points in the right direction. Mr. Dole does not.

My Russian Friends

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"We never considered not going," says a high Clinton aide about the trip to Moscow to celebrate the golden anniversary of the end of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.
Because Boris Yeltsin knew how eager Bill Clinton was to come (Reagan and Bush got D-Day, so Clinton gets V-E Day), we could extract no concessions beforehand. As a result, Russia's deal to help terrorist Iran become a nuclear power will go forward, and the Russian military's war on Chechnya will resume with greater fury the day after world leaders leave Moscow. 
 To provide Clinton with a little cover for his inability to influence dangerous Russian policies, Yeltsin is expected to profess to look a little less unkindly on the inexorable enlargement of NATO -- as if a Russian veto existed. Clintonite spinmeisters will hail this "sop to Cerberus" as a summit triumph.
How can next week's trip be saved from being seen by Russians as American acquiescence in Yeltsin's Chechnyan brutality and Iranian folly?
Much rides on the speech to the Russian people, a television opportunity traditionally given to visiting U.S Presidents.
Grigory Yavlinsky is the reformer whose popularity grows as Yeltsin's diminishes; he is among those who should have one-on-one sessions with the visiting President. His advice: "Clinton should demonstrate with specifics that the American people understand the real problems of the Russian people today."
That means Clinton should rise above the usual we-can-be-allies-again rhetoric. And he should not offer money he cannot deliver. Here are a few specifics, drawn from varied sources, for speechwriter Bob Boorstin as he drafts a document that might salvage the summit.
1. Topic A is organized crime, sweeping Russia as never before. The U.S. was in its grip a few generations back; we know what a Mafia is, and what it takes for national and local police working with courageous merchants and workers to break it up.
2. Handmaiden to crime is government corruption. We've been through waves of that, too, and now make certain that no official is above the law. Clinton might even point out that an independent prosecutor was in the White House two weeks ago, and the President of the U.S. had to answer his questions. Such is the strength of democracy.
3. Keeping elections honest is central to preserving freedom. The government in power must never meddle in the election process -- that's what cost Nixon the Presidency. Russia's elections must not only be on schedule but openly financed, with its press continuing free, with opposing candidates having equal access to television, and with competing observers at polling places.
4. Russians are worried about economic security. We went through a depression with 25 percent unemployed. Government helped free enterprise get re-started, which generated the jobs and taxes to build our safety net. Russia is on the right track, with half its production now private, but should be careful not to let a need for jobs endanger its children -- as selling nuclear plants to unstable neighbors would do.
5. Russians rightly want to hold their Federation together as a great nation. Americans made mistakes that led to a terrible civil war, and a century later are certain there is a better way to bind a nation than by using brute force. Make the summit truce permanent in Chechnya, and let our regional alliance negotiate a peace respecting ethnic differences and local autonomy.
In the context of Russia being a great power -- of unmatched size and natural resources, with an educated people and linked up with us in space -- Clinton should deal frankly with the coming reality of an enlarged NATO. Invite Russians into cooperation with NATO that will minimize the chances of the sort of war memorialized on V-E Day + 50 years.
Clinton's speech should be aimed past politicians and diplomats, persuading ordinary Russians by the force of our example that their post-Communist world need not be circumscribed by mafiyas, maladministration and misery. Democracies plow through all that to prosperity in freedom.
A peroration is called for drawn from World War II, evoking the memory of the crusade against a common enemy, in which more than 20 million Russians died. After the substance, sentiment is suitable. Pull out all the stops.

Clinton Imposing a Ban On All U.S. Trade With Iran
 President Clinton said last night that he would cut off all United States trade and investment with Iran, including purchases by American companies that account for more than 20 percent of that country's oil exports, in a further effort to isolate it as an "inspiration and paymaster to terrorists." 
 Mr. Clinton, speaking at a World Jewish Congress dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, said he would sign an executive order outlining the ban this week, to take effect in 30 days. It would apply to all American companies and their foreign subsidiaries and would eliminate virtually all remaining United States exports to Iran, which totaled $326 million last year, mostly in farm, industrial and oilfield equipment.

HEADLINE: Calling Iran 'Outlaw State,' Christopher Defends U.S. Trade Ban

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Seeking to explain a trade ban against Iran, Secretary of State Warren Christopher today portrayed the country as an "outlaw state" that spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on international terrorism and offered what he called proof that Teheran has been trying for a decade to develop nuclear weapons.
In briefing reporters, Mr. Christopher also called on America's allies to punish Iran with economic sanctions of their own and expressed hope that the American decision would move Russia and China to renege on their pledges to help Iran build nuclear energy plants. 
 But most of Mr. Christopher's information on Iran's nuclear program --described by senior Administration officials as based on highly classified data -- has already been disclosed in news reports during the last five years. Iran's support for terrorism has been documented in detail by the United States since the early days of the Iranian revolution in 1979, and the Administration provided no evidence of a recent terrorist act linked to Iran that would have inspired Mr. Clinton's decision to impose a trade ban.
Administration officials have no illusions that the allies, which do not wholeheartedly embrace Washington's bleak view of Iran, will follow suit.
In London tonight, a British Government official said that Britain would not change its long-held opposition to trade embargoes as a diplomatic tool except in the most extreme cases, like the outbreak of war. In Tokyo, Kozo Igarashi, the chief Cabinet Secretary who serves as the Prime Ministry spokesman, said that Japan had not received a request to join the ban, which will eliminate exports to Iran and prevent American oil companies from buying Iranian crude oil.
The United States is so isolated in its anti-Iran campaign that it will not seek a United Nations resolution for global economic sanctions or mount a campaign with its major trading partners at the economic summit meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, next month to ban all purchases of Iranian oil.
Nor does Washington intend to penalize Russia or China if they go forward with plans to help Iran develop nuclear energy, Mr. Christopher said.
Despite the trade ban and the rhetoric surrounding it, President Clinton, during a 30-minute telephone conversation last week with President Boris N. Yeltsin, did not even raise the issue of Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran or its $1 billion contract to build two nuclear plants in Iran.
The decision allows Mr. Clinton to look Mr. Yeltsin in the eye when they meet in Moscow next week and say that American companies are making economic sacrifices for the sake of global security and that Russia should do the same by canceling its nuclear power deal with Iran.
An indication of just how little effect the trade ban is expected to have is that oil futures rose only slightly today, a move that many oil analysts dismissed as overreaction in the often volatile futures markets. Eventually, non-American companies will buy more Iranian oil and American companies will buy more non-Iranian oil, although they may have to pay higher prices in the short run.
Why then, all the fuss now? Why did President Clinton decide to announce on Sunday that he was banning trade with Iran if America's allies would not go along, if it would not have an effect on Iran's economy and if it could complicate an already troubled summit meeting with Russia?
The immediate reason is that Congress is about to begin hearings Tuesday on legislation pending in both houses to punish Iran even more. The legislation, which includes a bill proposed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, has had wide support. In addition to banning trade between the United States and Iran, it would also impose a secondary boycott on American trade with foreign companies that do business with Iran.
But Mr. Clinton's move has already broken its momentum.
"I applaud the President," said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has aggressively documented Iran's weapons programs over the years. "He did the right thing and I will support him however I can. The D'Amato legislation should certainly be held in abeyance."
Senator D'Amato called the President's decision "a good first step." But he said that the next step is to get other countries to go along, and he has not withdrawn his bills.
The trade ban ordered by President Clinton also eliminates a major inconsistency that has dogged the Administration since it first branded Iran an "outlaw state" more than a year ago: the fact that American oil companies had become the largest purchasers of Iranian oil.
The Administration's vilification of Iran has also fed into the anti-Iranian fever that has seized Capitol Hill and touched off calls for further action. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said in a statement today that Mr. Clinton may want to cancel his trip to Moscow unless the Russians assure him they will not proceed with its plans to provide nuclear reactors to Iran. He also said that Congress might examine whether the United States should apply similar sanctions to countries like Syria and North Korea that it identifies as sponsors of terrorism.
To prove the Administration's case against Iran, Mr. Christopher took the unusual step today of revealing some of the same intelligence data on Iran's nuclear program that he shared recently with Russia's Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Washington's main allies.
"In terms of its organization, programs, procurement, and covert activities, Iran is pursuing the classic route to nuclear weapons which has been followed by almost all states that have recently sought a nuclear capability," Mr. Christopher said.
He said the United States had information that Iran has tried for years to buy heavy water research reactors to produce weapons-grade plutonium. He also said Teheran is "devoting resources" to enrich uranium so that it can be used for weapons, and has "scoured" the former Soviet Union in search of nuclear materials, technology and scientists. In 1992, Iran tried unsuccessfully to buy substantial quantities of enriched uranium from a plant in Kazakhstan, Mr. Christopher added.

CRACKDOWN IN BRONX ON POLICE ABUSE
On the streets of the Bronx, top police officials say, the police have evolved a separate culture, a more aggressive style of policing that apparently makes it easier for them to cross the line into brutality and illegal activity. In the last year, particularly, many officers seem to have interpreted -- misinterpreted, officials say -- orders to crack down on drugs and minor street crimes as a kind of license to abuse. A1.

HEADLINE: In the War of Politics, Medicare Spending Has Become the Latest Battlefield

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats are at war again over Medicare.
The back and forth of the last few days has largely been political positioning. But it shrouds some serious substantive decisions facing the President and Congress that could significantly affect the medical insurance available to 40 million elderly and disabled Americans. 
 To separate the facts from the political claims and counterclaims, it is important to keep these points in mind:
*As a practical matter, the Federal budget cannot be balanced in seven years, as the Republicans promise, without deep cuts in projected spending for Medicare.
*Cuts of this magnitude would raise the cost of health insurance to millions of retirees (read "voters") or reduce the services available to them.
*The Medicare trust fund that finances hospital bills is again in danger of running out of money. The problem has recurred periodically over the last quarter century, and Presidents and Congress have managed to resolve it without undermining the program.
*Democrats have scored politically in the last few weeks with their argument that the Republicans' Medicare plan would pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. The proposal by Senator Bob Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich to remove Medicare from the debate over the budget is largely an effort to gain more solid political footing.
Take these points one by one.
BALANCED BUDGET. Along with Medicaid, the health program for the poor, Medicare is the fastest growing part of the Federal budget. It will cost $176 billion this year and, unless changes are made, $286 billion in the year 2000, a 62 percent rise.
The Republicans in Congress have promised not to touch Social Security or lower the military budget, and interest on the national debt must be paid. Medicare is nearly 25 percent of everything that is left, and the fraction is growing every year.
In trying to write a balanced budget by 2002, Republican leaders have talked about reducing Medicare spending an average of $35 billion to $45 billion a year over the next seven years, although they have not said what steps they would to achieve that saving. This is one-quarter to one-third of the total saving required if the budget is to be balanced without raising taxes.
"Realistically, there is no way to come close to balancing the budget without cutting Medicare," said Stanley E. Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
PAINFUL CUTS. Trying to show that reducing projected spending for Medicare would not require a great deal of sacrifice, Republicans have made two main arguments. The first is that easy savings could be accomplished by placing Medicare beneficiaries in the kind of cost-efficient managed care programs now used by a majority of American workers. The second is that under the Republican plans, spending would continue to rise; only the rate of growth would be restricted.
Most independent analysts of the situation take issue with both arguments and say that limiting Medicare spending would inevitably result in higher costs or reduced benefits for the elderly.
In the case of managed care, little evidence exists to suggest that quick savings could be achieved in an elderly population requiring much more expensive medical treatment than people of working age.
Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, made the point this way: "There is some hope that managed care might save money, but not in the next few years. Managed care involves structural changes that take time to implement, and it requires a marketing campaign to convince beneficiaries that it is in their interest. That will take a long time."
Mr. Reischauer's analyses of health costs were eagerly embraced by Republicans last year when he calculated that the Clinton health plan would cost much more than the Administration had estimated.
As for restricting only the rate of growth in spending, the rising Medicare costs now being projected reflect not an expansion of the program but rather overall inflation in health costs and an increase in the size of the population entitled to benefits under the program.
An analogy can be seen in the military budget. The Pentagon spent the same amount -- $282 billion -- in 1987, before the end of the cold war, and in 1994, but no one seriously argues that the military budget has not been cut. By last year, for example, the number of troops had declined to 1.6 million from 2.2 million and the number of Navy fighting ships to 387 from 568.
TRUST FUND. In an effort to shift the emphasis away from the idea of cutting Medicare to balance the budget, Republicans have begun to argue that savings are needed to keep the system from going bankrupt.
Unlike doctor bills, which are covered by general tax revenues and premiums paid by the elderly, hospital bills covered by Medicare are financed by a 2.9 percent payroll tax divided equally between employers and employees. This money goes into a part of the budget called the Health Insurance Trust Fund, and by law, this is the only money that is to be used to pay those Medicare expenses.
For years, the fund has run a surplus. The extra money has been used to buy Government securities, thus reducing the amount the Treasury was forced to borrow in the private economy. But beginning next year, the tax revenues and interest received on the securities will be less than the amount paid out for health care. By 2002, the fund's trustees estimate, the fund will have run dry.
A similar problem arose several times in the 1970's and 1980's, and each time the politicians kept the fund solvent for several more years by raising taxes or cutting expenses.
In 1993, as part of President Clinton's deficit-reduction legislation, Congress abolished the income ceiling above which workers owed no Medicare payroll tax and increased the amount of Social Security benefits that are subject to income taxes. This money was earmarked for the Medicare trust fund. All Republicans voted against that bill. Now, Republicans in the House have voted to repeal the additional tax on Social Security payments, and Republican Senators have vowed to follow suit.
SEPARATE MEDICARE FROM THE BUDGET. Last week, Mr. Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, said: "We have decided that we're taking Medicare into a separate box. Every penny saved in Medicare should go to Medicare. It should not be entangled in the budget debate."
He did not explain what he meant, but here is a guess: The Republicans will adopt new budget rules setting Medicare "off budget," just as Social Security is, and asserting that no cuts in Medicare could be used for anything but to shore up the trust fund. As a practical matter, this has little meaning. When the deficit is calculated, off-budget items are counted the same as others. Thus, the huge surplus in the Social Security trust fund is used now to make the deficit appear lower than it would otherwise be and can be used by Republicans to show a balanced budget.
The Republicans will still have to propose large cuts in projected spending for Medicare if they hope to balance the budget. But as a political matter, the Republicans could gain an advantage, since every dollar cut from Medicare that goes toward balancing the budget will also count toward making the trust fund solvent, a goal the Republicans hope voters will see as worthy.
If, as seems likely, the Administration refuses to go along, the Republicans can accuse the President of endangering one of the Government's most popular programs.

HEADLINE: Highway of Drugs -- A special report.;
Opium Finding Its Silk Road In the Chaos of Central Asia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: OSH, Kyrgyzstan

 BODY:
Compared with the mysterious bazaars that brought wealth to this Central Asian region more than 2,000 years ago, when exotic spices and precious bales of silk were ferried on the backs of camels, the market here seems pretty tame.
Old men sell sugar from the trunks of rusted cars. Women gather bread in the folds of their skirts, and the smells of grilled lamb fill the air. But something else is going on here in southern Kyrgyzstan these days, something communicated mostly in quick nods and furtive glances. 
 Osh is rapidly becoming the best place in the world to buy opium, the hub of a newly resurgent Silk Road, perhaps history's most famous highway. The route that wound for 5,000 miles from China across vast steppes, through the mountains of Afghanistan to the open ports of the Mediterranean has now reopened for a compelling reason: Despite halting efforts to interrupt the traffic, the route now carries an ever-growing caravan of drugs through the damaged, lawless and often ungovernable countries of Central Asia.
Propelled by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, economic and political chaos, civil war, borders that cannot be controlled and the aggressive anarchy of Afghanistan -- which many narcotics experts now estimate is quickly becoming the the biggest grower of opium in the world -- this rugged, often unassailable region has become the ultimate drug runners' dream come true.
"What is happening in these countries is a nightmare," said Victoria Goh, deputy director of the United Nations Drug Control Program's regional office in nearby Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
"There are hundreds of little mountain passes and roads that cannot be guarded," she said. "There are almost no effective borders. There are no incentives to stop the traffic, only incentives to start. And the confusion and poverty in this part of the world is so great that I don't see any way anything is going to improve soon."
The tide of drugs sweeping across these struggling new countries presents major problems not just for them, but also for the European countries that have become the destination for the opium grown here. And as bad as the drug problem has become, the political troubles they cause are worse.
Central Asia is a fragile region, politically weak but strategically important. As corruption and ethnic violence take hold, larger neighbors -- especially China, Russia, Turkey and Iran -- have become increasingly nervous.
Indeed, the opium pouring out of Afghanistan has not only affected this region, but has also worried politicians in the world's largest heroin-consuming nation, the United States.
At the same time, crackdowns elsewhere have only added to the region's drug problems. Pakistan and Iran have recently started to get tough on poppy growers and heroin manufacturers, thereby diverting the river of opium, and turning Central Asia into an even more essential transit point for the thousands of tons that are produced each year.
On the new international drug highway, all roads seem to lead from Osh. Fewer than 300 miles from the Afghan border, and less than a day's drive from each of five other Central Asian countries, the city has become the bustling dispatch point for routes that spin north toward Russia, east to Asia and west to Europe, through the legendary city of Samarkand, where money was once measured in ounces of silk, not in tons of opium.
The economics of this mostly Muslim part of the world are stark. The average monthly salary for a working man in Kyrgyzstan is about $35, half what a boy of 10 can earn in a few hours guiding a horse laden with drugs through a mountain pass.
Raw opium has quickly become a bread-basket commodity in this rural land of 4.5 million people: farmers can swap 20 pounds of flour for a rich chunk of opium the size of a jumbo chocolate bar. It can also be bartered for peanuts, canned goods, cooking oil, lamb or cognac.
"I have replaced every one of my officers," said Bakerdin Subunbekov, chief of the Osh police, which must fight the flood of drugs and corruption in a city of 500,000 with three Russian-made jeeps, a few guns and one walkie-talkie.
"I picked the new men myself," he said. "They were trained in secret. They are 29 good honest men, but they earn $45 a month. They have families. You can figure out the rest."
A pound of pure opium gum -- available to anyone who shows an interest -- costs less than $400 in the Osh market, much less for shoppers willing to buy in bulk. The same amount costs three times as much in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, which may help explain why it is sold openly there by senior members of the police force.
The price nearly doubles again when the opium arrives in Samarkand, hundreds of miles away in Uzbekistan. By the time the opium reaches its main destination in Moscow, where it is often refined into heroin, it costs at least $5,000 a pound.
"One look at a map and you can see it all," said Henry Lee Clarke, the American Ambassador to Uzbekistan, which has the toughest drug laws in Central Asia. "This problem is beginning to get out of control. Those drugs are mostly grown in Afghanistan. But they just can't get where they are going unless they come through here."
 
The Economics
Drug Business Is 'What Works'
 The business of drugs goes against every economic trend in the region. World opium production has doubled in the few years since the Soviet Union collapsed, according to the United Nations-sponsored International Narcotics Control Board in Vienna. In 1993 a record eight tons of heroin was seized in Europe. The 1994 figures, while not yet final, may be twice that, according to the United Nations.
And while most of the increased production took place in Afghanistan and Pakistan, this is where drug dealers ship it these days -- even more than that originating in Myanmar or Thailand.
That is largely because the commerce carries few risks. Even in Uzbekistan, where the death penalty has just been introduced for drug dealers, almost everyone in the business pays someone to protect them.
"Only the fools and the small fry get caught," a longtime drug dealer said in his home in Samarkand, another large center of the opium trade. "It's a business, and if you act like a businessman, you won't get hurt."
Geography, economy and political chaos have rarely been joined in more perfect union. In Kyrgyzstan, the 1994 per capita income was $300, 60 percent of what it was in 1991. The figures are only slightly better in Uzbekistan, and anarchy and war have taken root in Tajikistan, which shares some of the world's best poppy fields with its neighbor Afghanistan.
Industrial production in these mountainous, beautiful and remote former Central Asian republics (which also include Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) averages less than half of the Soviet-era figures. Real unemployment in the region, according to estimates by the World Bank, stands at 35 percent.
"Drugs are what works in this country," said Takone Kassymbekovhe, deputy chief of the anti-narcotics division of Kyrgyzstan's Interior Ministry. "They solve every problem. People are using them more, growing them, importing them and exporting them. If you have enough money, you can pay Russian border guards to deliver your opium in helicopters."
It is an assertion heard frequently in this part of the world, but one that Russian officials deny.
Dozens of laboratories that turned poppies into bricks of opium gum or into morphine or their most concentrated and highest-priced form, heroin, have been shut down in Kyrgyzstan in the last two years. But many more go undetected, officials here concede. For the first time this year, both the Uzbek and Kyrgyz authorities seized several pounds of locally made heroin in what is seen as a troubling trend.
In the past, opium was always shipped elsewhere, to places like Pakistan, elsewhere in Asia or Europe, for most such refining. But all that is rapidly changing. International law-enforcement agencies now estimate that there are hundreds of such labs spread across the region, although most of them are based in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the two countries where poppy plantations have grown the fastest.
Mr. Kassymbekovhe has been assigned the task of stopping the importing of opium from Afghanistan, a job he compares to holding back the sea with the palm of his hand, which he stares at sadly as he talks. He has traveled extensively along the 450-mile road from Khorog in Tajikistan to Osh. That road is essential for the farmers in the region. It is also the umbilical cord that connects the poppy fields of Afghanistan with the rest of the world.
Mr. Kassymbekovhe said he had watched as border guards took strategically timed tea breaks when trucks rolled by. He bought more than 100 pounds of raw opium last year in a weekend, just to show how simple it was.
"Nothing is going to change here until the politics do," he said in an interview in Bishkek.
He added that publicizing the problem was an important part of his job, but Mr. Kassymbekovhe, who is 63, has had about all he can take and plans to retire soon.
"I am disillusioned," he said. "There is no winning. We only lose."
Although some officials say it is hard to buy opium on the streets here, Mr. Kassymbekovhe suggested that a reporter see for himself.
 
The Traffickers
Drug Runners Have It Easy
 It takes less than an hour to buy large quantities of opium in Bishkek or Osh.
In Bishkek, prospective buyers are taken to the headquarters of the Interior Ministry, where police officials store the opium they are only happy to sell. The opium gum is in the form of brown bricks the size of shoe boxes.
Young men hover behind nearly every market stall or bus stop competing with one another to offer the best prices, and dealers are eager to supply samples. But the biggest deals are never done in public. They are made as soon as poppies are harvested in the fields in Afghanistan, several hundred miles south of here.
"It is like watching a powerful epidemic begin," said Rusail Riamberdayev, 39, the anti-narcotics chief for the Osh region. "I think we are in for something very bad."
A couple of weeks traveling across the region would tend to confirm his suspicions. Few countries are less rigorous about guarding their borders than those of Central Asia. Visas are rarely required; when they are, they are almost never checked. Most cars pass between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and, in the north, Kazakhstan, without incident or inspection. Some frontiers simply have stop signs.
Drug runners have it easy, particularly if they have paid in advance for protection. The drugs make their journey by car, truck, bus, mule and human being from Tajikistan to Osh and beyond. Official Russian trucks are often used by Tajik drivers, and this allows their owners to say the vehicles were stolen if something goes wrong.
"We sent a Western customs officer as an adviser to the border of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan," said a diplomat based in the region. "The Government asked for help on this drug route. So the customs officer told them he would be there on a Monday. He showed up on Sunday, though, and spent the day in the hills, watching the post through binoculars."
The adviser said he had observed vehicles passing the checkpoint without a nod from the border guards or the customs officers.
"He saw truck after truck," the diplomat continued. "He wrote down license numbers. There were more than a dozen of them. When he showed up the next day and asked to see the books, not one of them was listed."
The people who are stopped and searched usually do not have enough money for bribes.
"We have been here for more than 24 hours," said a weary Rassal Tayaviv, a 32-year-old driver hauling several tons of dried fruit from Tajikistan to Moscow, where he hoped to sell it. Mr. Tayaviv had been stopped in the Fergana Valley, the heavily Muslim region that spreads across eastern Uzbekistan and into Kyrgyzstan.
It has become a popular route for drug runners because when the weather is dry, they can drive on river beds, not just the main highway, causing the police more trouble.
"They want one million rubles, and we don't have it," he said, almost in tears, citing an amount of about $200. "Believe me, if we were carrying drugs, they would have found them already."
Not necessarily. Truckers are learning to weld their stash into the heaviest parts of their vehicles. One day this spring, the Osh police cut 150 pounds of opium out of a truck that was headed toward Russia from Tajikistan. Somebody had removed the metal flooring, loaded the opium in strips and welded it all into place.
Nearly every day now, the Osh police take blowtorches to trucks, burning holes in the thickest steel. Sometimes they find something, but not often.
"We have picked up about 200 kilograms of opium so far this year," said Alijon Halikev, a drug inspector who was busy one recent day torching an 18-wheeler. "But they say that much comes into the country every day. How can we stop it?"
 
The Policing
Few Resources For Drug Control
 With a combined surface area that is almost twice the size of Europe and some of the most poorly organized and corrupt police forces in the world, Central Asia offers drug traffickers the uninterrupted obscurity they need to flourish.
It is not even possible to gauge with certainty how much opium is grown in the remote hills here, though estimates are becoming more accurate through the use of satellites. There are seven major mountain passes on the Kyrgyz border that lead from Khorog to Osh, and dozens of minor branch roads that only highly sophisticated and expensive helicopter surveillance could monitor.
But the United States and other Western governments have not yet committed the kind of money to these countries that they put into Colombia or Thailand.
When the rivers of southern Kyrgyzstan freeze in the winter, children walk across them with bundles of opium poppies strapped to their backs. Old women hide hundreds of pounds of poppy on their farms for small fees. Once the opium is collected, turned into gum and taken safely out of Afghanistan, couriers carry it to Osh or Dushanbe, the Tajik capital.
The opium is loaded on private planes, military planes or even commercial flights. The United Nations has tried to help by supplying money for guard dogs, by training border guards and by buying a few cars for local police forces.
But they are fighting forces that have far more incentive and much more money.
"Each of the five countries in Central Asia lacks the basic resources for effective drug control," the annual United Nations report on international narcotics trafficking said recently. "All law-enforcement agencies there are hampered by poor technical equipment, chronic lack of fuel, inefficient communication systems and shortages of trained staff."
At least 500,000 people in the region, or 1 percent of the population, are estimated by the United Nations to use drugs at least occasionally, a fivefold increase in the last several years. Cultivation has risen markedly in all of the Central Asian countries, partly as a hedge against future attempts to shut borders, and partly because it is the best cash crop around.
"There has been poppy growing in this region for centuries," said Maj. Gen. Kutbydyn Burkhonov, Uzbekistan's First Deputy Interior Minister, who is in charge of the country's anti-narcotic efforts.
"It used to be big news if we caught a person with a few grams," he said. "Now we catch people with kilos almost every day. They swallow it, sew it into their clothes, everything. We will be as vigilant as we can be. But this is a problem that cannot be solved alone."

HEADLINE: Pataki, Too, Is Pinched Without Pay

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 1

 BODY:
Around the Capitol it has been well known for weeks that Gov. George E. Pataki's refusal to pay himself, state legislators and their aides until the budget is passed has created financial pain and anxiety for many state workers.
It turns out that the Governor himself had to take special measures to deal with a financial squeeze. 
 On March 23, a week before the deadline for the new budget, Mr. Pataki received a $140,000 home-equity line of credit from Chemical Bank that he plans to use to pay off another debt, to help finance business investments and to tide over his family while the budget impasse continues. Mr. Pataki's salary is $130,000 a year.
Mr. Pataki may be feeling a pinch, some of his advisers say, because he already has mortgages on four properties and owns a farm that he is seeking to sell but that has been losing money in the interim. They say that he does not have a large savings account that could carry him through a protracted budget fight and has several major bills nearly due. The budget is now 31 days late, and no agreement is on the horizon.
Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's director of communications, said that the Governor would have taken the line of credit whether or not the budget was late because he needed money to repay a $90,000 loan and to pay legal and other fees related to efforts to sell his family's Peekskill farm to developers.
But she acknowledged that Mr. Pataki might use some of the credit line for personal expenses. "He has a family and a home to support," she said, noting that while Mr. Pataki's salary has increased this year, he also gave up income from rentals and his law practice upon becoming Governor.
"It certainly, as it is with all of us, would be helpful to get paid," said Ms. Mucha, who along with about 100 of Mr. Pataki's aides has not been paid since April 1. "But he strongly believes in what he's doing."
Ms. Mucha said it was coincidence that Mr. Pataki received approval on the line of credit one week before the new fiscal year began, when his threat to stop paying himself, the lawmakers and their aides was to take effect. She said he first applied for the loan in December.
But another adviser to Mr. Pataki, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the Governor was concerned early in his administration that he would not have enough money to cover his personal expenses in an extended budget battle, and that he wanted to make sure he had the line of credit in place before April 1.
The loan, essentially a second mortgage, is secured by Mr. Pataki's 25-room house in the Putnam County town of Garrison, where he and his wife, Libby, who does not draw a salary, reside with their four children. Ms. Mucha said that the Governor would pay the prime rate, or 8.5 percent, for at least the first year of the line of credit.
Keith Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH Associates, a New Jersey mortgage information firm, said the terms Mr. Pataki received appear to be typical of a home-equity credit line.
Mr. Pataki plans to use the first $90,000 of the loan to repay a second mortgage he took last year from a Scarsdale-based company, Alfred Geisinger Inc. That loan, which carried a 12 percent interest rate, must be paid off by June 17. Mr. Pataki used that earlier loan to cover expenses he incurred during his race for governor, Ms. Mucha said.
Mr. Pataki plans to use some of the remaining $50,000 in his line of credit for costs associated with selling his family's 17-acre Peekskill farm to real estate developers. The rest will be available to the Governor and his wife for personal use.
Mr. Pataki is paying mortgages on four properties: the Garrison home, a house in Peekskill, a condominium in Saratoga Springs and a Washington County estate he bought late last year. He paid $48,308 in mortgage interest and property taxes last year on the first three of those properties, according to his 1994 tax returns. Information was not available today about Washington County property.
In addition to those mortgages, Mr. Pataki received a $60,000 loan in 1991 from Paul Guillaro, a developer, to finance engineering plans for the Peekskill farm. Mr. Pataki must repay the loan when he sells the farm.
Becoming Governor has clearly been something of a mixed financial blessing for Mr. Pataki. While his state salary roughly doubles what he earned as a senator, he has relinquished a legal practice that earned him $55,000 last year, and about $17,000 in rental income on his Garrison home. He stopped renting a wing of the mansion, known as Ienia, for security reasons after the election.
A Federal judge in Binghamton is expected to rule this week in a suit brought by nine state workers who hope to force Mr. Pataki to resume paying about 4,000 legislative aides.
Some Democratic lawmakers have said that they want to file their own lawsuit. But Democratic leaders have counseled against such action, afraid that it might appear that they were too concerned about their own paychecks.
Though most were loath to admit any problems, a few lawmakers acknowledged hardships. Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, Democrat of Brooklyn, said that he and his wife -- who had been unemployed until last week -- were forced to cash in a retirement account to help pay living expenses and their daughter's law school tuition.
Assemblyman Jules Polonetsky, also a Democrat of Brooklyn, has been sleeping on a couch in his Albany office to save on $40-a-night hotel costs. Last weekend, he and his wife, an artist, celebrated because she sold a painting at a craft fair in Brooklyn for $85.
"That was the sum of our earned income for the month of April," he said.

HEADLINE: Russian Complains To Gingrich on Aid

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The Speaker of Russia's Parliament met with the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, today and complained that the United States had not provided Russia with millions of dollars in promised economic aid.
Ivan P. Rybkin, Speaker of Russia's lower house of Parliament, said he had told Mr. Gingrich that his country had not received all the aid promised to build new housing for Russian troops pulled out of the Baltic states or to decommission more than a dozen Russian nuclear-powered submarines. 
 At a lunch with reporters, Mr. Rybkin said many Russians had grown annoyed that after Moscow withdrew troops and dismantled military installations, as the United States has urged, Washington has not come up with all the money promised.
Several Administration officials said Mr. Rybkin was badly underestimating how much American aid had been provided, but they said his views could not be ignored because if he is angry about American aid, then many other Russians must be too.

HEADLINE: Success of Housing Program Rests on Economy

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Will Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani complete the ambitious New York City housing program that has already produced more than 50,000 new apartments and houses in the last nine years?
The answer has less to do with Mr. Giuliani's ideological inclinations -- or even his budget released last week -- than with the unpredictability of New York's economy and the vagaries of trying to predict the city's long-term construction budget years in advance. While on paper the Mayor has committed to spending $4.2 billion over the next decade to keep the program going, it is by no means certain that the city's economy will grow enough to enable him to spend that much. 
 And there are many needs that could suddenly present themselves to compete for those dollars.
So far, Mr. Giuliani has kept largely intact the program begun by Mayor Edward I. Koch and continued by his successor, Mayor David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, the city has spent nearly $4 billion and produced more new apartments and houses than any other municipal housing effort in the country. In fact, it has produced more housing than all other local efforts combined.
But faced with five years of economic decline, city officials have been forced to slow down the pace of New York's effort, first under Mr. Dinkins and now under Mr. Giuliani. The annual capital, or construction, budget of the city agency that oversees the housing program has declined in four of the last six years because of fiscal constraints.
Officials of the agency, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, say they remain committed to completing the renewal effort conceived by Mr. Koch.
They are adding new dimensions to the program, which has concentrated on completely rebuilding abandoned apartment houses and constructing new one-, two- and three-family houses on vacant, city-owned land. The city has run out of large, vacant shells to rebuild, and under Mr. Giuliani it is shifting attention to renovating the remaining city-owned vacant buildings, which are small and scattered and have a potential of about 12,000 apartments.
But Mr. Giuliani, faced with a $3.1 billion gap in the city budget for the next fiscal year, has scaled back many of the city's long-range construction plans for next year and beyond.
Mr. Giuliani's broad, 10-year capital plan calls for reduced spending on housing construction for the next three fiscal years, and then increased spending over the following seven years. In all, the Mayor proposed to spend $4.2 billion on housing over the next 10 years. If he keeps that pledge he is likely to approach the progress of the last decade.
Under the proposal, the city would spend $341 million next year on housing construction, a reduction of $29 million, or 8 percent, from the $370 million spent in the current fiscal year. By the end of the three years, during the fiscal year that begins in July 1997, the city would spend $314 million on housing construction, a decrease of $56 million, or 15 percent, over spending in the current fiscal year.
The Mayor's 10-year plan assumes that New York's economy will begin to grow late in the decade. If the economy grows, so would city tax revenues. If the revenues grow, the city has more money to take on more debt in the form of municipal bonds, which it uses to finance long-term construction.
Many community groups and developers of low-income housing are worried that if there is not a significant turnaround in the local economy, the restorations in construction spending contemplated by Mr. Giuliani in the later years of his 10-year plan would not occur.
Critics also say that plans made now for capital spending that is four or more years away are often unreliable. Financial and economic circumstances change so rapidly that a commitment to spend more by the end of the decade, however well-intentioned, is no more than a broad outline, subject to many changes.
Competing construction needs, like rebuilding bridges or modernizing sewage treatment systems, could also constrain the Mayor's ability to expand city spending on housing late this decade and beyond.
But Mr. Giuliani and his budget aides insist that the reductions are necessary. They contend that, by curtailing spending now, the city government will help the local economy rebound.
The administration is asking to be judged over the long haul, a point that Deborah C. Wright, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, emphasized yesterday in a prepared statement. "Despite the budget reductions and fiscal constraints that must be imposed over the next four years," she said, "the Giuliani administration's commitment to housing is unmatched by any city in the country in terms of both dollars and units."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Woes of a Weak Dollar;
What's Good for Exporters Isn't Good for Everyone

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For all the advantage to exporters in this country, the sharp decline of the dollar in recent months is beginning to hurt American companies in their efforts to expand abroad. It also threatens to reverse the gains they have made against foreign competitors in the last decade.
Companies looking to raise their presence abroad through acquisitions are finding the price increasingly prohibitive. Consider the Wall Street financier Sanford I. Weill's ill-fated bid for the brokerage arm of Barings P.L.C., the insolvent British investment bank. Mr. Weill traveled to London in March to negotiate the acquisition, only to watch as "the value of our bid fell by 4 percent in a single week." The Dutch firm ING, bidding in strong guilders, won. 
 Or consider Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman of the Eaton Corporation of Cleveland, who reluctantly canceled an expansion strategy that American multinationals have pursued for years. Eaton wanted to buy a big German company to manufacture its electrical controls and auto parts. But the falling dollar made such a purchase too costly. "We will have to expand in Germany slowly, through exports," Mr. Hardis said. "That is far less effective than having a local presence."
Closer to home, some voices are warning that the enfeeblement of the dollar might undo much of the cost-cutting that has been the guiding principle of corporate America for more than a decade.
Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, thinks 1995 could be as much a turning point for corporate America as 1985. In that year, the resurgent dollar peaked at more than 3 marks and 250 yen, crimping American sales overseas. Finding themselves underpriced by their European and Japanese competitors, American companies stepped up a restructuring binge -- cutting costs, shifting production abroad and holding back wages.
Today, with the dollar at 1.39 marks and about 83 yen, the situation may be reversing itself, Mr. Roach warned. The dollar's battering is lulling corporate managers "into a false sense of complacency that allows them to take their eye off the ball in the global contest for market share," he said.
"Under the protective umbrella of a weak dollar," Mr. Roach added, "there's the chance that businesses could finally become lax in granting wage increases to increasingly disgruntled and overworked labor forces. Such a trend would be particularly disconcerting, since so many union contracts are up for renegotiation this year."
The falling dollar has raised that very thought in the mind of Joseph Uehlein, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. official. "It is becoming a very good reason to demand wage increases in contract talks this year, especially in view of the concessions that were granted in the name of making companies more competitive," he said.
With the exception of its surge in the early 1980's, the dollar has been gradually falling for decades against the yen and the mark, the world's two other most powerful currencies. But no one anticipated the latest plunge, to so low a level. The conventional wisdom still holds that a weak dollar can help the American economy by making American goods more affordable for foreigners, spurring exports.
The dollar's weakness has indeed increased sales abroad for American manufacturers. What's more, the nation's big multinationals have found ways to insulate themselves from currency swings. Over the last decade, many have set up or expanded operations abroad, and now their new foreign revenues offset the decline in the dollar. A thousand yen earned by Motorola's operations in Japan, for example, were worth $10 in January and $12 yesterday.
What is getting less attention are the negatives. For example, as foreign-currency fees to register patents overseas have risen, some companies have cut back. They have reduced the number of countries where they pay for such protection to keep their products from being illegally copied and sold, said George Gottlieb, a patent attorney. "My clients are pruning their portfolios," he said.
Even people who should be rejoicing at the export opportunities are gloomy. The Will-Burt Company, an Orrville, Ohio, maker of vehicle parts, is too small to set up its own manufacturing plants overseas. But exports to Europe of its rotating lights for emergency vehicles are booming as the low dollar makes them cheaper in other currencies. Will-Burt is also getting more orders from Caterpillar Inc. because the American heavy-equipment maker's overseas sales are rising as it takes customers away from its big Japanese rival, Komatsu.
Yet far from exulting, Harry E. Featherstone, Will-Burt's president, is nervous. "Exports are rising but that won't last," he said. "I've been in manufacturing 45 years, and I have finally learned that when the dollar falls, something goes wrong. This opportunity for more exports is going to turn out to be temporary, even if the dollar stays down."
Other companies, having spread their operations abroad to protect themselves from currency fluctuations, are now reluctant to shift them back home to take advantage of the weak dollar. Intel and AT&T, for example, buy parts from Japanese suppliers that might now be made more inexpensively in the United States. But neither company plans to switch to domestic production.
"If the dollar stays weak, there will be some migrating of production back to the United States, but only on the margin," said Lawrence Seifert, AT&T's vice president for global manufacturing. "We have been through this currency problem so much that we are more or less deployed globally, and that will not change."
Even so, many economists think the dollar should rebound. "You cannot sustain a situation in which 83 yen, the dollar's value today, will buy twice as much in Tokyo -- twice as much coffee, for example -- as a single dollar will buy in New York," said Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate in economic sciences. By his reckoning, a dollar's true value is more than 150 yen, and therefore must inevitably return to that level, last reached in 1990.
"The dollar is not weak," Mr. Friedman said. "It is just that the Japanese and Germans are out of line."
The latest plunge of nearly 20 percent against the yen and 12 percent against the mark is sorely testing such an assumption. The dollar is showing no signs of recovering to its 1994 levels. And Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve System whose anti-inflationary efforts reversed the dollar's decline in the early 1980's, wonders if it will.
"We have dug ourselves a kind of hole that we can no longer easily get out of because the implicit confidence that everyone had in the dollar, which has been amazing, has eroded and it is a real challenge to restore it," Mr. Volcker said. "If you think American leadership is important, that erosion is a negative."
Mr. Volcker and other experts tick off reasons why they think the dollar won't recover. People overseas have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars, particularly since the 1980's, and the outflow is worsening, reducing the dollar's allure. Most of the imbalance results from the chronic trade deficit.
More recently, another big exodus of dollars has begun. Mutual funds, insurance companies, speculators and pension funds, which once confined their activities largely to the United States, are investing billions in foreign stocks and bonds.
The cold war, previously a major reason to hold dollars, is gone. The Japanese, once enthusiastic investors in America, are trying to liquidate holdings and convert their dollars to yen, to rescue a struggling economy back home. And American interest rates, which used to be much higher than rates in Japan and Europe, are closer now, so the incentive for foreigners to invest in American securities is diminished.
"You have all this money out there, in reluctant hands, and $1 billion more going out every business day," Mr. Volcker said, "and sometimes there are people out there who will buy that many dollars and sometimes there aren't. It gives a constant weak tinge to the dollar."

Strong Yen Shortchanges Japanese

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 1

 BODY:
With the yen up 19 percent against the dollar in the last three months, the prices of imports from soup to nuts to socks and watches should be sliding, leaving Japanese consumers doing a grateful jig in the store aisles.
But it is not working out that way. While a few companies, like Chrysler and McDonald's, are shaving prices, most are taking advantage of the dollar's weakness against the yen rather than passing the benefit along to consumers. 
 The United States had hoped that the rising yen would reduce Japan's stubborn trade surplus by allowing Americans to fire a volley of cheap products at Japan. But by the time the goods land in Japanese stores, they have filtered through the nation's sprawling, inefficient distribution system, which preserves jobs and entrenched interests.
Even at today's exchange rate here -- 84.10 yen to the dollar late this afternoon -- they are often not cheap enough to dazzle the Japanese consumer.
"We don't feel that the prices in Japan are falling at all," said Kazuyuki Hamada, a consultant whose house is chock-a-block with goods acquired during a stint in the United States. "Only when we go abroad can we enjoy the power of the yen."
The production price of oil is tumbling, but Japanese consumers find utility and gasoline prices as high as ever, and bus and taxi fares are rising. Japanese rents, though they have dropped since the economy sagged in the early 1990's, remain sky-high.
While American companies have often complained about the costs of doing business in this country, many Japanese seem to have grown accustomed, or resigned, to the exorbitant prices of their goods and services. Some Japanese say this is part of a broader official attitude: the Government cares primarily about producers, not consumers.
"We should be angry," said Shimako Sato, 31, a film director, who had just emerged with a tiny, expensive purchase from a department store. "People say we have a democracy in Japan, but things are pretty much dictated by bureaucracy. We are always taught to follow. The Government tells us what to do, and we are not used to organizing protests to fight against prices. Even if we do, the Government does not respond."
In 1992, as the yen was climbing toward 110 to the dollar, a consumer group, the Consumer Science Federation, met with officials and business leaders to ask for lower prices. It was told that nothing could be done, because businesses were facing tough times and jobs were more important than price cuts.
Consumer groups in Japan are extremely weak, and that particular experience has left the federation at a loss for what to do.
Some consumers are taking import matters into their own hands and turning to mail-order catalogues from overseas. American companies like L. L. Bean and the personal computer maker Gateway 2000 are often used by Japanese, who benefit from American prices even after paying for shipping.
The Association for Promotion of Imports, which advises consumers on how to import by themselves, has about 200 new customers a day in its offices, mostly to learn how to buy products like children's clothing, outdoor wear, bags, cosmetics and household goods by mail order.
But at traditional department stores and smaller Japanese retailers, prices for imported goods have hardly budged, so that at current exchange rates, the expensive becomes outrageous. An 8.8-ounce package of Camembert cheese sells for the equivalent of $21.64 at a supermarket, for example, and a one-ounce jar of Estee Lauder skin moisturizer costs $119 at the Seibu Department Stores.
A consumer filling a shopping basket with food would find that at today's exchange rates, a Florida grapefruit costs 450 yen ($5.35), a Mexican lime 300 yen ($3.57), a package of Lark cigarettes 250 yen ($2.97), a 16-ounce package of graham crackers 630 yen ($7.49). A Domino's pizza for three (14 inches), with pepperoni and mushrooms costs 2,400 yen ($28.54).
Prices like that help to explain why the number of Japanese going abroad is expected to rise sharply in the coming holiday season. Shopping bargains overseas encouraged many Japanese to travel abroad -- 11.9 million in 1993, the last year for which figures are available -- and enticed them to spend $26.9 billion during their trips. In contrast, foreign tourists visiting Japan spent only $3.6 billion. The Government estimates that in 1994, 13.5 million Japanese tourists went overseas.
To be sure, some companies are passing on savings to the consumer. A few weeks ago, Chrysler cut its prices on some cars sold in Japan. And more recently, McDonald's for the first time in a decade lowered the price of its basic hamburger by 38 percent, to $1.55. The next day, the number of customers increased nearly 30 percent.
Discounters like Daiei Inc. and Ito-Yokado, are also paring prices. Ito-Yokado has held a couple of "strong yen" sales in its supermarkets last month, during which it dropped its prices on various imported goods.
"I think the bigger issue is that prices of energy like electricity, gas and water remain at their current levels," said Kazuko Itakura, a spokeswoman for Ito-Yokado. "As long as that's the case, dramatic price cuts are not possible."
As a growing number of Japanese discounters and American retailers like Toys "R" Us are beginning to nibble away at the traditional consumer landscape in this country, some economists say the persistently strong yen, coupled with Japan's recession, may help bring about real change in the economy.
That is likely to happen only if policy makers are convinced that changes like deregulation will bring less pain than no change. By allowing large quantities of cheaper imports, they could force inefficient domestic producers and distributors to tighten costs and lower retail prices.
"In the past, there's been a huge bias in favor of the corporation," said Richard A. Werner, an economist at the Tokyo branch of Jardine Fleming Securities. "But in the long run, someone else will be getting the benefits, and that's the consumer."
Not everyone is sanguine about the prospects for the consumer economy, and most economists say there will probably not be a consumer revolution, particularly one inspired by the surging yen.
More likely is that manufacturing industries and export-related companies will hold down wages and cut costs, measures that will in turn help to dampen expectations and cramp consumption.
Meanwhile, a lot of finger-pointing is going on to explain the high consumer prices. At Japanese book stores that import foreign-language works, the prices of books, magazines and newspapers may be twice, or a lot more, than what they cost in the home country, and this has recently drawn sharp criticism in the press here.
For instance, Sunday copies of The New York Times, which sell for $2.50 in New York, now cost 4,400 yen -- $52.32 -- in a typical Japanese bookstore. But Tower Records , which just opened a giant store filled with books and compact disks, sells the same newspaper for 990 yen, or $11.77.
"You see, Japanese bookstores aren't used to setting book prices on their own, since Japanese retail book prices are all fixed," said Kunio Takahashi, a director of the Yohan Western Publications Distribution Agency.
Kinokuniya, a large bookstore chain, offered a different view. "We are making requests to these distributors to lower their rate," the store said in a written response to questions. "Unless they streamline their operation, the price reduction will not be possible."
Even those who want to cut prices to their customers are finding it difficult.
At the Cha Cha Coffee House, in the Ginza district of Tokyo, the price in yen of a $1 cup of coffee used to fluctuate with the daily exchange rate. It drew scores of Japanese, who would crowd into the shop at lunchtime as the coffee price in yen kept tumbling with the weakening dollar.
But for the management, the price was falling too low, and Cha Cha finally gave up. It posted a handwritten paper sign outside the door saying, "We are sorry, but because of the drop in value of the U.S. dollar, we have decided to fix the lowest price of the $1 coffee at 100 yen."

HEADLINE: Sales Slowdown Worsened for Big Auto Makers in April

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 1

 BODY:
Most auto makers reported today that their sales plunged in April, in the most striking of four consecutive monthly declines, dashing their hopes that warm weather, stable interest rates and fattened incentives would bring buyers back to showrooms.
Several companies, including the Chrysler Corporation and the Honda Motor Company, posted double-digit percentage decreases from a strong month a year earlier. Auto makers controlling two-thirds of the United States market reported sales today, and not one major company reported an increase. 
 Over all, auto sales fell an estimated 9.2 percent in April from the corresponding period a year earlier.
"It's scary," said Jack Kirnan, an auto analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York. "These are like recession numbers."
The dismal performance seemed likely to bolster Chrysler's efforts to convince restive investors that it needed to set aside $7.5 billion in cash to see it through the next economic downturn, which until recently seemed a distant danger.
While the General Motors Corporation said today that it would increase its quarterly dividend by 50 percent, to 30 cents a share, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive, warned that investors should not expect another increase soon because the company wanted to be sure it could pay the full amount through the next downturn. G.M. cited a stronger balance sheet for the dividend increase.
"We'll revisit the dividend issue in the future, but we're going to apply a rigorous standard of sustainability in considering any future increase," Mr. Smith said.
The Big Three auto makers have been producing vehicles at high rates, in anticipation of stronger demand this year than last. Now, with a third of the year gone, the slack pace of sales means that the companies will probably have to cut production and increase their rebates and other sales incentives in order to clear out the rising inventories.
The surprisingly weak numbers sent analysts searching to explain why the industry's sales appeared to slowing more than the economy as a whole. The nation's economic growth subsided in the first quarter from the torrid growth rate of late last year.
"We were anticipating slowing, but the sluggishness has been below most people's expectations," said Paul D. Ballew, the economist with the Detroit branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, referring to the auto sales figures. But, he said, "the macroeconomic fundamentals are still positive."
Mr. Ballew said a substantial jump in monthly interest payments for vehicles in the first quarter could be one culprit for the sharp decline in auto sales. Auto loan rates have increased far more than those for other types of loans, he said, producing a 13 percent jump in the average monthly payment, to a range of $380 to $390.
Mr. Kirnan argued that auto makers were pricing their new vehicles too high. He said rivals for consumer dollars, like the computer and the home appliance industries, had been far more restrained in their pricing and were reaping the benefits.
And car buyers appear to be turning to the used vehicle market. In the new vehicle market, Mr. Kirnan said, "Increasingly, the only people who can afford to buy a vehicle are higher-income people."
Some dealers also said used cars were taking customers away from new-car showrooms. "Used cars have become the entry-level car for almost every nameplate," said Lewis Webb, owner of a Toyota dealership in Cerritos, Calif.
Two big auto makers did not report sales today. The Toyota Motor Company is expected to report sales on Tuesday, and the Ford Motor Company on Wednesday.
Ward's Automotive Reports estimated today that the annual selling rate for cars and light trucks plunged during April to 13.8 million vehicles from 15.2 million in the corresponding period a year earlier and 15.1 million in March. And Ward's made its gloomy estimate -- which is based on production figures, historical market shares and other company information -- despite anticipating a rise in sales by Ford.
At G.M., car sales fell 10.4 percent, to 232,188, while sales of light trucks slipped only 1.6 percent, to 161,810. G.M. dealers said they could not get enough trucks to satisfy demand. "We've been experiencing a severe inventory problem since November," said Jim Johnson, general manager of Landmark Chevrolet Geo in Houston. He said the shortage was likely to continue into the fall.
At Chrysler, however, sales of light trucks plunged 19.2 percent, to 102,239, while car sales fell 16.4 percent, to 64,157. Some buyers may be postponing purchases as they await Chrysler's new model mini-van, due later this month. But evidence is growing that Chrysler is losing customers for high-profit sport utility vehicles, one of its lucrative market segments, to G.M. and Ford.
Nissan also had a miserable April. Its car sales in the United States fell by more than a quarter, to 29,704, while its sales of light trucks fell 13.7 percent, to 15,367.
Honda's car sales in this country dropped 14.5 percent, to 57,466. The company's sales of light trucks rose 12.7 percent, to 2,038. Honda is now selling a light truck, the Odyssey mini-van, which was not available last year.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
An Embargo Is Seen to Affect Oil Services and Farmers Most

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 1

 BODY:
President Clinton's announcement on Sunday that he would issue an executive order this week banning trade with Iran left many exporters anxiously awaiting the actual document.
While international oil companies like Exxon, Mobil and Caltex that had been buying Iranian oil for resale abroad have the biggest contracts at stake, it appears that oil service companies will bear the brunt of the curb on exports to Iran. They accounted for more than half the $326 million in American exports to Iran last year. Some agricultural products are also major exports, especially corn and rice. 
 The Clinton Administration projected that the export embargo would cost "a few thousand jobs" based simply on the size of the export market. More than 3,000 jobs would be lost in the oil services sector alone, applying the Department of Labor's rule of thumb that each $1 million in exports in that industry accounts for 19.7 jobs, according to Russell Ginn, a valve company executive who is president of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association, a Houston-based trade group.
Exporters were worried about how the President's order might affect getting paid for past exports and completion of current contracts, as well as lost opportunities in the future. And, as in past trade battles, they argued that restrictions would only drive Iran into relationships with foreign competitors.
"We're very troubled," said Larry Bowles, director of government affairs at Halliburton Inc., an engineering and oilfield equipment company based in Houston. "We don't feel it will have any significant effect on keeping Iran from achieving the goals that concern the President."
Mr. Bowles and others added, though, that President Clinton's plan appeared far less burdensome than that proposed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who wants to bar American companies from doing business with any foreign company trading with Iran.
Mr. Bowles said that the embargo plans were especially disappointing because Iran appeared to be embarking on a major renovation of its aging oilfields that could have meant a substantial upswing in business for Halliburton and others. The company was already hurt by the decision last month -- under White House pressure -- by Conoco, a unit of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, to pull out of a deal to develop two offshore oilfields in Iran. "We expected some of Conoco's service work," Mr. Bowles said.
Mr. Ginn said that for many companies the big concern would be getting paid for work already done. He said American companies were already owed $500 million, and that many smaller companies in his industry operated on such thin margins that they might be driven into bankruptcy if Iran retaliated by halting all payments.
A trade embargo may also sharply affect rice growers. After losing one of their major foreign markets with the overthrow of the Shah of Iran 15 years ago, they had been enjoying a strong trade rebound in recent years. Exports to Iran had zoomed from zero in 1990 to a projected 200,000 to 220,000 metric tons this year, worth about $75 million.
"At a time when our farmers are being told they must learn to depend more on markets rather than government, this embargo is a confusing signal," said Patricia Alderson, spokeswoman for the USA Rice Federation in Houston.
Corn exports to Iran had also been growing rapidly in recent years, according to the U.S. Feed Grains Council, an industry group that focuses on grain exports. The industry expected to export 750,000 tons this year, a small amount compared to the 16 million tons going to Japan but still important, a spokeswoman for the council, Donna Dunne, said.
"Every export market is one we are looking for," she said.

HEADLINE: White House Spurns Request By Gingrich About Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The White House today spurned Speaker Newt Gingrich's invitation to propose ways of restructuring Medicare and said the Republicans in Congress must first specify how they intend to reconcile their promises to balance the budget and cut taxes.
President Clinton's chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said the Administration was not interested in any plan to shore up the Medicare trust fund unless it also made comprehensive improvements in the nation's health care system and provided coverage to some of the 41 million Americans who now have no health insurance. 
 Mr. Panetta's comments escalate the political conflict over Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, just as the 1995 White House Conference on Aging is to begin. The White House and the Republicans both seem to be assuming that whoever first specifies cuts in Medicare will suffer severe political damage.
Mr. Panetta, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee, summoned reporters to his White House office this afternoon and declared that the Republicans had, "to some extent, painted themselves in a corner by promising what they can't deliver.
"They have basically promised that they could balance the budget by the year 2002, that they could provide tax cuts totaling about $345 billion over 7 years, $600 billion over 10 years," Mr. Panetta said. "And they are trying to find a way to pay for it. They basically know that they can't deliver on those first two promises without significant cuts in Medicare, along with other programs like Medicaid and education."
Miguel Casas, a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich, said the Speaker had no immediate response.
Mr. Gingrich initiated the latest round of wrangling over Medicare on Friday, when he sent a letter to the President asking how the Administration proposes to avoid the bankruptcy of Medicare. The trustees of Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, including four Administration officials, said last month that the trust fund would run out of money in 2002, well before significant numbers of baby boomers retire.
In his letter, Mr. Gingrich asked the President to present proposals to guarantee the solvency of Medicare and asked, "Does the Administration recommend tax increases?"
Mr. Gingrich said Medicare was in a financial crisis, and at a briefing on Capitol Hill today, a Republican aide to the House Ways and Means Committee said, "The Medicare problem can be solved independent of health care reform."
In a letter responding to the Speaker today, Mr. Panetta refused to answer Mr. Gingrich's questions.
The White House chief of staff told the Georgia Republican, "If you really want to work together on the Medicare trust fund, you must first pass a budget plan that fully specifies how you plan to balance the budget and pay for the proposed tax cuts." Such a course would be full of political peril for the Republicans, since it is widely assumed that they cannot balance the budget by 2002 unless they sharply curtail the growth of Medicare.
Almost all Americans 65 or older are enrolled in Medicare. The cost of the program, $159 billion in 1994, is growing more than 10 percent a year. Almost all of the uninsured are under 65.
Senate Republicans said last month that they intended to reduce projected Medicare spending by $250 billion, or 13 percent, over seven years, while House Republicans seek savings of $300 billion, or 16 percent.
In his letter today, Mr. Panetta told Mr. Gingrich, "You are essentially calling for the largest Medicare cut in history to pay for tax cuts for the well-off." Mr. Panetta said such changes in Medicare "would be completely unnecessary if you did not have to pay for a seven-year $345 billion tax cut that goes predominantly to well-off Americans."
Mr. Panetta told the Speaker that "significant cuts in Medicare and Medicaid outside the context of health care reform will not work."
If Republicans try to save money for Medicare by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals, Mr. Panetta said, the doctors and hospitals will simply increase their charges to other patients, including workers with private insurance. Such cost-shifting amounts to "a hidden tax on the health premiums of average Americans," he said.
Mr. Panetta also raised the specter of "a coercive Medicare program," suggesting that the Republicans might herd elderly people into health maintenance organizations, which limit patients' right to choose doctors and hospitals. Republicans asserted last year that such coercion was a central feature of Mr. Clinton's ambitious proposal to redesign the nation's health care system.
Mr. Panetta said that the Republicans, rather than frightening the elderly with apocalyptic visions of an insolvent Medicare program, should simply set forth their spending priorities as part of a budget resolution. Federal law stipulates that Congress should pass such a resolution by April 15, but neither house has met the deadline, Mr. Panetta noted.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Panetta's letter was disappointing. "The tone of this letter suggests that because the American people rejected the President's health care reform plan last year, the President has no interest in addressing the unique problems of Medicare this year," he said.
"You do not have to have comprehensive health care reform to solve the problems of Medicare," Mr. Fleischer added. "We get nervous when we hear the President talk about comprehensive health care reform. We think those are code words for raising taxes."
Mr. Panetta relished the prospect of making the Speaker squirm, just as Republicans enjoyed the political triumph they achieved in last year's health care debate.
Noting the Republicans' promise to separate Medicare from the rest of the budget, Mr. Panetta asked today: "Are they still committed to balancing the budget by 2002? Are they still committed to this huge tax cut for the wealthy? Are they still committed to doing Medicare cuts outside of health care reform? Where are they at? The only way we can get the answer to that, frankly, is when they present their budget resolution."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Forgo Opportunity to Expand on Recent Commerce-Clause Ruling in Gun Case

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today made a strategic, although perhaps only temporary, retreat from the constitutional battle lines it drew last week in a 5-to-4 decision over the power of Congress to regulate commerce.
Rather than use a new case to elaborate on last week's ruling that Congress lacked authority to ban possession of guns near schools, the Justices re-examined the facts in the new case and ruled unanimously that the Court did not have to address the question it took the case last October to decide: whether the Federal racketeering law applies to a local business that does not serve an interstate market and that has only an incidental effect on interstate commerce. 
 Instead, in a three-page unsigned opinion announced from the bench this morning by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court concluded that the business, an Alaskan gold mine, was directly and not incidentally engaged in interstate commerce because it brought equipment and employees to Alaska from other states.
This factual conclusion, treating the small, defunct mine as if it were the General Motors Corporation or any other interstate business, enabled the Court to put off deciding an issue on which the Justices are undoubtedly deeply divided: whether an economic activity that takes place in one state nonetheless "affects" interstate commerce enough to support the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.
The outcome was intriguing because the Court had labored for more than two months on this case only to produce such a minimal opinion. The case was argued on Feb. 27. It is possible that, with tempers still raw from the battle over United States v. Lopez, the gun case, a ruling to which the decision today did not refer, the Justices simply decided to disengage and step back from the issue rather than divert energy needed for other hard cases before the term ends in about two months.
Last week, in Lopez, the Court held that the possession of guns near schools did not affect interstate commerce. In fact, such possession was "in no sense an economic activity" at all, Chief Justice Rehnquist said in the majority opinion that invalidated a 1990 Federal law, the Gun-Free School Zones Act.
The case the Court decided today, United States v. Robertson, No. 94-251, posed the same question in the related but even more provocative context of the widely used Federal racketeering law. To establish a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, usually known as RICO, the Government must show as an initial matter that the business or "enterprise" accused of being racketeering affects or is engaged in interstate commerce.
Since the Alaskan gold mine in this case was by any definition an economic activity, the Court's expected focus was on how to evaluate its ties, admittedly slight, to the national economy. The case raised, more directly than in the Lopez case, the question of what standard the Court should use to determine an "effect" on interstate commerce.
The mine was opened by a former Federal prosecutor with money he had received from dealing in narcotics. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, overturned his racketeering conviction on the ground that "there was no evidence to show that the activities of the mine, or the proceeds therefrom, affected interstate commerce."
Today, the Supreme Court said that "we do not have to consider that point" because the hiring of seven out-of-state employees and the purchase of supplies from Los Angeles showed that the mine was "engaged in commerce." For that reason, the Government was not required to demonstrate that the mine's operations had any particular effect on the interstate economy, the unsigned opinion said.
But it is not unusual for the Court, after struggling over an issue, to then pull back to await further developments in the lower courts.
Three years ago, for example, the Court decided in Lee v. Weisman, a bitterly contested 5-to-4 ruling, that a public-school district violated the Constitution by inviting a clergyman to offer an invocation at a graduation ceremony. The Court then declined to take up a case raising the obvious follow-up question of whether students themselves could offer prayers at graduations. Another case on that issue reached the Court several months ago, and the Justices have yet to decide whether to hear it.
Today, the Court denied review in two criminal appeals that raised Commerce Clause questions related to the decisions last week and today. Both were appeals from convictions under the Federal arson law, which makes it a crime to engage in arson of "any building used in an activity that affects interstate or foreign commerce."
In one case, Ramey v. United States, No. 94-5755, a West Virginia man appealed his conviction for burning a trailer to express his disapproval of the interracial couple who lived there. The Government argued successfully in the lower courts that the trailer's receipt of electricity through an interstate power grid was sufficient to establish its connection to interstate commerce.
The second case, Moore v. United States, No. 94-642, was an arson-for-hire appeal from South Carolina. The lower courts upheld the Federal prosecution on the ground that the house that was burned was connected to interstate gas and telephone lines.
The lower Federal courts are in agreement on this use of the Federal arson law, a fact that was undoubtedly important to the Justices' decision not to take these cases. In addition, the South Carolina house was being marketed for sale in other states and had its mortgage and insurance with out-of-state companies. The Government argued that the case was an unsuitable candidate for review because these factors would have sustained Federal jurisdiction even if the gas lines and telephone connections were found insufficient.
There were also these developments at the Court today.
 
Liquor Advertisements
 The Court agreed to use a Rhode Island case to decide whether the First Amendment permits states to ban the advertising of liquor prices. The case, 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, No. 94-1140, will continue the Justices' active examination of commercial speech in the context of alcohol regulations; two weeks ago, the Court declared unconstitutional a Federal law that prohibited brewers from listing the alcohol content of their beer on the label.
Rhode Island, like a dozen other states, prohibits the advertising of liquor prices on the theory that price competition would increase consumption. The state enforces its law strictly, imposing fines for advertisements that use words like "Wow" or "Sale" even when no price is listed.
The law was challenged in a Federal court suit by two liquor stores, one in Johnston, R.I., and another that advertised to Rhode Island customers from over the state line in Massachusetts. The in-state liquor store, 44 Liquormart Inc., had earlier paid a $400 fine for an advertisement in The Providence Journal-Bulletin that did not list prices, but showed pictures of liquor bottles with the words "Thanksgiving Harvest" as well as peanut-shaped forms that contained the word "Wow."
The Federal District Court in Rhode Island declared the law unconstitutional in a 1993 ruling that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, overturned last year. The appeals court held that because the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition, gave the states broad authority to regulate liquor sales, courts should uphold any "reasonable" state regulation.
 
Jesus Portrait
 Without comment, the Court let stand a ruling by a Federal appeals court that a Michigan high school could not constitutionally display a portrait of Jesus in a central corridor outside the principal's office.
The portrait, a copy of a well-known painting by Warner Sallman called "Head of Christ," had hung in the Bloomingdale, Mich., school for 30 years until the school district removed it this spring on the order of Judge Benjamin F. Gibson of Federal District Court in Grand Rapids, Mich.
A high school student, Eric Pensinger, had sued to have the portrait removed before he graduated in 1993. One question for the Justices, had they accepted the school district's appeal, Bloomingdale Public Schools v. Washegesic, No. 94-1383, was whether the plaintiff's graduation made the case moot.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, upheld Judge Gibson's decision last November. In his ruling, Chief Judge Gilbert S. Merritt said that while the portrait would probably not offend most people, "a few see it as a government statement favoring one religious group and downplaying others" and "it is the rights of these few that the Establishment Clause protects." The school district argued in its Supreme Court appeal that the decision "demonstrates an unconstitutionally hostility towards religion."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Distorting Mirrors

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Twice within two weeks, Bill Clinton has fulfilled one of the major duties of any American President: to see clearly a danger to American peace, at home or abroad, to speak in public candor about it, and to start acting to meet it.
And twice Mr. Clinton has found himself denounced by important parts of the American society that is the target of the terrorist danger he sees. 
 In politics and journalism, the President's call to Americans to speak out against armed bigotry is being widely and deliberately twisted and distorted. In business, the automatic reactions to his decision to impose a trade and investment embargo against Iran have been to call it useless or harmful.
When the next bomb is exploded in the next Oklahoma City, or when the U.S. has to decide whether Iran's nuclear plants have to be bombed before they produce weapons or after, these attacks against Mr. Clinton will no longer be important. But, as we wait, they serve as museum-quality specimens of how mean-spirited and suicidal American establishments can be when they really put their minds to it.
After Oklahoma, Mr. Clinton said in several speeches that those Americans who did not agree with fellow citizens who exercised their constitutional rights to spread paranoia at least should use their own right to speak against them. Platitudes -- but important ones, since so few Americans do stand to speak against hate warriors of right or left.
In one speech, Mr. Clinton spoke a few words about some hate-mongering coming by radio, another piece of important obviousness. They pounced -- the commentators, columnists and Democratic and Republican politicians who would not forgive Mr. Clinton if he said that the sun would rise tomorrow.
Some of the fury came from people who found that the shoe fit. But what was startling, and rather disgusting, were the charges, repeated endlessly in the mainstream press and TV, that by daring to mention radio, the President was scapegoating and trying to stifle criticism of the Government.
In politics, members of both parties clucked at Mr. Clinton and assured us that the country would not be taken over by extremist nuts. They are like a doctor who tells a patient he has a painful, spreading disease but probably won't die, so forget it.
As for business, it generally takes the attitude that the U.S. can use the lever of economic power only when it is in its business interests to do so. Last year Mr. Clinton damaged himself badly by bowing to the China-trade lobby and reneging on his pledge to use tariffs as pressure for human interests in China and Tibet.
So the business reaction to the Iran embargo was perfect knee-jerk -- it will do no good because Iran will sell its oil elsewhere when American companies stop buying their current share of about 30 percent. The truth is that the embargo is of major importance.
It weakens foreign confidence in Iran as an investment market and strengthens the domestic opponents of the increasingly unpopular regime.
Used properly by Washington, it will be notice to our allies that they can expect American economic pressure to back off from trading with a terrorist, nuclear-bent Iran. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, says he will ask Congress to add on a boycott of foreign companies that do business with Iran. That should focus the attention of our allies on whether they prefer to do business with Iran or America.
Most important to American ethics, the embargo will end the contribution of American capitalism to Iran's drive to become a military nuclear power within 5 to 10 years, with Russian and Chinese help.
So the embargo should strengthen Mr. Clinton when he delivers the critical message to Mr. Yeltsin: The Russian decision to build a nuclear plant for Iran is a danger that the U.S. cannot tolerate.
The Clinton people naturally do not wish to push Mr. Yeltsin to the advantage of his Russian enemies. But that is not as great a danger as allowing Russia to sell Iran the power of nuclear blackmail or nuclear terrorism.
Bill Clinton has started the work of engaging with domestic and foreign terrorism, with allies abroad or without them. That's the story, and a lot more important than the distorting mirrors being held up to that work, so cynically, so destructively.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Wheat Prices Rise on Prediction Of China Deal, Later Confirmed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Wheat prices rose yesterday after the Agriculture Secretary predicted that the United State would approve a new wheat export package for China this week.
After the market closed, the Agriculture Department announced the deal, which allows China to purchase an additional one million tons of wheat at subsidized prices from the United States in the coming months. 
 Copper prices fell to a six-month low. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities gained 1.34 point, to 236.64.
Wheat prices gained after the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, told reporters on Friday that he saw a "favorable, positive announcement" on a third package of wheat for China.
Yesterday, the Agriculture Department said China might make subsidized wheat purchases until June 30 under the Export Enhancement Program. China has already purchased more than four million metric tons of United States wheat, about 12 percent of all wheat exports since the marketing year began July 1.
Wheat for July delivery rose 7.75 cents, to $3.5875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. On the Kansas City Board of Trade, wheat rose 8.25 cents, to $3.6275 a bushel.
The Kansas City and Chicago contracts are for the winter wheat crops that were planted last fall and will be harvested later this spring.
Spring wheat futures rose after heavy rain in the Midwest delayed planting and raised concern that this year's crop could suffer if it is planted too late in the season.
"It's cold, it's wet, and it's just been continual drizzling rain," said Mike Palmerino, senior meteorologist with the Weather Services Corporation of Lexington, Mass. "That's delaying them from getting the spring crops planted."
Spring wheat for July delivery rose 9.50 cents to settle at $3.6950 a bushel on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange.
Copper prices fell to a six-month low amid expectations that manufacturers would use less of the metal as the economy slows down.
While recent economic indicators have given mixed signals about the pace of manufacturing activity, an unmistakable slowdown in the automotive and housing industries has weakened demand for copper, traders said.
"I'd say it is the auto and housing industries that are doing it to the market," said Bernie Schilberg, executive vice president with Schilberg Integrated Metals in Willimantic, Conn.
Copper for July delivery dropped 1.9 cents, to $1.252 a pound on the Commodity Exchange of New York, its lowest price since Nov. 11.

HEADLINE: John C. Bennett, a Theologian Of Outspoken Views, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
The Rev. John C. Bennett, a theologian whose views on religion, politics and social policy influenced American thinking for decades, died on Thursday at a retirement community in Claremont, Calif. He was 92.
From 1963 to 1970, Mr. Bennett served as the 11th president of Union Theological Seminary in New York City. 
 "He was an early supporter of feminism, an ardent champion of the civil rights movement, an eloquent critic of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, a prophetic supporter of economic rights for minorities," the Rev. Holland L. Hendrix, current president of Union Theological Seminary, said yesterday. "All this far in advance of the popularity of these movements."
Mr. Bennett was a key figure in the ecumenical, or Christian unity, movement. He also made a lifelong study of Communism and repeatedly warned against turning the cold war into a religious crusade. By doing so, he said in 1960, "we make impossible the tolerance and humaneness which must yet come into international relations if there is to be a future for mankind."
Widely regarded as a quick, precise speaker and skilled debater, he dismissed the notion that his outspokenness was a violation of the separation of church and state. "Church-state relations in the United States have never meant that churchmen should separate their Christian ethics from political action," Mr. Bennett said in 1966.
That was a time in which he was growing increasingly disturbed about American involvement in Southeast Asia, so much so that he and Rabbi Abraham Heschel formed Clergy and Laity Concerned About the Vietnam War. But Mr. Bennett, ordained in the Congregational Church, was never a pacifist-above-all: in 1941, he opposed American isolationism in the face of Nazi conquests and was a co-founder with Reinhold Niebuhr of the magazine Christianity and Crisis.
John Coleman Bennett was born in Kingston, Ontario, the son of a Presbyterian minister. He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy and Williams College and did graduate studies at Oxford University in England and at Union Theological Seminary.
Though he was commonly referred to as "Dr. Bennett" because of his many honorary degrees ("five in one week from Catholic institutions," Dr. Hendrix recalled yesterday), Mr. Bennett never received a doctorate. He held various religious and teaching posts, joining the faculty of Union Theological Seminary, an interdenominational institution in Morningside Heights, in 1943. He became dean of the faculty in 1955 and was acting president for a brief time before assuming the presidency.
In 1966, Mr. Bennett was instrumental in forging an agreement between the seminary and Fordham University to pool professors, credits and library resources for religious studies. The agreement was believed to be the first contractual sharing of graduate resources in theology between a Protestant and Catholic institution.
In 1970, Mr. Bennett was one of three theologians invited by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to testify on the war in Southeast Asia. "More than any other theologian or moralist," Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota said shortly afterward, "John Bennett knows how to put issues into historical, legal and moral contexts which allow thinking politicians to make sound judgments."
Mr. Bennett's principal books were "Christian Ethics and Social Policy," published in 1946; "Christians and the State" (1948), and "Foreign Policy in Christian Perspective" (1966). In retirement, he continued to write and lecture and to condemn nuclear warfare.
Mr. Bennett's wife, Ann McGrew Bennett, died in 1986. He is survived by two sons, John, of Claremont, Calif., and William, of Portland, Me., and a daughter, Elizabeth Hemmer of Sacramento, Calif.

Umpires Will Return Tomorrow

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Faced with a thorny problem in Toronto and the escalating problems managers and players were having with replacement umpires, the American and National Leagues reached agreement with major league umpires yesterday, ending their four-month lockout and completing the return to work of everyone who works on the field.
The difference is that major league management has a deal with the umpires, where none exists with the players. 
 Donald Fehr, the players' union leader, said he sent a note to the league presidents, Gene Budig and Len Coleman, and Richie Phillips, the umpires' lawyer, congratulating them on their five-year agreement and "asking that they send us whatever magic potion they had; we'll see if it comes in the mail."
The umpires will return to work tomorrow with an agreement that will pay them 100 percent of their salaries for this season, even though they will have missed the first week and the season will be only 144 games instead of the usual 162.
"The umpires were neither penalized for the players' strike nor for the owners' lockout of the umpires," Phillips said after a news conference at a Manhattan law office. "That was critical as far as I was concerned to getting the deal done."
Under the terms of the new deal, the umpires' pay scale, which had ranged from $60,000 to $175,000 for those with 25 years in the majors, will range from $75,000 to $225,000 for umpires with 30 years in the majors. But that increase is not their only economic benefit.
All junior umpires will receive the same post-season bonus, $20,000, that all senior umpires have received, instead of the $10,000 that they had been getting. Pay for World Series umpires will rise from $5,000 to $17,500, and those who work the league championship series will get $15,000, instead of $5,000. The new division series will pay each umpire who works one $12,500. All-Star Game pay was doubled to $5,000.
Umpires will be able to work a division series and the World Series, meaning a possible post-season work pay of $30,000, instead of $5,000.
Management said that the overall economic increase for the five years was 16 percent, but individually, umpires could do much better. For example, Harry Wendelstedt, the only 30-year umpire in the majors, can earn a maximum of $282,500, instead of $206,000, a 37 percent increase. A rookie umpire, who always begins in the second year of the pay scale, can earn a maximum of $100,000, instead of $75,000, a 33 percent increase.
The leagues had been expected to maintain the lockout much longer than one week into the season, but once the Ontario Labor Board ruled last Friday that replacement umpires could not work games in Toronto, the pace of negotiations picked up considerably.
Not lost on the negotiators either were the very visible arguments managers and players were having with the replacements. Two runner-interference calls Sunday that resulted in the ejections of Managers Joe Torre of St. Louis and Tommy Lasorda of Los Angeles were particularly noticeable.
"I don't want to say the Toronto decision itself triggered the agreement or the performance of the scabs triggered it," Phillips said. "But I'd have to say those two factors were substantially contributory to the fact that the pace accelerated and we were able to get a deal."
Management representatives did not acknowledge that the replacement umpires or the Toronto decision had an impact on the talks or their negotiating position.
Coleman, the National League president, and Budig, the American League presidents, spoke only in positive terms of what it meant to have the dispute ended. Robert Kheel, the leagues' negotiator, spoke of the intensity of negotiations throughout the weekend.
Kheel said he and Phillips spoke by telephone Friday, Saturday and early Sunday, then met in his office beginning at about 8 o'clock Sunday evening. They reached a fundamental agreement, he said, by 3 A.M. yesterday, with some details still to be worked out.
The union's board of directors held two meetings via conference call, one at about 3 A.M., the other at 5:30 A.M. The board approved the agreement by a 9-0 vote, Phillips said. However, not all of the umpires approved it. Phillips said 3 umpires among the first 45 they called voted against the agreement.
Jerry Crawford, the umpires association president and a National League umpire, said the returning umpires expected to hear the typically negative reaction from fans and to have arguments with players.
"I'll be thrilled when I hear them boo because I'll feel right at home," he said of the fans.

Trade Boycott of Iran by U.S. Appears Unlikely to Succeed

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 1

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's trade boycott of Iran appeared today to be unlikely to succeed. Washington is not expected to be able to persuade Japan to follow suit and ban its oil companies from trading with Iran, industry executives said.
Nor are European countries expected to back the Administration's initiative, which came in reaction to attempts by Iran to develop nuclear weapons and its support for terrorism. Britain, for example, said today that it would impose no such restrictions on its oil companies. 
 For consumers, most experts interviewed today suggested that no oil crisis was looming, and the embargo was likely to fall short of the United States aim of choking off Iran's revenues.
Nevertheless, oil prices rose moderately on world markets in response to the United States action. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil in the June futures contract closed up 12 cents at $20.50 a barrel after soaring to $20.80, the highest since last August. Oil prices have gained $3 a barrel over the last six weeks amid tightening world supplies. June unleaded gasoline gained 0.76 cent, to 64.15 cents a gallon.
But Japanese oil industry officials said the United States was unlikely to persuade Japan to suspend daily purchases of 600,000 barrels of Iranian oil, although Washington has already made such a request.
If Japan were to join the boycott of Iranian oil, nearly 40 percent of Iran's oil exports of 2.5 million barrels a day would be blocked out of world markets, energy experts in Europe estimate.
A prolonged action would deprive Teheran of a third of its annual hard-currency revenues, close to $4 billion, which would be a painful blow to an Iranian economy that is already in the throes of fierce inflation and economic depression.
But absent the unlikely event that the Japanese would join the boycott and that European companies would agree not to replace American oil buyers, oil industry experts say that the chief effects of the Administration policy will be to create more hardships for United States businesses, as the places they can work in the Middle East are diminishing.
"The use of oil as a weapon is costly -- it can cut both ways," Nordine Ait-Laoussine, a former oil mininster of Algeria, said in a telephone interview today. "At the moment it is American oil companies who cannot work in Libya, or Iraq or Iran." But companies from other countries are working there. "and Iran will discount its oil to sell it." he added.
Still, given the precarious balance between oil supplies and consumption, prices could rise further as a result of the Administration's ban.
American companies have been barred from buying oil from Libya since 1986 and from Iraq since 1990. Further, Russian production has dropped steadily in the last four years to six million barrels a day at present from 12 million barrels a day in 1991.
"There is a limit to how much oil you can keep out of the market without pushing prices up," said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in Manhattan, in a telephone interview. "It's like a Catch-22 situation. The more successful U.S. policy is, the price of oil is likely to increase by several dollars."
Iranian oil has been effectively banned from the United States since 1987, but American companies bought $4 billion worth of Iranian crude last year and refined it for sale abroad. The President's ban will halt that.
International oil companies said the overall impact of the American boycott would become clearer after 30 days, when the executive order takes force.
"If the Americans are very, very firm in their pressure, it will create real difficulties for Iran in dealing with third parties, too," said the president of a major oil trading company based in Monte Carlo, which ships a substantial amount of Iranian crude oil. "No one wants to defy America today."
Third parties, like independent oil traders and oil shipping companies, will play a major role, for Iran is expected to try to bypass the boycott and resell oil through them to America and other markets, oil industry experts in Europe said, and consequently the United States might have to put into place a heavy policing apparatus to which Japan and Europe would be unwilling to contribute.
To ease any supply crisis, some Europeans say, the United States will face renewed pressure from Russia, China and France to end United Nations sanctions that ban Iraqi oil sales.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
British investors have concerns, but good profits may allay them.

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
JUST before the Federal Reserve reversed course and set American interest rates on an upward path 15 months ago, the London stock market hit a record high. With Britain and the United States at similar stages in the economic cycle, it was not surprising that shares in London, as on Wall Street, then went into a swoon.
Wall Street has since recovered, with the stock market in the last few months surging to new highs on a regular basis. But London, though perkier than it was a year ago, remains well below its highs, afflicted by a variety of worries. Among the market's most immediate concerns are the likelihood of a drubbing for the governing Conservative Party in local elections on Thursday and an increase by the Bank of England in official interest rates by half a point, to 7.25 percent, on Friday. The inflation outlook has not been helped by a sharp decline in the pound against the German mark. 
 Longer term, investors in British stocks remain unconvinced that the Government will be able to keep inflation in check, especially with the Conservatives under intense political pressure to reduce taxes and keep interest rates as low as possible in advance of the next general election, which must be held within two years. Most analysts expect interest rates to keep rising through next year.
On Monday, The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed at 3,220.40, 8.5 percent below its high in February 1994 of 3,520.3 but 12 percent above its low last year of 2,876.6.
The rest of Britain's economic fundamentals have been nearly ignored by the market. Last year's growth of 3.9 percent is expected to moderate to around 3 percent this year and next as higher interest rates act as a brake. The budget deficit and unemployment both continue to decline, and Britain has nearly wiped out its trade deficit on the back of increasing exports.
With the economy cooking along at its best rate in decades, corporate earnings are surging, seemingly giving investors plenty of reason to buy stocks. But the great question facing the London market is whether investors will put aside their other concerns to bet on continued strong industrial performance, giving the market a chance to rally.
"We're pretty positive on the U.K., and principally on the strength of the corporate sector," said Richard Davidson, a strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. "We're going through a period of excellent cash flow, dividend and earnings growth, but they've been largely ignored by a market caught up in worries about inflation and politics, both of which are overdone at this stage."
Mr. Davidson said British companies were enjoying an average of 15 percent profit growth this year, dividend growth of 8 percent and cash flow growth of 10 percent -- all on top of strong gains last year, and with solid prospects in store for the next several years as well.
Moreover, he and other analysts said, next week's likely rate increase and the possibility of even higher rates and increased inflationary pressures are already priced into the market.
To a certain extent, the British markets are suffering from global factors. The flow of money from the United States into international markets has fallen off, and much of what continues is moving into more cyclically sensitive markets in continental Europe to take advantage of strong economic rebounds there.
"The medium-term outlook is healthy without being exciting," said Joe Rooney, a strategist at Lehman Brothers International in London. "With bond markets in the range they're in at the moment and with good earnings and dividend growth continuing to come through, we would see the market moving to 3,400. As we progress through each quarter the trading range will be shifted upward as growth is digested by the market, until we reach a point where there's a shift in long-term interest rates."

HEADLINE: Income, Savings and Spending Rose in March

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
With the aid of farming subsidies, the income of Americans rose more strongly in March than it had in two months, and spending nearly kept pace.
The Commerce Department said today that income climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in March, up slightly from February's increase, while spending rebounded from its first decline in nearly a year, rising by five-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Analysts said the report suggested moderate growth and was a sign that the consumer-driven economic expansion had not run out of steam.
"The consumer is still alive and well and certainly not going into a shell," Robert Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said. "The consumer isn't shutting off the spending valve entirely. It's encouraging as we head into the second quarter."
Americans are also saving at a higher rate than in more than two years, and that could signal more spending ahead.
In another report, the Commerce Department said weakness in housing brought March construction spending to its lowest level in four months. Construction spending dropped four-tenths of 1 percent, marking the first time in nearly three years that it has fallen in three straight months.
Also, the ability of a typical American family to buy an existing home dipped in the first quarter as mortgage rates hit a recent peak, the National Association of Realtors said.
In another sign of an economic slowdown, the National Association of Purchasing Management said American manufacturing grew modestly in April, and price increases for materials eased considerably. The group's closely watched index has advanced steadily during the last 20 months, but the rate of growth has slipped this year.
That is in line with a Government report issue on Friday that its broadest gauge of economic activity slowed dramatically in the first three months of this year. The gross domestic product rose 2.8 percent at an annual rate, a little more than half the growth rate of the fourth quarter last year, which was 5.1 percent.
The Commerce Department reported today a revised spending figure for February to show a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent, in contrast to a previously estimated rise of one-tenth of 1 percent. The February spending decline was the first since April 1994.
Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, has tailed off since last year's spree.
"We assume that second-quarter spending will be a bit stronger, but April was probably about flat," economists for Merrill Lynch & Company said in a statement.
Analysts credit the slowdown at least in part to the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates seven times in the 12 months ended Feb. 1.
The March increase in personal income made it the fourth straight gain after being unchanged in November. The last time income rose more rapidly was in January, when it climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent. Farm subsidies in March and auto industry bonuses the month before helped inflate the total.
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component of income, increased just two-tenths of 1 percent in March and four-tenths of 1 percent in February. Disposable income -- income after taxes -- climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in March after gaining five-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.
The combination of incomes and spending meant that the savings rate of Americans -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- rose to 5.5 percent in March from 5.4 percent the previous month. The savings rate is the highest since December 1992, when it was 8.3 percent.
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes and spending both rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March.
Income rose to just under $6 trillion in March and spending was at $4.79 trillion.

HEADLINE: Cy Endfield, 80; Blacklisted Director

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 1

 BODY:
Cy Endfield, a director who was blacklisted in the United States before moving to Britain and filming the bloody epic "Zulu," died on April 16 at his home in Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, England. He was 80.
Mr. Endfield was born in Scranton, Pa., and studied at Yale University before trying his hand at theater in New York City and Montreal. In 1940, he went to Hollywood. His first film was "Inflation," a 15-minute piece commissioned by the Office of War Information but rejected on grounds that it was anti-capitalist. 
 After serving in the Army in World War II, Mr. Endfield wrote for radio and television while working on a series of low-budget features. A recurring left-wing slant to his movies drew the attention of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which in 1951 put him on the Hollywood blacklist.
Mr. Endfield moved to Britain, and worked anonymously to avoid distribution problems in the United States. The first film to carry his real name again was "Hell Drivers" (1958), a violent thriller starring Stanley Baker.
Mr. Endfield made 21 films in all. The best known was "Zulu" (1964), based on a battle between British soldiers and the Zulu army in South Africa in 1879.
This big-budget epic featured Mr. Baker and Michael Caine as two rival army officers forced by the battle to work together, and it set the relatively unknown Mr. Caine on the path to stardom.
Mr. Endfield's other movies included the fantasy "Mysterious Island" (1961) and "Sands of the Kalahari" (1965), starring Susannah York.
He is survived by his wife, Maureen, and two daughters.

HEADLINE: Billions Suffering Needlessly, Study Says

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
In spite of a few notable health gains, billions of people worldwide suffer needlessly from disease and preventable illnesses because of poverty and a lack of access to health services, the World Health Organization said today.
In its first annual survey of global health, the organization said that more than two billion people, about 40 percent of the world's population, suffered varying degrees of sickness at any one time. Much of this disease and illness, the report said, is preventable and tied to widening gaps in health, education and access to care between the rich and the poor. 
 Officials said poverty was the greatest underlying cause of disease, suffering and death, with more than one-fifth of the world's 5.6 billion people living under conditions that provide little or no resources for preventing or treating their illnesses. More than half the world's people cannot get the most essential drugs and about a third of the world's children are undernourished, the organization said.
The report, released simultaneously in Geneva at the 48th World Health Assembly and at a briefing here, noted that life expectancy around the world had increased to 65 years from 61 years in the last 25 years. In other promising news, infant mortality has fallen by 25 percent in the last 15 years and polio has been eradicated in the Western Hemisphere in the last three years. But such gains could easily be reversed, officials said.
"For many millions of people for whom survival is a daily battle, the prospect of a longer life may seem more like a punishment than a prize," Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, the W.H.O. Director General, said.
Dr. David Brandling-Bennett, deputy director of the Pan-American Health Organization, part of the world health agency, said in an interview that increased life expectancy through past health gains was now presenting new problems.
"The millions of lives that have been saved and the better chance of survival have led to an increase in the number of older persons throughout the world, many of whom develop heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other chronic diseases," he said. "Unfortunately, developing countries are poorly equipped to deal with these new diseases."
Dr. Brandling-Bennett said the new annual health survey would be used as a benchmark against which to gauge future progess against the world's ills. He said international efforts were under way to eradicate polio, measles and tropical guinea worm disease by the year 2000, as well as eliminate leprosy and childhood tetanus.
The report said life expectancy and the health conditions related to it were closely linked to poverty and each country's per capita gross national product, with the poorest countries having almost half the life expectancy of the richest. Life expectancy has reached 78 years in Japan, Iceland and Sweden and 76 in the United States. But the survey said it was only 43 in Uganda and would probably decrease there and in the Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, Congo and Zambia over the next few years because of little money to spend on health.
The report said ischemic heart disease, caused by obstructed blood vessels, was the deadliest disease in the world, killing 4.3 million people in 1993. The next deadliest is acute lower respiratory infections, mainly pneumonia, in children under 5. The infections killed 4.1 million people in 1993, the latest year for which data are available.
The next greatest killers are cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, which killed 3.9 million people in 1993; diarrhea in children under 5, which killed 3 million; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2.9 million; tuberculosis, 2.7 million; malaria, 2 million; measles, 1.2 million and heart failure and other cardiac diseases, 1.1 million.
Big health challenges for the world include AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis, the report said.
More than 13 million adults were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1994 and another 6,000 people are added to the list each day, the report said. By the year 2000, the cumulative worldwide total of infection by H.I.V. could reach 30 million to 40 million, with 10 million developing AIDS by that time, it said.
Other sexually transmitted diseases are rising, with 250 million new cases reported each year and particularly afflicting people 20 to 24 years old. Rates of these diseases are rising worldwide, even in developing countries, reflecting among the young a lack of education and the means of protecting themselves, officials said.

HEADLINE: Times Mirror Goes Outside For New Chief

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company, the media conglomerate that publishes The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, made a surprise announcement this evening that it had named Mark H. Willes, the vice chairman of General Mills Inc., its next president and chief executive.
The appointment of Mr. Willes was remarkable for several reasons. He has no prior experience in the media business and has not been well acquainted with the Chandler family, which still controls Times Mirror. Within the tightly knit newspaper world, a top position is rarely filled by an outsider. 
 In addition, there had been a competition for the top job between two executive vice presidents of the company. It was expected that one of them would be chosen.
Times Mirror, which is based here, is one of the country's pre-eminent media groups. But it is struggling like many of its rivals to find its place in the burgeoning world of electronic media and decided that it needed a financial expert at the top.
Curtis A. Hessler, who is an executive vice president in charge of Times Mirror's electronic media operations, and Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, were regarded as the front-runners to succeed Robert F. Erburu, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 later this year. Now the two executives have been passed over, which is raising concerns within the company that one or both might ultimately leave.
The company had planned to introduce Mr. Willes, who is 53, at its annual meeting on Tuesday, but it rushed out the announcement this evening as word of the appointment spread. He will become president and chief executive on June 1, and will assume the additional title of chairman on June 1, 1996, according to the company's announcement.
Mr. Willes spent 15 years with Minneapolis-based General Mills, the $8 billion consumer products company known for its breakfast cereals and other prepared foods.
"He brings a strong focus on financial performance, marketing excellence and quality," Mr. Erburu said in the statement.
Referring to Mr. Willes's previous service with the Federal Reserve, Mr. Erburu said, "His broad interests and prior public service career will enhance his leadership of a major media company." Mr. Willes became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis at the age of 35, serving from 1977 to 1980. He was with the Federal Reserve system for 11 years.
Mr. Willes, a native of Salt Lake City, received his bachelor's degree from Columbia College, New York, and a Ph.D. from the Columbia Graduate School of Business in 1967.
He will enter the company at a critical time. While Times Mirror is a powerful force in Southern California, it was hurt by the region's weak economy of recent years.
Times Mirror separated its substantial cable television interests from the publishing operations last year by combining the cable holdings with those of Cox Communications in a $2.3 billion deal. Times Mirror had revenue of $3.35 billion last year.

HEADLINE: Washington Approves Pequot Annexing of Land

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 1

 BODY:
Federal authorities said today that the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe in Ledyard, owner of the Foxwoods Casino, can legally annex into its reservation 247 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to the casino, thus removing the property from local control and taxation.
The decision, announced late in the day by the United States Department of the Interior, was immediately condemned by local officials in the communities around the casino and by Connecticut's Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, who said he would appeal the decision. 
 The Mayor of Ledyard, Joseph A. Lozier, said that local opposition to the annexation, which has raged in the southeast corner of the state since the tribe filed its application in 1993, was partly about taxes and zoning, but also about power.
The Pequots, a tiny tribe of less than 400 people, have purchased thousands of acres of land in Connecticut, and announced ambitious economic development plans ranging from a theme park to high-technology manufacturing using the proceeds of their gambling and hotel businesses. Specific plans for the 247-acre site are unclear, however. Tribe offices were closed for the day when the decision was announced.
A statement issued by the counsel to the Interior Department, John J. Duffy, also left a number of jurisdictional questions unanswered. The statement said that the towns around the casino "will not lose any tax revenue from this decision" because the Pequots had agreed to make voluntary payments in lieu of taxes, and that the land could not be further developed by the tribe without further Federal approval, including an environmental review.
Mr. Blumenthal said he doubted that those rules could legally be imposed. Once lands are designated Federal trust property for use by an Indian tribe, Mr. Blumenthal said, all development decisions are up to the tribe.

HEADLINE: Councilman Feels Fallout Over His Changed Stand

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Life on New York's City Council rarely affords any of its 51 members a chance to break from the pack and establish a political reputation that extends beyond the legislator's own district.
Last week, Guillermo Linares did just that. And he's been paying the price ever since. 
 In the days since Mr. Linares switched sides and cast the deciding vote in favor of a controversial plan for a huge Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem, the Hispanic Councilman from Washington Heights has been the target of harsh attacks from many of his constituents.
Although he has been lauded by some elected officials who say he acted on conscience, many critics feel he forsook the very merchants in his heavily Dominican district whose cause he has championed in his five years in office.
Those holding that view were very much in evidence yesterday at an angry press conference held on the steps of City Hall by owners of small businesses and bodegas. They gathered as much to condemn the plans to build the $12 million supermarket as to assail the 44-year-old Mr. Linares as a "traitor," "back-stabber" and "sellout." Others protested outside his Washington Heights office yesterday.
The vote last week of the Manhattan Borough Board, which is composed largely of the City Council members from Manhattan, was considered the most crucial step in getting the Pathmark project under way.
Before Mr. Linares changed his mind, opponents predicted confidently that they had the votes to kill a project that had caused deep divisions between Hispanic residents of East Harlem and their black neighbors. The ethnic makeup of Mr. Linares's Washington Heights district is 44 percent Hispanic, 33 percent non-Hispanic white and 23 percent black.
Until now, Mr. Linares, New York's first Dominican-American elected official, has been widely heralded as a fresh voice of the emerging Dominican community in New York. He has been hailed as a healer and peacemaker, taking to the streets to calm unrest after he fatal shooting in 1992 of Jose Luis Garcia by a police officer in Washington Heights.
Now, being the subject of such bitter protest and anger -- most strongly by some Hispanic officials and bodega owners -- has been particularly wrenching for Mr. Linares.
"This has been a very, very intense period for me," he said, in an interview yesterday. "I knew, as I made this decision, that people would react very strongly because their expectations would not come through. But I had to make the decision that I thought was in the best interest of everyone."
A soft-spoken man who speaks in slow, deliberate cadences, Mr. Linares said he feels at peace with his decision, through he acknowledges it may have cost him political support and even some friendships.
In addition, he and Council officials say he has received some threats. "I'm not going to walk down the street alone right now," he said in an interview.
Plans for the store have been the subject of intense political, ethnic and business feuding in recent months. Opponents, many of them Hispanic, insisted that the huge store would drive small neighborhood shops out of business, and they criticized the government subsidies called for in the plan. But the proponents, most of them black, said the new store would create jobs and finally bring the selection and low prices of a supermarket to a minority neighborhood.
Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Councilwoman from the Upper West Side of Manhattan and a supporter of the Pathmark project, called Mr. Linares' vote "sensible" and said he "was genuinely concerned about the future of economic development in distressed areas." She added, "He believed if this market was defeated, it would jeopardize future development."
But Antonio Pagan, a Councilman from Manhattan's Lower East Side, said he worked for months with Mr. Linares on a strategy to defeat the Pathmark project. "He is a man with no word, a sellout," Mr. Pagan said. "He is a someone who betrays and lies to his colleagues. He has violated one of the principal rules of Latino social conduct: that your word is gold or you have no soul. It was not an act of courage. It was an act of cowardice."
Others contend that Mr. Linares must have been offered some compelling inducement to change his mind.
"Everybody who knows him was surprised," said Alfredo Rodriguez, the owner of two Associated Food Stores in East Harlem and a longtime friend who had worked with Mr. Linares to attempt to defeat the Pathmark plan. "I just don't understand it."
Mr. Linares said he was persuaded just hours before the vote that if the project was shelved it would choke off, for years, plans for any future economic development either in East Harlem or any other depressed area in New York City.
"The killing of a project like this sends the worst message you would want," Mr. Linares said. "All along, this was difficult for me because I recognized the importance of the bodegas in our communities. But that should not impede opportunities for job creation."
It is impossible to determine how lasting the political impact will be. But many storeowners said that they had been financial supporters of Mr. Linares in his past campaigns and that they will never contribute again.
Reflecting on his vote, Mr. Linares said yesterday that "the only anguish I have is that there were friends that were involved in this with me and that they probably feel that I did not really come through for them. But I'm very, very firm that I did the appropriate thing."
Then he added: "I do what I think is right. Then I live with the consequences."

Grace Names New Chief, But Questions Remain
The board of W. R. Grace elected a former chairman and chief executive of American Cyanamid, Albert J. Costello, to succeed J. P. Bolduc, the Grace chief executive who resigned after a vicious struggle.
But analysts suggested that Mr. Costello's election may have raised more questions than it answered and that the extraordinary events that have shaken Grace in the last two months may not be resolved. Wall Street was not cheered by the news, pushing Grace shares down $1.375, to $52.25. D4.

HEADLINE: 2 Big Utilities Plan to Merge In Deal Valued at $6 Billion

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Two large and strong utilities in the Midwest, the Northern States Power Company and the Wisconsin Energy Corporation, said yesterday that they would merge into a new company with a combined market value of about $6 billion.
Analysts said the deal, which could put pressure on other utilities to seek partners, showed how quickly the industry was preparing for an era of fierce competition. 
 The merger would create a new company called the Primergy Corporation, which would be the nation's 10th-largest utility owned by investors. The deal is subject to approval by state and Federal agencies.
Under the merger plan, the shareholders of both utilities would trade their shares for shares in the new company. The current shareholders of Northern States, which is based in Minneapolis, would own about half the new entity, as would the shareholders of Wisconsin Energy, which is based in Milwaukee.
Northern States employs 7,000 people and provides electric power to 1.4 million customers and natural gas for 400,000 clients in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Wisconsin Energy, with 5,000 employees, provides electric power to 945,000 customers and natural gas to 350,000 client in areas of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula.
Analysts said the utilities, which offer low-cost power and have reduced staff, would cut more jobs and become even stronger as a single company. The utilities said they expected to achieve savings of about $2 billion over 10 years.
The merger would leave the companies in a strong position to defend their turf and perhaps raid that of other utilities when deregulation took hold, analysts said.
Some states, including California, are considering allowing customers to bypass their local utilities and buy power directly from outsiders. Large industrial customers across the country have already received reductions in rates from their current utilities and want to be able to buy inexpensive power from outside sources. And the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is considering making the nation's power transmission system more accessible to independent producers.
In the Primergy deal, Northern States and Wisconsin Energy would keep their headquarters and operate under their current names. The holding company would be based in Minneapolis.
The shareholders of Northern States would get 1.626 shares of the new company for each current share, while the holders of Wisconsin Energy would get one share of Primergy for each current share.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shares of Northern States rose $1, to $45.25, and those of Wisconsin Energy rose 75 cents, to $28.50.
"This merger gets us in front of the changing energy marketplace," said Richard A. Abdoo, the chairman, president and chief executive of Wisconsin Energy.
Mr. Abdoo, who is 51, will become vice chairman of the new company when it is formed and chief executive in 1998.
The chairman, president and chief executive of Northern States, James J. Howard, said the merger would let the companies offer a modest reduction in rates for their retail customers and freeze rates for customers through 2000.
"By doing that, we will help our communities attract new business, add jobs and strengthen the economy in our combined service territory," he said.
Mr. Howard, who is 59, will be chairman of the merged company and chief executive until 1998.
By keeping down costs, utilities like Primergy could put more pressure on states with higher-cost power, like California, New York and New Jersey, to allow more access to cheaper electricity. Low-cost companies could also prompt some higher-cost utilities to seek mergers.
Barry Abramson, a Prudential Securities analyst, said that large utilities in the Northeast might eventually have to find merger partners in order to compete, but they would have a difficult time doing so because they have high rates and costs.
The merger of Northern States and Wisconsin Energy would form a company with annual revenue of $4.2 billion and assets of more than $10 billion.
Mr. Abramson said that with the new company's annual dividend of $1.62 a share, the shareholders of Northern States would get the same payment level that they receive now, while the holders of Wisconsin Energy would see an increase of about 10 percent in their dividend.
The companies said they expected to complete the deal by the fourth quarter of 1996.

HEADLINE: The Iran Embargo

 BODY:
A United States trade embargo is not a foreign-policy weapon to be casually employed. Whether or not it has a crippling effect on the target country, an embargo is a powerful symbol of Washington's ire, and should be used only against countries that threaten American security and principles. Iran fits that definition.
President Clinton made the right call when he followed his foreign-policy advisers rather than his economic advisers and imposed a complete ban on trade and investment with Teheran. Mr. Clinton acted to punish the Iranian Government's open support for terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Besides its continuing death threats against the novelist Salman Rushdie, Teheran has been implicated in the murders of Iranian political figures abroad. Iran is also believed to be behind deadly car bombings from Beirut to Buenos Aires. 
 In addition, American intelligence agencies are convinced that Iran, which sits on more energy resources than its civilian economy will ever need, is pursuing reactor and other nuclear technologies from Russia and China to develop atomic weapons. Curbing international terrorism and nuclear proliferation are rightly among the Clinton Administration's highest foreign-policy priorities.
Until now, European oil-consuming countries and nuclear suppliers like Russia and China have been unwilling to restrain their commerce with Iran. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts not backed by economic pressure have done little to change Iran's dangerous behavior. Under these circumstances, the United States is justified in acting on its own and encouraging others to follow its example.
The embargo will end purchases of Iranian oil by American companies for resale overseas, which last year amounted to $4 billion, or one-fifth of Iran's oil revenues. American companies were already barred from importing Iranian oil. The President's executive order will also halt remaining United States exports to Iran. By barring the trade of American companies, Washington may have a chance of persuading its allies to apply economic pressures of their own.
The Administration also acted to head off efforts by Senator Alfonse D'Amato to legislate a wider ban that would have attempted to punish foreign companies doing business with Iran. This would needlessly antagonize the same allied governments Washington is trying to persuade to join the embargo.
Imposing sanctions that major allies are likely to ignore always runs the risk of cheapening the credibility of sanctions in general. But the dangers from Iran are sufficiently great to override this risk. The Administration should now strengthen the case for other countries to join the embargo by spelling out the minimal steps Iran must take to get the sanctions lifted.
Over the past 28 months the Clinton Administration has been extremely reluctant to impose international trade penalties for political purposes. Iran's support for terrorism and drive for nuclear weapons make it an appropriate exception.

HEADLINE: REBEL SERBS SHELL CROATIAN CAPITAL

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, May 2

 BODY:
Rebel Serbs attacked the Croatian capital today, firing rockets that slammed into a central square here and spread death and mayhem among people strolling in the warm spring air.
The city authorities said five people were killed and 121 were hurt when three rocket-propelled cluster bombs hit the downtown area and another six hit the southern outskirts near the Zagreb airport. The United States Ambassador, Peter Galbraith, confirmed that rockets tipped with shrapnel-spraying cluster bombs had caused the damage. One landed about 100 yards from his Embassy. 
 The rocket attack, which shook buildings throughout the center of the city, came in response to an offensive begun yesterday by the Croatian Government that today captured most of a pocket of land held by separatist Serbs in western Slavonia, about 75 miles southeast of the capital.
The Croatian attack the day before shattered a "permanent cease-fire" signed last year by Croatia and the rebel Serbs, who went to war in 1991 to resist joining a newly independent Croatia that they perceived as threatening. The pocket represents a small part of the 30 percent of Croatia controlled by Serbs since the 1991 war.
The Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, announced today that the offensive ended after the surrender of Okucani, a town where many of the 13,000 separatist Serbs in the enclave live. "The action of the Croatian police and army is closed," he said.
But it appeared more likely that the ramifications of Croatia's flagrant violation of the cease-fire, in the largest offensive since 1991, were just beginning to unfold.
While he seems to have secured a significant, if small, military victory and demonstrated that the Croatian Army is growing stronger, President Tudjman has angered the United Nations and set back negotiations with the Serbs to the point where it will be difficult to revive them.
The Serbs made their anger abundantly clear in the rocket attack today. The charred wreckage of several cars could be seen smoldering shortly after one rocket hit central Strossmayer Square. Windows along the square were smashed, sidewalks were littered with rocket fragments and sirens pierced the air as ambulances responded.
The abrupt, direct impact of a war more often seen on television screens in the Croatian capital appeared to stun a city whose growing number of new cars and boutiques have given it an increasingly western European feel.
Police officers cordoned off a wide area and the city authorities closed schools for 48 hours. An eerie silence descended for several hours on central streets amid apparent incredulity that rockets could fall out of a clear blue sky on a European city of one million people. One rocket hit a school near the Defense Ministry, and several children were injured.
While Bosnia's capital has been devastated by three years of fighting and Serbia's has been squeezed by international sanctions, Zagreb had become a relative oasis from the physical misery of the Balkan conflict. This normally secure city is used by the United Nations, foreign diplomats and others as the main access point for relief, peacekeeping and mediation missions in the region.
It was the Croatian capital's first taste of real war since it was bombarded by the Yugoslav Air Force in 1991.
"Sending a rocket full of cluster bombs into a European capital is a repugnant act clearly intended to kill many people," Mr. Galbraith said. "It's an act that can only be intended to provoke a full-scale war." But he added that the United States had warned Croatia that such attacks might occur in response to the Croatian offensive in western Slavonia.
Later in the day, the United States evacuated about 35 people from Zagreb, mostly dependents of American Embassy staff and nonessential personnel.
The Orkan rockets, a type manufactured in the former Yugoslavia, were apparently fired from multiple-rocket launchers from the closest positions held by Serbs, about 25 miles south of the capital near the town of Petrinja.
Prior to the outburst of fighting during the last few days, the Serbs had seemed ready to engage in a slow diplomatic process aimed at settling their differences with Croatia. Those negotiations had secured a measure of economic cooperation, including joint use of an oil pipeline from the Adriatic coast.
The future of the recently revamped United Nations peacekeeping mission to the country now appears in doubt, and the Serbs have made clear through the attack on Zagreb -- and another more limited one on Karlovac -- that their response to the offensive will not be passive.
"There is a great chance that a high price will be paid by Croatia in terms of our overall effort to achieve a peaceful settlement," said Fred Eckhard, the chief United Nations spokesman in Zagreb. Negotiations had been set back by "many, many months," he added.
The United Nations is in the process of cutting its force in Croatia from 12,000 to 8,750. To satisfy Croatia's concerns, the United Nations had committed itself to redeploying some of those soldiers in a way that might prevent the Serbs of Croatia from getting arms from Serbia and Serb-held parts of Bosnia. With the Serbs enraged by the Croatian attack, such a deployment now appears virtually impossible.
Prime Minister John Major said today that Britain would withdraw from the United Nations forces in the former Yugoslavia if the trend toward a wider war in Bosnia and Croatia continues.
The United Nations Security Council issued a statement late on Monday demanding that Croatia "put an end immediately to the military offensive launched by its forces in the area of western Slavonia."
The Security Council also urged the Serbs and Croatia to "comply with the existing cease-fire agreement," suggesting that the Croats should withdraw to the front lines prior to the offensive. Such a withdrawal appears very unlikely, given the huge popular enthusiasm stirred here by the Croatian military success.
Using tanks and MIG-21 fighters acquired despite an arms embargo on all countries of the former Yugoslavia, more than 3,000 Croatian troops stormed into the Serbian enclave in a pincer movement from the east and west early on Monday, apparently meeting scant resistance.
By today, they appeared to have secured the entire length of the E-70 highway that runs through the pocket and was the declared target of the offensive. The Croats also marched into Okucani.
The road was reopened last December as part of the economic accord between Croats and Serbs. A violent incident on the highway last Friday night in which a Serb was stabbed and three Croatian motorists were then killed by gunfire was the immediate catalyst for the raid.
But the capture of the road appears to have been no more than a pretext for the Croats. The taking of Okucani suggested that the real aim was to capture the whole enclave, which bulges into Croatian territory from Serbian-controlled northern Bosnia. The Serbs' control of the enclave has long made it difficult to travel between Zagreb and the important central Croatian industrial city of Slavonksi Brod.
At least 5,000 Serbian refugees poured southward from of the western Slavonia pocket over a bridge on the Sava River into areas of northern Bosnia controlled by Serbs, United Nations officials said. About 600 armed Serbs in the town of Pakrac surrendered after the fall of Okucani. There were also unconfirmed reports of heavy casualties near Okucani.
The fate of Serbs remaining in the enclave was unclear.
President Tudjman promised that "all Croatian citizens of Serbian descent" would be guaranteed full respect of their "human and civil rights" -- something that did not happen when Croatian Government forces massacred Serbs during attacks on Serbian enclaves near the Adriatic coast in 1993.
The President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, condemned the Croatian offensive as "a criminal act against a civilian population and a flagrant attack on comprehensive efforts aimed at establishing peace in the region."
But Mr. Milosevic also condemned the rocket attack on Zagreb by Serbs. "Yugoslavia condemns the bombing of cities and casualties among the civilian population," he said. "The bombing of cities by either side and suffering by the civilian population must be most severely condemned."
Mr. Milosevic, who set in motion the dissolution of Yugoslavia with a brand of aggressive Serbian nationalism that destabilized the former federation, has recently sought to portray himself as a moderate man and a peacemaker. But he has not been prepared to recognize Bosnia or Croatia, despite mounting pressure from Western governments.
The Serbs now appear certain to seek a withdrawal of the Croats to the front lines that prevailed prior to the offensive before any cease-fire is signed. President Tudjman seems equally certain to reject such a request, setting the stage for what may be a tense stalemate, a slow drift toward increased fighting or, perhaps, a rapid plunge into another war.

HEADLINE: A Bond Fund Strategy Too Clever by Half;
Fidelity Stumbles in an Attempt to Repeat Its Success With Stock Funds

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
It has been about a year since Fidelity Investments, the country's biggest and most powerful mutual fund company, announced to the world that it was on the way to becoming as big a force in bond funds as it was in the stock funds that had made it famous.
And Fidelity said it was using the same method that had worked so well in stocks: spend lots of money to hire the best and the brightest money managers, do the most thorough research and use the considerable financial muscle of the company to dominate the markets in which it invests. 
 A year later that plan has ended in disaster. Many of the young managers, along with their boss, have left, been forced out or been reassigned. Thousands of Americans who believed in them and in Fidelity suffered huge losses from Fidelity's heavy bets in Mexico and in the complex securities known as derivatives. Many investors pulled their money -- billions of dollars -- from the company's funds.
Of course, last year was one of the worst ever for almost everyone who owned a bond or bond mutual fund. Lots of fund companies stumbled by betting that interest rates would continue to decline, even after the Federal Reserve started raising rates in February 1994.
But the trouble at Fidelity runs far deeper than just one bad call -- it stems from the aggressive culture of the company, a unit of the FMR Corporation of Boston. Fidelity has always wanted to be the biggest and the best and make money at the same time. And it believed that its expensive approach to stock picking would be easy to transfer to the bond market. So, unlike many of its competitors, the company was willing to scour the most obscure corners of the bond market and take big bets in the hopes of making big hits, the same way it did with stocks.
But as it turned out, the Fidelity case was akin to Ferrari wanting to dominate the market for small sedans -- by building them with the same high-performance engines it puts in its race cars. It may have been an accident waiting to happen.
The Fidelity story also reveals some dirty little secrets that the mutual fund industry, busy selling Americans on the idea of one-stop shopping, would rather investors not know: the very things that make a company good at managing some kinds of investments may make them bad at running others. And the way a fund company is run affects the investments that their customers get.
Fidelity declined to comment yesterday on its bond funds and canceled interviews that were scheduled with a reporter. The company may name a new bond chief as early as today; the president of Fidelity, J. Gary Burkhead, has been managing the fixed-income department since the end of January.
Thomas J. Steffanci, the head of the Fidelity bond business who left in January, would not comment on his strategy or what went wrong at Fidelity, a spokesman said yesterday.
But at a news conference last year trumpeting Fidelity's fixed-income successes, he said, "It is fair to say that we're part of the school that believes that passive management is passe."
Using the arcane language of his trade to hint at what the company was up to, he added, "Over the next decade adding value to fixed-income investing would not come from just making duration bets." In plain English, that meant Fidelity planned to do more than simply bet on the direction of interest rates. In addition, the company and its investors would make money "finding new investment opportunities and identifying harder-to-find market inefficiencies," he said.
That may not sound too startling, but it is far different from what most bond managers do. In general, they try to make their portfolios match a benchmark index of bonds or a sector of the bond market, the yardstick against which their performance is measured. They may put additional small bets on interest rates or hold bigger than average positions in corporate bonds in an effort to do slightly better than their benchmarks. But in general they do not stray very far. But in stock investing, the best way to beat the benchmark is to buy things that are not in it, and that is what Fidelity decided to do in bonds. To that end, it hired two dozen new bond specialists, including analysts who covered obscure little foreign markets and those familiar with the complicated and sometimes risky financial instruments known as derivatives.
"Growth in areas we consider key to our strategy -- global, quantitative techniques and specialized trading -- have been dramatic," Mr. Steffanci said.
Most of Fidelity's competitors focus on macro-economic factors like inflation and interest rates and rarely analyze individual bonds.
By contrast, the portfolio managers at Fidelity evaluated individual companies and securities, often in offbeat places, and played down broad economic trends.
Ralph G. Norton 3d, managing editor of IBC/Donoghue, a company that publishes mutual fund newsletters, said that last November he attended a Fidelity seminar "on international investing and how great South America is." When he asked about potential currency devaluations and other economic problems, he added, "They said, 'We think the companies down there are plenty strong." Several months later Mexico devalued the peso and the market for its stocks and bonds collapsed.
Indeed, Fidelity placed a heavy emphasis on Latin American debt last year. Part of the explanation was the willingness of the company to give a lot of responsibility to young, relatively inexperienced managers. While competitors like Putnam Investments boast of tightly knit teams of managers who work under experienced leaders, Fidelity has encouraged its managers to experiment, using computers that try to think like people and developing funds that tap into trends like skirt lengths and sun spots.
Robert K. Citrone fit that pattern. He joined Fidelity in his 20's, out of business school, with an interest in the debt of emerging markets but without much experience. His enthusiasm proved infectious, and by early 1994 Fidelity owned $7 billion of emerging market debt and was rumored to be the largest lender to Mexico.
And those bets were not limited to clearly risky funds with emerging markets in their names; they also showed up in conservative sounding Fidelity Short-Term Bond and the company's Balanced and Puritan funds.
The Fidelity stock analysts are expected to become strong advocates of investments they like and persuade money managers to buy them. Mr. Steffanci wanted bond managers to do the same, said John Rekenthaler, an editor at Morningstar Inc., which analyzes mutual funds.
"Tom Steffanci was explicit about this early in his tenure -- he said Fidelity had great equity funds, and he wanted to make the bond people like the stock people," Mr. Rekenthaler said. "He wanted them to start staking themselves and pounding on the table."
And there were other similarities. Because it is a big buyer of initial public stock offerings, Fidelity is often able to have deals tailored to its needs. It began to do the same in bonds, buying a lot of derivatives designed for it and even purchasing whole issues of municipal bonds that no one else would buy, based on what Fidelity considered to be its superior research.
As a whole, this approach is anathema to traditional bond fund managers like Ian MacKinnon, who runs the rival bond funds of the Vanguard Group. He said he did not believe that anyone could run a bond fund like a stock fund.
Moreover, he added, there is a danger in placing big bets, in deviating too far from the risk characteristics of the bond market. Companies like Fidelity, he said, "have a willingness to deviate from those risk characteristics, which leads to spectacular returns in some years and ludicrous ones in others."
And that is exactly what happened. After Mr. Steffanci joined Fidelity in 1990 and started implementing his strategy, the company's previously mediocre bond funds started outperforming their peers. In 1993, for example, Fidelity's taxable bond funds beat 76 percent of their competitors and the tax-exempt funds beat 81 percent, the company said.
The fund managers took big risks to get those numbers. For example, a computer analysis by Carpenter Analytical Services in Hanover, N.H., shows that in early 1993 Fidelity's long-term Government-bond fund became sharply riskier than the bond market as a whole.
Last year, however, the tables were turned. Though a few of Fidelity's funds, particularly its convertible bond fund, continued to prosper, many of its largest funds tanked. For example, its short-term bond fund was in the bottom 5 percent and six other funds were in the bottom 30 percent during the last 12 months. The company's international bond funds were hit particularly hard.
As a result, investors pulled about $6 billion from Fidelity's bond funds last year. Total assets in those funds dropped by 23 percent, compared with 13 percent for the rest of the industry.
Fidelity insiders say the management of the company tried to rein in the bond department late last year after things went wrong. In any event, by January both Mr. Steffanci and Mr. Citrone had both left.
Analysts say the company has gotten rid of many of its derivatives investments and Latin American debt, and has adopted a more conservative approach all around.
"I think they've gone back to more plain vanilla," said Eric Kobren, who publishes Fidelity Insight, a newsletter.
But that may leave the company in a bit of a quandary. If it drops or downplays its bond funds, it risks losing customers, including the many companies for which it manages retirement accounts. Yet if it abandons its high-risk, high-performance strategy, the only other way to succeed in bond funds is to keep costs very low. And Fidelity is not a low-cost provider, said Geoff Bobroff, a consultant to the fund industry.
"On the one hand, they want to be able to do research on weird things that no one else is looking at, and add value that way," said Amy Arnott, an analyst for Morningstar. "But they also don't want the problems they ran into last year."

HEADLINE: U.S. Fails to Enlist European Allies in Iranian Trade Embargo

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, May 2

 BODY:
The United States effort to get other countries to join a trade embargo of Iran faltered today when leading European nations rejected the idea, and, in Bonn's latest sally against Washington, a German official called the American initiative wrong.
Japan, too, gave the idea a cool response. Officials in Tokyo said they had received no formal American request for support and, if they did, they would study it seriously. But, reflecting longstanding differences with Washington over Iran, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official indicated that Tokyo preferred dialogue with "what are called moderates in the Iranian Government, so they will be more cooperative." 
 European countries, too, have long differed with Washington over its attitude to Teheran, saying they prefer "critical dialogue" to isolation as a means of curbing Iran's support for international terrorism.
The policy protects widespread efforts to promote trade ties with oil-producing Iran. While Germany, for instance, lists Iran as a "low-level" trade partner, it imports Iranian carpets and oil and sells machinery, electrical goods and chemicals there. And, by Iranian accounts, Germany is Teheran's most important trade partner.
President Clinton announced on Sunday that he would sever all United States trade and investment with Iran, seeking to halt Iranian support for terrorism and to block what Washington calls Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Secretary of State Warren Christopher urged Washington's allies on Monday to impose their own embargoes.
But a spokesman for the European Union said in Brussels today that the organization was "not going to respond to this initiative" because its policy of "critical dialogue" left each of its 15 members free to conduct relationships with Iran.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, told reporters in Paris, "We do not believe in unilateral embargoes," though he expressed sympathy for American criticism of Iran over human rights and other issues.
Criticism of the American embargo was only the latest in a series of German signs of displeasure with Washington in recent times over other issues, notably the dollar and trade.
Today, the Economics Minister, Gunter Rexrodt, told a German radio station, "We do not believe that a trade embargo is the appropriate instrument for influencing opinion in Iran and bringing about changes there that are in our interests."
"The right thing to do is to conduct a political dialogue with Iran," Mr. Rexrodt said. "Only political dialogue can bring Iran to behave responsibly."
Paradoxically, the American initiative coincides with an attempt by Germany to revive its trade with Iran, which sank in recent years because of Iranian failure to pay debts as its economy stumbled.
In 1992, Germany's trade surplus with Iran stood at some $5 billion, five times the surplus recorded in 1994. In 1992, Iran was Germany's 16th largest export market. Last year it ranked 41st.
Last February, however, the Government drew Israeli and American criticism by re-instituting export guarantees worth some $110 million dollars a year to protect German traders. The export guarantees had been suspended since the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and, as soon as they were revived, a German Government delegation left for Teheran to discuss debt recycling and the use of the new guarantees.
At the time, German politicians dismissed Washington's criticism of the guarantees, saying the United States had offered no proof that Iran was a sponsor of terrorism.

HEADLINE: Pataki Nominates Regan to Head M.A.C.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 2

 BODY:
Former State Comptroller Edward V. Regan has been nominated by Gov. George E. Pataki to be chairman of New York City's Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Mr. Pataki today called Mr. Regan, a Republican who resigned in 1993 after 14 years as comptroller, "one of New York's foremost municipal finance experts." 
 The selection is subject to confirmation by the State Senate. The post carries no salary and Mr. Regan's term would be for four years, according to a spokesman for the Governor, Christopher Chichester.
Mr. Regan would succeed Eugene J. Keilin, who was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1993 to replace Felix G. Rohatyn. The Municipal Assistance Corporation was set up during New York City's fiscal crisis in the 1970's as a vehicle for the city to borrow money by issuing bonds.
Mr. Regan was elected comptroller in 1978 and re-elected in 1982, 1986 and 1990. He resigned to join the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson. Previously, he had been a Buffalo city councilman and Erie County executive.
Mr. Regan said he supports Mr. Pataki's plans to cut taxes and spending and to "return fiscal sanity to New York."
"The Governor's plan for change should have been undertaken 10 years ago," Mr. Regan said in a shot against Mr. Pataki's Democratic predecessor, Mr. Cuomo.

HEADLINE: Budgetary Matters Intrude On Call for Medicare Unity

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Republican Congressional leaders today invited President Clinton to join them in forging a bipartisan policy to control Medicare costs and keep the program solvent. But they found themselves struggling against White House assertions that their primary motivation was to balance the budget at the expense of the elderly.
At a news conference today, Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, asked Mr. Clinton to meet them in the Capitol for a discussion of Medicare and asserted that spending on the health insurance program for the elderly could be separated from the rest of the budget. But they cut the news conference short and walked offstage under a barrage of questions on the relationship between Medicare spending and their plans to balance the budget while cutting taxes. 
 Mr. Gingrich said there was an urgent need to shore up Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, now expected to run out of money in 2002. "This has nothing to do with the budget," he said.
But Democrats and some Republicans insisted that Medicare was inseparable from the rest of the budget because its growth was responsible for a large share of the projected increase in Federal spending during the next decade.
At a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee to discuss Medicare, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, told the Republicans, "You want to be bipartisan only when it suits your needs." He said the Republicans were not bipartisan in the first 100 days of Congress, when they pushed their Contract With America through the House over Democratic objections.
A White House official said the Republicans were looking to Mr. Clinton to provide them with "political cover" for changes in Medicare likely to upset many of the 36 million beneficiaries.
Mr. Clinton will lay out his approach to Medicare on Wednesday in a speech to the White House Conference on Aging. Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy, said Mr. Clinton was unlikely to accept the invitation from Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich.
"You have to admire their chutzpah," Mr. Sperling said of the Republican leaders. "They have a tactic a day, a gimmick a day, to avoid their basic obligation to tell the American people the specifics of their budget for the Contract With America, the contract they ran on, brag about and gloat over every chance they get."
Administration officials say the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will run out of money in 2002 if Medicare law remains unchanged. Options for keeping the program solvent are all distasteful to politicians: Congress could reduce payments to doctors and hospitals, limit the services available to elderly people or raise payroll taxes for workers.
After two days of consultations, Republican leaders of the House and the Senate were unable to agree on how to deal with Medicare in the blueprint for Federal spending known as a budget resolution. Federal law says Congress should complete action on the budget resolution by April 15. But the Republicans are so nervous about Medicare that the Budget Committees in the House and the Senate have not begun drafting the resolution.
Democrats said they would not help Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole out of their political predicament. Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, an expert on Medicare, said he wanted the Republicans to "stew in their own juice until they realize that their Contract With America will harm senior citizens just as it harms children."
President Clinton's chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said on Monday that the Republicans were "essentially calling for the largest Medicare cut in history to pay for tax cuts for the well-off." He said Medicare should be discussed only in the context of comprehensive efforts to improve the health care system.
At the Ways and Means Committee today, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, repeatedly refused to be drawn into a discussion of specific ways to rescue the Medicare trust fund. That infuriated committee members.
The chairman, Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, said Dr. Shalala sounded like "a broken record." He said Mr. Clinton proposed virtually no steps to shore up Medicare in the budget that he sent to Congress in February.
Representative Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, told Dr. Shalala, "If you don't want to suggest anything, then we are going to do it ourselves without your assistance." Representative Mel Hancock, Republican of Missouri, said: "Truman talked about a do-nothing Congress. We ought to be talking about a do-nothing President." Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, said, "I see a huge crisis in leadership by the Administration."
Senator Dole, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, said: "The choice for President Clinton is very clear. He can either heed the warning of his own Cabinet members and join us in preserving Medicare, or he can heed the advice of his political pollsters and decide that his re-election is more important than his responsibility or his relevance."
Dr. Shalala said, "It is ironic that those who are suddenly interested in the plight of the Medicare trust fund have advocated policies that exacerbate the insolvency of the trust fund." One such policy, she said, is the plan by House Republicans to reduce the tax on Social Security benefits received by people with substantial income from other sources.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said he was amused to see Republicans appealing to the President for guidance on Medicare. "They are frozen like deer in headlights," he said. "They have the votes to do anything they want, but they don't want to do it unless we give them a program."

HEADLINE: Class Notes

BYLINE: By Seth Mydans 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
This is one college course where Jaime Bardacke always stays late, a course where professors find themselves cutting off persistent questions and ushering students to the door. It is a course where a lecturer may feel it necessary to preface his remarks, as Roger Waldinger did recently, with, "I'll just tell you what I think and you can boo at me if you want."
It is the new hot-button course at the University of California at Los Angeles, "The History and Politics of Affirmative Action," hastily organized this semester to address one of the most contentious issues on the public agenda, one that has affected the university system itself. 
 In 20 lectures over 10 weeks, professors from the fields of law, history, sociology and economics are addressing aspects of a subject that one of the organizers, Scott L. Waugh, the university's dean of social sciences, calls an ideal prism for studying all of American society.
Though most lecturers have been painstakingly circumspect about revealing their personal beliefs on the divisive issue, the multiethnic class of some 100 undergraduate students has not.
Pointed questions from the students peppered the lecture by Dr. Waldinger, a sociology professor, on "Affirmative Action in Light of the Immigrant Experience." At the end of class, agitated groups of students lingered in the room to attack his thesis that blacks still need affirmative action but that other minorities do not.
"The whole class stays afterward instead of fiddling with their stuff five minutes before the end," said Miss Bardacke, a sophomore who plans to major in history. "People try to keep things civil, but it's such a heated issue that it's hard to feel you're not being attacked when people are voicing their opinions."
Some students, like Hanh Thuan Nguyen, arrived armed with their own research. When Dr. Waldinger's lecture was over, she hurried to the lectern to challenge him chart for chart and graph for graph.
Afterward, Miss Hanh, a Vietnamese immigrant, lingered in the sunny courtyard, exchanging personal experiences with Kimberley Kirkwood, an American-born black, and Christina Abilando, who emigrated eight years ago from Cameroon.
"I didn't have a 4.0 grade-point average," Miss Abilando said. "I came here because of affirmative action. I think it is for disadvantaged groups."
Affirmative action has moved to the forefront of public debate in recent months with a proposed California ballot initiative that would end many race-based preference programs. Gov. Pete Wilson supports the initiative and has made the issue a central one as he prepares to run for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.
The university itself has become a focus of the debate after Ward Connerly, a regent for the University of California system, called for an end to such preferences in admissions. The U.C.L.A. Chancellor, Charles E. Young, quickly took a strong stand against Mr. Connerly, saying affirmative action had benefited the university and should continue.
One of the course organizers, Carol Peterson Hartzog, vice provost of the College of Letters and Science, emphasized that the interdisciplinary course was intended to inform and to foster discussion, not to present a point of view. The lecturers were selected for their research into various aspects of affirmative action but without regard to, or even knowledge of, their personal views.
"The course is not meant to defend the university's policies or to strengthen our position," she said.
Taking into account the passionate divisions the issue arouses, Dr. Hartzog said she had distributed a flier at the start of the course clarifying the difference between dialogue and confrontational debate.
"Dialogue creates an open-minded attitude and an openness to being wrong and to change, to listen to the other side," she said. "Our purpose here is not advocacy but to help the students to become as well informed as we can and to be able then to develop their own well-reasoned opinions."
Readings in the course include selections by such well-known social commentators as Seymour Martin Lipset, Andrew Hacker, Henry Louis Gates, Dinesh D'Souza and Shelby Steele. Course materials also include the positions of both Dr. Young and Mr. Connerly.
In a future lecture, James Sidanius, a psychology professor, said he would describe his new research showing that both racism and the concepts of fairness and equity play roles in the attitudes of whites toward affirmative action.
In another lecture, Julian Eule, a law professor, said he would present his own scholarship on the role of the courts in reviewing voter initiatives like the current affirmative action ballot measure. As "unfiltered majoritarianism," Mr. Eule said, ballot measures tend to be stacked against minorities more than legislative action.
In his lecture, Dr. Waldinger offered a potentially divisive thesis that minorities other than blacks have historically succeeded without the help of affirmative action and that such preferences could be dispensed with today for all groups except blacks.
Color-blind "equal opportunity" is the ideal standard, he said, and preferential programs are justified most clearly for blacks because of their "greater past discrimination and its persistent legacy."
His comments raised a host of objections from the students. Black students spoke out in solidarity with American Indians, and Hispanic students in solidarity with blacks.
"I don't want to get into this argument about who suffered more; we're all here," said one student, Monica Serafin. "I don't like the way he sets African-Americans against Latinos. I'd rather stay away from that."
But tough issues like this will be hard to avoid. The course's next scheduled lecture was titled, "Affirmative Action in Higher Education."

HEADLINE: Displaced Aerospace Workers Face Grim Future in California Economy

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif.

 BODY:
Martha Sias had no idea what she was producing before she was laid off from her high-security job as an assembler of military aircraft parts for the Lockheed Corporation, but she says she was very good at it.
"You have your blueprints here; you have your parts here," she said. "You sit in a little cubicle, and you're making that one part. What it goes to, where it goes to, they don't tell you." 
 Like so many of the hundreds of thousands of jobs making military and aerospace equipment that were the underpinnings of the California economy for decades, it was great work. "You've got good benefits, good money, and you're always moving up," Ms. Sias said. "Your money never stays the same. It's always increasing."
But in November 1993, Ms. Sias's dream job ended suddenly. At the age of 43, she was caught in a tidal wave of layoffs caused by declines in military spending and commercial aircraft manufacturing. She became one of 210,000 people who have lost defense and aerospace manufacturing jobs in California in the last eight years.
Even as California recovers from its long recession, there is little likelihood that defense and aerospace work will significantly revive, and more workers are losing their jobs.
These are the people who led the scientific and military boom throughout the cold war, but now there are only sketchy statistics to tell what has become of nearly a quarter of a million displaced machinists, assemblers, engineers, scientists and managers.
And for those like Ms. Sias, who are eager to retrain, even less is known about what jobs are available and what specialities are in demand in Southern California's shifting economy.
"It's scary -- there are no answers," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles. He said he received constant inquiries from relocation agencies seeking information on needed skills and on growing industries.
"With the data we get, it is very hard to determine anything that specific," Mr. Kyser said. "If somebody asks how many multimedia jobs are there, we just can't tell them."
Los Angeles Trade Technical College, in partnership with the University of Southern California and the National Society of Professional Engineers, thought it had an answer. In 1992 and 1993 it trained 40 former aerospace workers, most of them with advanced scientific degrees, in the emerging technologies of environmental cleanup.
"When we started the program, the only stocks on the stock market that were going up were environmental engineering firms," said Hilda Tomberlin, dean of career and technical education at the college. "It was very exciting."
But Government priorities shifted, the industry never took off, only 16 of the graduates found jobs in that field, and the course in environmental technologies was dropped.
Similarly, little data exist on how well former aerospace workers have done in finding new jobs, although there are many sad stories, including those of an electronics engineer who works at McDonald's, of a $75,000-a-year project manager who plans to open a grocery store, and of the many people who have been retrained only to find that their new skills are as unmarketable as their old ones.
A 1993 study published by Paul M. Ong, a professor of urban planning at the University of California at Los Angeles, found that one-third of the former aerospace workers who applied for unemployment insurance faced long-term unemployment, compared with only one-fifth of claimants nationwide.
The report found that only 17 percent found new jobs in the aerospace industry. Of those who found work outside the industry, only one-third were able to stay in California. Average earnings dropped by about one-third.
Another report now being prepared by the Rand Corporation paints a somewhat brighter picture, one that seems at odds with both the U.C.L.A. report and with anecdotal evidence supplied by organizations running job placement programs, including trade unions and public agencies.
"Some of our aerospace people have been out of work for two or three years," said Mary Hart, coordinator of the Job Club at the employment development office in Torrance, just south of Los Angeles. "These are high-level professional people -- project managers, accountants, marketing people, sales representatives, sales managers, customer service managers. I could start a marvelous company with all these people if I had the money."
In its study of unemployment figures, Rand found that about 9 percent of aerospace workers were unemployed as of 1993, compared with 7.8 percent in nonaerospace durable manufacturing. This was more than double the unemployment rate for aerospace workers in 1990 (4.2 percent), said the report's author, Bob Schoeni. He said 74 percent of professional technical workers, mainly engineers, who found new jobs were re-employed within their specialty, although re-employed aerospace workers overall experienced a 16 percent drop in wages.
Many former aerospace workers did land on their feet, like Leiv H. Blad, a manager of manufacturing research with Lockheed who in 1991 accepted a generous retirement package after 23 years with the company. He took over a small company, Hub Engineering, where he is trying to apply his technical knowledge to the commercial manufacture of composite materials.
Ms. Sias is one of 16 students in a federally financed retraining program at Hub Engineering, working alongside a 49-year-old sheet-metal mechanic who is now supported by his wife, and a 48-year-old precision assembler who lives on $212 a month in general relief and $91 in food stamps and recently received a notice evicting him from his mobile home.
The students in this program were recruited with a questionnaire distributed by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represented 13,000 workers in 1988, most of them at Lockheed. Of these, only 2,500 still hold their jobs.
Retraining can mean something different for top-level executives like John Forster, who supervised 10 project managers at TRW Inc. before losing his job in 1992.
"These high-end managers have to retrain in basic skills," said Mary Ann Pranke, the marketing director for the Private Industry Council in Carson, a Los Angeles suburb, one of 58 such job-placement groups in the state with financing from the Department of Labor.
"They used to turn their reports over to their secretaries," she said. "Now they have to learn how to type their own reports."
Both the former managers and their former workers must also learn to search for work in a marketplace that does not always welcome them.
"They don't want us because we worked in aerospace," Ms. Sias said flatly. "First, we made too much money. Second, they tell us we are overqualified. Third, 'Have you ever done this kind of work before?' No, but just give me a blueprint or your schematic and I can build it. You want me to build you a doorknob, I'll build a doorknob."
Placement counselors also say employers, particularly in small companies, are worried that the highly specialized aerospace workers are less suited for jobs that require flexibility, and fear that they would desert them if a higher-paying job opened up in aerospace.
"Some commercial companies don't believe aerospace employees are productive," added C. J. Jackson, local president of the Electronics and Space Technicians Union, in which 8,000 of the 12,000 members have lost their jobs. "Most of our people are still out of work."
One of them is Joseph Smith, an expert in repairing Apache attack helicopters for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, who concedes that he became "pretty well stagnated" after performing the same specialized tasks day after day, year after year. At the age of 49, he is studying to be a telecommunications and microcomputer technician, but, he said, "There's no guarantee, when I get done with that, that I'm going to be able to get employed either."
Age itself is a problem for many job hunters. Though employers almost never acknowledge it, older workers say it is common knowledge that long experience can, paradoxically, be a handicap. The U.C.L.A. study found that long-term unemployment was particularly common among workers 55 and older.
"The human resources people can read into a resume," said Jerry Steiner, a 59-year-old former executive at the Northrop Corporation who supervised 55 people and handled $200 million in procurement orders a year. He said he earned more than $85,000, 25 percent to 30 percent more than he could have earned in commercial industry.
"I cannot put down 'over 30 years' experience' or that I served in the military from 1958 to 1960," he said. "These things they can put together and realize you are over 50, and they won't even talk to you."
A footnote was added by Dale Herron, president of the Engineers and Scientists Guild, an aerospace union that once represented nearly 2,000 engineers at Lockheed, of whom about 800 remain. "The people who dealt with secret defense disciplines have a harder time being placed because they can't tell you what they did," he said. "It's ironic, but it happens."
Carll N. Pontius Jr. graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959, "right after Sputnik," and like many of the brightest young people of his generation he hitched his future to the space race, working first at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and then at TRW.
The current tide of cutbacks is the end of that era of boundless horizons, Mr. Pontius said, and when he lost his job, he turned his back on his past. At the age of 53, he supports his family as a ski patrolman and an ambulance attendant, and he is about to receive a degree as a registered nurse from Los Angeles Harbor College.
The only problem, as he embarks on his new life, is finding a nursing job. Mr. Pontius said 85 percent of last year's graduating class were still unemployed.

HEADLINE: Proving Racial Bias, Worker Finds, Is No Easy Task

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 28

 BODY:
For six years, Raymond Hunter tried to get someone to listen to his complaint of racial discrimination on the job. But when he finally got to court, he saw his claim converted into a routine labor dispute and dismissed by a Federal judge.
"All I want is for someone to look at this thing and tell me if I'm right or if they are," said Mr. Hunter, who has filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia seeking to have his discrimination claim restored. 
 Mr. Hunter, 56, was laid off twice, in 1989 and 1991, from his job as a boiler operator for the H. L. Yoh Company of Radnor, Pa., and replaced by men whose operating licenses were later judged by state officials to be fraudulent or invalid.
Mr. Hunter, who was out of work for two years, contends that he was the victim of racial prejudice. The company said it was only following the contract, replacing Mr. Hunter with men with more seniority when it was forced to reduce its work force. In all, the company laid off 20 workers, including 17 who are white and 3 who, like Mr. Hunter, are black.
What happened to Mr. Hunter's complaint in the court system is not unusual, said Paul Schacter, a Newark lawyer who specializes in civil rights litigation. "It's very, very difficult to prove discrimination," he said. "There are a lot of obstacles, and it's difficult to prove what is in someone's mind."
For the worker involved, it can make a big difference whether his claim is treated as a bias case or a contract violation. For example, under his bias claim, Mr. Hunter was seeking damages for emotional distress; that kind of compensation would not be available if his case was considered purely as a labor contract dispute under Federal law.
Of the 400 complaints of racial discrimination in employment filed with the State Division on Civil Rights in 1994, only 43 led to monetary awards. The total won by all 43 plaintiffs was $256,572, or an average of $6,000 each. More than half of the 1,744 complaints of all types of discrimination that the division closed last year were found to have no probable cause or were withdrawn by the plaintiffs.
Mr. Schacter said the only way to win a civil rights case against an employer is to demonstrate that the company's statements "are not worthy of belief."
Michael J. Ossip, one of the lawyers who represented the Yoh company, said a plaintiff must do even more under rulings by Federal courts in the Third Circuit and by the United States Supreme Court. "It's not enough to prove that the employer's stated reasons for dismissal are false," he said. "You must also demonstrate there was intentional discrimination sufficient to have played a determinate role in the decision."
Mr. Ossip said that in depositions Mr. Hunter was asked why he thought his layoff was due to his being black, and he replied, "Well, what other reason was it?"
Mr. Hunter began working for the Yoh company in Jan. 25, 1988, as a boiler operator at the AT&T Bell Laboratories Corporate Education Center in Hopewell, N.J. The Pennsylvania company was under contract to do all maintenance work and operate the steam generation plants at the center.
On Feb. 9, 1989, Mr. Hunter was promoted to lead boiler operator. But by June, he was laid off in favor of another employee who the company said had the right to bump, or replace, Mr. Hunter under its contract with Local 68 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. The man had more seniority but not the training or the licenses that Mr. Hunter had.
"You can't bump up and replace someone four classifications higher than you," Mr. Hunter argued.
The union supported the company's position, however, and Mr. Hunter still has a complaint of racial bias against the union pending before the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Within two months of being laid off, Mr. Hunter was invited back because the man who had replaced him was found to be unable to properly operate the water and heating systems at the Corporate Education Center and was dismissed at the insistence of AT&T.
The New Jersey Department of Labor found that two supervisors at the Yoh company had falsely certified that Mr. Hunter's replacement had the proper training for a boiler operator's license.
Mr. Hunter filed a complaint with the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, which found probable cause to investigate. After he was back on the job as lead boiler operator, the company asked Mr. Hunter to drop his complaint. Against the wishes of his family, he said, he agreed, but only after demanding that the company give him a letter attesting to his professional competence and value to the company.
"I thought that would give me job security, but I was wrong," he said.
In 1991, AT&T decided to close the building Mr. Hunter was working in, and he applied for a lesser position as a boiler operator at lower pay that was opening up in another part of the Hopewell complex. He began working at the job on May 6, 1991. But by July 1, he was again bumped by a man he had supervised at the Corporate Education Center, who had more seniority but not the training that the new job required, Mr. Hunter said. That man's license was rescinded by the New Jersey Labor Department when he could not document that he had the necessary training.
This time, however, instead of recalling Mr. Hunter, the company told the state it would train the replacement worker and make sure that he qualified for the job. Mr. Hunter filed grievances with the union and the company, which were rejected, and an unfair labor practice charge against the union with the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled against him.
At that point, Mr. Hunter filed a suit in New Jersey Superior Court contending that he was the victim of racial bias. Lawyers for the Yoh company responded by going into Federal District Court and arguing that the matter was pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act since the issue of whether the company discriminated against Mr. Hunter or acted unlawfully could only be determined by reference to the collective-bargaining agreement between the company and the union.
Judge Garrett E. Brown of the Federal District Court agreed. He also rejected Mr. Hunter's claim under the Federal labor act because it requires claims to be filed within six months. Mr. Hunter did not file his lawsuit until nearly two years after the last incident of perceived bias because the state's law against discrimination has no such time constraint.
Mr. Hunter continued his education during the two years of unemployment and obtained his gold license, the highest of five grades of engineering licenses in his field. In June 1993, he was hired by Trenton State College and is now the school's chief operating engineer.
Mr. Hunter said he had fought so hard and long to win a judgment against the Yoh Company because he had finally obtained a good-paying job in his field only to see "the company take it away from me by helping white operators get fraudulent licenses."
Mr. Ossip, the lawyer for the Yoh company, said he understood how strongly Mr. Hunter held his belief in his claim. "I don't doubt that he believes he was the victim of racial discrimination," he said. "But I also don't doubt that he wasn't."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Plans Software for Easier Systems Management

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Promising to reduce the spiraling costs of managing computer networks, I.B.M. is expected to announce the first in a line of new software today that will integrate and automate the management of large computer systems from the most advanced mainframes to the lowliest desktop machines.
The software, called the System View series, is intended to meet the growing needs of corporate computer managers, who have seen their jobs become increasingly complicated as companies have added disparate networks of personal computers and data servers to their traditional mainframe systems. 
 Although these new, decentralized systems promised to lower costs and increase efficiency, they have often proved harder and more expensive to manage than mainframes, which can be monitored from a single site.
System View offers a coordinated set of tools to enable administrators to automate a range of management tasks that are now done by hand, including revising software and monitoring disk storage space.
"These are the kinds of things that customers have been waiting for," said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects, a Washington consulting firm.
The first version of the software, which I.B.M. said would be available today, is designed for the RS/6000, a server that runs the Unix operating system. Versions that run on OS/2 and MVS, I.B.M.'s operating systems for personal computers and mainframes, will be available by the end of the year, while a version for OS/400, I.B.M.'s midrange operating system, will arrive early next year, the company said.
Although the software is based on these different operating systems, it will be able to manage networks made up of different brands of hardware and software, including those from all of I.B.M.'s major competitors. And as evidence of I.B.M.'s move away from proprietary technology, the company also plans to introduce versions that run on software sold by Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and others.
"We're in the software business at this part of I.B.M., and so I'm interested in developing and making the very best software no matter what platform it's on," said John M. Thompson, a senior vice president who was named head of the company's software business in January.
I.B.M. hopes to get a jump on Hewlett-Packard, a leader in network-management software, which is developing its own comprehensive approach. That new software, code-named Tornado, will not be available until August, according to Scott Safe, a marketing-programs manager at Hewlett-Packard.
Mr. Thompson said I.B.M. planned to design future versions so that independent software vendors could easily write new applications to be integrated with System View.
"I think it's a big step forward," said Waverly Deutsche, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "We're getting a strong message that network management is going to be one of the areas that I.B.M. sees as critical to its future."

HEADLINE: Foreign Policy Can't Ignore Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You miss a key point of the speech of Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser (news article, April 28) that relates to Mark Hertsgaard's April 8 Op-Ed article on the Berlin climate change conference. The United States was isolated at Berlin because it is pursuing an isolationist foreign policy at home. 
 We must make such connections if we are to redefine "national security"; global climate change and other threats require it. Mr. Lake made reference to the "new threats" of environmental degradation and population growth; but in discussing only "old threats" in his speech (that is, military), you miss the point. Failure to broaden our concept of national security lies at the root of isolationism and the heart of today's debate.
Those who wish to reduce our foreign involvement are caught in outmoded ideas of national security and preparedness. The United States can no longer discuss security without paying attention to the environmental and economic impacts of climate change, such as flooding and losses to the insurance industry. And it can no longer discuss preparedness without taking a precautionary approach to address these and other threats.
Just as Harry Truman, facing an unfriendly Congress, accomplished the Berlin airlift en route to a second term, President Clinton should begin shaping United States foreign policy for the 21st century.
Putting climate change and other emerging national security threats on the foreign policy "radar screen" would benefit the United States economically and environmentally.
Redefining our foreign policy will require bipartisanship and take time. New issues like climate change show that the task is to rethink, not reduce, foreign aid.

HEADLINE: Indictments Seen on Third-World Loans

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
An investigation of the market for developing-nation bank loans by the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the Federal Reserve Board is expected to result in indictments soon, people close to the investigation said yesterday.
In their joint investigation, the District Attorney's office and the Federal Reserve are focusing on a small group of young loan traders who worked at big commercial banks and their possible role in the unauthorized sale and trading of millions of dollars of bank credits lent to developing nations in exchange for kickbacks, the people close to the investigation said. 
 Many of the bank loans were sold at deep discounts to their face value in 1988, 1989 and 1990, after big banks made huge provisions against the billions of dollars they had lent to the developing world in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Investigators suspect that a few loan traders at some big banks may have cheated their own institutions by selling credits to third parties at below-market prices and then shared the profits with the third parties.
In the late 1980's, the biggest American banks vied with one another to make big provisions against their shaky credits to such Latin American nations as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, which had borrowed heavily in the early 1980's.
One focus of the joint investigation is on traders who previously worked at the First Chicago Corporation's First National Bank. The bank sold its loans as fast as most of its competitors, and at some of the deepest discounts, and in January 1988 added $240 million to its reserves for troubled foreign loans after making a similar $800 million provision in 1987. At that time, First Chicago alone had $3 billion of such troubled loans. The January 1988 provision increased that bank's reserve for shaky developing-nation loans to $1.32 billion, or about 40 percent of its total loans to countries in the developing world that were having loan problems.
As a result of the January 1988 provision, First Chicago reported a loss of $96.5 million for the fourth quarter of 1987, while a year earlier it had declared a $64.2 million profit for the fourth quarter of 1986. Altogether, First Chicago had losses of $570.7 million for 1987 because of its large provisions. They allowed the bank to sell the loans that it had with Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and other developing nations at a rapid rate in 1988, 1989 and 1990. During the fourth quarter of 1987, for example, First Chicago charged off $38 million of such loans as it began to sell and trade such obligations at a big discount to their face value.
Although it is now a much more regulated and orderly market, in the last years of the 1980's, the market for loans to developing nations was murky at best. The Federal Reserve generally did not take much interest in the growing market until the early 1990's, after the market had acquired a reputation for some unregulated dealings.
Three traders at the Security Pacific Corporation, for example, assembled a 90-page report dated Feb. 27, 1989, reconstructing the sale of $416.4 million of loans with Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, Venezuela, Chile and other countries, contending that loans were sold at below- market prices in an organized fashion to the benefit of one of their colleagues. A Federal grand jury in Manhattan looked into the matter with the cooperation of the traders, but no charges were brought. Security Pacific was later taken over by BankAmerica.
More recently, however, the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the Fed began looking into the market as a result of their joint investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the rogue bank closed by regulators in July 1991. As a result of the investigation, Daniel Young, a former vice president of Manufacturers Hanover, pleaded guilty in March 1994 in New York state court to a felony in misapplying bank property in connection with the 1990 sale of some Colombian bank debt. Manufacturers Hanover was merged with the Chemical Banking Corporation in 1991.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
For Japanese chip makers, a boom time mixed with caution.

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
MUCH of Corporate Japan is closed this week for the so-called Golden Week holidays. But semiconductor factories will keep operating. Demand for computer memory chips continues to soar, defying predictions that the chip shortage would turn to glut this year.
But good news for chip producers here does not necessarily mean good news for their stocks. Indeed, while the shares of American chip companies have generally outperformed a strong American stock market, the shares of Japan's big chip makers have generally performed worse than the slumping Japanese market. 
 One reason is that most American semiconductor companies, like the Intel Corporation and Texas Instruments Inc., specialize in chips and gain directly from a booming market.
The major Japanese semiconductor companies, however, are large conglomerates, like Hitachi Ltd. and the Toshiba Corporation, that make everything from televisions to turbines. While semiconductor sales might be strong, the other businesses of these companies are being hurt by the weak economy in Japan and by the appreciation of the yen against the dollar.
Another factor has been the fear that demand for chips, which has been fueled by strong worldwide sales of personal computers, may end at any time. Recently, those fears have been ebbing.
"I don't think we are done buying PC's," said Steven Myers, an analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Japan. "I don't see any sign that this is suddenly going to come to an end." He said that with prices relatively high for memory chips, Japanese companies could still make money on them even at the current exchange rates of roughly 84 yen to the dollar.
With stocks weak and chip demand strong, there should be a way to invest. Mr. Myers recommends the NECCorporation, among the big chip makers. It has led the other companies in moving semiconductor manufacturing overseas, insulating it somewhat from the effects of the strong yen.
Taketoshi Yamamoto, an electronics analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo, has "strong buy" recommendations on two specialized stocks -- the Kyocera Corporation and the Rohm Company -- whose fortunes are more closely tied to the semiconductor market than those of the big conglomerates.
Kyocera is the world leader in ceramic packages for microprocessors and other sophisticated chips. It is also heavily involved in the fast-growing mobile telephone business in Japan. Rohm is a maker of specialized semiconductors for video processing and some niche markets.
Yet another approach is to invest in companies that make the equipment used to make semiconductors. Peter Wolff, an analyst at CS First Boston in Tokyo, likes Tokyo Electron Ltd., which is Japan's largest vendor of such equipment and has a huge order backlog. Mr. Myers of Jardine Fleming likes Tokyo Electron and the Advantest Corporation, Japan's leader in semiconductor testing equipment.
But Joseph Osha, an electronics analyst with Smith New Court (Japan) Ltd., says it is already too late to invest in semiconductor equipment companies. He argues that growth in sales of chips will slow in 1996. That slowdown will spook semiconductor companies into cutting back on capital spending in 1996, slicing the profits of companies like Tokyo Electron and Advantest.
"It is not necessary to assume that the world semiconductor market will collapse in 1996 to believe that capital spending will weaken," Mr. Osha wrote in a recent report. As for stocks of semiconductor equipment manufacturers, he said, "the time to sell is now."

Breast scans may indeed help women under 50.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
IT is hard enough to get healthy people to go for checkups that might pick up hidden cancers while they are still curable. But when experts argue among themselves about who should get various tests and how often, reluctance can turn into outright refusal.
With regard to screening mammograms for women under 50, practitioners say the current debate about their lifesaving potential is prompting many women to avoid the test even as a growing number of studies points to its ability to reduce breast cancer deaths in women of all ages. 
 In 1989, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and 11 other national organizations recommended that women from 40 to 50 years old have a mammogram every one to two years and that those 50 and older should have one annually. Then, late in 1992, a 7-year study of screening mammography done in Canada showed no benefit to women under 50. In fact, women in their 40's who were in the screening group in that study actually had a higher breast cancer death rate than women who were not screened, a finding no one could explain.
Despite widespread criticism of the design and execution of the Canadian study, the National Cancer Institute retracted its advice, saying there was no proof that routine mammography benefited younger women. Instead of a blanket screening recommendation for all women in their 40's, the institute recommended routine mammograms only for those whose family history placed them at an unusually high risk of breast cancer. No other organization went along with the change, but the publicity given to the cancer institute's revised recommendation angered most mammographers and left women confused.
 
Why the Debate
 The matter is not inconsequential, in terms of either money or lives. Each year 40,000 women under 50 learn that they have breast cancer, and each year there are 10,000 deaths of women who developed breast cancer from the age of 40 through 49. Only about one in five of those cancers occur in women with family histories of breast cancer.
While the numbers of cases and deaths are much higher among women over 50, the years of life saved are much greater when a 45-year-old woman is cured than when a woman of 65 is. Still, many more younger women must be screened to find one cancer than is the case among women over 50. As Dr. Russell Harris and Dr. Linda Leininger of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine recently put it, "In our rush to control the terrible problem of breast cancer, it is easy to forget that, in the best of circumstances, the many must be screened to benefit the few."
And because mammograms often detect suspicious areas in the breast that warrant further tests or biopsies but that turn out not to be cancer, there are issues like medical costs, mental anguish and physical trauma to consider when deciding whether routine mammograms are worthwhile for younger women. Experts must determine whether the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks and whether administering the examination is both practical and economical.
There are many reasons why it may be more difficult to show a life-saving benefit of screening mammography in younger women. Women in their 40's are considerably less likely to develop and die from breast cancer than are women 50 and older. In the studies completed so far, less than a third of the participants were in their 40's when screening began. Women in their 40's are more likely to have very early stages of breast cancer and so their life expectancy is naturally longer whether or not their cancers are found through screening. The older forms of mammography used in the studies may be less sensitive to cancers in the denser breasts of younger women.
Such factors suggest that larger studies and a longer follow-up -- 10 or more years -- using the newest and most sensitive equipment may be needed to see benefits in younger women. It now appears that the Canadian and other studies on which the institute based its new advice may not have been large enough or long enough or used refined enough technology to demonstrate a lifesaving benefit for younger women.
 
Emerging Benefits
 In a new analysis published last month in the journal Cancer, Dr. Charles R. Smart, formerly of the National Cancer Institute and now of Salt Lake City, and his co-authors found that when all eight scientifically designed studies of screening mammography in younger women were combined, there was a 14 percent reduction in breast cancer deaths among those screened. This was not statistically significant, but when the Canadian study's aberrant results were left out, there was a statistically significant 23 percent benefit associated with screening.
Dr. Smart reported that the longer the study, the more likely it was to show a benefit of screening mammography for younger women. He concluded that women who had regular, high-quality mammograms today were more likely to have cancers detected at an earlier and more curable stage than participants in all eight studies he examined.
But the chances that future studies will show an unquestionable benefit of screening mammography in younger women are not good. Dr. Smart pointed out that to demonstrate an unequivocal 20 percent reduction in breast cancer deaths in women in their 40's would require a study of nearly one million women. Thus far fewer than 180,000 such women have participated in all the studies combined. Nor is a convincing finding likely to emerge from a new trial in Britain, which will be offering annual screening to one-third of 195,000 women in their 40's.
There have been several indications that when cancer is found in a younger woman through mammography, it is likely to be at least as curable as cancers found in women from 50 to 64, for whom an annual mammogram is uniformly recommended. When a breast cancer is discovered, chances of cure depend on the tumor's size, its growth patterns and whether cancer cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
In a study published in the current issue of The American Journal of Radiology, Dr. Belinda N. Curpen, now at Notre Dame Hospital in Quebec, and colleagues at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco reported that in 44,301 screening mammograms, 75 cancers were detected in women 40 to 49 and 128 were found in women 50 to 64. The detection rate was 3 per 1,000 examinations for the younger women as against 5.5 per 1,000 examinations for the older women, suggesting that few cancers were missed in either group.
There were no significant differences between the two groups of women in the size, stage and lymph node spread of the cancers found. If anything, the radiologists concluded, the younger women had a slightly more favorable prognosis than did the older women. The authors concluded that if, as all agree, mammography benefits older women, it should have a comparable benefit for younger women. One just has to wait long enough to see it.

HEADLINE: 16 Police Officers Are Indicted In Bronx Precinct Graft Inquiry

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Sixteen police officers, including three sergeants, have been indicted on charges of robbery, burglary, larceny, filing false police reports and insurance fraud in a sweeping corruption investigation of the 48th Precinct in the Bronx, senior law enforcement officials said yesterday.
In addition, seven other officers assigned to the station house in the East Tremont section -- including one sergeant -- are to be suspended from the force today and could face dismissal. Although these officers were suspected of criminal wrongdoing -- in some cases witnessing a crime and not reporting it -- the Bronx District Attorney's office told police officials that sufficient evidence to obtain an indictment had not been collected. 
 A senior police official said that officers from the Internal Affairs Bureau would begin taking indicted officers out of their homes in handcuffs overnight and would conclude the arrests this morning. The official would not say how many officers had been arrested last night nor release the names of the officers to be arrested and suspended, but shortly before midnight, at least 10 officers were taken in handcuffs through a side door at 315 Hudson Street in lower Manhattan, where the police Internal Affairs Bureau has offices. A police barricade had been erected at the front entrance to the building.
The indictments handed up by two Bronx special grand juries in recent days are to be unsealed today, law enforcement officials said.
The indictments and administrative actions mark the second time in just over a year that large numbers of officers in a New York City precinct have been implicated in a corruption scandal. Last year, more than 30 officers were arrested in the 30th Precinct in Harlem on charges ranging from assault to drug dealing.
Senior police officials expressed particular dismay over the broad dimensions of the case -- involving nearly 10 percent of the officers in the 48th Precinct -- and because most of the offenses cited came since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton took office.
"With all the major accomplishments we made in the reduction of crime in the last year, I'm disappointed that some of that may be clouded by the alleged actions of a few," said Assistant Chief Rafael Pineiro, the Bronx police borough commander.
Police officials said the 16 indicted officers included 10 people who have already been removed from the field and placed on desk duty. Several of them, the officials said, have helped in the investigation by naming other officers. The sergeants implicated include two from the 48th Precinct and one from the 40th Precinct, also in the Bronx, suspected of committing insurance fraud within the 48th Precinct.
A senior police official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said he did not expect many more officers from the 48th Precinct would be implicated, although other officials said the Police Department was looking at many other officers in such adjoining precincts as the 46th, the 44th and the 52d.
"The people we are bringing in in the 48th are everyone who is known," the senior police official said, though he added that the suspects would be urged to name other officers believed to be involved in criminal activities after they are arrested.
At the precinct stationhouse yesterday and last night, there was more activity than usual, with police officers coming and going between regular shifts. Some of the officers wore grim expressions.
Police officials would not say precisely what the indicted officers were said to have done. But they did describe the insurance fraud case, saying that a sergeant had reported his car stolen, then dumped it at a car repair shop to be stripped for parts.
The investigation into the 48th Precinct was the first major corruption inquiry into a single precinct that was initiated by the Police Department itself. Under pressure from the Mollen Commission, which held public hearings in late 1993 identifying pockets of suspected corruption in the East Tremont, University Heights and Morris Heights neighborhoods of the Bronx, the Internal Affairs Bureau began a series of sting operations in the 48th Precinct to detect corrupt officers.
Mr. Bratton's aides said the Commissioner was clearly upset about the case. Speaking of the brutality and corruption found over the last year in the 30th Precinct in Harlem, one senior police official said, "We thought after the three-oh, it would have put a damper on it."
Mr. Bratton spoke with Bronx police commanders and police union leaders yesterday, and then taped a video to be distributed today to precincts around the city explaining what had happened in the 48th Precinct. Late last night, he toured the streets of the precinct.
Trying to find a silver lining to the crisis, police officials said they developed new investigative techniques in pursuing the 48th Precinct case that included more sophisticated sting operations and patterning types of arrests and complaints to single out suspected officers.
"I hope the message is learned that there are certain things this department will not tolerate," Chief Pineiro said, "and we have shown we are in the position to conduct these investigations to a successful conclusion."
Officials said the pattern of corruption found in the Bronx precinct was somewhat different from that of the 30th Precinct, where crews of four or more police officers were accused of beating up suspects, dealing narcotics and stealing drugs and guns from traffickers. In the 48th, most of the offending officers worked either alone or with partners, the officials said, adding that the crimes were more "opportunistic" than planned.
The differing patterns of police crime in the 48th and 30th Precincts reflected the differing patterns of the drug trade in Harlem and the central Bronx. Because upper Manhattan is a wholesale center where drug dealers from all over the metropolitan area shop for their drugs, the officers arrested in Harlem were often tempted by large sums of money or caches of the finest cocaine they found on the job.
The East Tremont section, by contrast, is dominated by small-time drug dealers hawking heroin and crack on the streets. Officers who stole did so for petty amounts, officials said.
And while almost all the officers to be arrested or otherwise disciplined in the 48th Precinct worked on the overnight shift, the officers arrested in the 30th Precinct worked on all shifts.
Joseph Mancini, a spokesman for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he could not comment on the indictments. "We don't really know very much," he added.
Since brutality and corruption often go hand in hand, Police Department officials and outside investigators said patterns of abuse complaints in at least several other precincts in the city suggested the possibility of worse corruption problems than in the 48th.
Former staff members of the Mollen Commission said their preliminary investigations indicated severe corruption problems in a broad swath of the city stretching from Harlem to Washington Heights and into the central Bronx. They said there was another deep pocket of suspected police corruption and brutality in central Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: March New-Home Sales Up 3%, Quelling Hope for Fast Recovery

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes inched up in March but remained far below the levels of a year ago, the Commerce Department said today, dashing hopes for a quick recovery in the housing sector.
Sales gained 3 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 577,000 units. But that followed a revised decline of 12.5 percent in February and left the March sales a steep 20 percent lower than the pace of a year ago. 
 The report provided further evidence that a year of increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve had succeeded in dampening consumer demand. Higher borrowing costs have hurt sales of cars and trucks as well as houses.
And while mortgage rates have eased since the beginning of the year, they remain 1.5 percentage points higher than they were in late 1993.
"We have had some decline in mortgage rates, but it would take a much larger drop to offset the impact of a weaker overall economy," said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.
Sales rose in the West and Midwest but fell in the Northeast and South.
Despite reports of bad weather in California in March, sales of new homes in the West soared by 38.7 percent, to a rate of 172,000, the biggest monthly increase since a rise of 48 percent in December 1981.
Sales in the Midwest were up 11.7 percent, to a rate of 115,000.
But home sales dropped 14.1 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of 55,000 a year, and fell 13 percent in the South, to 234,000 a year. It was the largest monthly fall in the South -- the nation's biggest regional housing market -- since a decline of 15 percent in May 1994.
Previously, the department said the sales of new homes had fallen even more sharply in February, by 14 percent, to a rate of 551,000. It revised that up to a rate of 560,000 units, still the lowest since 554,000 in May 1992.
"The data on home sales, combined with the latest automobile sales data, indicate that both these interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy are continuing to falter," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York.
The big auto makers reported on Monday that their sales dropped sharply in April.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Pataki's Ratings Are Low Over Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Four months into Gov. George E. Pataki's administration, large numbers of New Yorkers are concerned that he is moving too swiftly to shrink state government and believe that his policies will damage their quality of life, according to the latest New York Times poll.
While newly elected officials typically receive a bounty of public good will, only a third of New Yorkers said they approve of the Republican Governor's job performance and only a quarter expressed a favorable opinion of him. Even when the public's disaffection with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was peaking last October, his job approval rating stood at 46 percent -- 13 percentage points higher than Mr. Pataki is getting now. 
 Beneath Mr. Pataki's low ratings runs a deep vein of public anxiety about his austere budget, now the center of heated debate in Albany. New Yorkers have said they do want change in Albany, but in the latest poll, large margins say they disapprove of his specific proposals to reduce or freeze state spending in several major areas.
When asked if they thought the Governor's plan to cut state assistance to the State University of New York by one third was a good idea, 79 percent said it was not. Asked if his proposal to freeze state aid to public schools would help or hurt education in the state, 56 percent said they thought it would hurt. And 92 percent of the poll respondents disapproved when asked what they thought of the plan to reduce home health care for the elderly poor "as part of the effort to try to balance the budget."
And while a thin plurality of people said they believed that Mr. Pataki's plan to cut income taxes by 25 percent over four years would generally help the economy, two out of three New Yorkers said they would prefer a smaller tax cut if it meant that state services would be preserved.
In one of the unexpected findings of the poll, there were relatively small differences between regions. Just 39 percent of respondents upstate, Mr. Pataki's political base, said they approved of his performance, compared with 26 percent in New York City, where Mr. Pataki's support has been weakest.
Mr. Pataki has said repeatedly that the electorate handed him a mandate last November to make government smaller. "We will begin where the people want us to begin -- reducing the size and cost of government and getting rid of unnecessary and counterproductive programs," he said in his inaugural address in January.
But the poll found that the public is wary of Mr. Pataki's agenda. Most of the people surveyed were unwilling to abandon many of the programs the Governor wants to reduce or eliminate.
There were a few positive trends for Mr. Pataki. Despite Democratic efforts to portray him as a weak leader, 49 percent of registered voters said Mr. Pataki has strong leadership qualities, an increase of 14 percentage points from October.
And though only 27 percent of these people said they have a favorable opinion of Mr. Pataki -- a surprisingly low number for a new Governor -- that is still 9 percentage points higher than in the fall.
The statewide telephone poll of 1,205 adults was conducted April 26 through April 30 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Zenia Mucha, the Governor's director of communications, said Mr. Pataki's own pollsters are finding that he has a significantly higher approval rating.
"The only point on which your numbers and our numbers agree is the fact that New Yorkers recognize Governor Pataki's strong, principled leadership and know that he is going to bring about the sweeping, fundamental change that the people have demanded," she said.
The public's opinion of Mr. Pataki may have been influenced by the intense advertising campaigns that have been waged for and against his budget over the last three months. But because large amounts of money were spent on both sides, it is difficult to gauge whether the Governor's image was damaged or enhanced.
Over all, the poll found that that the Governor was standing on unsteady political ground. A virtually unknown State Senator before last year, Mr. Pataki won with just 49 percent of the vote, largely by capitalizing on anti-Cuomo sentiment without sharply defining himself to a restive electorate bent on change.
The poll suggests that many people who voted for Mr. Pataki did so out of anger or weariness with Mr. Cuomo and are not firmly allied to the new Governor even now.
Many respondents were like Elaine Nichols, a 56-year-old clerical worker from Otsego County in central New York. In a follow-up interview, Ms. Nichols said she is a Republican who voted for Mr. Pataki last year because she was tired of Mr. Cuomo. But now, she said, she is concerned that the new Governor's budget cuts will put people on the unemployment lines while his tax cuts will aid only the wealthy and not people like herself.
"He's pushing, pushing, pushing too fast, and it's cutting everyone out of work," she said. "A lot of people with a lot of money don't get hurt, while we poor people do."
Mr. Pataki also seems to remain something of an enigma to many people; 42 percent of those surveyed said they still do not have an opinion of him or do not know enough about him to form one.
And those who do have opinions tend to have negative ones. Fifty-two percent said they think Mr. Pataki does not care about their needs and problems. Forty percent said they believe the overall quality of life will diminish under Mr. Pataki, compared with 27 percent who thought it would improve. And 42 percent said he is moving too quickly to change the state's direction, compared with 27 percent who think he is proceeding at the right pace.
There was a strongly partisan quality to many of the answers. Fifty-eight percent of the people who identified themselves as Republicans or Conservatives said they approved of Mr. Pataki's performance, compared with 17 percent of those who called themselves Democrats or Liberals.
Answers also varied widely based on the respondent's race. Four out of five blacks disapproved of Mr. Pataki's performance, while whites were almost evenly divided: 43 percent said they approve of his performance, and 38 percent said they disapprove.
There was a broad consensus cutting across racial, regional and economic lines that Mr. Pataki's tax cut plan may be too ambitious. Fifty-three percent of people earning $75,000 a year or more -- those who would benefit most from his tax cut proposal -- said they would prefer a smaller cut in order to preserve state services. Larger proportions of lower-income New Yorkers said they also supported the smaller cut.
Even Republicans were ambivalent on this issue, with 50 percent saying they would prefer a smaller tax cut and 39 percent saying they support Mr. Pataki's plan.
The question posed was: "Governor Pataki has proposed a 25 percent cut in income taxes over four years. He has also proposed to reduce spending on government services by 4 percent, or $1.2 billion. Would you prefer that tax cut, or would you prefer a smaller cut that would require a smaller reduction in government services?"
The New Yorkers surveyed said they did agree with the Governor on at least one point, reducing state spending on welfare. Fifty-six percent said current benefit levels are too generous. Mr. Pataki has called for cutting welfare grants by as much as 25 percent.
Sixty-two percent said welfare mothers should not receive greater benefits when they have additional children, a policy that many Republicans support but that Mr. Pataki has not yet proposed.
More than 90 percent of the people polled endorsed the policy of requiring welfare recipients to work for their checks, with 61 percent saying this should include mothers. That mirrors findings in recent national surveys.
But New Yorkers rejected the idea of setting time limits on welfare, saying the poor should be allowed to receive benefits as long as they work for them. Mr. Pataki has proposed cutting off welfare payments to able-bodied single adults after 60 days, a policy firmly opposed by Democratic lawmakers.
Asked which problems they want Mr. Pataki to focus on, people ranked crime, welfare, taxes and education about equally.
On the state budget, now 34 days late, New Yorkers sided with the Governor, defying accepted Albany wisdom that governors are held responsible for late budgets. Only 9 percent of those surveyed said it was solely Mr. Pataki's fault that the budget is overdue. Twenty-six percent blamed the Legislature while 58 percent laid blame equally on the Governor and legislators.
In follow-up interviews, respondents often expressed anger about specific budget cuts proposed by Mr. Pataki. "I did vote for him and now I'm sorry," said Gertrude Sunk, a 77-year-old Columbia County resident who fears she will lose home health-care services if Mr. Pataki's budget is approved. "I thought he would help us. It seems he is against us."
The poll also showed that 24 percent of registered voters have favorable opinions of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's chief political patron last year, compared with 45 percent who have unfavorable ones. Mr. D'Amato's Democratic colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, was viewed favorably by 45 percent of those registered voters and unfavorably by 15 percent.
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times poll of New York State is based on telephone interviews conducted from April 26 to 30 with 1,205 adults throughout the state. Interviews were done in either English or Spanish.
The random sample of telephone numbers was provided by Survey Sampling Inc. of Fairfield, Conn.
Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines in the residence, as well as to adjust for variations relating to the region of the state, race, sex, age and education.
According to statistical theory, in 19 out of 20 cases the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adults in New York State.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for results based only on residents of New York City, it would be plus or minus 4 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of the questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: From Washington, The Fading Pension

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
For more than a decade, the Government has been tinkering with the nation's pension system, largely in the name of two good causes: cutting the deficit and making retirement benefits more equitable.
The cumulative effect of all the tinkering, however, has been anything but good, says a growing chorus of pension experts and economists. The changes, whose impact is only now being fully recognized, threaten the retirement benefits of many of the 41 million workers covered by traditional company-financed pension plans, they say. Because some changes are just kicking in and come into play over many years, baby boomers as well as those who have recently entered the labor force, the so-called Generation X, will be most affected. 
 Some of the impact is already being felt, by higher-income executives now entering retirement. Eventually, the experts say, even those at modest income levels will feel the pain.
There are four major forces at work.
One series of changes drastically restricts the amount of money that businesses can put aside each year as long-term savings to finance traditional pensions. That reduces the tax deductions that businesses can claim for this purpose, thus raising more revenue for the Government. Under these changes, the Government now requires employers to slash pension contributions when employees are young, counting on the companies to make up for it many years later. This long delay in financing raises questions about whether the pensions will be there when the employees retire.
A second set of changes, completed in 1993, has lowered the maximum salary used to calculate future pensions to $150,000. While seemingly generous today, that amount, after adjusting for decades of inflation, could fall short in providing an adequate retirement income for young workers and is already restricting pension contributions for some of them.
A third set of changes, begun more than a decade ago, was aimed at limiting pension benefits available to the most affluent workers by capping the amount that the plans can pay out each year and still qualify for favorable tax treatment. Because of adjustments for inflation, the cap for retirement at age 65 has gone up a bit lately, to $120,000. But caps for early retirement were severely restricted last year. For now, these changes mostly affect early retirees with relatively generous pensions.
The last factor is the exploding number and complexity of regulations needed to carry out these and many other changes. The costs of compliance can be high -- small companies must now spend about $500 a year a worker -- giving many employers another excuse to drop traditional pensions. In their place, employers are often sponsoring 401(k) plans, which involve less red tape and are mostly financed by employees. And some companies are offering no plan at all.
The unintended consequence of all the changes, the experts contend, is a further unraveling of the safety net that American workers have long counted on for their later years. Along with growing fears about the Social Security and Medicare systems, these concerns will serve only to remind most Americans that they need to rely more on their own resources for retirement.
The situation has become so dire that Congress must act quickly "to reverse Government policies that are strangling private pensions and threatening their financial soundness," warns the Committee for Economic Development, a group that represents large companies, in a report being released today.
Officials at the Treasury and Labor Departments and at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal agency that takes over failed pension plans, all declined to comment yesterday on the record. But they say the health of the nation's pension system is improving and that the outside critics may be cherry-picking unusual examples to support their case.
To be sure, even the critics say the dire outcomes that they forecast can be avoided. That will require even more tinkering, they say, but of a kind that reverses the current direction.
For now, the critics say, Washington's policies are restricting the flow of dollars into the huge pension portion of the national savings pool at a time when the Government says a higher savings level is crucial to the long-term health of the country.
Indeed, while other factors are also at play, last year's contribution per worker for traditional pensions, known as defined benefit plans, was nearly 50 percent below the peak in 1978, adjusted for inflation, and barely above the level in 1964, according to Sylvester J. Schieber, vice president for research at the Wyatt Company, a benefits consulting group.
The tinkering, during both Democratic and Republican administrations, has come in a series of disconnected and often obscure legislative steps going back to 1982, including provisions tucked into a bill last year approving the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Under the 1994 legislation, Congress sharply lowered the maximum pension for highly paid workers who take early retirement. Under a typical plan, a company previously allowed an employee, eligible at 65 for a $120,000 pension, to receive $94,200 if he retired at 55, Mr. Schieber said. But the Government's new rules now limit the payout to $53,558.
Given the trends, workers of more modest means who are approaching retirement will be affected before long, the experts warn. "The way Congress has been ratcheting down pension contributions every two years or so, I expect that within a decade people making $40,000 or $50,000 who stayed with one company will not be able to collect full pensions," said Edwin Hustead, a vice president at the Hay/Huggins Company, another benefits concern.
But it is the Generation X worker on whom the pension contributions ax has fallen most sharply. Under the latest rules, contributions to a typical plan for a 25-year-old employee have been slashed nearly 80 percent during the early years of the worker's career.
The shortfall is supposed to be made up during the second half of the employee's career by increasing contributions as much as 18-fold, according to Wyatt. That means Generation X workers must wait until then to have 75 percent of the contributions made to their plans. In the past, there were much smaller differences in contribution levels based on age.
The experts fear that some companies will not be around when the bigger contributions are due. A failure by an employer in the early or middle years of a worker's career could thus mean sharply reduced retirement benefits or added burdens on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. They worry, too, that employers that are around may choose to dump older workers for younger ones, thus avoiding the big payments, or to terminate their pension plans.
Another complex rule with consequences for younger, less affluent workers involves the new $150,000 salary cap for calculating future benefits.
Mr. Schieber cited the example of a 35-year-old worker making $35,000 a year. The law requires companies to project likely pay increases, and if the employer adopts 5.5 percent as an annual average, the calculation shows that the worker will make $165,000 in the year he turns 65, or $15,000 more than the cap. Therefore, the Government says, only the portion of the employee's current pay that can be extrapolated to $150,000 at age 65 -- in this case, $31,752 -- can be used to calculate this year's pension contribution. This kind of approach, critics say, could leave many workers with a smaller pension.
In its report being released today, the Committee for Economic Development also cites the cost of complying with anti-discrimination provisions as a serious drag on pension financing. Under such provisions, a pension plan must provide significant benefits for rank-and-file workers, not just executives, to qualify for favorable tax treatment.
Complying with these rules, which run more than 600 pages, requires "an army of lawyers, actuaries and accountants, who often seem to be the major beneficiaries of the legislation," the report says.
A Hay/Huggins study estimated that the costs in 1990 of complying with 11 major pension regulations came to $455 an employee for a company with 15 or fewer workers. More rules have been added in the last five years. (The annual cost for the largest companies, which can spread the burden over a much bigger work force, is about $50 an employee.)
Many of the fairness rules dealt effectively with serious abuses, said Thomas Ochsenschlager, the senior tax partner at the Grant Thornton accounting firm. "There was a time when we could, and did, work up a plan that was totally qualified under the law, but would benefit only the owners of a company," he said.
But now, with administrative costs so high, Mr. Ochsenschlager said he concurred with the business committee's proposal to exempt companies from the rules if they make pension benefits proportionate for all workers based on their salaries, up to the $150,000 cap.
Something will have to change, nearly all the experts say. They argue that Washington needs to find a way to cut the deficit other than nibbling away at pension benefits.
"On the one hand we want to collect all the taxes we can today," said Olivia S. Mitchell, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of its Pension Research Council. "On the other, we want to increase retirement savings."
When it comes to pensions, the experts say, the hard reality is that you can't do both.

HEADLINE: A First Step on Cuba?;
Americans Say the Accord on Immigration Might Be Followed by Other Agreements

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's new policy on Cuban immigration, the product of the highest level of American-Cuban cooperation in more than a decade, could signal a new level of engagement between the two countries.
Moreover, the new immigration policy -- made possible by an agreement secretly negotiated by senior diplomats from the two countries and announced on Tuesday -- could be followed by engagement on other areas of mutual interest, like the fight against narcotics or environmental problems, American officials said. 
 At the least, the Administration's decision to admit the 21,000 Cubans being held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station and to send future "boat people" back to Cuba is expected to have immediate major benefits for both Governments.
For the Clinton Administration, the new policy will head off rioting at the base and prevent a surge of boat people like the one last summer, American officials say. For Fidel Castro, it will spare him the embarrassment over the boat people, who have scared off European and Latin investors and tourists. The Cuban leader is also happy to see Guantanamo emptied of 21,000 Cubans, these officials said, because the presence of thousands of angry anti-Castro refugees there was viewed as a security threat.
The new immigration policy may also indicate a new pragmatic approach to Cuba in which Washington will sometimes be willing to offend Cuban-American groups -- which condemned the decision to repatriate future boat people -- when it is convinced it is pursuing the wisest policy.
Administration officials say they have not written off the Cuban-Americans or Florida's 25 electoral votes in the 1996 Presidental election. Rather, they insist, they were selecting the policy with the best chance of keeping the immigration situation from exploding this summer.
To handle this delicate subject, the Administration secretly sent Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, the third-ranking official in the State Department, to talks with Ricardo Alarcon, the chairman of Cuba's National Assembly. It was the highest-level meeting of American and Cuban officials since United States diplomats maneuvered to stop the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980.
Cuban-American groups said they were outraged that the Administration did not consult with them. They also expressed alarm that the cooperation exhibited in sealing the accord could portend a full normalization of relations with Cuba.
Senior Administration officials deny that the immigration agreement is the first step toward normalizing relations. "It's nothing more than one of several agreements we've reached with Cuba on immigration," said a White House official.
The policy could also pave the way for the Administration to roll back some of the sanctions imposed on Cuba last August to punish Mr. Castro for not cutting off the flow of boat people last summer.
The steps under consideration, Administration officials said, include making it easier for scientists, artists and academics to travel between the two countries and relaxing restrictions that prevent many Cuban-Americans from visiting relatives in Cuba. Senior Administration officials insisted these steps would not weaken the three-decade-old trade embargo against Cuba and are not intended to reward Havana.
"We want to take steps that we believe will lead to the evolution to democracy in Cuba," a senior Administration official said.
But some Republicans in Congress scoffed at the notion that the measures will cause Mr. Castro to take substantial steps toward democracy. Others held strategy sessions today to devise ways of countering the new policy. One proposal would forbid the Defense Department from using money to repatriate political refugees from Communist countries. Also under consideration is a proposal to accelerate approval of legislation to tighten sanctions on Cuba.
"Senator Helms thinks it's very important that Congress reassert that its policy is to isolate Castro and not cooperate with him," said Mark Thiessen, a spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The Administration argues that any further opening to increase the flow of ideas to Cuba is nothing more than carrying out the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which Bill Clinton endorsed as a presidential candidate. The act tightened the economic embargo but also outlined steps to increase telecommunications ties and the flow of ideas between the two countries.
Representative Robert Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who sponsored the act, said increasing ties between Cubans and Americans is a certain way to undermine Mr. Castro. "The opening up of telecommunications provided probably greater problems for Castro than economic pressure," he said. "It doesn't help Castro to have Cubans-Americans talking at night to relatives in Cuba about their quality of life and plans for the future."

HEADLINE: Economic Data Show a Slowing Of U.S. Growth for Rest of Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
The Government index designed to forecast the economy fell in March for the second consecutive month, pointing to subdued growth for the balance of 1995.
While the data suggested that the economy would continue to slow in the next six months, factors ranging from a solid job market to strength in stocks suggested, some analysts said, that the slowdown would come without a recession -- nearly the model of the "soft landing" of noninflationary growth sought by Federal Reserve policy makers and hoped for by the markets. 
 "Things are really slowing down here," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber and a former president of the Forecasters Club of New York. "But I don't think we'll have a recession."
Investors were heartened by the latest evidence of a soft landing, with its promise of low inflation that keeps the value of bonds intact. That helped bond prices surge, sending interest rates to their lowest level in nearly a year. [Page D20.]
The bond rally spilled over into stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 44.27 points to another record. [Page D10.]
The markets were also bolstered by a separate report from the Commerce Department showing that new orders for factory goods edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in March. It was a surprisingly weak performance in light of partial figures published last week showing that orders for the durable goods component -- items lasting three years or more -- had risen six-tenths of 1 percent.
"It's further confirmation that the manufacturing sector and the economy in general have slowed sharply in the first half of the year," said John R. Williams, a top economist at Bankers Trust.
The index of leading indicators, created to call turns in the economy, is not the most reliable barometer. But investors often choose to see what they want in economic reports. And investors right now seem to be anxious for signs that the Federal Reserve's strategy of raising interest rates to moderate the pace of the economy has worked. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates seven times since February 1994.
The Commerce Department said today that the index declined five-tenths of 1 percent for the month, the biggest decline in two years and the first back-to-back declines since the late summer of 1992.
This followed a dip of two-tenths of 1 percent in February and an unchanged reading for January.
Despite a rule of thumb that three consecutive declines in the forecasting index portend a recession six to nine months ahead, few analysts believe one is anywhere in sight. The necessary "earmarks," particularly a deterioration in the job market and in incomes, "are just not there," Mr. Williams of Bankers Trust said.
Indeed, based on some later figures, economists said the index would post an increase for April as stock prices advanced smartly and consumer expectations rebounded after three straight declines.
And even if the index fell for a third time, the department cautioned that a reversal in its direction did not signal a turn in the business cycle unless the move was of "significant" size and scope as well as duration. The two declines so far have not been very big nor particularly widespread, with less than 60 percent of the components moving negatively, on average, in February and March. This is why the rule of thumb is not so reliable.
The probability of recession has now edged up to only about one in eight, estimated Michael P. Niemira, an economist with Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
In March, 6 of the 11 index components were negatives while 3 made positive contributions and the other 2 were either unchanged or so little changed as to round to zero.
The biggest drag was vendor performance, a gauge of how long it takes for companies to get orders delivered from their suppliers. Faster service implies few of the bottlenecks that characterize an overheated economy.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is said to watch this with particular interest, but analysts are widely agreed that no recent figures are likely to change the view that monetary policy is "on hold" and will likely remain so pending some economic results for the second half of the year.
Growth at about a 2 percent rate for the April-June quarter is now a typical prediction, down from a 2.8 percent pace in the first quarter.
Other negative items in the March index were lower consumer expectations (since reversed), lower prices for materials especially sensitive to business conditions, a shorter average workweek, a decline in building permits, and fewer new orders for consumer goods and materials.
The rise in stock prices was the biggest force supporting the index, followed by higher contracts and orders for plant and equipment and a rise in unfilled orders to factories for long-lived goods.
First-time claims for state jobless benefits were unchanged and the money supply rose so little as to have no impact on the index.
Companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent and four-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, the Commerce Department report also showed.
This meant that the ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, which is considered a useful alternative predictor, declined for the third straight month, though less than in February.
The report on factories showed orders for nondurables skidding seven-tenths of 1 percent in March, the biggest decline since July 1993. Orders for durables were up five-tenths of 1 percent, slightly less than the estimate of six-tenths of 1 percent estimated last week.

HEADLINE: New Fulton Market Lease Includes Big Rent Increase

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
In an apparent breakthrough in attempts to keep the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan, the city reached an agreement yesterday on a new lease with a major trade association at the market and won substantial rent increases.
Rents for seven wholesale companies in the structure known as the Tin Building will increase to a total of $650,000 a year in the first three years of a 10-year lease. The dealers now pay a total of $72,000 a year. 
 The agreement signaled a coup for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The 40 wholesale seafood dealers in the market have said a united front was needed to resist steep rent increases. Lawyers for two other trade groups in the market said yesterday that they would resist the city's demands for rent increases, adding they they had not given up the idea of moving the market outside the city or challenging the increases in the courts.
But Joseph L. Forstadt, a lawyer for one of the groups opposing the proposed increases, conceded that yesterday's agreement lessened the possibility of a mass move by the dealers to another location.
"It does not foreclose it," said Mr. Forstadt, "but it certainly puts a damper on it."
Steven D. Dryer, a lawyer for the Fulton Market Fishmongers Association, the group that signed the agreement, said he doubted that the rent increase would lead to higher retail seafood prices in the New York area. The market is the region's major supplier of fish and seafood for retail stores and restaurants.
Giuliani administration officials initiated the negotiations in March after noting that rents -- totaling about $270,000 a year for about 30 companies -- had not been raised since 1982. The city is the landlord for most of the three-block area along South Street in lower Manhattan, where the market has been located for more than 150 years.
Asserting that the Genovese crime family is entrenched at the market, the Giuliani administration has asked the City Council for authority to license and regulate all companies and employees in the market. The Council is expected to approve the proposal later this month.
The seven companies that agreed to the lease, members of the Fishmongers Association, do business in the building that was badly damaged by arson on March 29. Randy Mastro, Mr. Giuliani's chief of staff, and Mr. Dryer said that the total annual rent for the building will be $450,000 starting in May 1996, $550,000 in May 1997 and $650,000 in May 1998.
Increases after that will be based on rises in the consumer price index or in the assessed real-estate value of the property. The rents can not be reduced, even if the index or real-estate values decline, Mr. Mastro said. The lease is for 10 years, with the association having the right to renew it for 15 more years.
Mr. Mastro said that the city expected to begin extensive repairs soon on the Tin Building, so-called because of its aluminum siding, and that rent increases will be phased in over the next 12 months as sections of the building are reopened.
The dealers are now operating only on the ground floor of the three-story structure. The lease is with the association, which assesses rents from its members based on the space they use in the building.
Mr. Dryer said that members of the Fishmongers Association felt that they had no choice. "My clients believe this is a large amount of money to pay," he said, "but the city is going to repair a burned out building and give us a long-term lease."
Mr. Mastro said that a fire insurance policy would cover $2.7 million of the repairs but that the total renovation costs were not clear.
Mr. Mastro said the the agreement had been reached despite warnings by some dealers that higher rents would force merchants to leave New York or go out of business. "Now we see there is a commitment not only on the city's part but also by major businesses to stay in the market and to improve the climate for everyone," he added.
Until the fire, the Fishmongers Association handled about 25 percent of the market's business, Mr. Mastro said. The market is the nation's largest wholesale seafood center, with 1,000 jobs. It generates between $800 million and $1 billion annually in sales and in wages, the city says.
The city's Economic Development Corporation, the agency negotiating the leases, is expected to begin talks next week with the New York Wholesale Fishdealers Association, a trade group that represents 12 companies in the market.

HEADLINE: Gains in Sales At Toyota and Ford in April

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 3

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation defied the auto industry's pattern today by reporting better sales in April.
But even with the gains, the overall record of the industry remains weak this year and suggests that Americans are retreating from the buying boom that helped produce record profits for domestic producers in 1994. 
 The deliveries of cars and light trucks for Ford rose 3.6 percent from April 1994 on the strength of the company's 19th consecutive monthly record for trucks. Toyota, the largest foreign-based auto maker, said daily sales rose 2.1 percent.
Still, auto sales in the United States fell 6.1 percent last month from the level a year earlier. European manufacturers as a group posted an increase in sales, but they accounted for less than 4 percent of the market. Sales by the Big Three domestic auto makers were down 6 percent, while sales by Asian companies dropped 9.5 percent.
It was the fourth consecutive month of declines in auto sales, and came against a backdrop of other evidence suggesting that the American economy was slowing down. The Government said today that its main economic forecasting gauge reported the biggest drop in two years, partly as a result of weakening consumer demand.
An economic slowdown does not necessarily mean that consumers will sharply reduce their purchases of cars and other expensive items. But it suggests that they may be getting more particular about the way they spend.
"There are other things people want to do with their money at this point in time," said Art Spinella of CNW Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore.
In 1984 new vehicles ranked third on the list of large purchases that people planned during the next 12 months, the surveys by the company found. In January of this year new vehicles ranked 11th, behind "everything from in-home computers, high-end electronics and home improvements to taking vacations," Mr. Spinella said.
The auto makers have predicted a healthy 1995 for the industry. Economists at Ford, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation say they expect vehicle sales to match or surpass the levels of 1994.
But "business isn't as good as it should be, given the fundamentals," an analyst for Ford, Joel Pitcoff, said.
A number of factors might have exaggerated the decline in sales from April 1994 to April 1995.
The month had five weekends last year and none was an Easter holiday weekend. Weekends are normally strong selling periods and holiday weekends are weak. April of this year had five weekends, but one included Easter.

HEADLINE: 4 Traders of Foreign Debt Are Indicted for Defrauding 3 Banks

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Four traders in foreign debt have been indicted on charges that they defrauded First National Bank of Chicago, Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. and Banco Ganadero of Colombia.
The three indictments, which were announced yesterday, said the traders were covertly taking fees that belonged to the three banks. 
 A former banker for First Chicago, Waldemar N. Jezler, 42, is accused of brokering transactions in Brazilian trade credit obligations through his firm in Rye, N.Y., Tandem Trading Inc., from October 1989 to June 1990.
The three other traders, Carlos A. Abadi, 35, a former assistant vice president at First National; Miguel C. Timponi, a former vice president of Algemene, which is now ABN-Amro, and Juan B. Echeverri, a former executive vice president of Banco Ganadero, "shared in the fees paid out by their employers in connection with the trade commitment transfers" made through Tandem, the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said at a news conference yesterday.
Mr. Jezler, who left First Chicago in 1990, paid $2 million of kickbacks to the three traders, the District Attorney's office said, and the four men together paid more than $6 million into foreign bank accounts and offshore corporations. In addition, Mr. Jezler, Mr. Tandem and Mr. Abadi are charged with failing to report as income the $6 million diverted to the offshore corporations. The four traders were arraigned in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday.
The indictments, handed up by a state grand jury, also charge four companies: Tandem Trading; Merlin Overseas Ltd. of St. Johns, Antigua; Nacional Holdings Ltd. of St. Johns, Antigua, and Vikingo Corporation of Tortola, British Virgin Islands, with involvement in the scheme to defraud the banks.
A lawyer for Mr. Abadi reacted sharply to the indictments. "These charges are an injustice to Mr. Abadi and his family," said Bill Schwarz, who is representing the former First Chicago banker.
"Carlos Abadi is a highly ethical professional who served his employer loyally and always acted in its best interests," Mr. Schwarz added. "He is completely innocent and will be vindicated."
Mr. Abadi was senior foreign debt trader for First Chicago in New York until he left the firm in 1991. He now runs a money management firm that mainly handles investments for wealthy Latin Americans.
Mr. Jezler did not respond to messages left with his office at Tandem Trading in Rye, and Mr. Timponi did not return telephone calls left at his home in Miami. Mr. Echeverri, who lives in Coconut Grove, Fla., could not be reached for comment.
The four traders each face one count of grand larceny, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. They also face bribery, conspiracy and fraud charges, each of which carries a sentence of up to four years in prison.
First Chicago, the parent of First National, reacted cautiously to the indictments. "All corporations, particularly financial institutions, rely on the integrity of their employees," the bank said in a statement. "It's always distressing when a former employee is accused of improper behavior," the company added, noting that "the accused has the opportunity to defend himself," and "accordingly it would be inappropriate to comment further on this case."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips Against the Mark, But Advances a Bit on the Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the German mark yesterday as worries about British and French elections continued to strengthen the mark.
The dollar edged up against the yen, however, as the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and the Japanese Trade Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, met in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the first day of talks on automotive trade. 
 Political uncertainty in Europe typically bolsters the mark, the currency of the Continent's strongest economy. Yesterday, dealers sold British pounds for marks ahead of local government elections in England and Wales today. The ruling Conservative Party, which has been badly trailing the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls, is expected to fare poorly. The pound fell to 2.2203 marks, from 2.2269 marks on Tuesday.
Dealers also again sold French francs for marks on worries that the winner of Sunday's presidential election in France would not maintain the Government's policy of supporting a strong franc. The mark rose to 3.5675 francs from an early low of 3.5595 francs, though the mark was down from 3.5689 francs on Tuesday.
"Political uncertainty in the U.K. and France" is bolstering the mark, said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York.
A strong mark hurts the dollar because dealers often sell dollars to buy other currencies for mark transactions. The dollar has dropped 9 percent against the mark so far this year.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.3745 marks from 1.3787 marks on Tuesday. The pound rose to $1.6154 from $1.6152. The dollar was quoted at 83.71 yen, up from 83.63 yen.
The dollar recovered from early losses against the yen after Mr. Kantor said that the auto trade talks with Japan might be extended to tomorrow and that "we're prepared to make progress within the next three days." The United States is pressing Japan to further open its auto and auto parts markets.
"Kantor's comments brought the dollar back against the yen," said Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, a dealer with Westdeutsche Landesbank in New York. "But the market is still very nervous about whether anything will come out of this."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Phasing out protection for textiles may take a silver bullet.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
DOES the right hand of the Clinton Administration know what the left hand is doing?
Bill Clinton ran for the White House as a global economic realist, the President who would champion high-paying, high-technology jobs while allowing senescent industries to go gently into that good night. But the bureaucrats who must turn these fine sentiments into day-to-day policy have apparently not gotten the message, digging in against efforts to open markets to everything from Chinese honey to Colombian roses. 
 Actually, the idea that bureaucrats are undermining White House trade policy without the President's knowledge is the charitable view. While President Clinton fought for the last round of global trade liberalization, he never sweated the details. And plans announced last week for phasing out protection for clothing and textiles -- what Kimberly Elliott, a researcher at the Institute of International Economics, calls "the last great bastion of protectionism" -- suggest the President is, at the very least, a passive accomplice to the regression of his own Administration.
No part of the recent world trade agreement was greeted with more enthusiasm by free traders than the commitment to untangle a rat's nest of quotas and tariffs that has governed world trade in apparel and textiles for three decades. Ms. Elliott and Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, estimate that unlimited imports would reduce clothing costs in the United States by 18 percent.
Price breaks would almost certainly be steepest at the low end -- underwear, children's apparel, cotton pants and shirts -- where the struggling middle class does its shopping. "The benefits should add up to as much as the House Republicans' proposed middle class tax cut," said Robin Lenier, a lobbyist for clothing retailers, "and it wouldn't cost Washington a penny."
What's more, the jobs at risk are not the ones America has been mourning since the 1970's. They typically pay less than $7 an hour. And if there is one clear lesson from a decade of booming employment and slipping wages, America has no problem replacing bad jobs.
But as the retailers are discovering, it will take a silver bullet to kill the global quota system
known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement. The United States has 10 years to get with the program, and the Washington bureaucrats who just firmed up plans to phase out protection are plainly in no hurry. Phase I (1995-97) includes such treasured items as parachutes and seat belts. Phases II and III, extending to 2004, cover just 11 percent of the categories where quotas actually bite.
Retailers initially expected that some of the pressure on clothing prices would be relieved by a parallel agreement allowing the volume of imports entering under quota to expand. But the numbers hammered out at Geneva are too modest to make a dent: Demand for clothing is still likely to outpace quota-constrained supply.
That will leave the domestic industry sitting pretty until it falls off a precipice in 2005. Some 150,000 jobs, albeit very low-paying jobs, would be put at risk in a single year rather than phased out over a decade. "We knew the phase-out schedule would be backloaded, but this is worse than we feared," Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, lamented.
The smart money says it will never come to that. Once the precipice is in view, Congress will likely break the trade accord, extending the quota unilaterally. As a last resort, domestic apparel producers could ask the International Trade Commission to impose "temporary" quotas to save them from injury from the expected surge of imports -- a tactic akin to that of a parent killer who demands mercy as an orphan.
There is no shortage of villains. Rita Hayes, the Commerce Department official who wrote the rules, has close ties to Congressmen from the Southern textile states. So does Jennifer Hillman, the deputy to the United States trade representative in charge of apparel. Her boss, Mickey Kantor, has made no secret of his sympathies, announcing just one day after public hearings that there would be no changes in the proposed phase-out schedule. And, of course, there is Mr. Kantor's boss, Bill Clinton, who appointed them all.
But in a tepid defense of the President, Ms. Lenier points out that his Administration is merely going along with a game that started long, long ago. "The program stinks -- and the program's 30 years old," she said. While Republican Presidents were ideologically committed to free trade and not beholden to the apparel makers' unions, they, too, avoided tangling with the textile lobby.
The tragedy here is President Clinton's inability to break free from interest group politics as usual. The New Democrat pledged to reconcile liberal sympathies for the losers in the capitalist free-for-all with the new realities of a globally integrated economy has been left with the dirty work of defending the industrial dinosaurs.

HEADLINE: Second Night of Caution at Auction

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Where has the passion gone? While the buyers were out in full force last night at Christie's sale of contemporary art, caution was the watchword. Works sold, but few takers were willing to reach for the stars and push prices beyond their estimates.
The sale totaled $11.3 million, not too far below Christie's estimate of $13 million to $17 million. Of the 52 works offered, 44 found buyers. Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Tuesday night made $13 million, also below the house estimate of $15.7 million to $22 million. At Sotheby's, 36 of the 46 works found buyers. Americans dominated the buying on both nights. 
 "There were a lot of buyers tonight, which shows the market is healthy," said Diane Upright, who heads the contemporary art department at Christie's in New York, after the sale. "That things sold within the estimates shows that we're evaluating our market accurately."
Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America and the evening's auctioneer, said he was pleased with the number of bidders. "There was confidence in the market, which was borne out by the percentage of works sold," he said.
Like Sotheby's sale, Christie's contemporary-art auction featured more classic works by artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns, and fewer works by stars of the 1980's. Christie's only had two million-dollar-plus works, Mr. Lichtenstein's "Kiss II" and Jackson Pollock's "Eyes in the Heat II," and many by artists like Donald Judd, Frank Stella and Morris Louis in the $300,000-and-under range. "Above $1 million, the market is still thin," Ms. Upright said.
Last night's sales results were proof. By far the star of the evening was "Kiss II" (1962), one of Mr. Lichtenstein's famous comic-book images of a couple kissing. An unidentified telephone bidder won the painting after fighting it out with an unidentified man in the salesroom. The price was $2.5 million, right at Christie's low estimate.
The seller was Masao Wanibuchi, a Tokyo-based tailor who had bought the painting in May 1990 at Christie's in New York for $6 million, still the record for the artist. Mr. Wanibuchi, who sold Andy Warhol's "Shot Red Marilyn" for $3.6 million at Christie's last fall, tried his luck again last night, but he was willing to take a big loss. "It's a satisfactory price in the current market," Mr. Burge said.
Mr. Lichtenstein has been the one of the highest-profile artists not only of the week, but also of the last six months. "The Nurse" (1964), another comic-book image of one of his prototypical blondes, was sold at Sotheby's on Tuesday night to an unidentified American collector bidding by phone for $1.6 million, just above its estimate of $1.5 million. Last fall, the SoHo dealer Holly Solomon, sold "I . . . I'm Sorry" (1965-66) to Eli Broad, the Los Angeles collector, for $2.5 million, its high estimate.
(Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Unlike the Pop art, the important Abstract Expressionist did not fare well. Pollock's "Eyes in the Heat II" (1947), a densely painted work in which the artist applied silver-colored paint with both a palette knife and a brush, and also squeezed his paint onto the canvas directly from the tube, failed to sell. Although there were two bidders in the salesroom, no one was willing to pay more than $880,000, far below its estimate of $1.2 million to $1.8 million.
Another Abstract Expressionist work, Clyfford Still's "Untitled" (1946-47), also went unsold. Bidding never rose above $480,000, far below its estimate of $750,000 to $950,000. (Still has notoriously poor results at auction.) But two small untitled Rothkos had lots of takers. One from 1960-61, estimated at $180,000 to $220,000, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $266,500. Another, from 1959, sold to Abigail Asher, a dealer, for $354,500, well above its $250,000-to-$300,000 estimate.
Gerhard Richter also brought some life to the auction room. "Alster" (1963), a dreamy view of Alster, a lake in the center of Hamburg, estimated at $150,000 to $180,000, was sold to a telephone bidder for $299,500, far above its high estimate of $180,000. At Sotheby's on Tuesday night, another Richter, "Corner of the Cathedral" (1987), was expected to sell for $300,000 to $400,000 but soared to $662,500.
Sculpture is one area of the market that has been strong recently. Last night Isamu Nocuhi's "Sun" (1963), an exquisitely carved white marble circle that had sat in the architect Gordon Bunshaft's East Hampton, L.I., garden, was bought by Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer for $552,500, just above Christie's $450,000 estimate. The sculpture was sold by the Museum of Modern Art, which had been bequeathed it by the architect Gordon Bunshaft and his wife, Nina. The proceeds are to go for acquisitions in the museum's department of painting and sculpture.
Alexander Calder, once considered recession-proof, was tested again last night. Among his works for sale at Christie's were "Five Points" (1957), a large black-painted steel sculpture from the estate of the cartoonist Robert Osborn and his wife, Elodie, was expected to fetch $600,000 to $800,000. It sold to Ms. Asher for $640,500. A large Calder mobile, "Double Gong" (1953) failed to sell at Sotheby's on Tuesday night. After an estimate of $1 million, bidding stopped at $880,000.
While work by 1980's artists has been scarce this week, what was for sale last night did well. An untitled bronze sculpture by Joel Shapiro from 1986-87 was bought by an unidentified American collector for $288,500, nicely above its $250,000 high estimate and a record price for the artist. And Eric Fischl's "Love" (1981), estimated at $70,000 to $90,000, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $195,000.
One artist who has been having a renaissance for some time is Andy Warhol. This was true last night, too. Warhol's "Double Elvis" 1963), a portrait of Elvis Presley as a cowboy against a silver background, based on publicity stills from Presley's 1960 Western "Flaming Star," was expected to bring $600,000 to $800,000 and brought only $497,500 from an unidentified telephone bidder.
But the biggest surprise of the evening came from Warhol's "Nine Multicolored Marilyns (Reversal Series)," from 1979. Suddenly the salesroom erupted with bidders. At one point, three Christie's employees on the telephones were calling out bids, and hands were waving in the audience. As the price rose, the number of bidders diminished until it was down to two. An unidentified American collector bidding by phone was the winner, paying $585,500, nearly twice its high estimate of $300,000. Mr. Burge proclaimed the moment "an old-fashioned duel," but many people were perplexed. The Marilyn Monroe Reversal series is not rare.
"Somebody spent a lot of money on a very boring Warhol," said Elaine Dannheisser, a prominent New York collector. "Obviously they had a lot of money and didn't know what to do with it."

HEADLINE: Europe Still Gives Big Doses of Money To Help the Arts

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 1

 BODY:
Lionel Jospin is a socialist and Jacques Chirac a conservative, but when it comes to cultural policy, it is hard to tell they are competing fiercely for the French Presidency in Sunday's runoff election: both have pledged to keep pouring vast amounts of taxpayers' money into the arts. This is, of course, a French tradition.
While most American cultural institutions depend largely on wealthy patrons and corporate sponsors for financing, governments here have long sustained the arts. Indeed, France's subsidy system today is considered essential to keeping Anglo-Saxon culture at bay. True, the candidates are also acting out of self-interest. France's cultural elite, pampered by President Francois Mitterrand over the last 14 years, would very likely savage any politician who threatened its privileges. So instead, Mr. Jospin and Mr. Chirac are busily wooing leading artists and intellectuals. 
 France's movie lobby, for example, is already confident of continued aid. "Cinema is a topic of consensus in the French election campaign," said Daniel Toscan du Plantier, the president of Unifrance, an association of movie producers, directors and actors. "The candidates have run after us."
Yet perhaps the main difference between French and American approaches to culture is to be found in the electorate itself. With polls showing that a majority of French like the cultural fare they are spoon-fed by the Government, there are no votes to be had from attacking public-sector financing of the arts. Much the same could be said throughout Europe. An economic recession has squeezed cultural budgets and sharpened competition for funds in some countries. In Eastern Europe, the collapse of Communism has decimated long-entrenched subsidy systems, leaving many opera, dance and theater companies close to bankruptcy.
But in contrast to the United States, it is rare today to find a European politician or policy maker who views the arts through either a moral or an ideological prism. Rather, in a region steeped in history, culture is considered a source of national pride and a main ingredient of national identities.
At present, European governments routinely spend 5 to 15 times more per head on culture than the United States. Further, the new Republican leadership in Congress is contemplating large cuts in economic support for the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which currently receive around $450 million a year.
Only in Britain has government financing of the arts been held down as a matter of policy rather than of economic necessity. But culture has not been singled out for punishment: Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Government has been cutting public spending across the board, alienating doctors and nurses as much as performing artists and museum directors. "There's a feeling the arts should better justify spending taxpayers' money," said Jeremy Eckstein, a researcher at the London-based Policy Studies Institute, explaining the Government's position. "But we don't have the vociferous right wing you have in the United States. We have a long way to go before we get into a situation like that."
In fact, even in Britain, optimism is stirring following the decision to use some of the profits of a new national lottery to build or renovate theaters, museums and concert halls. But program financing may still be in short supply. "Lots of people are suspicious that the Government will reduce its own support because of the lottery," Mr. Eckstein said. Lord Gowrie, the chairman of the Arts Council of England, which this year will spend $300 million on culture, is a constant campaigner for more funds. "It is no use having a marvelous new national center for dance and ballet, for instance, if we cannot afford to pay people to dance in it or if our best dancers are being trained to emigrate," he warned recently.
Elsewhere in Europe, it is not unusual to hear theater and museum directors complaining about frozen budgets. Yet the principle of government support for the arts -- and public broadcasting -- is not challenged. Rather, culture is generally viewed as a public service that, despite some corporate sponsoring of cultural events, the public sector is expected to provide. What varies is the way cultural spending is defined (one-third of Denmark's $1.5 billion cultural budget, for instance, goes to libraries) and how taxpayers' money reaches cultural institutions. Further, some countries separate, say, conservation of monuments from financing of the performing arts.
Direct comparisons between cultural budgets are therefore tricky. In Italy, with its wealth of museums, churches and archeological sites, management and preservation of the national heritage is the responsibility of the Ministry of Cultural Assets, which has an annual budget of around $1.2 billion. On the other hand, subsidies for opera houses, orchestras and the movie industry, totaling around $700 million a year, come from the Department of Tourism and Performing Arts.
But in many European countries, financing of both the performing arts and construction of new museums is increasingly being shared by regional and municipal governments that recognize culture to be an important magnet for tourism. The new Guggenheim Museum being built in Bilbao, Spain, for instance, is being paid for largely by the country's Basque region. And Barcelona's new Contemporary Art Museum was jointly financed by the Barcelona and Catalan governments.
In Germany, culture is subsidized almost entirely by the governments of the 16 federal states and three city states, Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen. In 1989, for example, only 5 percent of the $7 billion in tax revenue spent on the arts and museums came from the central government, although this share has since risen as Bonn has moved to aid the five federal states of former East Germany. Andreas Johannes Wiesgand, director of the Bonn-based Center for Cultural Research, has estimated that private patronage of the arts represents only 2 to 3 percent of what the public sector provides in Germany. And the share would be even smaller if government support for public radio and television companies were included.
The director of the London-based International Arts research bureau, Rod Fisher, said Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and France were the European countries with the most developed systems of public financing of the arts. "Things are becoming more difficult everywhere," he said, "but compared to the United States, culture is very well supported in much of Europe."
The last detailed attempt to compare cultural spending in the United States and Europe dates back to a report by the Policy Studies Institute published in 1990 but based on 1987 data. Its broad conclusion, though, is still thought to be valid: that public expenditure on the arts and museums in the United States is far less than in five selected European countries.
The study backed its conclusion by calculating arts expenditure as a percentage of total public expenditure and of the gross domestic product as well as by comparing local, regional and central government arts expenditure per head. For 1987, it estimated total public-sector arts expenditure per head to be $4 in the United States, $19 in Britain, $41 in the Netherlands, $43 in France, $48 in what was then West Germany and $55 in Sweden.
France stands out, though, because its strong tradition of centralized government gives the Culture Ministry enormous power, a power that was reinforced under Mr. Mitterrand, who set the target of giving the ministry 1 percent of the Government budget. In practice, it was achieved only in 1993, and the ministry's share has slipped to 0.91 percent this year. But both Mr. Jospin and Mr. Chirac have pledged to meet this target -- equivalent to about $3 billion per year -- if they win Sunday's election. And they agree that after the outgoing President's concentration on Grands Travaux, or great works, in Paris, it is time to give more attention to the provinces. All that France's artistic world still needs to know, then, is the name of the next Culture Minister.

HEADLINE: The Last Open Space May Come With Tees

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
LIKE the pioneers, they talk about land, wide-open, green and rolling. But their quest in the exurban wilderness is not for a farm in God's country; it's for a $400,000 house with a view of the 18th hole.
"We knew if we bought a place here that no one would put a house in front of us," said Dan Wyckoff, as he and his wife, Jenna, looked out at the vast expanse of fairway beyond their window at Ivanhoe Estates, a 400-acre gated community about 35 miles northwest of Chicago. 
 Golf communities used to be the destinations of retired snowbirds looking for a warm place for the winter: in Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. But now, golf communities are going up in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and they're booming in the Midwest. There are 38 just in the 11 counties surrounding Chicago.
A farmhouse may still sit next to a video store, or a stable of horses may stick their heads out of their stalls on a busy highway, but the landscape feels like wall-to-wall malls, office parks and housing. Those who can afford to buy a house facing the fairway count themselves lucky to look out on some of the last open space in the neighborhood.
Anne and James Marshall live on the 18th fairway at Crystal Tree, a gated golf community about 25 miles southwest of Chicago. With 450 homes ranging from $200,000 to $1.7 million, it was carved out of 600 acres of woodland and old farm fields five years ago.
The Marshalls followed the bulldozers that molded the earth into treacherous sand traps and water hazards for the golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr.
"We ate dirt for two years, ankle deep in mud, trying to figure out where the 18th hole was going to be," Mr. Marshall said. His wife added: "We watched the clubhouse being built. There was a certain romanticism to it."
About 12 percent of the nation's 15,000 golf courses are linked to residential development. Among new courses being built, the percentage of golf communities has stabilized at about 30. Many of the communities are gated, and about half have private courses. The other half allow the public to play for a daily fee of $25 to $100.
In most cases, you don't have to live in the community to play on a private course, but, like the residents themselves, you do have to join the club, which costs an initial $25,000 at Crystal Tree and $50,000 at Ivanhoe, plus annual fees.
Residents inside the gates say they need them for security. But they are also a status symbol. "A lot of times, there's nobody even guarding the gate," said Tim Nugent, who helped his father, Richard Nugent, build the golf course at Ivanhoe. "People buy into these places because they want a sense of belonging. If you say you live at Ivanhoe or Desert Mountain, in Arizona, people know what that means."
Richard McElyea, the president of Economics Research Associates, a real estate consulting firm in San Francisco, said: "Just being inside the gate, so to speak, increases the value of the property by 5 to 10 percent. If you have a to-die-for view, say, over the water, or the 18th green, sometimes that's a 100 percent premium."
And each club has a certain position on the social ladder.
"Crystal Tree is like good old South Siders who stay close to their roots," said Maureen Haberkorn, whose husband, Jack, the owner of the Bonus Electric Company, is president of the golf club. The Haberkorns keep a cooler of beer on the deck for thirsty golfers nearing the 13th hole, which is at their back door.
Mr. Haberkorn, the son of a firefighter, said: "There's no old money here at all. All the children of the industrialists are on the North Side."
Mrs. Haberkorn walks every morning with friends. "One of the girls said she hadn't felt this sense of camaraderie since high school," she said. "And it's the truth."
The Chicago suburbs were once prairie where Indians roamed thousands of years before the first colonists. Now the landscape is rolling bunkers, emerald green fairways and 3,000-square-foot villas big enough to house whole tribes of golfers.
"We're on the edge of civilization out here," said Courtney Luc, standing by her 12-person hot tub overlooking the ninth hole at Ivanhoe. Ms. Luc, a part-time legal secretary, doesn't golf, but she loves walking on the course.
Her husband, Jerry, the president of an electronic control systems company, recalled: "The first night we were here happened to be the Fourth of July. It was really dark and there weren't any people around and a coyote was howling."
Joe Rice went in search of this land about 10 years ago, after his old club losts its course in Deerfield, Ill., when the property was sold for housing.
He found it at a little rural crossroads called Ivanhoe: "I hacked my way through the woods, which was full of mosquitoes," he said. "When I saw the lake, I knew this was it."
What Mr. Rice had stumbled upon was an old golf course built in the 1930's, complete with a 15-acre lake to irrigate the greens and two log cabins to house barrels of beer to irrigate the golfers.
Mr. Rice's club bought all 225 acres for $2 million and built a $3.5 million 18-hole course and a $12 million clubhouse, while residences were developed around it.
Golf roots go deep in Chicago. In 1893, industrialists imported the game from Scotland and formed the Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, one of the first clubs in the country.
There is even a village called Golf (pop. 454) that sprang up about 15 miles northwest of Chicago, simply because the chairman of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad made his engineers stop the train there so he could play a round or two at Glen View Club, one of his favorite clubs. Another train would pick him up later.
The game has long been associated with the rich and the powerful. And the course is still the place where deals are made and character is revealed.
"I wouldn't trust anyone who cheats on a golf course," said Robert Hendricks, a vice president for Anixter Inc., a wiring systems distributor. He and his wife, Sharon, live near the 17th tee at Royal Melbourne, a new golf community northwest of Chicago near Long Grove, Ill. "Like giving the ball the old foot wedge in the woods," he continued. "Golf is a game of honor."
Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks knew enough to site their house near, but not too close to, the 17th green -- away from the line of fire.
"There's one house on the 15th hole that's a natural," Mrs. Hendricks said. "If you pull hook the ball on your second shot you can put it right through the window."
Broken windows are such a problem in some communities that unlucky residents have to install plexiglass, and the club may set up a "window fund," in case some golfer doesn't fess up.
Golf is known largely as a white sport. Of the 24 million Americans who play it, fewer than a million are members of minority groups, said Hugh White, the vice president of research at the New York Times Sports/ Leisure Magazines Group. While club managers at golf communities are quick to say that no bylaws keep minorities out, the lack is glaring.
Elliott Williams, who has played public courses in Chicago for 26 years, said he had never tried to join a private one. "Blacks have been excluded economically, because this is a game that requires a moderate to good income," he said. "And we're just getting to that level now."
Mr. Williams, who owns the Williams Insurance Group in Midlothian, Ill., plans to build a golf community on the South Side of Chicago that he said would welcome African-Americans and serve as an inspiration for young black players.
"It would be upscale housing," he said. "It will be a mixed community, not a private black country club."
Unlike towns that have taken decades to evolve, these instant golf community landscapes seem bland and devoid of character. But to their residents they are oases of peace and a certain controlled beauty.
At Royal Melbourne, Jerry and Dee Cwiok go out their back door and play a few holes in the evening. They watch the frogs in the pond, and the big heron fishing. Mr. Cwiok loves the smell of grass at night, when the water system goes on.
Golf courses have long been notorious for their heavy use of pesticides, but greenskeepers say they have come a long way from the old days, when DDT was used to kill the earthworms that made the greens messy. Many residents said that they were concerned about the use of pesticides on golf courses but that they trusted their greenskeepers to use them judiciously.
"My son plays in the pond near our house, and there are plenty of frogs and turtles," said Dr. David Goldrath, a urologist who lives at Wynstone, a private gated community near Ivanhoe and Royal Melbourne. "We are concerned about the chemicals, which is why we don't live right on the course. But with all these wetlands here, they have to be careful."
Golf has a way of shaping not only the landscape, but also the players' experience as they move through the landscape.
"I like the transition in and out of woods," said Richard Nugent, who designed the course at Ivanhoe. "I like the spatial experience, of being tight and enclosed -- and then coming through an open space. It's also an infinitely varied space: the smells of plants, the sounds of birds. At one hole the wind's in your face; at the next, it's at your back."
As wild plants and animals retreat from the march of Chicago's suburbs, these manicured open spaces, especially those with native grasses, wetlands and a patch of untouched brambly woods, are becoming refuges for species adaptable enough to survive golf carts and bent grass.
Some think this is plenty wild enough.
Ray and Sue Dignan have two sons, Ray Jr., 10, and Kevin, 5. Both boys are already golfing at Crystal Tree, but they also watch the fox lope off into the woods beyond the green in back of their house.
"Look over there," Mr. Dignan said, pointing to a small woods behind a fence. "It's like the northern woods of Wisconsin. It's the best-kept secret on the South Side of Chicago. It's not a flat cornfield. It's a gem."

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
In Search of a Pulse At High Point

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C., April 29

 BODY:
It is claw-and-ball time again in America.
Wending its way from the more than 2,100 companies exhibiting their wares at the International Home Furnishings Market here to a store near you next fall is a tidal wave of prosperous conservatism, furniture that recycles the accouterments of grand houses in grand locales: Newport, R.I.; Savannah, Ga.; Charleston, S.C.; the Hudson River Valley; the south of France; Ireland; the English countryside, and the Scottish Highlands. A few of the pieces are great, many are indifferent, most are brown. 
 What's "in" at the spring edition of America's leading furniture fashion show -- which ends its twice-yearly, two-week run Friday afternoon -- is the past. And as seen by the 69,000 designers, store buyers and journalists from around the world, what's "out" is individuality and most decorative statements that allude to life on the verge of the 21st century.
Six months ago, the talk at High Point, a sleepy, azalea-bedecked city of 70,000, and its environs, was of adventuresome furniture designs and a growing economy. Conversations have now turned to concerns about rising interest rates, a weakened dollar, stagnant new-home sales and that old standby, consumer apathy. In less-than-buoyant times, safety -- namely old-fashioned neo-classicism -- sells.
"There isn't much to see, is there?" the interior designer Mario Buatta said with a sigh.
Still, the industry is growing, but slowly. According to the American Furniture Manufacturers Association, a trade group, $19.8 billion worth of home furnishings was ordered by retailers in 1994, nearly a 10 percent increase over 1993's $18 billion. Analysts predict that orders will reach $21.3 billion by the end of 1995.
Restrained design isn't necessarily a bad idea, of course, either financially or esthetically, but bringing back bread-and-butter basics means more than simply cranking out yet another dozen or two of design history's greatest hits. One trick to enticing wary consumers is to present furniture that looks comfortably familiar but transcends its regularity with a subtle shock of the new.
Several manufacturers rose to the challenge. Rather than promoting the imperial, impersonal grandeur of the famous so-called cottages of Newport, the E. J. Victor company came up with a tidy, tightly edited assortment of livable reproductions authorized by the Preservation Society of Newport County. Notable among the custom-quality upholstered armchairs and bits of chinoiserie was an English Georgian secretary whose diminutive but authentic dimensions -- approximately 30 inches wide, 18 inches deep and 7 feet tall -- made it one of the rare grand historic reproductions that would fit in even the smallest apartment.
Led by Sir Humphrey Wakefield, a fast-talking baronet with an eye for the eccentric, Baker's Stately Homes Collection introduced a line of exuberant Irish Georgian furniture outfitted with details that disregard conventional rules of proportion. Pediments look twice as large as necessary, hairy-paw feet are swollen to bovine breadth, and grapefruit-size ram's heads jut along the front of a marble-topped console table.
Baker also introduced a plainly finished mahogany table whose discreet neo-Gothic silhouette looks as modern now as it must have when a Russian Czar commissioned the original, now in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, in the early 1800's. That piece and another Stately Homes entry -- a Dutch center table inlaid with folk-art stars -- looked far fresher than the strangely stodgy French Provincial line seen at Baker's usually hip spinoff, Milling Road.
Stodgy, too, were Mark Hampton's additions to his European Country Collection for Hickory Chair, a division of Lane. Bulky and made of coarse-grained oak, the 17th-century-inspired canopy bed and Tudor esque tables seemed out of character for the urbane Mr. Hampton, who has shown himself to be a master of mass-produced furnishings with the panache of the custom made.
Especially disappointing, given the premarket hype and the involvement of the popular English decorator Jane Churchill, was the Royal Country Retreats collection by Drexel Heritage -- lumbering "adaptations" of noble British country-house furniture given coarse paint jobs and clumsy carving.
One happy side effect of all these backward glances, however, was that fresh ideas stood out in even bolder relief.
From Calligaris were rows of simple polished birch side chairs, one with stencil-like leaf cutouts along the back. Brown-Jordan offered the brilliantly reductivist Venice canopy bed, a slender, cast-aluminum cage enameled a silvery shade of celadon. And at the booth of Mobili di Castello, an Italian company making its High Point debut, was a palazzo-style bookcase painted in robust shades of terra cotta and olive green.
From the L.& J. G. Stickley company, purveyors of fine Arts and Crafts reproductions, came a handsome copy of an early-20th-century wicker settee designed by Gustav Stickley for his home in Parsippany, N.J. Also exciting to look at was Bernhardt's cowboy-flavored camelback sofa, Durango, its softly swooping, velvety leather form detailed with nailhead curlicues.
John Houck and Roger Plaster of the J & R Collection continue to impress with their focus on sleek, sensible furniture that marries the palest of woods to the coldest of metals. Perched on gently arched, brushed-aluminum feet, their Bastille maple bookcases and matching two-door cabinet have the modest appeal of line drawings.
High Point's bad boy is Larry Laslo, the Manhattan designer best known for the calm, luxurious interiors of the Takashimaya store on Fifth Avenue. Straddling the tension-filled line that separates camp from homage, Mr. Laslo's Act II collection for Directional bonded a glamorous grab bag of inspirations -- Marilyn Monroe, Brancusi, film noir set designs -- into a rollicking collage of fashion-forward fantasy.
Act II provided a stylistic jolt in a market sorely in need of animation. Cubist side tables coated in silver leaf stood next to shell-shaped sofas, and beneath a supernovalike chandelier made of sharp, menacing crystals stood Mr. Laslo's piece de resistance, the Stiletto dining chair.
"It's my dominatrix look," said Mr. Laslo, who wrapped the chair in a tartish ensemble -- black patent leather, polished chrome nailheads -- that paid tribute to vinyl-clad vixens of the 1960's like Diana Rigg's Emma Peel and the European B-movie siren Ira Furstenberg.
Though prone to self-consciously groovy shapes and searing color combinations, Milo Baughman of Thayer Coggin turned out a surprisingly crisp collection. His Design Classics recalled the fresh-scrubbed modernity practiced by the 1960's interior decorator Billy Baldwin (not to mention a recent furniture line by Ralph Lauren).
Mr. Baughman's pale-wood sectional sofas and cubic chairs -- boxy, angular, free of distracting details -- were clean and precisely tailored, with the brisk, well-groomed look that is the quintessence of American interior design.
That is what High Point needs more of. There's always next fall.

HEADLINE: Study Attacks F.A.A. on Child Safety Seats

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
The main union of flight attendants yesterday renewed its campaign to make child safety seats mandatory on airplanes, aligning with the airlines and the National Transportation Safety Board, both of which contend that the Federal Aviation Administration's opposition makes no sense.
The union, the Association of Flight Attendants, issued a critique it had commissioned that rebutted the aviation agency's argument: that if parents had to pay for seats for babies who now fly as "lap children," many would choose to drive instead. That, the agency contends, would mean a higher death rate among travelers, since driving is more dangerous than flying. 
 "There are no valid economic reasons to believe that the conclusions drawn by the F.A.A. have a basis in fact," said the report's author, Darryl Jenkins, a visiting scholar at George Washington University who is a specialist in airline economics.
Mr. Jenkins, who said he had worked on developing fare structures at five major airlines, contended that the carriers had a poor understanding of families' financial decision-making despite having spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" to determine the price sensitivity of their customers, deciding what price they will pay and at what fare level they will either drive or stay home rather than fly.
And if the airlines have little understanding of this issue, the aviation agency has even less, said Mr. Jenkins, who described the agency's analysis of the safety-seat matter as too simplistic, partly because it failed to take into account air fares' decline in recent years.
Larry West, a spokesman for the aviation agency, said it had not yet had time to react to the new report but that "our message is not that they're wrong and we're right -- we all have the same goal." Still, he said, if bringing a baby along means extra cost, some travelers will be drawn to less safe means of transportation.
The latest round of debate on any requirement that children be restrained during air travel began last month when the National Transportation Safety Board, analyzing the crash of a USAir turboprop on approach to Charlotte, N.C., last July, concluded that a 9-month-old girl who had been ripped from her mother's arms by the force of the crash and thrown over three rows of seats would probably have survived had she been in a child safety seat. The board made a similar finding about a child aboard a United Airlines jet that crashed in a cornfield near Sioux City, Iowa, in July 1989.
And Chris Witkowski, the safety director of the flight attendants' union, pointed out yesterday that when a DC-10 encountered turbulence near Puerto Rico in 1990, the only serious injury among the 144 passengers was to an infant, riding on an adult's lap, who suffered a skull fracture.
Discussing his criticism in a telephone interview, Mr. Jenkins said the F.A.A.'s analysis ignored the economic experience of the last few years, in which declining air fares and new cut-rate airlines have drawn travelers out of their cars and into airplanes.
He also made another argument: that if children under 2 were required to have their own seats, the airlines would surely find a low-cost way to accommodate them.
"If there are two people willing to pay a fare, we're not going to lose those two fares over an airline seat for a baby," he said. "What drives everybody batty over this is the airlines have said that themselves."
So far, no airline has required safety seats on its own, perhaps fearing that to do so would put it at a competitive disadvantage. But Mr. Jenkins predicted that some airlines would soon offer free seats to babies on off-peak flights, as a marketing tool.
In the midst of the renewed debate, an aeronautical inventor in Smyrna, Tenn., is offering an entirely different solution: a baby seat that does not take up an adult's seat.
The inventor, Thomas E. Bennington, has been making the rounds with his product, which is designed to rest between the feet of an adult passenger and fasten to the jet's floor the same way that regular seats do, on tracks that run the length of the plane.
"It guarantees free seats for kids in a full airplane," said Mr. Bennington, who patented the design in 1993 and holds two other patents on aeronautical devices. His mock-up is in its fourth version and has attracted the interest of some safety engineers, but he has not yet found a manufacturer. The aviation agency is looking it over but has offered no judgments.
Mr. Bennington, a pilot, started his design work while on strike against Eastern Air Lines. He is now manager of flight operations for Capital Air, in Smyrna.
"I've always been concerned about loose infants," he said. "They're like little baby rockets during impact."
The seats would differ from plane to plane, because the distance between the floor tracks differs. As a result, the seat would have to be provided by the airline, not the parent. It would probably cost several hundred dollars, Mr. Bennington said, and would be used in front of the window seat, to avoid blocking the row.
The seat is 11 inches wide. It would fold flat to fit in an overhead bin when not in use. The design also includes a net behind the parent's heels that would prevent bags stored under other seats from sliding forward into the baby.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 4 about a campaign by the Association of Flight Attendants to make child safety seats mandatory on airplanes misidentified the type of plane in which a baby was torn from her mother's arms by the force of a crash last July and killed. She was on a twin-jet USAir DC-9, not a turboprop.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Thomas E. Bennington, an inventor in Smyrna, Tenn., has come up with an airliner safety seat that does not take up an adult's seat and so would save parents the cost of a fare. Were it adopted, the product would presumably quell a debate on whether child safety seats should be required on airplanes. (Fritz Hoffman for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Europe's Muslim Population: Frustrated, Poor and Divided

SERIES: Wary Strangers -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: MARSEILLES, France

 BODY:
In the streets rising from Marseilles's old port, couscous is easier to find than croissants. Cockney neighborhoods in London are now bazaars for Muslims from Bangladesh. Muezzins call Turks to prayer from new minarets in Cologne.
With 10 million to 13 million Muslims living in Western Europe, conservative and far-right politicians, including some voices in the French presidential campaign, have appealed to prejudice against the Muslim presence. 
 "France must firmly oppose clandestine immigration," Jacques Chirac, the conservative French presidential candidate, said recently. "Too often the laws of the republic are openly flouted."
Americans would find many of the European slogans familiar: Legal and illegal immigrants are taking your jobs, ruining the neighborhood, hurting the schools, increasing your taxes, swelling the welfare rolls, making the streets unsafe. And some politicians play on Europeans' fears of terrorism rising from the Muslims in their midst.
But five weeks of interviews in France, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, where the largest concentrations of Muslims from Asia, Turkey and North Africa live, reveal a far more complex portrait.
Scores of interviews with Muslim immigrants who came to Western Europe to work in the 1960's, and with their children who were raised in Europe, depict a population that is divided and traumatized, weakened by unemployment and humiliated by dependence on social welfare.
The interviews described a Muslim population stymied by cultural values it does not share, having done little to integrate over the years. Many in the older generation, now largely retired or unemployed, appear disconnected from the societies they live in. Rather, they are trying to reconnect with the one they left behind, watching television programs broadcast by satellite from their native lands.
Adding to the cultural dissonance, their sons and daughters are no longer connected to Muslim tradition, many seeking to adopt the views and values of European society. In fact, most Muslims in Europe are not political or even particularly religious -- a silent majority who want simply to carry out their lives as best they can.
Still, the anxiety about Muslims has been raised to the level of geopolitics. This year the Secretary General of NATO, Willy Claes of Belgium, pronounced militant Islam as important a strategic threat today as the Soviet Union was before Communism imploded in 1989.
"At the moment, I'd say the fantasy part of the perception of militant Islam as a menace in Europe is greater than the reality," said Francois Burgat, an expert on militant Islam at the National Center for Scientific Research at Aix-en-Provence, France.
The fears, however exaggerated, have been fed by the arrest in Europe of scores of Muslim militants, mostly from North Africa, on charges of stockpiling weapons and explosives for use back home.
Islam's recent and highly visible presence in Europe has run into resistance, analysts say, for many reasons: bigotry, the religious zeal of some Muslim immigrants, the inability of some new arrivals to adapt to a dominant European culture, the alienation that is common among Muslim youths.
 
 
Divided
Opposing Values Generate Tensions
 In Heerlen, a Dutch town of 35,000 near the German border, Sheik Ahmed Ali Saroukh fidgeted with a cup of tea in a grimy factory that was transformed seven years ago into Masjid Al Nour, the Mosque of Light, as he pondered how to turn the town into a center of Islam.
The preacher, who came to Herleen about five years ago from Morocco, wants to put up a minaret on the building, topped by a loudspeaker to broadcast the call to prayer five times a day, starting at dawn.
He advocates that Dutch women who are teachers in Heerlen wear a veil in schools when teaching Muslim children and that boys be segregated from girls. He also wants the local hospital to build a mosque for the handful of Muslim patients who end up there and serve them meat prepared under Islamic regulations. There are about 750,000 Muslims in the Netherlands, out of a total population of 15 million.
"The fact that they allow us to have mosques does not mean they love us," Sheik Saroukh said, stroking his graying beard. "On the contrary, they fear us. The proof is they are fighting us every step of the way as we try to claim our rights. They have different values from us. The Dutch man and his wife work. They raise dogs, not children. We want our women to raise children and stay protected at home."
While Sheik Saroukh attributed the failure to achieve his goals to Dutch discrimination, his principal obstacle is Heerlen's deeply divided population of 2,500 Muslims from Morocco, Turkey and some Arab countries, many poorly educated and unemployed, heavily dependent on the generous Dutch welfare system.
The sheik's mosque attracts a minority of older-generation Moroccans. But whether it is a small Muslim community in nearby Aachen, Germany, or a large one like the estimated 150,000 largely North African Muslims in Marseilles, France, religious militancy has widened the generational divide.
Mohammad el-Jashi, 32, a Moroccan mechanic technician who lives in Venlo, the Netherlands, wants to become part of Dutch society.
"Sometimes militants here ask for ridiculous things, like segregated schooling," he said. "We didn't have that in Morocco. I went to a mixed school until I left at 15 to join my father. My heart remains in Morocco, but my head says we stay here where my family is better off."
And in Heerlen, a breakaway group of Muslims established their own mosque in space lent by a liberal Christian missionary center a few blocks away on Putgraaf Street. There, a 32-year-old Palestinian named Khalil Shahine was contemptuous of Sheik Saroukh.
"Before conquering Europe for Islam, which is a hope, we should concentrate on building up our weak, illiterate societies, our people, with education and knowledge," Mr. Shahine said.
Mostapha Dalouj, 36, a physicist by training who accepted a job as social worker in Venlo after learning Dutch but failing to land a job in his area of expertise, said that repeated rejection was pushing him to avoid assimilation into Dutch ways.
"I came by choice from Morocco, equipped with a fair idea of Western societies," he said. "But until now I can't understand what they mean by integration. I want to be a Muslim living in Holland. But that does not mean I want to melt completely in this society and disappear, which is what the Dutch want. When I say that I speak to my children in Arabic, they answer: you are a racist. I am just trying to teach them some of the tradition."
Amizian El Hussein, 51, an unskilled Moroccan laborer, came to the Netherlands three decades ago. "I don't know if we changed or the Dutch have changed," he said. "When I came here I didn't think much of religion. Like most who came here, I was illiterate, but the living was good and there was no friction. They treated us well, and we behaved better than the young generation now.
"I now find myself praying regularly," he added. "My children have had problems in school. Some have dropped out. So now, when I look back, I can't blame it on the Dutch really, but it is true they have become resentful of foreigners and we are not doing as well as we used to."
 
Integrated
A Job Can Make All the Difference
 Leila Yehiawi, 36, a sociologist in Marseilles, is a daughter of an illiterate Algerian father who is now retired from working as a laborer. She is part of the second generation that has emerged as the heart of Europe's Muslim communities.
Unlike many of her generation, she is highly educated and successful. Fluent in French, which she speaks with a native Marseilles accent, Ms. Yehiawi considers herself well integrated but deeply committed to the North African immigrants who did not make the transition into French society.
She works as a teacher and counselor at Lycee Jacques Raynaud, a vocational training school whose 250 students are largely Muslims who dropped out of other schools.
"My students accuse me of being a traitor because the image I reflect is one of success in an atmosphere of failure," she said. "Many of these kids come from homes where both parents are unemployed. They are lost as second-class citizens to whom France is inaccessible. Some adopt Islam as an exhibitionist factor to signal discontent, but, in reality, they are yearning to be equal citizens. Their problem is idleness and deprivation."
But of her own eight brothers and sisters, only two have jobs. "This high rate of unemployment is new, and it is the problem facing our communities -- not Islam, not militancy and not what is happening in Algeria," she said. "Work is the backbone of integration. The lack of it leaves a fertile ground for exploitation by fundamentalists."
Salah-Eddine Bariki, a 43-year-old Algerian who works at Radio Gazelle, a local station broadcasting ethnic programs in Marseilles for minorities, said it was absurd that Muslim communities could be the bedrock of an Islamic revolt.
There are an estimated 150,000 Muslims in Marseilles, with 43 places of worship. But a recent survey of foreigners living in France by the National Institute of Demographic Studies, which polled 13,000 people over eight months, found that 68 percent of those from Algeria considered themselves to have no religion.
Only 10 percent said they practiced Islam regularly, and 22 percent occasionally. Half of the men and a quarter of the women between 18 and 25 said they were involved in a relationship with a French-born person, and 87 percent of those born to Algerian parents considered French their mother tongue.
The problem, Mr. Bariki said, is not Islamic militancy but unemployment, in a country where more than 12 percent of all workers are jobless, with far more than that unemployed among the immigrants.
Hans Korz, a 58-year-old Dutch coordinator of welfare and rehabilitation consultant for the government in Venlo, said the same was true in the Netherlands, where unemployment is about 8 percent.
"Among immigrant youths, largely Turks and Moroccans, it is 60 percent for those between 17 and 25," he said. "The problem is not social, cultural or ideological. It is economic in the first place."
Many Moroccan immigrants, however, say that part of the problem lies in the resistance of Dutch society to foreigners who want to become part of it.
 
Feared
A Few Militants Fuel Suspicions
 Despite lack of evidence that militants have made significant inroads, some officials believe that Europe is in danger of being taken over by a wave of fundamentalism.
Patrick Lalande, a Paris prosecutor who specializes in terrorist affairs, said such thinking dominates French and other European government circles. Indeed, over the last year France, Germany and Belgium have arrested or expelled close to 200 Islamic militants on charges of subversion and arms trafficking.
The most important activity by such militants is logistical support -- buying weapons or sending faxes on behalf of armed groups in Algeria and fundamentalists battling the Governments of Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and countries in the Persian Gulf region.
Members of one such group, the Algerian Fraternity in France, which included Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians and one Egyptian fundamentalist, were arrested in France in July. Some members were found near the French-Spanish border loaded with arms and military uniforms on their way to Algeria. But most of those expelled were thrown out for nonmilitary activities like fundamentalist propaganda.
"We are facing a sort of Islamist international assault made up of networks of militants with connections to fundamentalist countries including the Sudan, Afghanistan and Iran," Mr. Lalande said. He said the militants' focus was not France or Europe, adding, "I think their main objective is to take over North Africa."
One way in which France has tried to cope with its estimated five million Muslims, the largest population in Europe, is to encourage what it calls "French Islam" -- promoting, through progressive Muslim preachers born in France, a modern, secular outlook for the religion.
It is still a modest effort, and far from successful. The French-appointed imam of the mosque of Paris, Dalil Boubaker, often says there is no contradiction between Islam and living in a secular society.
This approach has yet to prove convincing to orthodox believers. On the other hand, Muslim militants have yet to prove they can attract a significant following.
Sheik Mohammad Abelhadi Doudi is a staunch supporter of the Islamic Salvation Front, which is battling to establish an Islamic state in Algeria, and administers a mosque in Marseilles. He says that after more than a decade of trying, his militant version of Islam is simply not enough to win adherents who are unemployed, speak French and are exposed to "temptations" of Western life.
"If I give a young man a Koranic verse, does it solve his problems?" he said. "No. I have been doing this for 14 years, but it's like sowing the sea. Even if there are fruits, they are small and bitter. Islam cannot breathe freely in the West."
NEXT: Western Europeans react to Muslims in their midst.

HEADLINE: CLINTON OPPOSES MOVE TO TOUGHEN EMBARGO ON CUBA

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, which has taken steps in recent days signaling a new cooperation with Cuba, told Congress today that it opposed key parts of a Republican-sponsored bill that seeks to do just the opposite -- further isolate Fidel Castro.
A letter from a State Department official criticized the bill, which is intended to strengthen the 33-year-old American trade embargo against Cuba, on the ground that it would anger allies of the United States and force Washington to violate several international agreements. 
 The Administration detailed its objections within days of announcing that it would send all future Cuban boat people directly back to the Communist island nation. Many Cuban-American groups harshly criticized the sudden shift in immigration policy when it was announced on Tuesday, accusing the Administration of seeking rapprochement with Mr. Castro and betraying Cubans seeking freedom.
The bill that would bolster the embargo is sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who heads the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. Supporters of the bill argue that putting additional pressure on Cuba now, after its loss of aid from the former Soviet Union, would topple the Castro Government.
Among other things, the bill would carry out these provisions:
*Ban American imports of sugar from any foreign country that buys sugar or molasses from Cuba.
*Deny visas to foreigners who use, manage or profit from property in Cuba that was expropriated from Americans.
*Reduce American contributions to the World Bank and other international financial institutions if they make loans to Cuba.
*Allow almost 6,000 American individuals and companies with claims of expropriated property in Cuba to sue foreign companies in American courts if the foreign companies are now profiting from those properties.
In opposing large parts of the bill, as in announcing the plan to repatriate future Cuban boat people, the Administration has shown a new willingness to flout the wishes of Cuban-American groups, especially the Cuban-American National Foundation, a conservative group that is the most powerful voice in that community.
"We recognize we may face criticism from certain domestic political quarters, but the potential foreign policy troubles this bill will create outweigh those concerns," said one senior Administration official.
Administration officials said they hoped to work closely with Congress to rework the bill.
Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Mr. Helms, said today, "The fact that the Administration wrote a detailed six-page letter seeking changes indicates that the bill is going to pass and end up on Bill Clinton's desk."
In its letter to the House International Relations Committee, which was sent Friday and released today, the State Department said it was opposed to the provision that would bar countries that import Cuban sugar or molasses from selling sugar to the United States.
Allies like Canada and the European Union would view the provision as a violation of international trade agreements, the letter said. If enforced, the Administration warned, the provision could even prompt other countries to order trade retaliation against the United States.
"These provisions would also undermine the longstanding U.S. policies on secondary boycotts, as in the case of the Arab boycott of Israel, which the United States had long and vigorously opposed," said the letter, which was written by Wendy Sherman, the State Department's chief liaison with Congress.
The Administration also criticized the provision that would deny visas to foreigners who use or profit from property that the Cuban Government expropriated from an American.
The provision casts its net too wide, the letter said, because it could penalize shareholders in mutual funds investing in companies that profit from such confiscated property, or even the children of executives whose companies use confiscated property.
Moreover, some Administration officials say the bill would hurt America's relations with its allies more than it would hurt Cuba.
Jose Cardenas, Washington representative of the Cuban-American National Foundation, said today that it would be difficult for Congress and the Administration to forge a compromise.
"The intransigence on the Hill toward negotiating with the Administration on this is very strong," he said. "And I don't see it abating for some time because people feel so angry and betrayed by the decision to repatriate people to Cuba."
Some Cuban-American groups are also concerned that the White House is considering the relaxation of some restrictions it imposed on Cuban travel last August, when it sought to punish Havana for not doing more to stop the wave of boat people who were fleeing the island nation.
The Administration's new strategy toward Cuba emerged from a six-month policy review headed by senior officials, who concluded that new approaches were needed because the long trade embargo had failed to bring democracy to Cuba. The officials included Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, Samuel Berger, the deputy national security adviser, and Morton Halperin, a senior official on the National Security Council.
Their views prevailed over the hard-line, mid-level Latin American specialists at the State Department, who favored as little cooperation with Havana as possible, officials said.
The Administration had high praise for a part of the bill that calls for provision of food, medicine and other assistance to help any new Cuban government that emerges that is intent on making the transition to democracy.
But the letter released today sharply criticized a provision that would cut Washington's contribution to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund if they lend money to the Castro Government. The letter also criticized the bill's call for slashing about $200 million in economic aid to Russia if it maintained an observation post in the island nation. The letter said it was reasonable for Russia to maintain the post to verify Washington's compliance with arms control agreements.
Representative Burton belittled the criticisms of the bill, saying the Administration's Cuba policy was "directed by left-wing people who want to take the pressure off of Fidel Castro."
He said the bill sought to create incentives to insure that foreign companies "not do business with Castro or buy expropriated American property, thus propping up his Government by giving him hard currency."
Mr. Burton expressed confidence that the bill would pass. The bill has nearly 50 co-sponsors in the House and 21 in the Senate, among them several Democrats, including Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
Canada, Britain, France and the European Union have all protested the bill, saying the United States has no right to interfere in their trade with a third country.
Canadian officials have warned that if Canada's $500 million in sugar exports to the United States are barred because the nation imports Cuban sugar, then the United States might face retaliation against a like amount of exports to Canada.
"The people supporting this bill are ready to put up a naval blockade around Cuba," said Wayne Smith, a Cuba scholar who headed the United States Interests Section in Havana in the late 1970's. "They keep on wanting to ratchet things up. But the Administration just can't go as far as these people insist. At some point it had to resist."

HEADLINE: New Pressure on Japan to Open Car Market

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WHISTLER, British Columbia, May 4

 BODY:
The United States increased pressure on Japan today to open its markets to American automobiles and auto parts, with President Clinton warning of a "strong response" if no deal is reached.
Without significant progress in the trade talks here, officials said, the president's National Economic Council is likely go forward with a list of more than $1 billion in Japanese products that would be subjected to punitive tariffs. The council is to meet over the weekend. 
 Negotiators for both sides voiced increasing pessimism today about the prospects for an agreement. On Friday, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and the Japanese trade minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, are to resume direct talks to see if there is any chance for a breakthrough.
Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton told The Detroit Free Press that "the United States is committed to taking strong action" if no deal is reached.
The paper's Friday issue quoted the President as saying the hard-line negotiating stance taken by Mr. Kantor "is my line, it is my conviction."
"I have worked for over two years on this," Mr. Clinton said. "We've tried all those other things and they have not worked, so we are going to have to be very strong.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Assails Clinton on Mexico Bailout

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
House Speaker Newt Gingrich contended today that the White House had not provided full disclosure on the financial bailout deal with Mexico and that the Administration had violated a three-week-old Federal law by extending a $3 billion midterm loan to Mexico last month.
Mr. Gingrich raised his accusations in a letter to President Clinton in which he said that the Republican-controlled Congress "will not countenance such willful lawbreaking by the executive branch." But the Speaker did not threaten any specific action against the Administration and one of his senior aides confirmed that no immediate action was planned. 
 The White House played down the significance of the letter. The President's chief counsel, Abner J. Mikva, said in a statement that the White House had complied with Congress and that he had asked to discuss the matter with Congressional officials in mid-April.
On Jan. 31, the President authorized a $20 billion loan through the Exchange Stabilization Fund to help stabilize the Mexican peso. He acted on his own after opposition mounted in Congress to an earlier plan that required legislative approval.
At issue now is the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act of 1995, which House and Senate conferees amended to a $3.1 billion supplemental military appropriations bill on April 5. The legislation, which Mr. Clinton signed into law on April 10, was intended to force the Administration to provide a broad range of documents, some of them classified, about the bailout plan before any more money could be sent to Mexico.

HEADLINE: Unusual Leader in a Dallas Campaign

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 4

 BODY:
In Dallas, winning mayoral candidates always seem to run with the blessings of the business establishment. And in a lot of ways, Ron Kirk fits the mold.
Mr. Kirk, a lawyer in a top-drawer downtown firm, is the candidate with nearly all the big-name endorsements, ranging from wealthy real estate developers to the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach. Mr. Kirk has attracted more than twice the money raised by either of his two major rivals and, as Saturday's election approaches, his television commercials are commanding plenty of air time. 
 But in one way Mr. Kirk, who was Secretary of State under former Gov. Ann W. Richards, would be different from all the Dallas mayors before him. He is black, and if elected he would be the first black mayor of any major city in Texas.
To be sure, many people here view this nonpartisan mayoral election as fundamentally similar to past ones, in which the city's business barons anoint the chosen.
"The white power structure decided it was time to have a black mayor and move Dallas into the 1970's," quipped Joseph Stewart, a political scientist at the University of Texas-Dallas.
Still, in a city with a long history of racial divisions, political, economic and geographic -- most blacks live in South Dallas, most whites in North Dallas -- the most recent poll suggests that Mr. Kirk may have assembled a remarkable coalition.
But while the poll shows Mr. Kirk leading the race, it also indicates a large undecided vote, meaning that he is by no means guaranteed of victory, especially if he fails to capture a majority of votes on Saturday and is forced into a runoff four weeks from now.
The Dallas election is already historic in that it marks the first time that candidates from each of Dallas's major ethnic groups are given a shot at winning.
The poll, published by The Dallas Morning News last Sunday, showed Mr. Kirk with 30 percent of the vote, followed by Domingo Garcia, a Hispanic City Councilman, with 23 percent and Darrell Jordan, a white former prosecutor and onetime president of the Texas State Bar, with 19 percent. Twenty-two percent were undecided. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Dallas, the nation's seventh largest city, has a population of 1 million, of which 48 percent are white, 30 percent are black and 21 percent are of Hispanic ancestry. But whites have generally been a greatly disproportionate percentage of voters in city elections, and this year they may line up far more solidly behind Mr. Jordan than the poll suggests.
Moreover, Mr. Kirk's support in black neighborhoods, while broad, may not be particularly deep, raising questions about turnout in parts of the city that have historically had very low voter participation.
"This is not a black campaign," said Rufus Shaw, a black political consultant, radio commentator and columnist who has not endorsed anyone in the race. "This is a black in a white campaign. This is a guy white folks have chosen."
"If he wins, this won't be something revolutionary for black people, like Harold Washington or Marion Barry or Maynard Jackson," Mr. Shaw said of Mr. Kirk, referring to men who were recognized as black political leaders before being elected Mayor of Chicago, Washington and Atlanta, respectively.
In interviews, all three mayoral candidates here predicted a runoff, and all three agreed that Mr. Kirk would be one of the surviving candidates.
Mr. Kirk clearly bears the front-runner's mantle. At a recent televised debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters, his major opponents plus several of the other seven, lesser-known candidates, including a forklift driver and a fast-food worker, took turns jabbing at him as a tool of the establishment.
Afterward, Mr. Kirk said he was unfazed. "I guess when you're the lead dog," he said, "the view for the rest of them gets pretty boring."
While each candidate says he wants to play down racial factors, race is clearly an issue, especially since there is not much to distinguish their views on major issues.
In a recent forum sponsored by The Morning News, the candidates all agreed they wanted to be tough on crime, fight tax increases, avoid strict affirmative action quotas and keep the city's downtown sports arena from moving to the suburbs.
Mr. Garcia and Mr. Jordan, in a furious bid to make the runoff, have traded shots at each other.
When Mr. Jordan's campaign sent a letter to Republican voters, signed by several supporters and proclaiming that "Darrell Jordan has the intelligence, courage, breeding and educational background to represent us well," Mr. Garcia accused him of playing "the race card" to white voters, an accusation that Mr. Jordan dismissed as absurd.
Mr. Kirk, who is 40, and Mr. Garcia, 37, are both Democrats, while Mr. Jordan, 56, calls himself an independent with empathy for the Republican point of view. They are running to replace Mayor Steve Bartlett, a former Congressman who is not seeking a second four-year term.
Mr. Garcia, who is Mayor pro tem on the City Council, has repeatedly tried to remind voters that he is the only major candidate to have held public office. "The choice in this election basically is between replacement players who haven't played a game in the major leagues, and an experienced veteran," he said at a recent debate.
Though the Mayor here is considerably less powerful than his counterparts in many other major cities -- Dallas has a city-manager form of government -- the post is symbolically important, and Mr. Kirk's election as the first black mayor -- or Mr. Garcia's as the first Hispanic mayor -- would be especially so.
"This is like the class president," said Mr. Shaw, the political consultant. "He can't even send someone to the office. He can't make someone get out of their chair. But symbolically, it is the first picture in the yearbook."

HEADLINE: City Life's About the Same Under Giuliani, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Most New Yorkers say the quality of life in the city has neither improved nor worsened since Rudolph W. Giuliani became Mayor in 1994, according to the latest New York Times poll.
Although many residents cited an improvement in police protection, poll respondents said the Giuliani administration has had little effect on daily life in the city, despite the steep budget cutbacks begun by the Mayor in his first 16 months in office. 
 The telephone poll, based on the responses of 495 residents, found that 52 percent of New Yorkers approve of Mr. Giuliani's performance, down from 61 percent in October.
The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The survey was conducted April 26 to April 30.
Midway through the survey period, the Mayor released his proposed city budget for the next fiscal year, which included the largest reduction in spending since World War II.
Looked at one way, the results of the poll were less than a ringing endorsement for the Mayor, who has stressed his commitment to improving the city's quality of life. When asked, "Do you think the overall quality of life in New York City has improved, gotten worse or has stayed about the same" since Mr. Giuliani became Mayor, 24 percent answered "better," 22 percent said "worse" and 53 percent responded "about the same."
"He hasn't made anything worse, and he hasn't made anything better," said one respondent, Gina Gonzalez, a foster mother who lives in the Bronx. She had said she approved of the Mayor's performance, and added in an interview after the poll was taken, "I'd say he was a so-so Mayor."
But the results of the poll can be considered another way. The Mayor slashed his first year's budget by more than $2 billion and reduced the work force by 15,000. Even with that, the results seem to support his contention that most New Yorkers have not suffered as a result.
At the same time, the poll results at least suggest that city residents are wary about further cuts. Mr. Giuliani's proposed budget for the next fiscal year would reduce spending on city agencies by more than $1 billion, and on welfare and Medicaid programs by $700 million.
When respondents were asked: "In general, do you think New York City should increase the services it provides, decrease them or keep services about the same," a mere 6 percent said services should be decreased, 35 percent said they should be increased and 55 percent said they should be kept the same.
Another poll, taken April 27 through April 30 by the Gallup Organization for New York Newsday, found that the Mayor's approval rating has dropped sharply. Last October, 67 percent of respondents approved of the Mayor's performance and 26 percent disapproved. In the new poll, published today, 44 percent of respondents approved and 46 percent disapproved. The telephone poll, of 824 New York residents, has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The Times poll asked residents to evaluate four essential services. A majority of those polled said three of those services -- education, parks, and garbage pickup -- have not changed at all under Mr. Giuliani. Only in police protection did a significant number of residents say they noticed an improvement.
That question was: "Since Rudolph Giuliani became Mayor, do you think police protection in the city has improved, gotten worse or stayed the same?" Forty-two percent said police protection had improved, compared with 4 percent who said the same about education, 20 percent about parks, and 16 percent about garbage pickup.
The recent sharp drops in the crime rates have been the Giuliani administration's most touted successes. While some law enforcement officials have said the reductions occurred because Mayor David N. Dinkins increased the size of the police force, and because of demographic changes, Mr. Giuliani has said that his aggressive law enforcement and a redeployment of police forces led to the improvements.
The absence of any strong reaction to most of Mr. Giuliani's policies may also reflect that those hit hardest by his budget have been those who receive welfare and Medicaid benefits. Telephone polls tend to underrepresent those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum, because many do not have phones.
A majority of those questioned in the Times poll, 65 percent, said they approved of the Mayor's plan to make it more difficult for people to apply for welfare.
New Yorkers are split on whether Mr. Giuliani is moving too fast in his efforts to change the city's direction, although few seem to think he should move faster. Asked if they thought the Mayor was "moving too fast to change New York City's direction, or too slow," or "at about the right speed," the poll found that 35 percent say he is moving too quickly, 37 percent say the right speed, and 10 percent say too slowly.
"Let's give him a chance," said Theo Joseph, a retired resident of Jamaica, Queens, who also said he approves of the job the Mayor is doing. "He's only been Mayor for a year or so, and he had this big deficit to deal with. I really hope he can turn things around, but I'm dubious."
The poll continued to show a wide gap between whites and blacks in their perception of the Mayor's performance. While 75 percent of whites approve of the job the Mayor is doing, 68 percent of blacks disapprove. The percentage of whites and blacks who said the quality of life hasn't changed under Mr. Giuliani was about the same, just over half of each group. But 30 percent of whites say life has improved, while only 9 percent of blacks say that. The percentages were almost precisely reversed on the question of whether life has become worse.
Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's director of communications, said the poll was encouraging. She said Mr. Giuliani's ratings were about the same as his electoral vote, even after 16 months of budget cutting.
"Compare that to all the critics and pundits and experts who said that by cutting the budget the Mayor was going to destroy the city," Ms. Lategano said.

HEADLINE: John Edwin O'Toole, 66, Leader In Advertising for Three Decades

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
John Edwin O'Toole, a lifelong advertising executive who was one of the most articulate spokesmen for the agency industry, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 66 and lived in Greenwich, Conn., and Carefree, Ariz.
The cause of death was leukemia, said Joyce Harrington, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Advertising Agencies, of which Mr. O'Toole was a past president and chief executive. 
 Mr. O'Toole, a soft-spoken man with a dry wit, was born in Chicago in 1929. As a young man he intended to enter the newspaper business and in 1951 graduated from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.
After a year in the Marine Corps though, Mr. O'Toole returned to Chicago in 1953 and took a job as a junior copywriter at the advertising agency now known as BBDO. A year later, he moved to Foote, Cone & Belding, beginning an association that would last for the next 31 years.
He rose steadily at Foote, Cone, now the flagship agency of a holding company called True North Communications. After a decade as a copywriter, he was sent to the agency's Los Angeles office in 1964 as creative director. In 1967 he returned to Chicago, again as creative director, and a year later was elected a member of the agency's board.
In 1969, he was named president of Foote, Cone & Belding in New York. He became president of the parent company, then known as FCB Communications, a year later. In 1981, he was named chairman.
Under his stewardship, Foote, Cone's business grew strongly. From 1970 to 1985, when he retired, billings rose to $2 billion from $241 million.
His retirement was brief.
In 1987, he was named director of the Washington office of the agency association, known on Madison Avenue as the Four A's. Two years later, he was elected president and chief executive. He served a five-year term, representing the industry's interests with clients, the press and governments during a time of ferment and challenges that included the industry's worst recession since the 1930's. He retired at the end of his contract in January 1994.
Two months ago, he was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame of the American Advertising Federation.
He wrote extensively about the business, including a book, "The Trouble with Advertising," in 1981, and numerous articles for a wide variety of publications, including The Atlantic, Newsweek and The Columbia Journalism Review.
Mr. O'Toole is survived by his wife, Phyllis Treadway O'Toole, and two daughters, Ellen O'Toole Hoeffel of Manhattan and Sally O'Toole Whitesell of Greenville, S.C.

HEADLINE: Allan O. Hunter, 78, Head of Fannie Mae In Decade of Growth

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Allan Oakely Hunter, a former Congressman from California who led the Federal National Mortgage Association in the 1970's, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 78.
Mr. Hunter, who lived in Bethesda and Naples, Fla., died after a heart attack, said his wife, Dixie Lee.
He was elected to Congress in 1950 as a Republican from Fresno, Calif., and served two terms before losing a re-election bid in 1954 and resuming a private law practice. 
In 1970 Mr. Hunter was named by President Richard M. Nixon as chief executive of the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, a private corporation that buys mortgages from direct lenders, freeing up money for more lending.
Under his stewardship, which ended in 1981, Fannie Mae grew in importance as a mortgage lender. But in the late 1970's, sharply rising interest rates caught Fannie Mae in the same trap that snared other mortgage lenders.
"Fannie Mae had tremendous problems when the rates they were paying to borrow rose above the rates they were lending on mortgages," said Stan Strachan, editor of National Mortgage News, a weekly that covers the mortgage industry.
Mr. Hunter's first marriage, to the former Geene Hunter, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Dixie Lee, he is survived by three children and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Can It Be? Buffett Is Mortal?

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, America's folksy billionaire investor from Omaha, confessed recently that his investment in USAir Group was a result of "sloppy analysis" that might have been caused by "hubris."
Now, hubris is something Mr. Buffett, 64, might be allowed, given his record since he started buying six-packs of Coke for 25 cents and reselling the bottles at a nickel apiece as a child in the late 1930's. Today, he is worth more than $11 billion and the stake his company bought in Coca-Cola just a few years ago has more than quadrupled to about $5.9 billion. "It took only 50 years before I finally got it: The real money was in the syrup," Mr. Buffett quipped recently. 
 But sloppy analysis? Few people have ever accused him of that. Yet Mr. Buffett's mea culpa, along with some less-than-stellar forays into the stock market in recent years, suggest the unthinkable: The legendary Mr. Buffett is in a bit of a slump.
A look at some of his biggest investment disappointments -- including USAir, Salomon Brothers, the PNC Bank Corporation and Champion International -- shows that Mr. Buffett has at times strayed from his own axioms for success. Among those axioms: Don't try to time the market; invest in businesses with histories of steady earnings growth; invest for the long term; don't invest in something that you don't fully understand; invest in managements with proven track records, and don't get involved in the management.
Mr. Buffett also seems to have fallen victim to a problem familiar to many ordinary investors: letting the desire for better-than-average returns blind one to the weaknesses of the companies in which one invests.
It's not as though Mr. Buffett is about to be knocked from his pedestal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the holding company that is his investment vehicle and of which he owns 41 percent, still produces returns that are the envy of Wall Street, outperforming the Standard & Poor's Index of 500 companies by double digits year after year. It's just that his performance has slipped noticeably since he began stepping in as a savior of companies threatened by hostile takeovers in the late 1980's.
From 1965 through 1986, Berkshire Hathaway's net worth increased at an average compound annual rate of 23.63 percent, beating the S.& P. 500 by 14.38 percentage points. From 1987 through 1994, its average return slipped to 21.87 percent, narrowing its edge over the broader market to 10.02 percentage points. The decline was a bit like that of the baseball star Wade Boggs: After hitting an untouchable .345 over a decade, Mr. Boggs's average fell to a merely mortal .259 in 1992 and a merely sterling .302 in 1993.
Mr. Boggs's fans wondered what had gone wrong. And now, some investors are asking what, if anything, has gone wrong at Berkshire Hathaway.
One answer is that under pressure to maintain his fabulous returns, Mr. Buffett began to ignore some of his own advice. At the end of the 1980's, he started putting money into high-yield investments in companies threatened with hostile takeovers -- companies he has admitted he didn't always fully comprehend. The change in strategy was exemplified by Mr. Buffett's forays into USAir, Salomon, and the paper and wood products giant Champion International.
These investments were made by buying convertible preferred stock, which pays a high interest rate and can be converted into common stock. Mr. Buffett is reputed to have once called these instruments "Treasury bonds with lottery tickets attached." Their effective yield for Berkshire Hathaway was around 15 percent.
One mistake led to another. Stuck with some troubled companies, Mr. Buffett decided to get involved in managing some of them and he has not proved adept at that. He had to step in to act as chairman of Salomon after it was rocked by a 1991 scandal involving false bids at Treasury auctions. Four years later, he is still struggling with the firm.
Salomon, USAir and Champion also violated another Buffett rule: They had erratic earnings histories.
And had Mr. Buffett hewed more firmly to his principle of buying and holding, he could have made a lot more money from the one-third stake in Capital Cities/ABC Inc. that Berkshire Hathaway sold in late 1993. Holding on to the stake for 12 more months would have brought in an additional $217.5 million at today's price. Mr. Buffett ruefully highlighted the missed opportunity in his company's latest annual report.
Such missteps are taking a toll. Berkshire Hathaway's earnings dropped last year, to $494.8 million from $688.1 million in 1993, because of a $173 million write-down of the investment in USAir and a $33 million hit on the Salomon equity holdings. The stock of Berkshire Hathaway, now at $22,950, has risen roughly in line with the overall market this year, but is 7.5 percent below its all-time high.
Mr. Buffett declined to be interviewed for this article. But he has told stockholders on more than one occasion that investing is a lot more difficult these days than it was in Berkshire's earlier years, when a lot of "low fruit" hung ripe for the picking in the stock market.
Peter Russ, an analyst at Shelby Cullom Davis and a staunch admirer of Mr. Buffett, said that to some extent Mr. Buffett was a victim of his own success. Because he has so much money to invest, and because stocks are trading at such high price-earnings ratios, it has become more and more difficult for him "to find mispriced companies in wonderful situations," Mr. Russ said.
"The past seven years have been very difficult for the Warren Buffett style of investing," Mr. Russ said.
Some investors also think that the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock has gotten too far out of line from the value of the companies in which the company has invested. Pasadena Growth Fund sold its Berkshire Hathaway shares in late 1994, the managers Jim Mair and John Tilson explain, because "the premium got too high." Charles T. Munger, Mr. Buffett's partner and the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has recently sold stock in the company.
To be sure, Mr. Buffett's biggest investments are big and successful enough to let him make mistakes and swallow a few hundred million dollars of losses without much overall effect.
In addition to the 100 million shares of Coca-Cola that he acquired between 1988 and 1992, his other very successful investments include the Geico Corporation, the Gillette Company and the Washington Post Company. And he still has a substantial stake in Capital Cities/ABC.
"He's the world's greatest investor,' said Robert G. Hagstrom Jr., a Philadelphia money manager who profited handsomely from his 1994 best seller on Mr. Buffett's investment strategy. "USAir is a pimple on a $16 billion portfolio." Even so, Mr. Hagstrom acknowledged that USAir was a major mistake and that Salomon had been a disappointment.
Looked at as bond investments, Mr. Buffett's holdings of convertible preferred stock in USAir and Salomon don't seem so bad because of their high yields. But as equity investments, they seem less smart. Because of the serious financial problems at USAir, Mr. Buffett has written down his original $358 million investment to $89.5 million. "He paid a lot of money and his conversion price was high," says Steve Gidumal, an airline analyst at Bear, Stearns.
In Berkshire Hathaway's 1994 annual report, Mr. Buffett recognizes his mistake. "This was a case of sloppy analysis, a lapse that may have been caused by the fact that we were buying a senior security or by hubris," Mr. Buffett wrote. "Whatever the reason, the mistake was large."
Mr. Buffett has also had to write down his Salomon convertible preferred investment by $33 million to account for his share of the investment bank's 1994 net loss of almost $400 million. Salomon's troubled client businesses lost $179 million in the first three months of 1995, though first-quarter trading profits of $239 million pushed the company out of the red for the first time in a year.
Investments in pulp and paper companies, especially those like Champion International that own a lot of trees, have historically been a good hedge against inflation. But while Champion's senior securities, another convertible preferred investment, have provided a good return, the company lost money from 1991 through 1993, though its share price has risen recently.
And, despite a high and rising stock market, some of Mr. Buffett's other recent stock picks don't look so good. A stake of 8.3 percent, or almost 20 million shares, that Mr. Buffett acquired in 1994 in the PNC Bank Corporation still trades at below its acquisition price of $503 million, and was valued at $411 million at the beginning of the year. PNC is the holding company for the Pittsburgh National Bank.
But it is at Salomon, a unit of Salomon Inc,. where in 1987 he stepped in to buy $700 million of Salomon convertible preferred securities to rescue the firm from the investor Ronald Perelman, that Mr. Buffett faces some of his greatest challenges.
Altogether, Mr. Buffett has invested more than $1 billion in Salomon, and Berkshire Hathaway holds just over 20 percent of the firm's total voting rights.
In recent weeks, more than 20 managing directors have deserted the investment firm, many of them because they were unhappy with his plan to limit their annual compensation to $400,000 unless certain profit targets are met. The exodus forced Mr. Buffett's managers to modify the plan somewhat to keep top talent.
But great players, whether in Major League Baseball or on Wall Street, have a way of breaking their slumps. And for Mr. Buffett, the recent rally in Salomon stock, which has jumped from $32.25 in March to $37.375 yesterday, may be a signal that in the long term, the old Buffett magic is still there.

Chart: "UPS & DOWNS"
 A look at some of Mr. Buffett's and Berkshire Hathaway's investments since 1987.
 
COCA-COLA
Big winner. His current holding of 100,000,000 shares is worth $5.9 billion, more than four times what he paid.
 
USAIR
A loser. He paid $358 million for USAir convertible preferred stock shares in 1989. He says it is now worth $89.5 million.
 
FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP.
Another winner. 12.8 million shares acquired for $271 million, are now worth $842 million.
 
SALOMON
Still in trouble. Good earnings from the convertible preferred stock, but he has taken a writeoff of $33 million. He has also been drawn into management.
 
GILLETTE
A winner. Holds 24 million shares. Began acquiring stake in 1989 by investing in convertible preferred stock. Total cost was $600 million. Now worth $2 billion.
 
WELLS FARGO
Excellent. 6.7 million shares acquired in 1990 for $424 million now worth $1.16 billion.
 
CAPITAL CITIES
Mixed but good. Sold a third of his stake at $63 a share in late 1993. The price is now $84.75 a share, meaning he missed a potential profit of $217.5 million. But he still holds 20 million shares.

HEADLINE: Committee Proposes Whittling of Social Security Benefits

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Warning of a looming crisis for future retirees, a panel of top corporate officials and university presidents proposed today that increases in Social Security benefits be held below the inflation rate and that all benefits exceeding what a worker has paid into the system be taxed.
These recommendations from the Committee for Economic Development, a bastion of the American business establishment, were among the more far-reaching of an ambitious plan to avert growing problems in Government and private retirement programs and a dangerous drop in national savings. 
 "The pension and retirement system in America is headed for disaster unless steps to prevent it are taken now," said Lawrence A. Weinbach, chief executive of Arthur Andersen & Company and head of the committee panel that conducted the study. "It's underfunded, it's overregulated, and it's about to be overwhelmed by unprecedented growth in the retirement-age population."
While avoiding specific figures, the study did not shrink from proposing solutions that only recently have begun to gain a bit of acceptance among policy makers. For at least the last decade, all talk of making Social Security less generous -- even for future retirees -- was deemed political suicide.
With the ratio of active workers to retirees expected to drop over the next 35 years to only about 2 to 1 from today's 3.4 to 1 -- and outlays exceeding income by the year 2013 -- the panel called for paring cost-of-living adjustments "above a basic floor," essentially adopting a means test by taxing all benefits above levies paid into the system and further raising the retirement age.
The normal retirement age is already set to rise gradually to 67 years from the current 65, beginning in 2003, but this does not fully compensate for the rise in life expectancy, and there has been no change in the early-retirement age of 62.
In addition, the committee said, there should be a phase-in of a lower "replacement ratio," the proportion of retirement benefits to a worker's earnings history. It also said that the earnings limit for Social Security recipients should be increased substantially to encourage the elderly to remain in the work force.
The bulk of the report, however, dealt with private pension plans and a series of budget-driven legislative changes in the 1980's that have reduced the appeal of such plans.
Not only have deductibility and benefits been limited, but also "excessive Government regulation has sharply raised the cost of administering plans and significantly limited pension contributions," Mr. Weinbach said. "Regulatory costs have soared, with a devastating impact on pension formation, hitting the smallest employers the hardest," he said.
In constant dollars, employer contributions dropped 51 percent between 1980 and 1991 while total private pension contributions dropped 22 percent between 1985 and 1991.
The panel called specifically for restoring the full funding limit for defined benefit plans to its pre-1987 level of 100 percent of projected liability and for basing retirement tax preferences on accumulated lifetime income rather than only on current-year income.
Moreover, a worker should not be allowed to withdraw before retirement pension-fund money contributed by his employer, the committee proposed.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Retreat Ahead of April Employment Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks retreated yesterday after two days of record-setting gains as traders locked in gains ahead of today's employment report.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped as much as 37 points yesterday, crossing 4,400 for the first time, before closing down 13.49 points at 4,359.66. 
 The rally this week had been fueled by reports pointing to subdued economic growth, suggesting that interest rates would remain stable, and by strong corporate earnings. A rally in bonds, which continued yesterday, had also bolstered stocks.
"Everything is going right," said Mario Gabelli, the chairman of the $8.2 billion Gamco Investors fund group. "You've had very strong earnings and an enormous rally in the bond market in the past four months that's provided a significant kick to stocks."
But traders were cautious yesterday over whether the report on employment in April would support the notion of a slowing economy. Statistical quirks could cloud the picture of the economy provided by the data. In recent days, analysts have lowered their estimates of April employment growth, partly to reflect the effects of a strike by 32,000 workers in California.
"You've got a pivotal employment number out tomorrow," said Todd Clark, managing director in equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw. "We've had a nice run, and it's time to take some chips off the table to try to reduce risk."
The retreat accelerated as four rounds of computer-guided sell orders bombarded the market beginning at 2:40 P.M., according to Birinyi Associates Inc. All told, the orders knocked more than 40 points off the Dow industrials.
Trading was heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 436 million shares changing hands, compared with 392.9 million shares on Wednesday.
Among broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 0.06 point at a record 520.54. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.51 points, to 846.75.
Philip Morris, Alcoa and General Motors led the retreat in the Dow. Philip Morris slumped 2, to 70 5/8. Salomon Brothers lowered its investment opinion of the stock.
"People have had a very nice total return in Philip Morris this year and some decided to take profits," said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. The tobacco and food company's stock has returned 42 percent so far this year, with dividends.
Bullish forecasts from companies at Hambrecht & Quist's annual technology conference spurred buying in technology shares.
Intel rose 2 1/2, to 109 7/8, after reaching a record 111 1/2. National Semiconductor gained 3/8, to 25 1/8; Microsoft advanced 5/8, to 81 1/2; Applied Materials climbed 1, to 62, and Vishay Intertechnology jumped 3 1/8, to 65.
"Nobody understands the depth of demand in this semiconductor cycle," said Charles Howley, equity trader at Soundview Financial Group Inc. "This mad scramble is not just because of personal computers; it's spreading over to telephone handsets and other technology."
But other computer stocks gave up their gains. I.B.M. fell 1/4, to 93 3/4, after rising as high as 96 1/8. Compaq Computer closed down 1 3/4, at 36 7/8, after soaring as high as 39 1/2.
Brokerage firms also held the spotlight, as the recent rally in financial markets spurs optimism about stock and bond sales. Merrill Lynch added 7/8, to 45 3/4; Dean Witter, Discover gained 3/8, to 45, and Salomon rose 5/8, to 37 3/8.

Bonds Rally a Second Day, With Yields Lowest in Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds rallied yesterday for a second straight day and sent yields to their lowest point in more than a year on further signs of an economic slowdown and expectations that a Government report today will show weakness in the job market.
Bonds began to gain yesterday after the Government said that first-time filings for unemployment benefits rose by 20,000 last week to 371,000, the highest since July 16. Economists had expected a 4,000 drop in claims. 
 Traders said the report added to the widespread belief of a soft landing in which economic growth would slow to 2.5 percent, or just enough to keep inflation in check.
The price of a 30-year bond jumped 29/32 , to 10523/32 for a yield of 7.16 percent, down from 7.24 percent. At one point the price was up over a point and a half for a yield of 7.12 percent. It was the long bond's lowest closing yield since it fell to 7.10 percent on April 26, 1994.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the three-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.50 percent, off five basis points from the previous day, while the 10-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.87 percent, down seven basis points.
"The burden of proof is on the bears rather than on the bulls," said Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, "and that's a significant change in market sentiment. People generally expect bonds will keep rising."
Mr. Donne said the market had been helped by the view that the dollar's slide against the yen was more of a Japanese problem than an American one.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director of ASB Capital Management of Washington, said the bond market had gained this week on cumulative statistical evidence of a weaker economy, starting with the report last Friday that the gross domestic product in the first quarter grew by only 2.8 percent, down from fourth-quarter growth of 5.1 percent.
Since then have come reports that construction spending declined four-tenths of a percent, the third straight month of declines; that April auto and light-truck sales on a combined basis declined 8.5 percent from March, and that employment conditions have declined for two straight months.
Further, Mr. Carpenter said, new-home sales were able to rebound only 3 percent from the February decline of 12 percent. "And within that statistic," he added, "we are told that new single-family home sales are at a 7.3-month supply, the highest since July 1990, when the housing market was essentially flat on its back."
Then the leading economic indicator series declined five-tenths of a percent, the second straight monthly decline. Also, factory orders came in flat, "and today right off the bat we saw a substantial increase in unemployment insurance claims," Mr. Carpenter said
"What we have is evidence of a slowdown that is being more deeply imbedded and visible within the economy," Mr. Carpenter said. "All of this reported weakness in the economic real sector is clearly driving the bond market to a point where Treasury bonds are now lower than last June."
In addition, he said, the markets are viewing the dollar situation differently. "There is a growing perception by investors that the dollar must and will strengthen out near term and longer term," he said, citing gains by the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar in the last two weeks.'
But he added that it was difficult to engineer a soft landing, comparing it to a "Boeing 747 landing on the Navy's shortest aircraft carrier, in a typhoon, in the rain, at night and without the benefit of a tail hook."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
With Many on the Sidelines, The Dollar Has a Mixed Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen yesterday as the market watched for signs of a breakthrough in trade talks between the United States and Japan.
But it slipped against the German mark, which continued to gain strength against the French franc and other European currencies in advance of the runoff round of French presidential elections on Sunday. 
 Currency dealers described the trading as light. Financial markets in Tokyo were closed yesterday and will be again today as the Golden Week of holidays winds down there.
In addition, a number of traders chose to sit on the sidelines and wait for today's United States employment report for April. The figures are expected to provide more evidence that the American economy is sufficiently slowing to keep the Federal Reserve from again raising short-term interest rates. Higher rates tend to slow the economy and stem inflation, and also typically bolster a currency by making investments denominated in it more attractive to foreign buyers. The Fed's policy-making committee next meets on May 23.
"There is a lot of waiting in the market," said Win Thin, an economist at IDEA, a financial advisory firm in New York. "The market doesn't want to make too much of a move ahead of these things."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 83.80 yen, up from 83.71 yen on Wednesday. The dollar sold for 1.3710 marks, down from 1.3745. The British pound rose to $1.6172 from $1.6154.
Senior trade representatives from the United States and Japan met yesterday for a second day in Vancouver, British Columbia, on opening Japanese markets to foreign auto parts and increasing the number of dealers who offer American cars.
The Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions against Japan if no breakthroughs are made in the three days of meetings. There has been little progress reported so far.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Fall on Signals Of Slower Car and Home Sales

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices fell yesterday on signs that slower sales of new cars and houses would depress demand for the metal.
On other commodity markets, crude oil prices rose, but the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities dropped 0.42 point, to 235.06. 
 Copper prices, which surged as recently as March on shrinking stocks, have fallen 9.6 percent in the last four weeks on expectations that a slowing economy will reduce consumption. Copper is used extensively by auto makers and home builders.
Yesterday, the Chrysler Corporation said it might cut its forecast of vehicle sales in the United States in 1995 by about 2 percent, to 15.2 million, because of weaker-than-expected sales in April.
The housing market has also been weak. Earlier this week, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses rose 3 percent in March after two months of steep declines, disappointing economists who had hoped falling mortgage rates would attract more buyers.
"All that has built up to a softer fundamental picture for the market," said Richard Hirsch, vice president of Deutsche Sharps Pixely, a metals trading company in New York.
Copper for July delivery fell 2.95 cents, to $1.2245 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange of New York, the lowest price for an active contract since Oct. 26.
Traders also predict that a 17-month drop in stockpiles held in London Metal Exchange warehouses is about to end.
The price of crude oil rose, recovering from a two-day drop, with strong demand from refiners struggling to meet an increase in gasoline demand this summer.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Aiming to Privatize Index of Leading Indicators

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The Commerce Department announced today that it was seeking a private custodian to compile and update its index of leading indicators and two companion gauges that anticipate or track turning points in the economy.
Although the index, the Government's chief forecasting gauge, has fallen into particular disrepute among many professionals for emitting false signals of recession or failing to warn of actual ones, the report is widely followed and Commerce Department officials expressed confidence that somebody would be found to take over the work. 
 The Government spends $300,000 to $400,000 a year in compiling and updating the three business-cycle indexes, which are an outgrowth of work first published in 1938 by Arthur F. Burns and Wesley Mitchell.
"The indicators will not go away," said Everett M. Ehrlich, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. "We're only finding them a better home."
But Mr. Ehrlich indicated that if no one was interested in what he called "a compelling brand name," the agency would drop it. Unlike other Government reports on the economy, the leading, coincident and lagging indexes do not involve primary data collection, only mathematical compilation of data supplied by business, academia and other Government agencies.
The privatization effort is inspired by a need to free resources for a sweeping overhaul of the department's national and international statistics, a job it has called similar to that of a tailor trying to measure a sprinting athlete for a suit of clothes.
"We need to redirect our resources away from statistical programs, such as the cyclical indicators, that no longer require a Government role, and towards these most pressing statistical issues," Mr. Ehrlich said.
Another step announced in the initial implementation of the strategic review announced today was to begin featuring an index of real gross domestic product based on its "chain type" annual weights measure instead of the "fixed weight" measure it currently highlights.
Both are currently calculated but the change means greater attention paid to shifts in relative prices, eliminating a bias that builds up when no allowance is made for the fact that a surge, say, in the price of cotton prompts switching to other fabrics.
The chain-type methods reduced G.D.P. by about half of a percentage point in both 1993 and 1994, but officials said the change in presentation did not imply any significant change in assessment of the nation's economic potential.
In addition, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis will treat Government spending on such capital equipment as buildings, roads and medical equipment as depreciable investments instead of assuming -- as is now the case -- it is consumed in the year or purchase.
The bureau will also install an improved theoretical basis for its estimates of depreciation and capital stocks used in calculating profits and related income components for the national income accounts.
A complete explanation of the changes is included in the April issue of the Department's Survey of Current Business, published today.

Chile Fears a Delay in Trade-Bloc Entry

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, May 2

 BODY:
With negotiations over Chile's admission to the North American free-trade bloc scheduled to begin next month, trade officials and business leaders here are worried that the United States, engulfed in domestic concerns, could delay its promise to bring Chile into the pact.
Eduardo Aninat, Chile's Finance Minister, said in an interview that he saw no obstacles in Mexico, Canada, or Chile that would deter the quick approval of Chile as a trade-bloc member that the United States promised at a meeting of Western Hemisphere leaders in Miami last December. 
 But Mr. Aninat said that despite bipartisan support in the United States Congress for expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement -- or Nafta, as it is widely known -- Chile's entry may be slowed by fallout from the Mexican devaluation crisis and by gridlock over an ever more complex domestic policy agenda.
"It is a bit dangerous for me to give this opinion, but there is a possibility that they will say, because we are so occupied with upcoming elections and a new Congressional political agenda, 'Chile, come back another time,' " Mr. Aninat remarked.
He said that while such a delay would not be a disaster for Chile, "it will be very disappointing and a very sad point in U.S.-Chilean relations."
Chilean membership in the North American trade group has been anticipated ever since the Bush Administration said in 1992 that Chile, with the most advanced economy in Latin America, would be the next country admitted to the trade group. The Clinton Administration has reiterated that commitment.
The Administration has cited Chile as a test case for economic integration of the Western Hemisphere, in which almost all the countries in the region would reach a trading accord over the next decade.
In the last decade, Chile has become the model for economic change in Latin America as it privatized most state enterprises, slashed tariffs, liberalized investment markets, and opened its doors to foreign capital. The result has been 11 years of uninterrupted growth, with an average annual rate of 7 percent for the last eight years. Inflation slowed to 8.9 percent last year from 15 percent in 1992; unemployment is currently 5 percent, and Chile has one of the highest savings and investment rates in the region.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said recently that bipartisan support for a free-trade pact with Chile remained strong, and that the Administration was committed to obtaining so-called fast-track authority from Congress this year.
Under such an arrangement, used in gaining approval of both the North American trade accord and the more recent world trade pact, the Administration negotiates the details of an agreement and the House and Senate vote only to approve or block the pact without amendments.
"We believe that the United States and Nafta partners are on track with respect to Chile's accession to Nafta," said Charlene Barshefsky, a United States deputy trade representative, in a telephone interview from Washington. "We have met not only as Nafta partners, but working relations are very good and the commitment on the part of all the countries involved is very firm."
American trade officials said that trade and finance ministers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Chile are to begin formal negotiations on June 7 and that if all goes well, Congress is expected to vote on an agreement providing for Chilean membership near the end of the year. But expectations that Chile would gain rapid approval have been fading since late December, when Mexico devalued the peso, causing chaos in financial and credit markets in Latin America and sending investors running for cover.
Critics of the North American trade pact in the United States, like Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, have called on the Administration to abandon plans to expand the North American agreement to all of Latin America unless regional labor and environmental rules are included. Republicans dismiss any such rules as unacceptable, under pressure from American businesses that fear the same rules may be applied to them in the United States. The controversy has cast uncertainty on the expansion of free trade through the Western Hemisphere.
And the Republican-controlled House has been occupied of late with legislation promised in the Contract With America, and is next expected to emphasize conservatives' agenda items that were not addressed earlier in the year.
Clinton Administration officials say they are uncertain where the Senate stands on expanding the North American trade alliance.
Claudio S. Garcia, president of Chile's American Chamber of Commerce, which represents United States companies with business interests here, said that the Mexican crisis had "splashed a bucket of cold water on the issue of Chile and Nafta" but that his organization was continuing to lobby in Congress, seeking to shift the tide.
"It appears today that there will be difficulty getting fast-track Nafta through the United States Congress," said Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is based here. "If Nafta is delayed for Chile, the biggest casualty will be the spirit of the Miami conference, this concept of Western hemispheric integration that the United States has been promoting."
Mr. Rosenthal said that delaying Chile's entry into the North American trade group would send the wrong message to other Latin Americans and to Asian countries, which the United States is trying to persuade to open markets and broadly liberalize their economies.
Chile, a relatively small nation of 13.5 million people in an area of less than 300,000 square miles, is rich in natural resources like copper, timber, fish, iron ore, nitrates and precious metals. Last year, it had exports of $11.64 billion, of which $2.01 billion went to the United States -- mainly fruit, vegetables and forestry products. Chile imported $11.36 billion last year, of which $2.64 billion came from the United States, including vehicles, electronic equipment and other consumer goods.
Mr. Aninat said he was still optimistic that fast-track authority was possible, and he foresees an approval process in which Congress passes a fast-track measure by September, formal negotiations begin in October, and a draft of a new agreement is sent to Congress in January or February.
Yet some Congressional trade experts consider such a timetable very optimistic, and think that fast-track authority may not be completed until shortly before Christmas.
Mr. Aninat said that if fast-track authority was delayed, the United States would be missing a prime opportunity to establish an early trading agreement with a country where imports are growing 26 percent a year, one seen by many Asian nations as a platform for trade with the rest of Latin America.

HEADLINE: AT&T Appoints Chief for Its Flagging Computer Business

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Ending a five-month search, the AT&T Corporation yesterday appointed Lars Nyberg, an executive at Philips Electronics N.V., to take charge of its beleaguered computer business.
Mr. Nyberg, 43, will become chairman and chief executive of AT&T Global Information Solutions on June 1. He succeeds Jerre L. Stead, a highly regarded manager who abruptly quit in January to take the helm of the Legent Corporation, a relatively small software company based in Herndon, Va. 
 AT&T hoped to capitalize on the growing combination of computing and communications when it acquired the NCR Corporation for $7.4 billion in 1991. But the strategy has since proved disappointing.
Though the Global Information Solutions division had revenues of $8.5 billion in 1994, it has struggled to turn a profit. In the first quarter of this year, the unit, which is based in Dayton, Ohio, posted an operating loss of $143 million, costing AT&T shareholders about 5 cents a share in lost earnings, according to Richard Toole, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. Widely considered to be an also-ran in the cutthroat computer industry, AT&T, like many of its competitors, has seen its profit margins squeezed in recent years. Under Mr. Stead's energetic leadership, the unit, which employs 46,000, cut costs and began to transform itself from a hardware seller into a provider of custom information systems to large corporate customers.
Mr. Nyberg, who was in Europe, was not available to comment on his future strategy for the company yesterday, but he was urged to act quickly.
"They have to find a way to gain market share in whatever part of the business they are competing in or get out," said Richard Buchanan, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, Inc., an industry consultant in Cambridge, Mass., that includes AT&T among its clients. "When the current business cycle turns down, there is going to be a major shakeout in the industry. If you are not a volume business, then you are dead."
During his 20 years at Philips, Mr. Nyberg, who was born and raised in Sweden, held a variety of positions in sales and operations in Europe. He was head of the company's data systems division, which was sold to the Digital Equipment Corporation in 1992. Most recently, he led the Communications Systems division, one of the few Philips divisions that registered a loss in the most recent quarter.
"Under Lars's leadership and with a sound strategy and strong team in place, I believe GIS can meet the challenges it faces and make a valuable contribution to AT&T," said Robert E. Allen, the company's chairman, in a statement.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Rise to 9-Month High

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits shot up an unexpected 20,000 last week to the highest level in more than nine months, the Government said Thursday.
The closely watched four-week moving average, which is considered a more accurate barometer of the labor market than the weekly figure because it irons out weekly fluctuations, also posted a nine-month high. 
 Analysts were surprised by the increase and said it could translate into a higher unemployment rate later this spring.
The Labor Department said claims for unemployment pay in the week ended last Saturday climbed to 371,000 from a revised 351,000 and were the highest since 385,000 filings in the week ended July 16 last year.
The four-week average climbed by 7,250, to 351,750, pushing through the 350,000 threshhold for the first time since July.
Initial jobless claims have jumped unexpectedly for two consecutive weeksand have been edging up since the start of the year. Analysts said the trend fitted in with the picture of a cooling economy and they see the labor market continuing to weaken.
Seven states reported increases in initial claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended April 22, the latest period for which the data are available.
They were Massachusetts, with 3,830 additional filings; New Jersey, 3,664; Connecticut, 2,273; North Carolina, 1,655; New York, 1,628; Wisconsin, 1,588, and Rhode Island, 1,302.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Rent Tax Generates Votes, Not Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York City's budget imbalance and related threats from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to begin cutting basic services has focused attention on the program to eliminate the city's tax on commercial rents outside the Manhattan central business district south of 96th Street (front page, April 28). 
 This tax cut is in no way designed to stimulate jobs; rather, it is meant only to please a political constituency of small-business owners in the boroughs.
By comparison, the Mayor offered a full program of pro-growth tax cuts coupled with sound structural reforms during his 1993 campaign specifically crafted to revive the city's private sector (which had lost 400,000 jobs since 1989). Indeed, that program was almost exclusively based on my economic forecasts and analysis.
Rather than implementing these pledges, the Mayor disavows ever having made them. The result has been stagnation in the city, even as the nation enjoys the fruits of the best economic conditions since the 1960's. The exclusion of the city's crucial business core from the rent tax cut adds yet another inequity in the tax code and insures that the city will continue to founder.
Structural balance in the budget -- which depends not only on reducing costs but also on economic growth -- will not be achieved.
Slashing basic services such as sanitation, fire, libraries and infrastructure also hurts our prospects for economic growth. Since the Mayor's invidious $185 million proposal to cut the rent tax is designed to generate votes rather than jobs, it should be shelved.

HEADLINE: El Salvador: A U.N. Success Story

 BODY:
With the departure of its peacekeeping mission from El Salvador last Friday, the United Nations can celebrate a quiet victory. Three years after the initial peace agreement was signed between the Salvadoran Government and guerrilla insurgents, a divided society has begun to heal. Lawlessness, human rights abuses and bitter mistrust have given way to the beginnings of a civil society.
For the United States, the U.N. mission in El Salvador has been a bargain. American taxpayers underwrote a misguided proxy war there during the 1980's to the tune of $6 billion. Out of a total cost of $800 million for reconstruction, the American contribution is about $250 million, and out of U.N. costs of $110 million, Washington paid around $30 million. Member countries are making up the rest. 
 But the U.N. provided much more than needed funds for El Salvador. It served as a trusted mediator in a place where trust was in short supply. It presided over elections in which the F.M.L.N., the party of the guerrilla insurgents, participated for the first time as a legitimate political organization. It supervised the demobilization of the guerrilla forces and the hated National Police, the training of a new civilian police force and the removal of human rights abusers from the armed forces.
Despite these successes, big challenges remain. The reform of the judiciary, one of the goals of the peace process, has barely begun, and no return to civility can be sustained without it. The reintegration of demobilized fighters on both sides has been delayed. Unemployment is at 60 percent. The electoral system is still flawed. Donor countries, particularly the United States, will need to help maintain the reform and healing.
Both sides in the Salvadoran conflict realized that they could not win an outright victory. Both sides were exhausted. Americans' appetite for financing the abusive Salvadoran military was fading. Still, in a time when the role of United Nations peacekeeping is being questioned, El Salvador stands as a heartening example of success.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japanese Auto Trade Talks End in Failure

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
A last-ditch effort to avoid a major confrontation with Japan over trade in automobiles and parts failed last night, and Clinton Administration officials said they would decide today what kind of trade sanctions to impose on billions of dollars in Japanese goods imported into the United States.
The breakdown came after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto, ended three days of on-again, off-again talks in Vancouver, British Columbia, declaring that their differences were far too wide to bridge. 
 While many of the issues they were debating have long plagued relations between the two countries, , the breaking point was Japan's refusal to allow its auto makers to enter into a "voluntary plan" to increase substantially their purchases of American-made auto parts.
"They were ideologically rigid," Mr. Kantor said in a telephone interview yesterday evening. "They are well aware that we will meet this weekend, and, as President Clinton promised, we will be very strong in our response."
Mr. Kantor contended that the Japanese Government, while accusing the United States of "managing" trade between the countries, was actually seeking to protect its own industry from American competition. "They have managed trade themselves for years," he said. "They give hypocrisy a bad name."
The National Economic Council, the counterpart of the National Security Council, is expected to recommend today that Mr. Clinton order the publication of a list of Japanese products -- perhaps totaling $5 billion to $10 billion -- that will be subject to tariffs as high as 100 percent. The tariffs, to be levied primarily, but not exclusively, on auto parts, would go into effect in 30 days -- although the final list of products affected by the import tax is likely to total only a few billion dollars.
The Administration pursued a similar strategy with China earlier this year over that nation's unwillingness to protect intellectual property rights on American music, films and other products, forcing an agreement that was reached just hours before the tariffs were scheduled to go into effect. American officials are hoping that the same thing will happen in this case.
But there is considerable reason to question whether Tokyo will back down. The issue has become a heated one in Japan, and there is speculation that Mr. Hashimoto, a leading candidate to become Japan's prime minister in the near future, may need to appear to stand up to the United States, especially when many Japanese believe that Washington is keeping the dollar weak to harm Japanese industry by making its goods less competitive overseas.
Over the next several weeks, American companies will be given a chance to review the Administration's list of proposed tariffs, and will be able to argue for the removal of items that they rely on to produce automobiles and other goods. "We really can't tell how big the final list will be," one Administration official said last night, "but it will be bigger than any you've seen before."
Administration officials concede that they have embarked on a risky strategy, even though Japan has backed down before when threatened with sanctions. Now, the precarious state of the Japanese economy and the troubles facing the Japanese auto industry since the yen's surge in value against the dollar give Tokyo much less room to bargain.
Moreover, Japanese officials seem to be betting that the United States does not want to provoke a confrontation that would ruin either next month's summit meeting of industrialized nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, or this summer's anniversary of the end of World War II in 1945. Both capitals have been working to turn the anniversary into a celebration of the two countries' "global partnership." A trade skirmish would send just the opposite signal.
Currency traders have warned that the dollar could take a further beating if the two countries are engaged in a heightened economic confrontation. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has fallen by about 16 percent against the yen.
Japanese officials have repeatedly threatened to counter any sanctions by filing an action against the United States at the World Trade Organization in Geneva, the successor to the organization built around the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr. Hashimoto repeated that warning yesterday, Mr. Kantor said. The trade representative professed to be unconcerned. "We would welcome a review by the W.T.O. of all of Japan's automobile practices," he said.
In private, American officials are more concerned. They fear Japan would attract considerable support if it attacked any American laws that called for unilateral action against another country's products. Tokyo argues that such laws violate world trade agreements.
"It is a risk for both sides, because it is very possible the Japanese could win," said Clyde Prestowitz, the head of the Economic Strategy Institute, a group that argues for free trade under tougher worldwide rules. "I'm not sure either side wants to try it."
American officials note, however, that sanctions would be in effect while any complaint is heard, a process that could take months, if not years. They are betting that Japanese auto companies, which have been deeply divided over how to handle the American demands, would rather settle than endure the economic damage of a lengthy fight.
Over the last two years, since Mr. Clinton and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa signed a "framework accord" for settling trade disputes, the two countries have made far-reaching accords. But none of the issues have been as contentious as autos, which are by far the biggest part of Japan's huge trade surplus -- more than $63 billion last year -- with the United States.
Mr. Hashimoto is a formidable opponent. In a country that reveres quiet control, he is unusually outspoken, and this week in Vancouver he staged at least one incident in which he threw down his papers in frustration when dealing with Mr. Kantor.
In private, according to Japanese who have talked with him at length, he is quite dismissive of both Mr. Kantor and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. He has been known to toss aside the advice of career bureaucrats and reach deals on his own, as he did last year to resolve a dispute over American access to the Japanese glass market.
At issue currently are three main areas of contention.
The first centers on American efforts to get Japanese auto dealers to sell Ford, Chrysler or General Motors cars.
The second involves demands by Washington for a loosening of regulations on the use in Japan of imported parts to repair cars; it is especially significant because a Government inspection system requires most Japanese car owners to make extensive repairs every two years.
The third and biggest source of contention -- and the hardest political problem to solve -- concerns American efforts to get Japanese auto makers to sign "voluntary agreements" that would vastly increase the number of American-made automobile parts they use.
Former President George Bush reached such an agreement four years ago in a visit to Tokyo when Japanese companies agreed to nearly triple their parts purchases from American companies, to roughly $19 billion a year. The result was a mixed success. Japanese companies vastly increased the number of American parts they purchased for cars produced in the United States at "transplant" factories, where cars now average more than 50 percent American-made content. But the Japanese car makers failed to reach any of their vaguely described goals for increasing purchases in Japan, where parts makers are often owned or linked to big auto makers.
Mr. Hashimoto has repeatedly said that Japan must never again enter such an accord, because the Government should have no role in dictating purchases made by private industry. American officials insist that while some Japanese car makers have shown an interest in a new voluntary purchase plan, the Japanese Government has acted to discourage them.

HEADLINE: Europeans Struggle to Balance Old Ways With New Muslim Immigrants

SERIES: Wary Strangers: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 5

 BODY:
Michel Gourdin, a French baker in the northern Paris suburb of Garges-les-Gonesse, remembers the day a year ago when gangs of unemployed North African Muslim youths wrecked his shop in a riot.
One gang member, he said, had been killed by a rival Asian group, and the North Africans, believing that the French police had let the suspected killer go, attacked the local precinct house and then all the French-owned businesses in the neighborhood. 
 "What I don't understand," Mr. Gourdin said, "is that some of them are involved in hard-core gang robberies and drugs. The police know who they are, but they don't do anything. I think they are afraid of provoking an even bigger explosion here if they do."
Garges is a working-class town of 45,000 people with housing projects built for refugees from France's colonial wars in North Africa. Today it has been transformed, like other cities throughout Europe, by Muslim immigrant families who suffer from the same problems of unemployment, high crime and bewildering social change that affect the Europeans who also live there.
Europe's effort to integrate its minority of 10 million to 13 million Muslims is in crisis. The crisis is more than a profound cultural conflict. It is one with grave echoes of racism, fundamentalism and fears of terrorism, and whether Europe succeeds or fails could have important lessons for the United States, with its own large, new Muslim presence.
But for Europe, so far, many of the signs are troubling.
"The sad fact is that interaction is very difficult and rare," said Ian Hastings, a Briton who grew up in India and who has chosen to live in the cultural and ethnic mix that East London has become today.
From the British National Party in London's East End to Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in Marseilles, racist far-right politicians openly appeal to white fears in the parts of Europe where local populations are being steadily replaced by immigrants.
Mr. Le Pen, a candidate in the first round of the French presidential elections last month, won 15 percent of the vote nationwide, his strongest showing in two decades. A young Moroccan man drowned after skinheads who the police say were attending a Le Pen rally here on Monday pushed him into the Seine.
On Thursday night, unidentified people sprayed anti-Islamic graffiti on the walls of the Grand Mosque of Paris and defaced the entrance with black tar.
Government crackdowns on legal and illegal immigration in European countries have been prompted in part by the fear of right-wing demagoguery if the influx is not brought under control. Such moves have helped steal the thunder from the far-rightists in Britain and Germany.
Though modern urban crime and chronic high unemployment do not discriminate between Muslims and Christians in the poor European neighborhoods where the local and immigrant populations coexist, they do contribute to rising tensions.
Interviews in France, Britain and Germany, three Western European countries with heavy concentrations of Muslims in urban neighborhoods, show a range of attitudes toward Muslims of various cultural and ethnic backgrounds. It is estimated that there are five million Muslims in France, one million in Britain and two million in Germany.
 
The French View
Sharing Problems, Not the Blame
In Aulnay-sous-Bois, a residential sprawl north of Paris, Communist and Socialist-dominated governments over the years built housing projects intended for local French low-income families. Most of these apartments are now occupied by Muslim immigrants from Algeria.
One of the few remaining ethnic French residents of one project is Yves Hiestand, a 48-year-old accountant who has been unable to work for the last two years because of intestinal cancer. He opened the door to the stairwell on the 12th floor the other day and wrinkled his nose in disgust.
"Drug addicts," he said, pointing to discarded plastic syringes on the concrete steps and to a bloodstain on the yellow stuccoed wall. "All North Africans," he said. "The police don't even care."
He paused as his next-door neighbor, a North African woman wearing a head covering, passed on the way to the graffiti-covered elevator. "She asked me to clear the addicts out of the stairwell this morning, but I refused," he said, "If I say anything to them they just call me a racist."
The French-owned stores on the ground floor of Mr. Hiestand's building have, one by one, been bought out by North African owners who cater to their clientele with signs in Arabic. One French butcher remains.
He borrows the butcher's car because Mr. Hiestand can no longer afford one of his own on a disability payment that leaves him a little more than $600 a month to support himself and his two school-age sons, Yann and Rick.
"It's not safe to ride the buses, and taxis won't even come in here after dark," he said. "It's like being a prisoner in your own country."
Mr. Hiestand blames French social-welfare and immigration policies for creating the situation, and he supports Mr. Le Pen's far-right movement. On the walls of his sparsely furnished three-room apartment he keeps a small arsenal of guns and knives and a collection of military memorabilia from his days as a paratrooper in Senegal.
In Aulnay, Mr. Le Pen won 20 percent of the vote, but he came in ahead of all other candidates in more than a score of cities from Marseilles to Metz, Colmar and Dreux on a platform promising to send three million of immigrants back where they came from to make room for three million unemployed French workers.
Such arguments may make little sense, but they appeal to racism. In fact, Islamic immigrants are among the hardest hit by France's 12.2 percent unemployment rate, with joblessness in many North African neighborhoods running at about 40 percent.
 
The British View
Harmony Depends On a Balanced Mix
Unemployment is just as big a problem in the Brick Lane neighborhood of the Tower Hamlets section of East London, once the center of the Cockney world. Today the street signs are in Bengali and English.
A total of 161,000 people live here, 37,000 of them -- 23 percent -- from Bangladesh, with a smattering of black African and Caribbean immigrants. The rest, the English, tend to call all the other groups "blacks."
"I was born in the East End -- I live here because I belong here," said Eileen Whitmarsh, a 58-year-old resident who lives 10 minutes from Brick Lane in a city housing project on Ellsworth Street. "I can't say we like what's going on now -- the indigenous people feel like second-class citizens," she said. "They feel as if the outsiders are getting preference."
Local city government is not permitted to build subsidized housing, she said, but makes public land available to private housing associations only if they promise to build plenty of five- and six-bedroom apartments.
"That is clearly for Asians," she said. "If there's a mosque to be built, someone always finds the money and the land for that, too."
Mrs. Whitmarsh works with Asian children in a school for the mentally handicapped, and says she has become friends with many Bengladeshi and Pakistani families.
"People are people," she said, "but now the English people who have lived here all their lives are being displaced by immigrants who are taking over."
Mr. Hastings, the Briton who grew up in India, came here 15 years ago and now lives in one of the buildings put up on land made available by the Tower Hamlets city council. A teacher-trainee, he works hard at getting the Asians and the English to live together.
"My eldest daughter has been going to a Church of England school with a mix of students," Mr. Hastings said. "But now she has to go to the next level and it's 95 percent Bengladeshi, and that is a problem. We've opted for a central London school that tends to be more mixed, but it means a 40-minute daily train ride each day for my daughter."
The anti-immigration British National Party has been accused of egging on skinheads in the area, who have clashed with Asian gangs. Early last year, with tensions running high, newspapers predicted that local government elections in May would produce strong majorities for the party, but it was defeated, even losing the majority it had held in the Millwall district.
An election to fill a vacancy in the Weavers ward of Tower Hamlets at the end of February confirmed the trend with a victory by the opposition Labor Party candidate, Mohammed Ali; David King, the British National Party candidate, won 16 percent.
"The people in this area have a long history of fighting racism," said Pola Manzilla Uddin, an emigre from Bangladesh who has been a Labor Party councilor in Tower Hamlets for six years.
"It's always been a neighborhood full of immigrants -- the Jews and the Irish came before us, but we have a different skin color, we stand out and we'll be here longer than those groups were," she said. "Our children are the ones who are going to determine whether we live in a racist society for the next 50 years, or live in a more balanced, caring community."
Unemployment in Tower Hamlets last year ran close to 27 percent, two and a half times the national average. In Bradford, a manufacturing city 200 miles north of London, the jobless rate approaches 50 percent in some Pakistani neighborhoods, said Ralph Berry, a local councilor. There are 45,000 Pakistanis in the city, a ninth of the population.
Mr. Berry's living room, high on a hill in a mostly white neighborhood in Bradford's southwest, overlooks the Grange School, where 80 percent of the 1,000 students are Asian. "One child from this area goes to that school, which was built for it," he said.
The Grange school welcomes visitors with English, Urdu and Hindi greetings on the door, and its motto is "achieving together." Richard Thompson, the principal, said he saw his primary mission as preparing young Britons of whatever race or color for the society they live in now, not the one they came from.
"Some of my female students want to wear the veil, and they can if they feel they need to," he said. "I could stamp on it, but it isn't important. The important thing is for these British Muslims to be equipped with an education that allows them to live useful lives here," he said.
 
The German View
Far Right Fuels Fundamentalism
Two fundamentalist mosques, both in the predominantly Catholic, Rhineland city of Cologne, have been making headway in the Turkish Islamic population in Germany. The Turks have long been among the most secularized populations of the Islamic world.
The more radical of the two mosques, known by its Turkish initials I.C.C.B., runs an Islamic cultural and shopping center on the Niehler Kirchweg, a residential street in the Nippes section of Cologne.
A green Islamic flag flies above it, and on holidays the smell of barbecued lamb rises up to the fifth-floor apartment of Jurgen Kerstin and his wife, Regine, who live with their daughter in the building next door. Nippes is home to about 111,000 people, 12,000 of them Turks.
"We've always had Turkish neighbors, and we've always gotten along with them," Mrs. Kerstin said. "But these people are different -- the women always wear veils now, and they come on weekends to attend the Koran school."
In the Nippes city hall, Vural Emre, who came from Turkey 33 years ago to work in the Ford plant in Cologne and has since become a German citizen active in the Social Democratic Party, said he thought he knew why such movements had taken root.
Turks who had felt safe living in Germany suddenly felt dangerously exposed when right-wing German radicals, protesting a wave of foreign immigrants seeking asylum in Germany, began firebombing Turkish homes in late 1992, he said. More than 20 Turks and other foreign immigrants died in such attacks between then and the end of 1993.
The attacks declined after the German Parliament changed the Constitution in mid-1993 to make it harder to claim asylum. German far-right parties advocating the expulsion of foreigners failed at the polls in national elections last October.
But there are still problems, however petty.
Bernhard Henrici, the head of the Nippes district council, took a visitor up to his 15th-floor office, with a panoramic view from the Rhine to the Eifel hills to the west.
"Look around and try to count how many satellite dishes you see on the houses down below -- all of them are tuned to channels from Turkey," he said. Mr. Emre retorted, "Yes, and all of them had to sue their German landlords to get permission to put the dishes up."
The little three-story houses that Ford helped build to house him and the German workers at its plant in Nippes have since been neglected. Mr. Emre says the only German neighbors he has left on the Konigsbergerstrasse are widows like Maria Karbath.
Mrs. Karbath, 80, said she does not mind that the only grocery store in the neighborhood is run and staffed by Turks and carries Turkish staples.
"If I got sick and needed help, I know that I could call on any one of my neighbors and they'd take care of me," she said. "I'd rather depend on my Turkish friends than on the Germans."

Unemployment Rate Jumps As Number of Jobs Falls
The nation's unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent, in April and the number of new jobs fell for the first time in more than two years, as the slowdown in the economy spread to the job market.
The most startling figure in the employment data was the 9,000 decline in payroll jobs. And for the second straight month, the number of factory jobs declined. Analysts regarded the numbers as the most definitive in a series of reports showing a sharp deceleration of the economy. Indeed, fears are being raised that the Fed's anti-inflation campaign may have been overly severe. Page 1.
The unemployment rate in New York State increased to 6.8 percent and rose to 6.3 percent in New Jersey. In New York City, the rate was up slightly, to 8.6 percent. 38.
 
U.S. and Japan Break Off Talks on Automotive Trade
The United States and Japan said talks over trade in automobiles and auto parts had ended in failure. The Clinton Administration plans to decide what kinds of trade sanctions to impose on billions of dollars in Japanese goods imported into the United States. 1.
 
Drive for Legal Overhaul Is Trimmed
Senate Republicans scaled back their effort to limit damage awards in liability suits, hoping to attract enough votes for passage on Monday. The revised proposal would extend the damage cap in product liability suits but only to cases against businesses or government entities with fewer than 25 full-time employees. The revised measure would not cap punitive damages in medical malpractice cases. 10.
 
Dow Falls 16 on Jobs Report
The Dow industrials declined in a second day of erratic trading, falling 16.26, to 4,343.40, as the decline in new jobs, the first in more than two years, raised the prospect that corporate earnings would slump. 39.
A rally in the bond market helped the dollar gain slightly against the major currencies. The dollar rose to 1.3730 German marks from 1.3710 marks on Thursday and edged up to 83.96 yen, from 83.80. 34.
 
Group in Bid for Grace Unit
An investment group of former W. R. Grace executives is teaming up with Constantine Hampers in his $3.5 billion bid to buy National Medical Care, W. R. Grace's health care subsidiary. The group, called Quad-C, is based in Charlottesville, Va., and is headed by Terrence Daniels, a former Grace vice chairman who led the acquisition of National Medical Care in 1984. 37.
 
New York Fines Prudential
Prudential Insurance has agreed to pay a $5 million fine for disregarding rules requiring that agents and the policy forms they use be approved by New York State. It was the biggest fine ever levied by the New York Insurance Department, but the department said there was little effect on consumers. 38.
 
Trump and Pritzker Settle Feud
Donald Trump, left, and Jay Pritzker have settled their long-running legal feud over the management of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York, which they jointly own and which the Pritzker family's Hyatt Corporation manages. People familiar with documents signed by both sides this week said the settlement cleared the way for renovations at the convention hotel near Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Pritzker said he hoped that work on the hotel "could begin soon." 37.
 
Borrowing by Consumers Increases
Consumer borrowing accelerated during March at the fastest pace since last summer. Led by a $6.7 billion increase in credit card use, installment borrowing rose 17.9 percent, to $13.8 billion. In February, consumer credit rose a revised $7.7 billion. 38.
 
Nintendo Delays New Game Machine
Nintendo of America confirmed that its Ultra 64 video game player would not be ready in time for Christmas. The company said it would unveil the machine in November, but not introduce it until April 1996. Analysts said the delay could hurt competitors nearly as much as it did Nintendo, because consumers may put off buying any machine until the Ultra 64 becomes available. 34.

Cigarette Makers, in New Direction, Move to Raise Prices

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Displaying new confidence that the heated legislative climate surrounding the tobacco industry has cooled enough to permit a price increase, the largest United States cigarette makers raised their wholesale prices yesterday by 3 cents a pack, or nearly 4 percent for premium brands.
The first announcement was made by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, only a week after its parent, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Company, announced disappointing first-quarter earnings and declining tobacco sales. The Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest maker of cigarettes, confirmed late in the day that it was matching the Reynolds price increase. 
 David Adelman, a tobacco analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said yesterday that Brown & Williamson, the dominant American manufacturer of discount brands, had informed its distributors that it would increase prices by the same amount. He attributed the information to his father, Lawrence, also a tobacco analyst at Dean Witter.
A spokesman for Brown & Williamson in Louisville, Ky., Tom Fitzgerald, said, "We only discuss prices with our customers," declining to confirm Mr. Lawrence's report. There was no response to messages left at Brown & Williamson's corporate parent in London, B.A.T. Industries
The R. J. Reynolds price increase, the first since November 1993, when the company raised prices 4 percent, is effective immediately and affects all its premium and discount brands. The price rise is the company's second since "Marlboro Friday" in April 1993, when Philip Morris cut cigarette prices by 40 cents a pack in an effort to compete more aggressively against discount brands, and RJR Nabisco followed suit.
"Certainly the price increase will be beneficial to the Reynolds earnings," said Roy D. Burry, a securities analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. "They couldn't raise their prices due to the health care debate in Washington, but now things have cooled off, and they feel they can increase their prices by this amount."
He referred to calls by Democrats for health care legislation that would have included increased taxes on tobacco to pay for the proposed health benefits. With a Republican majority in Congress this year and the failure of the Clinton Administration's health care proposal, tobacco companies no longer fear a tax increase that would raise prices to consumers.
R. J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest cigarette maker, also announced the resignation of James C. Schroer, its executive vice president for marketing and sales. "I think this was inevitable, given the missteps the company has made over the last 9 to 12 months in their marketing programs," said Gary Black, a tobacco analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Mr. Schroer was second in command to the president and chief operating officer, Andrew Schindler. No successor has been named.
"Rather than cut prices to stunt share losses, RJR is more inclined to make management changes," Mr. Black said.
Karen Daragan, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, said the price increase was intended "to help recover inflationary costs." It will affect the company's premium cigarettes like Marlboro, as well as its Basic and Cambridge discount brands.
Mr. Burry of Oppenheimer referred to the tobacco industry as a "price oligopoly, following the industry's restructuring, returning to the way it was before Marlboro Friday."
Smokers may face another general price increase down the road as well. "They usually raise prices around the middle of the year and then again at the end of the year," Mr. Burry said. Should there be another price rise "that would be a total of more than 6.8 percent, too much of a price increase all at one time," he said.
RJR announced its price increase early enough to affect the market, and Wall Street seemed to approve. RJR Nabisco was up 12.5 cents, closing at $28.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris closed at $71.50, up 87.5 cents. Its announcement came after the New York market had closed.
The price increases by R. J. Reynolds amount to 3.4 percent a pack for the company's premium brands, or 3.7 percent including excise taxes, Mr. Black said.
Brown & Williamson will benefit most from an increase, Mr. Burry said, since 3 cents a pack at wholesale amounts to a 4.9 increase on its principal discount brand, GPC. Another increase at the end of the year would mean close to a 10 percent price rise for the year.
An increase of 3 cents a pack at the wholesale level could amount to a 6 percent rise for private-label manufacturers, Mr. Black said, adding that "having the first price increase in 18 months is good for the industry."
Nationally, the retail cost of premium brands averaged $2.25 before Marlboro Friday, $1.85 afterward, then $1.89 after the November 1993 increase. The cost, after yesterday's rise, will be $1.92.
Mr. Adelman of Dean Witter said analysts would be watching to see how much of the price increase "will stick."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rises to 5.8% In Clear Sign of Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
The slowdown in the economy spread visibly to the job market in April, as the unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent, and the number of new jobs fell for the first time in more than two years, Government figures showed today.
Analysts regarded this as the most definitive in a series of recent reports showing a sharp deceleration of the economy. The trend has started to raise fears that the Federal Reserve's anti-inflation campaign may have been too severe. 
 Yet while today's report on the labor market, the first comprehensive gauge of economic conditions for April, included many signs of weakness, various special factors made it unusually difficult to interpret. Still, most analysts concluded that the results were not as bad as they first appeared, and few saw the expansion, which recently entered its fifth year, as being near an end.
"The rise in unemployment confirms that the economy has slowed down, although this is not a sign of recession," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
The bond market, seeing the jobs report as evidence that the Federal Reserve would not push interest rates up further, rallied on the job figures, pushing long-term interest rates down to about 7 percent, the lowest level in more than a year. [Page 35.]
Stocks tumbled, then recovered half their losses as investors were apparently reassured that the economy was not in collapse.
Analysts said the lower long-term rates could help revive the housing sector, one of the main casualties of the Fed's ratcheting up of interest rates in seven steps from February 1994 to February 1995. Lumber and home furnishings were among the weakest industries in the job report.
The dollar's skid in world currency markets, which tends to help exports by making American goods more affordable abroad, is also seen as a prop for the economy in the months ahead.
Factory jobs, which have been on a steady upward trend since late 1993 and are relatively immune from the seasonal and other distortions that affected other elements of the report, have declined for two straight months. Furthermore, factory hours have eased from unusually high levels.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich called his department's report "disappointing," but expressed no alarm and avoided comment about any possible easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
"There is some cause for concern," Mr. Reich said in an interview. "But there's no evidence that the economy's going into reverse."
Irwin L. Kellner, a senior economist at Chemical Bank, said the Fed "should hold steady until further notice." Indeed, much of the impact of its earlier tightening of credit is still to be felt.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said the central bank could relax policy even in the face of somewhat higher inflation figures if it discerned long-term trends like a cooling economy that could lead to lower inflation. But other current trends -- notably high prices for many raw materials and semi-processed goods -- may convince the Federal Reserve that even with a cooling economy inflation may not yet be subsiding.
The most startling figure in the employment data was no doubt the 9,000 decline in payroll jobs, an item to which economists normally attach considerably more significance than to the unemployment rate.
The fact that jobs did not increase was a surprise even to those who had realized that a quirk of the calendar would severely limit growth and who had adjusted their expectations because March job gains significantly benefited from unusually warm weather that "stole" jobs in construction and recreation that would normally have shown up in April.
Other factors were a strike of 23,000 grocery workers in California and what officials said was a minimal effect from the late start of the Major League Baseball season.
The biggest obstacle to clear interpretation of the payroll survey was a peculiar calendar pattern, combined with the Labor Department's attempt to adjust the figures for recurring seasonal swings. In each of the preceding three years, which dominate the adjustment calculation, there were five weeks between the March and April surveys, allowing a maximum time for seasonal job gains to be captured in the statistical net. But this year there were just four weeks, meaning there was one less week of seasonal hiring.
This year's tally had to show enough jobs to overcome a big hurdle of 841,000 jobs that the process assumed to be the proper adjustment as a result of the 1992-94 experience.
By a very rough estimate, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, put this calendar effect at 70,000 to 234,000 fewer jobs in April, a range that analysts said was so wide as to be of little use.
Still, it was clear, she and private analysts said, that job growth has slackened from last year's rapid pace, with even the temporary-help category showing a decline of 21,000 in April. This, along with overtime, is one of the "easy" first options when employers seek to pare labor costs.
The average private-sector workweek, the report also showed, lengthened slightly, but factory hours slumped by 36 minutes and factory overtime fell by 24 minutes. These declines were magnified, officials cautioned, by time off for Easter and Passover.
And while the index of aggregate weekly hours inched up a tenth of a point, to 131.8, its factory component plunged 1.6 percent. "The bottom has really dropped out" in manufacturing, said H. Erich Heinemann, economist for Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, who predicts a "hard landing" for the economy in 1996.
The department's survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is calculated, also portrayed job-market deterioration, and it was little affected by seasonal distortion.
Altogether, 428,000 more people were out of work in April, as a result of job shrinkage of 202,000 and a rise of 226,000 in the labor force. That lifted the total number of unemployed to 7,665,000. A large proportion of these were people re-entering the labor force and those on temporary layoff, the report noted.
An almost equal number of people, 7,710,000, held two or more jobs, with 6.2 percent of all employed workers in this category, up from 6 percent in April 1994.
The median duration of jobless spells jumped to 8.5 weeks in April from 7.9 weeks in March, with much of the increase reflecting those out of work 15 weeks or more.
Unemployment rates rose among all major demographic groups except Hispanic workers, with those aged 24 to 54 accounting for the overwhelming share of the joblessness.
Before rounding, the overall jobless rate was 5.7744 in April, up from 5.4615 in March, a rise of a full three-tenths of a percentage point.
Today's report also showed an increase in average hourly earnings of six-tenths of 1 percent, but analysts remained calm since this is not only a volatile series but also one that has recently shown a tendency to jump in the first month of a new quarter.
Geographically, the jobless rate rose just a tenth of a point, to 6.1 percent, in the Northeast, while increasing three-tenths of a point in the Midwest (to 4.9) and five-tenths of a point in the South (5.5) and West (6.8).
Statistically significant increases for individual states were posted in Illinois (1.3 points, to 5.7), Massachusetts (1.3 points, to 5.9), Florida (1.2 points, to 5.6), North Carolina (eight-tenths of a point, to 4.7) and Ohio (seven-tenths of a point, to 4.5).

HEADLINE: Borrowing by Consumers Surges In Increase Led by Credit Cards

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing accelerated in March at the fastest pace since last summer even as the overall economy was losing momentum, Government figures showed today.
Led by strong credit card use, installment borrowing rose by a higher-than-expected $13.8 billion in the month, the Federal Reserve said. 
 In February, consumer credit rose a revised $7.7 billion. Previously, the Government said borrowing increased $8.2 billion in February.
"It takes a lot for the average American to put his credit card in his pocket," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass.
Today's report showed that installment credit was rising at a 17.9 percent annual rate in March, the largest advance since 21.3 percent in August, when the economy was stronger. In February, the growth rate stood at 10 percent.
Some analysts advised against reading too much into the unexpected leap in borrowing. "There may have been a seasonal quirk" in the statistics, said Dana Saporta, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. She noted that the Easter shopping season fell later this year than in 1994.
Economists pay particular attention to the Fed's credit statistics because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Before today's report, economists were expecting the Fed to report an $8.8 billion increase in consumer credit in March.
While consumer spending fueled the strongest economic and employment growth in 10 years in 1994, consumer demand has stumbled this year after seven interest rate increases by the Fed.
After showing little change in the early 1990's, consumer borrowing began surging more than a year before the Fed started raising short-term interest rates on Feb. 4, 1994, to cool the economy as a way of restraining inflation.
At the same time, use of credit cards increased as card issuers offered cash rebates and travel discounts, and supermarkets installed credit card scanners on checkout lines.
While consumer borrowing continues at a fast pace, the overall economy has been losing steam. Commerce Department figures show the economy's growth slowed to a 2.8 percent annual pace during the first three months of the year.

HEADLINE: 3 States' Heaviest Political Guns Try to Save Their Military Bases

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The elected officials from the three states had all come to the hearing held aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid yesterday to argue the same basic point, that the Federal Government was making a terrible mistake in trying to close down their military installations.
 Each state had trotted out its heavy artillery: from New York, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver; from New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, Senators Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg, and from Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland alongside Senators Joseph I. Lieberman and Christopher J. Dodd. 
 Each speaker was trying to persuade a special Presidential commission -- charged with reviewing the Pentagon recommendations in the latest round of military downsizing -- that someone in the Department of Defense in Washington had horribly miscalculated the potential savings of closing their state's bases.
 "With all due respect, the D.O.D. alleged cost savings are bogus," said Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey, seeking to rescue the Lakehurst Naval Warfare Center. "If someone working for me costed out a program or scenario so shoddily, I'd fire him for the good of the order."
 "For whatever reason," said Senator D'Amato, speaking on behalf of the Rome Laboratory, a high-tech military research installation, "the Air Force overestimated, and I believe with knowledge, the potential savings of closing Rome Lab. They have deliberately distorted the costs."
 "The numbers don't add up," said the Connecticut Governor, Mr. Rowland, testifying on behalf of New London and Stratford, Conn., installations, "logistically or financially."
 At issue were thousands of civilian and military jobs that pump millions of dollars into the economies of their respective states. And like contestants on a high-stakes game show, all of the players were well aware that the odds of winning the prize of getting their installation removed from the Pentagon hit list were slim. In two previous rounds of military downsizing, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which convened yesterday's hearing, has only reversed about 15 percent of the Pentagon's recommendations. The eight-member commission is to begin voting on the current list at the end of June.
 But first the commission must complete a nationwide tour that has involved stops at similar hearings in Guam; Great Falls, Mont.; Baltimore, and Delta Junction, Alaska. As they have elsewhere, the commissioners who traveled to the west side of Manhattan yesterday were greeted with a flurry of slides, charts, graphs, maps, speeches and, in the case of the Lakehurst contingent, a 10-minute movie. At times, even the commission chairman, Alan Dixon, a former Senator from Illinois, was unable to suppress a yawn.
 But for those arguing on behalf of their states, the proceedings were tense, a last chance to show the commissioners first-hand what the human cost of their decisions will be. Among the most vocal participants were 500 workers from Lakehurst in Ocean County, who came to the hearing on 10 chartered buses, wearing blue T-shirts proclaiming their installation "the heart of naval aviation" and raucously cheering each official who spoke on their behalf. The installation, which provides a variety of support and repair functions for the Navy, is scheduled to be closed, resulting in a loss of 1,383 civilian jobs.
 "I make over $60,000," said Mauricio Borrero, 35, a manager who has worked at Lakehurst for 12 years. "There's no place else in the county I am going to make that kind of money."
 Another New Jersey installation on the chopping block is the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, which employs 2,445 workers and has packed off untold tanks, trucks, helicopters and crates of ammunition to battlefields around the world. Under the Pentagon proposal, those tasks would be taken up by various commercial ports along the East Coast. But Lillian Liburdi, the director of the port department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told the commissioners that such plans were unrealistic and that the region's other ports, as well as commercial ports in Savannah, Ga., Charleston, S.C., and Jacksonville, Fla., were ill-equipped to handle military shipments.
 "I am very concerned," she said, citing the extraordinary space and security that would be required at those commercial ports, all under extreme time pressure, during a period of military mobilization.
In all three states, the common threat of the Pentagon's hit list brought together an all-star cast of strange political bedfellows: at one point, New York's Assembly Speaker, Mr. Silver, a Democrat, crouched alongside the state's Republican Governor, Mr. Pataki, and the two men -- at war in New York's protracted budget negotiations -- casually whispered back and forth.
 For several minutes, Governor Whitman, a Republican, sat next to Senator Bradley, the Democrat who defeated her in a bitter 1990 Senate race, and Senator Dodd, a veteran Democrat, found himself heartily seconding the presentation of his state's freshman Republican governor, Mr. Rowland.
 In New York, where several installations face closing or reduction, the delegates at today's hearing devoted half of their 105-minute presentation to Rome Laboratory. Indeed, at the conclusion of the Rome testimony, which led the hearing, Governor Pataki and Senator D'Amato left for the day, leaving Representative Susan Molinari to lobby for the retention of all the family housing at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn and Representative Gary Ackerman to fight for the life of Fort Totten in Queens.
 Rome Lab is the centerpiece of a $12 million state proposal to develop a high-tech corridor, along the lines of the Route 128 corridor around Boston, to lure a range of technology businesses to upstate New York. The Air Force lab develops sophisticated methods of battlefield control and surveillance and employs more than 1,000 people. It has tens of millions of dollars worth of contracts with area institutions and companies, including Cornell University, Syracuse University and Nynex.
 "Basically, I'm a businessman," said Ivan Seidenberg, the chairman and chief executive of Nynex, which has worked with the lab to create a series of interactive video networks linking teachers with far-flung students and doctors with far-away patients. "Rome Lab looks good on the balance sheet right where it is."
 That theme was echoed by James Robinson, vice president of Allied Signal, whose company is under contract with the Pentagon to produce tank engines at the Army Engine Plant in Stratford, Conn. Under the Pentagon plan, the plant would be closed and 1,600 civilians would lose their jobs.
 In raising skepticism about the Army's plan to relocate the factory's functions to other plants across the country, Mr. Robinson issued what sounded like a veiled threat. His company, he said, owns the heavy equipment essential to the engine-building process and was not inclined to move it elsewhere at the Army's behest. "At least," he said, "not for free."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rates Up in New York State and New Jersey

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Economic growth in New York State continued to stagnate last month as the unemployment rate rose again, Labor Department officials said yesterday.
While the national unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point in April, to 5.8 percent, the rate in New York State increased to 6.8 percent, from 6.6 percent in March. But it was down from 7.8 percent a year earlier. 
 The unemployment rate in New York City remained virtually unchanged, rising to 8.6 percent, from 8.5 percent in March. The rate was 9.5 percent in April 1994.
The coast-to-coast slowdown reflected in the national employment data could mean continued weakness in the job market in New York and much of the Northeast, Labor Department officials said.
"As the nation hopes for a soft landing for its economy, the risk is that sometimes the brakes get locked, and I hope that is not what we are seeing now," said Anthony J. Ferrara, acting regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In New Jersey, one of the few places in the Northeast that has kept pace with the rest of the country, the jobless rate rose to 6.3 percent, up from 5.8 percent in March and down from 7.2 percent a year ago.
No April data were available for Connecticut, which is not among the 11 states for which the Labor Department provides separate figures when it releases the national jobs data each month. The Connecticut Department of Labor said the rate of unemployment for March was 5.3 percent, down from 5.8 percent in February.
In sharp contrast, California's unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent in April from 7.6 percent in March.
While the unemployment figures in New York were indeed gloomy, Mr. Ferrara said the data reflecting the growth of new jobs were worse.
"New York had no growth whatsoever," he said. The state added only 32,000 jobs, he said, for a rate of four-hundredths of 1 percent, ranking New York 48th nationally, ahead of only Rhode Island and Hawaii.
At the same time, New Jersey added 78,000 jobs, or a 2.2 percent increase since March 1994. With that in mind, Mr. Ferrara attributed last month's increase in New Jersey's unemployment rate partly to the fact that more people in the state were actively looking for work.
But he said the disappointing prospects nationally "could only have a dampening effect on New Jersey."
Mr. Ferrara also cited what he described as a critical economic juxtaposition over the last year in New York City. He said that while government was shedding 30,000 jobs, private industry created 21,000 jobs.
"There are some people who would see that as positive sign, and others who would not," Mr. Ferrara said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Rally in Bonds Helps the Dollar Gain Against the Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly higher yesterday, helped by a rally in Treasury bonds.
Speculation that the United States and Japan could reach an agreement on automotive trade also helped the dollar stay steady against the yen, dealers said. 
 The dollar initially fell after the United States Labor Department reported a sharp rise in unemployment in April. The report dashed any remaining hopes in the currency markets that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on May 23. Higher interest rates typically bolster a currency by making deposits denominated in it more attractive.
But the bond market rallied on the employment data, bringing the dollar back. Higher United States bond prices help the dollar because foreign investors must first buy dollars to buy the bonds.
"The dollar was primarily driven by the bond market rally," said Hillel Waxman, manager of currency trading at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.3730 German marks from 1.3710 marks on Thursday. The dollar edged up to 83.96 Japanese yen from 83.80.
The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent. The report was seen as providing strong evidence that the Fed's policy of higher interest rates to slow the economy had succeeded and that the Fed would have to stop raising rates.
Although rates in the United States may have peaked, many traders said they were reluctant to sell dollars for yen as the United States-Japan auto trade talks continued. "The next thing the market is waiting for is the outcome of the talks," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
In other currency trading, the British pound fell after British interest rates were left unchanged. The move by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, after a meeting with the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, surprised dealers, who had been expecting an an increase of half a percentage point, to 7.25 percent.
The decision on interest rates came a day after the ruling Conservative Party had been roundly defeated in local elections in England and Wales. Uncertainty about the stability of Prime Minister John Major's Government has plagued the pound this year. So far this year, the pound has fallen 11.74 percent against the mark.
In New York, the pound fell to $1.5972 from $1.6172.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Issue Is Jobs

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
"The Turk" is the name professional football players have given to the low-level management functionaries who, in training camp, have the gruesome task of summoning players to the coach's office, where they receive the news that they are being dropped from the team.
The talk with the coach can last 5 or 10 minutes. The player then packs his bags, gets in his car and leaves. It's a brief, devastating scenario. Ferocious 300-pound linemen whose raison d'etre is to pound other mortals into mincemeat live in absolute fear of a visit from the Turk. 
 Thanks to the downsizing phenomenon, a similar kind of fear exists now in both the corporate and governmental workplace. As the ruthless combination of corporate power and conservative politics increases its dominance over American life, legions of faithful and mostly middle-class American employees are tormented by the fear that they will be the next to walk the employment plank.
On Monday, the Mobil Corporation announced it would cut the work force at its Fairfax, Va., headquarters by one-third, eliminating 1,250 jobs. As soon as the announcement was made, Mobil's stock hit a new high.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Department announced it would cut its work force by 27 percent, or 3,788 jobs. (To get a better sense of the human impact, think in terms of 3,788 families.) The move was seen as an effort by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary to ward off Republican calls for the entire department to be abolished. The G.O.P. would also like to eliminate the Commerce, Education and Housing and Urban Development departments.
Top corporate executives and rabid conservatives see the forced expulsion of workers from the workplace as a good thing. It is an extremely efficient way to suck money up from the middle classes to the elite. The lead headline in Thursday's Wall Street Journal said: "Amid Record Profits, Companies Continue to Lay Off Employees."
Forget for a moment all the talk about guns and immigrants and hatred of the Federal Government. Turn off the radio. Take a deep breath. Americans are angry and anxiety-ridden because tens of millions are already unemployed or temporarily employed or employed only part of the time. Millions are working without benefits or working two and three lousy jobs because one just doesn't pay enough. And millions more who are employed can hear the downsizing buzzsaw coming ever closer.
Poll results released Thursday by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion showed that one in three Americans have had trouble meeting their monthly expenses for housing, "and a similar number were financially pressed when medical attention was needed." The poll found that "more than one in four Americans experienced difficulty purchasing clothes that were necessary and one of every six Americans found it difficult to buy food which they needed."
That is a recipe for anger and anxiety. But when the anger is expressed, it is seldom directed toward the corporate elites or the politicians who do their bidding. Downsized and otherwise exploited American workers leave their work stations as humbly and quietly as the ex-football players leave training camp. When it comes time to rage, they find something or someone else to rage at.
The most recent figures from the Federal Reserve show that the richest 1 percent of American households have nearly 40 percent of the nation's wealth. The top 20 percent of American households have more than 80 percent of the nation's wealth.
And how are Americans voting at the moment? For politicians who will do everything in their considerable power to increase the disparity.
It's a given (disgraceful but true) that in the current climate the poor will be savaged. What is interesting to me is how so many in the middle and working classes are being clobbered but refuse to recognize who is doing the clobbering. By chasing scapegoats of all kinds -- Mexicans creeping across the California border, teen-age mothers, PBS -- they are, in effect, giving their oppressors carte blanche. Hit me again, they seem to be crying. And the corporate elite and their political stooges are more than happy to oblige.

HEADLINE: Vote for Supermarket Deserves No Praise

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Supermarket Success" (editorial, May 1), you loudly praise City Councilman Guillermo Linares for casting the decisive vote in favor of Pathmark in East Harlem. But what you call his "political courage" is nothing but an insensitive vote against the small merchants of East Harlem that he claimed to support until just before his vote. 
 It is greatly unfair to the small merchants that a big outside corporation be allowed to enter the neighborhood with tax exemptions, $12 million in loans ($7 million below market rate), and city and state grants, while they struggle to break even. It is unfair to allow in a megastore like Pathmark, while for decades the small merchants have struggled in the midst of increasing city taxes, high rent and declining sales.
Mr. Linares's vote is not an act of political courage, but rather an act of cowardice and treason against the political and economic empowerment of East Harlem's Latino community.

HEADLINE: Don't Rush to Sanctions

 BODY:
President Clinton's advisers meet today to decide whether to impose trade sanctions on Japan after failure to reach agreement on opening up Japanese markets for foreign automobiles and automobile parts. Japan's auto market is the right target for an aggressive American stand because it is closed to foreign suppliers and accounts for almost 60 percent of the $66 billion bilateral trade deficit. But instead of imposing sanctions on its own, Washington should work through the new World Trade Organization, created with American support to deal with this kind of grievance.
Japan imports only 4 percent of its automobiles and trucks and 2.4 percent of its car parts. American manufacturers are partly responsible. They have refused to sell small cars that the Japanese crave and have only recently built cars with steering wheels on the right-hand side, where the Japanese expect them. But there are Japanese problems as well, including a distribution system that shuts foreign cars out of showrooms, and Government regulations that impose costly inspections on parts on the pretext of guaranteeing safety. 
 The United States and Japan have reportedly made progress in knocking down both of these barriers. But Japan has rejected a demand that its manufacturers renew a "voluntary" pledge to use more American parts in their new models. Tokyo takes the justifiable position that it has no business telling private companies whose parts to buy.
If Washington tries to win with unilateral sanctions what it could not win in negotiations, it creates two problems for itself. Sanctions can trigger trade wars -- which explains why currency markets often greet American threats by driving down the dollar. The Administration's tactic of riling currency markets seems poorly timed, coming when the dollar has sunk to record lows against the German mark and Japanese yen.
Imposing, even threatening, sanctions also betrays Washington's commitment to trade rules it helped establish. America fought to make sure the World Trade Organization would have real power to resolve disputes. The Trade Organization's rules forbid unilateral, discriminatory sanctions.
Under rules that went into effect at the beginning of the year, Washington can seek the appointment of an international trade panel to hear its complaint that Japan's non-tariff barriers effectively nullify commitments to engage in open trade. Under the old rules, Japan could have vetoed an adverse ruling; under the new rules it cannot.
Washington fought for tougher dispute resolution so that it could force trading partners to play fair. But instead of giving the procedures a chance, the Administration is threatening to set its own rules, a model Washington will regret when other countries follow.

Hotels Offer Deals and Toys

BYLINE: BY BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
AN 8-year-old I know is paid for chores in "milk caps" for the Pogs game, a wildly popular commercial version of a Depression-era sidewalk game in which the goal is to flip over your opponent's disks. For this child, playing the game is less crucial than collecting and organizing the caps and the bigger "slammers" that make them flip over. He and others his age should be fascinated to learn that both Holiday Inn and Howard Johnson's are awarding special versions of the caps to young guests this summer as part of their programs.
Starting Memorial Day, Holiday Inns will give each young guest a box containing one slammer and four caps depicting endangered species; Howard Johnson's will give children 18 years old and younger a game package that includes three caps depicting Sega computer game characters. 
 Many other hotel and motel chains feature tie-ins with cartoons or video games along with special summer rates or discounts; marketing specialists say that children often choose a family's lodging.
 
Deals for Adults, Too
 Here is selected information on summer promotion offerings, mostly focusing on appeals to adults' wallets.
Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts calls its promotion Spectacular Options, which includes a discount plus an option such as an upgrade. This will be offered daily from May 26 to Sept. 5 at 31 of 33 properties of Inter-Continental and its partner hotels in the United States, Canada and Mexico. As a sample, at the Inter-Continental in New Orleans (where rates generally drop in the steamy summer), the rate will be $105 rather than the regular $200; at the Lenox in Boston, $146 instead of $190; at the Maui Inter-Continental Resort in Hawaii, $159 rather than $290. In addition, guests may pick one option: an upgrade to a suite; an adjoining room at half-price; a $25 or $15 credit (depending on the hotel) toward food and beverage, and double airline mileage or overnight parking.
Only some rooms at each hotel are available at these prices. Scott W. Boone, vice president for sales, said 10 percent of rooms was the minimum number set aside for the promotion, but most hotels offer more. Inter-Continental: (800) 327-0200.
Marriott Hotels and Resorts offers Two for Breakfast weekend discounts Thursday through Sunday at hotels and suite properties, and all week long at resorts. All 200 domestic and Canadian Marriott full-service hotels, and 26 resorts, including two in Mexico, are participating. Marriott says the savings are 30 to 40 percent; for example, the Wind Watch in Hauppauge, L.I., offers Two for Breakfast at $115 a night, compared with a regular rate of $155; the Denver City Center, at $79, as against $119. The promotional rate includes breakfast, of course. Marriott is providing a frequent-guest tie-in with the Visa Rewards program. Under this, 20 percent of what a customer spends at the Marriott is credited toward a future stay at a Marriott. Gordon D. Lambourne, director of public relations, says that the program is "widely available." The "weekends" number for Marriott is (800) 872-9563.
At 57 Hyatt hotels and resorts in the United States and the Caribbean, guests get a free night after three consecutive nights between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Hyatt: (800) 233-1234.
The Radisson Hotel chain of more than 300 properties worldwide is again offering Shades of Summer, this year tied in to the Six Flags theme parks. The room rates are 30 to 50 percent off advertised rates, the chain says, making them $69 to $159 a night. Last year, half the hotels offered breakfast with the rate; this year, a third do, according to Joan M. Cronson, a spokeswoman. At United States Radissons within 100 miles of the Six Flags parks in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, St. Louis and Jackson, N.J., guests will receive a $4 discount coupon for a one-day admission ticket or a coupon providing a two-day pass for the price of a one-day. The rooms available at the special rates average 10 percent of the total, according to Ms. Cronson. The rates must be requested on reservation. Radisson: (800) 333-3333.
Westin's Kids Club is going into its second summer at 50 hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and Mexico. From May 27 to Sept. 4, children under 18 stay free and those under 12 eat three meals a day free from a special menu, when eating with their families, room service included. Nine Westins are not participating: the Biltmore in Coral Gables, Fla.; the Algonquin and Plaza in New York; Walt Disney World Swan in Orlando; the Biltmore in Phoenix; the Governor, Portland, Ore.; the Westin Resort in Vail, Colo.; the ANA in Washington, and the Westin Mont-Royal in Montreal. Westin: (800) 228-3000.
Sheraton's Summer Suresavers, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, is a modification of a year-round program. Anyone making a reservation asks for the Suresaver rate, and is quoted the lowest available price except for corporate rates for big companies. At the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Manhattan, the Summer Special is offered from July 5 to Sept. 10 at $169 a night for two, with breakfast included. In both promotions, discounted rooms are limited in number. Sheraton: (800) 325-3535.
 
For Kids: Caps and Casper
 Now for the games and goodies. Holiday Inns always allow children 19 and under to stay free in parents' rooms; some Inns also allow children 12 and under to eat free with their parents year round. In summer, starting May 8, more than 1,100 of the 1,600 Holiday Inns in the Americas provide three free meals a day for children, as well as the Pog gifts. Holiday Inns: (800) 465-4329.
Howard Johnson's Kids Go HoJo is in its sixth year. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, children under 18, who stay free in their parents' rooms, may choose as a gift a Fun Pack with crayons and games, including the milk caps, or a video with Sega game tips, starring Sonic the Hedgehog and other heroes of the youthful. Howard Johnson's is offering special rates of $35 to $75 a night for up to four in a room, which represents a 10 to 15 percent saving, the chain says. Howard Johnson's: (800) 446-4656.
Choice Hotels, comprising the Sleep, Comfort, Quality, Clarion, Friendship, Econo Lodge and Rodeway labels, is plunging in on May 20 with promotions featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost, soon to appear in a movie, and later with "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie." The promotions, ending Aug. 31, offer children chances at prizes, from $250,000 in cash down to a discount coupon for Pizza Huts. The 1,292 Comfort Inns offer a large free breakfast; the Sleep Inns have a smaller version. Comfort, Clarion, Quality and Sleep Inns: (800) 221-2222. Econo Lodge, Rodeway and Friendship Inns: (800) 424-4777.
Starting June 5, some 2,000 Best Westerns are featuring Willy the Whale, soon to be seen in "Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home" due for release July 4. Free activity books based on the movie will be given away, and there will be contests to win free parties for 20 that include a screening of the movie, popcorn and a soda. Best Western: (800) 528-1234.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
A Wonder World in the Mile High City

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
WHAT IS THIS SUDDEN outburst of innocence on the Denver skyline? Three major public works will be completed in the Mile High City this year. All three are good buildings. Each is different in style and function. But running through all of them is a return-to-childhood motif, a sense of lost wonder recalled, if not regained.
A Big Top airport. A Classics Illustrated library. A Those Were the Days ball park. These projects add up to a statement, a more or less subtle and, one hopes, benign form of infantilism projected in architectural form. The regression is not confined to Denver -- other American cities are crooning these architectural songs of innocence -- but the coincidence of these major projects amounts to a fundamental change in the city's image. 
 It's a broad departure from what Le Corbusier called the "cite d'affaires," the traditional downtown where men and reason ruled. Denver has a lot of bright new skyscrapers too, a product of the nationwide building boom of the 1980's. But to give this spiffy core a soul, the architects of these public works have looked beyond the grown-up world of business toward fantasy, play and memories of adolescent yearning. Like "Village of the Damned," the architecture of innocence is essentially a remake. Welcome to the City of the Saved.
 
The Stadium: Theme Park
 You cannot smoke in Denver restaurants, but they haven't yet put a stop to drinking, and the new Coors Field baseball stadium is a virtual Field of Suds. Not only is it named for a brewer, but a brewery is attached to the stadium, forming one of its walls. And the streets surrounding the ball park are awash with gentrified versions of old saloons.
Designed by the Kansas City firm of HOK Sport, architects of the superb Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Coors Field is the latest of the new breed of ball park that is supposed to recall such sporting classics as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. I couldn't get inside the stadium, which was closed at the time, but the building's strengths as an urban object are clear enough from the outside.
Like Oriole Park, Coors Field sits on the edge of downtown, bordered by rail yards, and it represents a thoughtful and successful effort at urban revitalization. Denver's Lower Downtown district is a zesty neighborhood of old loft buildings that until recently was mired in skid-row seediness. Now, "LoDo" is Denver's SoHo, a center for galleries, small shops and artists' lofts. Coors Field throws a major league team into the mix. It's quite a catch.
The design of the stadium, too, recalls that of Oriole Park: in the industrial-strength steel and red-brick structure, the incorporation of an old brick building into the architecture, the fluidity of space between inside and outside. Both stadiums frame dramatic views. In Baltimore, it's a downtown skyline; in Denver, a spectacular view of the Rockies.
The point of view of the architecture is something else again. Here, the Devil is in the details: rusticated stone bases, diaper patterns in the brick, ceramic medallions, turn-of-the-century graphics. With all that retro ornament, it's as if the stadium had been dipped in sepia.
Oriole Park has its retro touches, too, but they are held in balance by the building's sinewy structural framework. As a result, visitors to the stadium can see that modern design, far from being the polar opposite of tradition, is firmly rooted in the vernacular tradition of industrial building.
Coors Field has the same strong industrial bones. But they're hidden beneath an ornamental veneer that strikes a dubious equation between baseball and the memory of happy days of yore. The result is attractive but coercive. You can't enter the stadium without sinking into someone else's fantasy about your past, though after a few beers you may forget how miserable the old days could be.
 
The Library: 7-Story Village
 Michael Graves's colorful, quirky esthetic has often resembled a child's garden of classicism, the vision of an impressionable prodigy who has been given a box of colored pencils and asked to draw a courthouse, a library or one of the other civic buildings seen on a school trip downtown.
Denver's new Central Library, designed by Graves with the local firm Klipp Colussy Jenks DuBois, won't be officially completed until September. But the library opened to the public a few weeks ago, and its exterior is largely complete.
This, too, is a building that aspires to make a strong connection to its surroundings, though the context is stylistically the reverse of Coors Field's gritty urban texture. It's an ideal site, however, for Michael Graves: a Beaux-Arts Civic Center, with state and city office buildings surrounding a beautiful classical plaza. Over the years, however, the classical harmony has been eroded by buildings like Gio Ponti's 1971 Denver Art Museum, and by a typical downtown's vertical sprawl. Graves has made it his task to reconcile the classical formality of the Civic Center with the architectural jumble around it.
He has accomplished this, successfully, by breaking down the seven-story building into fragments, including a square tower with a pyramid top, a cylindrical turret and a central rotunda capped with a gutsy, copper-clad, Gehryesque crown. Stone cladding, in a range of Crayola colors, sets each fragment apart; each facade is different.
Like Graves's unbuilt design for the Whitney Museum, the library is an addition to an existing building, in this case a low, modernist structure designed by Burnham Hoyt in 1956, which Graves turns into yet another fragment. The overall impression is less a building than a village, or a small civic center in itself: Mr. Rogers meets McKim, Meade & White.
 
The Airport: Escape Routes
 Let's run away with the circus! Or, if we're too old to imagine dangling from a trapeze, let's take a taxi out to the new Denver International Airport. This Big Top of an airport delivers the oohs and aahs, starting with the grand tent structure that encloses the main terminal. Designed by the Denver firm of C. W. Fentress J. H. Bradburn & Associates, the tent is made of Teflon-coated fabric, pieced together like sails. Parallel rows of masts lift the roof into a range of abstract snowcapped mountain peaks. A technically sophisticated structure that picks up on the pioneering work of Frei Otto, the visionary designer of the tent structures for the 1972 Munich Olympics, the roof also recalls the fabric pavilions Gordon Bunshaft created for the airport in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, in 1981.
Slung between the two central rows is the roof of a great hall, the airport's central space. Entering the hall on the balcony level, you look down on the bustling concourse with a gleaming granite floor. The effect is similar to the plaza at Rockefeller Center, though looking up you see not skyscrapers but clouds of natural light filtered though billowing cloth.
Compared with most airports, this building feels good for the body. A walk along the main concourse, beneath the tall trees that rise from the warm granite pavement, is almost as pleasant as a mountain hike. The nature imagery evokes the reason Colorado draws new residents as well as tourists.
The inner child bursts out in the airport's public artworks. Whirling propeller blades, like those attached to 50's-era beanies, sprout from the walls of the tunnel through which shuttle trains pass on their way to the airport's far-flung concourses. Wheee! Loudspeakers blare a merry ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay as the train pulls into the platform. In a living-art tableau, a herd of buffalo will be brought in to graze between the highway overpasses leading to the main terminal.
The three concourses, designed by Perez Associates of New Orleans, also develop the theme of innocence, though on a more specialized level. With ziggurats of glass and metal spanning their central courts, the concourses hark back to the dawn of modernism in Joseph Paxton's 1851 design for the London Crystal Palace. The reference takes on a particular meaning in the context of this airport, because the palace, built for the first world's fair, inaugurated the modern concept of globalism. The Denver airport shows where that idea has taken us: to international travel, and to the dish farms of the cable television companies clustered in Denver's industrial parks.
Indeed, there is something naive in the airport's use of natural imagery, for the airport itself will accelerate the transformation of the surrounding country into suburban sprawl. That's one theory for why the airport was situated 26 miles from downtown Denver. Within a few years, what is now ranch land will be carpeted with office parks and residential subdivisions. People will still come here for the nature, but they will have to go farther out to get to it. Perhaps the airport's stylized version of nature is to read as a kind of paradise lost: the rendering of God's own country into a man-made artifact.
A friend who lives in the mountains about an hour from Denver has a theory about these buildings. He says they are a result of the baby boomers' growing into their role as parents. They're reliving their childhoods, or perhaps creating the childhoods they wished they'd had, so that they can pass on something of value to the next generation. Perhaps these buildings are compensation for the innocence that was battered out of the boomers when they discovered that even they would grow old. A few years ago, the moan was "Oh, no, we're turning into our parents." Now maybe the idea is to reconstruct the parents they're turning into.
But there's something specifically urban going on here, as well, an effort to find a viable image so that the city itself can be passed on instead of dissolving into thin mountain air. As new industries continue to disperse the city along the highway, the identity of the central business district has been eroded. What has taken its place is the culture of travel and leisure: tourism, the arts, popular entertainment.
Once, tourism was an escape from the reality represented by cities; now it is reality, the city's most solid economic base. Once baseball was a pastime; now it is a major media-driven industry. Once the city was a place where businesses congregated. Now "the city" is itself a consumer product, recast as an escape from grown-up care. Cities 'R' Us.

HEADLINE: $2,000 or More: A Decontrol Odyssey

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
WHEN Pam and Kevin Wolf spent $250,000 to completely renovate their rent-stabilized three-bedroom duplex apartment on Park Avenue six years ago, some of their friends questioned their sanity.
"They told us we were crazy to spend that much money fixing up a rental," Mrs. Wolf said, gazing across the grand gallery the couple created -- and which they will vacate in August. "But we planned on staying here for at least 20 years. Everybody else who lives here has been here that long. And we thought, where else could we get a 2,800-square-foot duplex on Park Avenue for $250,000?" 
 But the Wolfs guessed wrong. Rent controls for apartments renting for $2,000 or more a month that are occupied by tenants whose household income was more than $250,000 for two years running were effectively lifted in 1993. For tenants of such apartments who either voluntarily acknowledge they make that much money or are found to make that much, the choice is unpleasantly clear: either move out, stay temporarily through a series of appeals and delays, or try to negotiate a deal with the owner.
For those who move out, finding a comparable apartment at a price near to what they were paying is close to impossible, according to real-estate brokers who cite the hot rental market as one factor. For some grand eight- or nine-room prewar apartments that may have rented for several thousand dollars to rent-regulated tenants, market rents may now be "way over $10,000, maybe $15,000 a month," said Dolly Lenz, Sotheby's top-selling agent.
Cathy Blau, a broker on the Upper West Side, cited the case of one older couple whose rent skyrocketed. "They had a three-bedroom, three-bath apartment in a great prewar," she said. "Now they're looking at a one- or two-bedroom with one-and-a-half baths in a postwar in an entirely different location. They're scaling down everything." Ms. Blau said she had suggested to families with children in private schools that they look at houses in Riverdale.
In TriBeCa, Barrie Mandel of the Corcoran Group said that one couple to whom she is currently showing apartments could have bought the 3,000-square-foot loft they are now renting back in 1980 or 1981 for $50,000. They gambled, and kept paying the rent, which has risen to over $2,000. "The rent will now shoot up to $5,000 a month," Ms. Mandel said. "If they bought it then -- with the tax deductions -- they would have paid the equivalent of maybe six months rent." If they want to buy their loft now, it's on the market for $895,000.
Throughout Manhattan, where most of the decontrol is taking place, deals are being made. Some landlords in buildings that have been converted to co-ops and condominiums, but in which some apartments are still occupied by rent-regulated tenants, are offering to sell apartments to well-off renters at less than market prices. If that fails, sometimes they offer cash incentives to leave, according to high-end brokers like Ms. Lenz, who says that 30 percent of her sales in the last nine months have been to "luxury-decontrol people."
AT 40 Central Park South and its sister building, at 41 West 58th Street, both of which were constructed in the 1940's, 18 of 200 apartments were decontrolled because of the high-rent, high-income decontrol law. Tenants in 15 of the apartments have already negotiated higher rents. Neither side will give specific numbers, but the landlord said the deals were a compromise between the old rent and the market rent.
The landlord, H. Dale Hemmerdinger of ATCO Properties, said that as a result of the decontrol of the apartments, he would spend $8 million on renovations and was using his prediction of more forced vacancies in the coming years to borrow from banks. "We're fighting over the timetable," he said, "because nobody really knows exactly how many apartments will turn over in a given year." He estimated there would be at least 10 a year in the buildings.
In one complicated negotiation involving 20 apartments at a magnificent old landmark building on the Upper West Side, tenants negotiated a "lifetime tenancy" deal with the landlord, according to the group's lawyer. The rents will be keyed to existing rents but will rise by amounts negotiated between the landlord and the tenants hit or likely to be hit by the decontrol provisions.
In other buildings, landlords have given tenants 5- or 10-year leases at a compromise rent. "Say if they were paying $2,500 and the market is $5,000, they'll start at $3,500 or $4,000, to be brought up to market over the time of the lease," said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who frequently represents tenants. Mr. Himmelstein said he was not talking about the half-dozen luxury decontrol cases his firm was handling, but cases he had been told about.
While 869 decontrol orders had been issued by April 28, notifying renters that their apartments are no longer subject to rent regulation -- rulings that may be appealed -- an untold number of renters "saw the writing on the wall," as one tenant put it, and left.
Although no governmental agency is tracking these people, real estate brokers report they are showing up in ever-increasing numbers at open houses and making appointments to view co-ops and condos. One such couple, a plastic surgeon and his lawyer wife, bought a carriage house on the Upper East Side, one broker said. The surgeon will use the downstairs for his office, perhaps even reducing his monthly expenses.
Some of these tenants say that they are unable to buy. Mary Vetri, a rental agent for William B. May's downtown office, said many affected young people were not moving from their old apartments, even though the rent will rise. "They'll stay because they're in a bind: they're making a lot of money, but they don't have any down payment to buy," Ms. Vetri said.
She said that many such renters are "young Wall Street types" who may have rented an apartment for $2,100 a month a couple of years ago and whose rent has risen to a market level of perhaps $2,400, nothing like the huge increase that someone who had lived in a regulated apartment for 10 or 20 years would encounter.
Renters in large, prewar buildings -- often already converted to co-ops or condominiums -- who have lived in their apartments for years have received the biggest financial shock. One such tenant who, like the Wolfs, spent a large amount of money to on improvements, and who would speak only on condition of anonymity, called the law "brutally unfair."
"It protects rent-controlled tenants paying almost nothing who are in a far better economic situation that I am," he said. "I felt that we have been taken advantage of." Since he moved into his nine-room apartment in 1985, he said, his rent had gone from $2,200 to $3,250. If he had not made a deal with his landlord -- a deal he refused to discuss -- the rent would have gone up to $7,000, he said.
Another lawyer who specializes in tenant representation, Steven Smollens, criticized what he termed the "illogic and unfairness of a law that allows a man making $1 million a year to keep his $500-a-month apartment, but takes away the apartment of a husband and wife with four children in private school, with barely a dollar for a pizza tip."
The high-rent, high-income decontrol law was approved by the State Legislature two years ago after a bitter struggle. Both landlord and tenant representatives predict that when the rent-regulation laws come up for the required renewal by the Legislature in 1997, with a Republican administration in office in Albany, there will be another battle.
THE final report of Gov. George E. Pataki's Transition Committee on Housing and Community Development, dated Dec. 13, 1994, recommends phasing out rent regulations completely through vacancy decontrol -- the lifting of controls on all apartments as they become vacant.
A similar vacancy-decontrol policy was in effect from 1971 to 1974, resulting in the decontrol of 388,000 apartments, or about a third of the city's rent-regulated stock, according to the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. About 90 percent of those apartments were reregulated in 1974 with the passage of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act, after a report by the Temporary State Commission on Living Costs and the Economy noted that rents had jumped precipitously on turnover. There were also complaints of tenants being harassed by landlords -- charges that were denied.
Currently apartments renting for more than $2,000 a month are, under the 1993 law, decontrolled when they become vacant.
Governor Pataki's transition committee for housing was headed by Charles J. Urstadt, the real-estate executive who was the architect of the first vacancy decontrol when he was Housing Commissioner under another Republican Governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller. The committee's report also recommends extending decontrol to current tenants with household incomes over $150,000 who live in apartments renting for more than $1,500 a month.
Tenant and landlord groups are already gearing up for the legislative struggle to come.
Michael McKee, development director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said he would join other tenant advocates on May 16 in chartering a series of buses bound for Albany, in the first tenant rally since Governor Pataki took office.
ON the other side, Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said that his group had already begun lobbying legislators.
"There's going to be a major battle in 1997, but that doesn't mean we're not doing anything now," said Mr. Spinola. "I don't think we'll be able to reduce the limits this year -- we'll try -- but I think maybe this year we'll be able to pass a law putting rent that's being withheld into escrow."
Mr. Spinola and his group contend that the escrow measure is necessary because some tenants, faced with a decontrol order, would unfairly claim "diminution of services" and not send in their rent. "After about eight months -- long enough to see they're not going to win -- they'll just run out without paying," said Mr. Hemmerdinger.
Mr. Hemmerdinger said that he was making renovations at his two back-to-back postwar apartment buildings -- 40 Central Park South and 41 West 58th Street -- that he would not have undertaken without luxury decontrol. He has hired two noted interior designers, Jed Johnson and Alan Wanzenberg, to draw up plans for elaborate granite and bronze lobbies in both buildings and for renovations to the entrance on Central Park South.
He said that he would redo the elevators at both and that he had spent in "six figures" resurrecting the garden courtyard between the buildings. He said he was installing an elaborate plastic-key and card security system that will restrict even the tenants to certain floors. He is replacing the buildings' old balconies with stainless steel ones.
"Like any landlord, you let the carpet get threadbare, let the elevators look seedy," said the outspoken developer and landlord. "Now I have motivation: I can't get the higher market rents unless my halls look good."
THE first step in high-rent, high-income decontrol involves a questionnaire. Under the system, landlords may send income questionnaires to anyone who pays rent of $2,000 a month or more. If the tenant replies that gross household income has not totaled more than $250,000 in each of the last two years, or if the questionnaire is not returned, an income check is run through the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. If the tenant answers yes, or if the income check reveals that the household is "over income," a decontrol order is issued.
At this point, negotiations often begin. The landlords interviewed all agreed that their first choice was to keep the sitting tenant -- but at a higher rent. Tenants can appeal decontrol orders, as landlords can appeal denials. The decontrol orders do not become effective until the expiration of the lease.
Until recently, Doug Oliver was a rent-stabilized tenant in an 11-room, high-ceilinged prewar apartment at 21 East 66th Street, a building that was converted to a condominium six years ago. Mr. Oliver was paying $2,700 a month when he received the decontrol questionnaire. Some of his friends in the neighborhood are paying that much for a one-bedroom apartment, he freely concedes.
When Mr. Oliver received the questionnaire, he decided that his days as a $2,700-a-month renter were numbered -- despite the fact, he said, that his highly variable yearly income as a commercial real estate broker had been over the threshold in only one of the two preceding years.
"The first year I had tremendous losses," he said. "But my second year was great. So even though I didn't qualify then, they can send these questionnaires out every year and I knew it wouldn't be long before I did."
At first, Mr. Oliver's instinct was to fight, and to drag the procedure out as long as possible, continuing to pay the $2,700 rent "probably until the year 2000." He called lobbying groups and "rushed down to Mike McKee's office and gave him a check for $5,000 to go to Albany and do something. I paid another $3,000 for old ladies to go picket. I gave a couple of Councilpeople contributions."
But then he and the conversion sponsor worked out a compromise: the sponsor would sell him the 11-room apartment, with three exposures, 28 windows and three fireplaces, for $1.23 million. The apartment has been appraised for more than double that figure, he said. As part of the deal, the condominium's sponsor required that if Mr. Oliver sold within three years of the purchase -- a process known as "flipping" the apartment -- Mr. Oliver would pay him a set sum, which he declined to disclose. With the mortgage and maintenance, Mr. Oliver said, he now pays about $15,000 a month before taxes -- more than five times his former rent. At market value the apartment might rent for between $18,000 and $20,000 a month, according to Ms. Lenz.
ALTHOUGH the apartment appears to be a sound financial investment, Mr. Oliver said that he made the decision at least partly because "once I got into a real out-and-out battle, they were right that someday they'd get it back, and I didn't want to live in my house under that threat; my home was in jeopardy."
Pam and Kevin Wolf, after their initial shock on receiving a questionnaire, also felt that their home was in jeopardy. In doing their $250,000 renovation six years ago, they had combined two rental apartments in the postwar white-brick building at 920 Park Avenue, at 80th Street. Their total rent was $4,100 a month. They said that with the landlord's permission they put in new windows, central air-conditioning and heat, some slate floors, Jacuzzis and an elegant winding staircase. They had remodeled every room.
When they move out this August, at the end of their lease, the rent on their apartment, they said, is scheduled to go up to $7,500 a month. "It sounds outrageous, but according to people who have been looking, the landlord will probably get it," Mrs. Wolf said. "This apartment works well for people who want to live on Park Avenue but can't pass stringent co-op rules."
Like Mr. Oliver, the Wolfs decided to buy -- but not in the same building. (The building at 920 Park is all rental, so they did not have the option.)
They declined to give the exact address or the price they are paying for their new apartment, but Mrs. Wolf deemed the monthly after-tax expenses "comparable" to the $7,500 they would have had to pay to stay where they are.
She said she felt that the new building, a landmark on Central Park West, would be more conducive to raising their two children, Jessica, 3, and Jared, 2.
"We're leaving the East Side for the West Side, for a more family-oriented building, where the children can Rollerblade in the lobby," Mrs. Wolf said. "Here one of the tenants once asked the doorman if the children and I couldn't ride in the freight elevator."

LONG WHARF READINGS
Four new plays will be presented in readings at Stage II at Long Wharf in New Haven this week, followed by discussions between the audiences and the artists. Admission will be free, but donations, at a suggested $7, may be made at the box office.
Opening the series on Tuesday at 7:15 P.M. is Anthony Clarvoe's "Brothers Karamazov," based on the Dostoyevsky novel and directed by Gordon Edelstein, the theater's associate artistic director. Wednesday's offering at 8:15 P.M. is an acidic comedy called "The Smell of the Kill," by Michelle Lowe, in which three women at a dinner party, tired of their inattentive husbands, flip a coin to decide what dire fate will befall the men. 
 In "Poor Super Man," by Brad Fraser, on Thursday at 8:15 P.M. a male artist falls in love with his boss, a married man, and the consequences are a three-way stretch of urbanity, eroticism and hilarity. The final reading on Friday at 8:15 will be Jamie's Baker's "All Americans," a play about a black man who is hired as the basketball coach at a Southern university that refused to admit him as a student, regenerating old prejudices.
More than 70 new plays have been presented at Long Wharf in this manner since the workshops began in 1985. Nancy Fales, David Wiltse, Michael Henry Brown, Larry Shue and A. R. Gurney are among playwrights who have benefited from the exposure. Call 787-4282 to reserve tickets or obtain more information.
 
ORCHIDS TO BONSAI
 The Bartlett Arboretum of the University of Connecticut in North Stamford will holds its annual Spring Garden Fair on Saturday from 10 to 3 at 151 Brookdale Road. More than 10,000 annuals, perennials, wildflowers, herbs, ground covers, orchids and bonsai will be for sale, along with garden and gardening accessories displayed by vendors from throughout the tri-state area.
Demonstrations of pruning and instruction on the safe use of pesticides and the creation of a compost pile from yard and kitchen waste will be ongoing, as well as supervised activities for children.
Visitors are encouraged to bring blankets and picnics to enjoy on the grounds, and proceeds from anything they buy will go toward the arboretum's educational programs. Call 322-6971 for more information.
 
'BABAR' WITH MUSIC
 Francis Poulenc's music for Jean de Brunhoff's beloved "Story of Babar" will be performed by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra and narrated by Peter John Sacco, the orchestra's conductor, abetted by Babar's great-grandson, in three locations this week.
The programs are designed especially for children from 3 through 6 years of age, organized in cooperation with the Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven. The symphony's Kinder Konzerts are an annual series in which two performances are given at each site.
This year's first appearances are scheduled for tomorrow at Warsaw Park, Route 243 in Ansonia at 9:30 A.M. and 10:45 A.M. Tuesday's location is the Jewish Community Center, 360 Amity Road in Woodbridge, and on Wednesday it's the Daisy Ingraham School at 105 Goodspeed Road in Westbrook.

THE MEXICAN MARKET
 "Market Realism: Short and Long Term from the Mexican and United States Perspectives" is the subject of a panel discussion at a World Affairs Council lunch on Friday at 11:45 A.M. at the Hartford Club.
The program will feature Sergio Hidalgo, Trade Commissioner of Mexico, and Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C. Gabriele Lamers, an international economist with the Bank of Boston will serve as moderator.
The fee for lunch and the program is $45. Call 594-4100 for reservations.
 
CHILDREN AND DRUGS
 In a scenario that youngsters from from third through ninth grade can understand, David Crane, Marta Kauffman and Michael Skloff have come up with a musical titled "Jekyll and Hyde."
The show will have two performances on Tuesday at 10 A.M. and noon at the Palace Theater, 61 Atlantic Street in Stamford, produced by Theaterworks/USA.
The main character is a teen-ager, Henry Meckler, premiere nerd of his school and resident chemistry genius. Desperately needing something to boost his social standing, he invents a substance that he calls More, which he imbibes, transforming himself into the personification of cool -- charming with women, aggressive with bullies and so on.
Henry needs more and more More to maintain his new persona, until it takes over his life and sends him into an academic and personal tailspin. Any resemblance to drug addiction among school children is purely intentional, but the aim is to entertain as well as inform children and their parents. Tickets are $5. Call 325-4466 for reservations or more information.
 
ALL HANDS TO THE OARS
 The Norwalk Harbor Splash in South Norwalk has a crowded agenda today that starts with a rowing regatta from 8 A.M. to 1 P.M. in which 200 men and women will participate.
A children's Gutter Regatta from 10 to 5 will be held at the Maritime Center at 10 North Water Street, in which staff members will help with the making of a small boat that will then be tested for seaworthiness.
Boat-building demonstrations will go on all day at the center; kayak building will be in session from 10 to 1 and 2 to 5:30 at the Woodworkers Shop south of the center at 85 Water Street.
Hourly narrated tours of the harbor aboard the Island Girl are scheduled from 10 to 4 and cost $7, departing from Hope Dock next to the Maritime Center. At the center's own dock the sailing ship Mimi, a 72-foot ketch may be boarded for tours from 10 to 5.
Many restaurants in the area will have Chowder Pot signs in their windows, indicating that they are participants in the Clam Chowder Cook off from 11 to 4. Samplings will be supplied to visitors, who may then cast their votes for a winner.
A walking tour of historic SoNo will be led by the city's historian, Ralph Bloom, at 1:30, and the new New England Brewery at 13 Marshall Street will hold an open house from 1 to 5 P.M.
At noon, 2 and 4 P.M., red, white and blue columns of water spouting from a fireboat will add some color, and the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum nearby at 295 East Avenue will open from 1 to 4 P.M. with an exhibition titled "From Shoreline to Sheffield, a 100-Year Retrospective."

Moving Out to a Home on the Ever-Costlier Range

BYLINE: By DOUG McINNIS 

DATELINE: LANDER, Wyo.

 BODY:
IN California, Ken Marble lived in upscale Newport Beach, drove a Mercedes and owned a boat-cleaning business. Two years ago he traded the California life style for harsh winters, seven-day work weeks, and the uncertain financial future of owning a Western ranch.
His summer work day now begins at 4:30 A.M. when he irrigates his hay fields, and ends as the sun sets. But when calves are born in the later winter and early spring, the work day never stops. Every hour or two, round the clock, Mr. Marble checks the barn where pregnant cows are isolated. He could lose both cow and calf if he doesn't act quickly when something goes wrong. 
 He has already lost three calves this year, including one that was born unexpectedly on the range and died from hypothermia when it fell in a creek. Mr. Marble's Red Bluff Ranch is just 2,000 acres, small by Western standards. He raises only 60 calves a year, so every calf is critical to the ranch's profitability.
The 35-year-old Mr. Marble runs his ranch single-handed, a not uncommon practice in the West. He is part of an influx of outsiders who have bought Western ranches in recent years. Though still small, the migration is driving up the price of land in highly scenic sections of Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. Mr. Marble's ranch is cradled in one of the most desirable areas -- the foothills of Wyoming's Wind River Mountains, which crest in the clouds at the Continental Divide.
The newcomers are producing a domino effect. Some long-time ranching families are selling scenic ranches at premium prices, then taking their profits and buying much bigger spreads in less scenic, less costly areas of the West.
For instance, Dr. Tom Carlson, a veterinarian and rancher, sold his 600-acre horse ranch in Shell at the base of red cliffs in Wyoming's Big Horn Mountains. He then acquired 16,000 acres in the high plains near Medicine Bow and had money left over.
The domino phenomenon is driving up prices in even the cheaper areas, said Blair Newman, a ranch broker with Frontier Realty in Torrington, Wyo.
None of this is typical in ranch country. Usually ranchers sell to their children, or their neighbors. Bill Cheney bought his 11,000-acre ranch near Casper, Wyo., from his mother in 1973. He is now selling the ranch to his son, Bob. In both sales, the older generation gave the new one a price break, said Mr. Cheney.
"You have to sell the ranch at a discount to your offspring in order for them to be able to pay for it," he said.
By contrast, Mr. Marble and other newcomers made their money in other fields and they have little difficulty financing their acquisitions, or buying them outright.
Some of the new arrivals view their new holdings as an investment. They hope to make money off both cattle sales and the long-term appreciation in land prices. Others, such as Mr. Marble, say they are buying a new way of life.
Mr. Marble spent weeks traveling through Wyoming on high school vacations, passing ranches that were miles away from one another. "That's what really stood out -- the openness of it," he said. "Out of the blue I got this crazy notion that I wanted to buy a ranch. I had never been on a horse."
He runs the ranch by himself, without hired hands, and takes pride in the black Angus cattle he raises. He lives alone in a log cabin built not long after the Red Bluff was homesteaded in 1884. The home lies at about 6,000 feet.
From the ranch's highest point, at about 7,000 feet, Mr. Marble can see the Wind River range to the west and the foothills of the Big Horn Mountains 100 miles to the north. His companions are his livestock, two dogs and the deer, elk, antelope and rattlesnakes that abound in the area.
Mr. Marbles said he welcomed isolation. "It's not for everyone. You've got to be of that mindset. I love people, but I kind of like knowing that they're on the other side of the hill."
THE ranching business appeals to his preference for hard labor. In Newport Beach, Mr. Marble donned a wet suit each day and spent eight hours underwater cleaning the bottoms of pleasure boats. "You were soaking wet all day long. Visibility was about two feet. It was very demanding."
Mr. Marble bought the ranch in 1986, but leased his range land to other ranchers for the next six years while he continued to run his California business. Income from the boat service generated funds for ranch improvements, and a cash cushion he would need for his new vocation.
"It's like any new business -- you had better have cash reserves," he said. "It takes a year to prime the pipeline. It's a year before you have any calves to sell."
Since his arrival, he has made the transition from native Californian to high plains rancher. Foreign cars gave way to a beat-up 1983 Ford pickup, and he has been elected secretary-treasurer of the Fremont County Cattlemen's Association.
He still has much to learn. "I've bought cows [at auction] an established rancher wouldn't look at. It's very difficult to develop an eye for cattle."
Then, there are long days of herding cattle, repairing fence lines and maintaining ranch equipment and buildings. The toughest hurdles, though, are cyclical downturns in cattle prices and the devasting whims of Nature.
Last year Mr. Marble encountered both. The extended Western drought withered grasslands. With less to eat, calves bound for market weighed roughly 50 pounds less than those the year before. Then, fall calf prices plunged 17 percent, the worst year-to-year drop in 21 years. The combination cost ranchers well over $100 for each calf sold -- more than a quarter of their gross income.
"I knew the downside, but it's still a bit of a shock when you work all year for nothing," he said. "A lot of ranchers did that last year, and they'll do that for a couple of years more. The cattle numbers are too high and when they're too high something has to break, and that's the price."
MR. MARBLE looked at some 25 ranches before he settled on the Red Bluff. Though he got the asking price down roughly $100,000, he worries that $225,000 he paid for the ranch may have been too high for the economics of running cattle.
He would like to buy more land and run bigger herds. But rising prices in the Wind River region make that impossible for now, though high prices have some advantages. Mr. Marble estimates his ranch's value has doubled since he bought it.
But Mr. Marble said he wasn't in it to make money on real estate. He wants to be a rancher, and he said he was prepared to take a second job -- as many other ranchers do -- if he needs to. He's learning how to shoe horses, a job that is always likely to have customers in the West.
The ranching business "used to be easier, but not anymore," he said.
"The margins are too tight," he explained. "Forty years ago a family could survive on a ranch this size."
Mr. Marble, who is single, doesn't have to feed a family from the Red Bluff's cash flow. His only concern is to make the ranch succeed.
"I have nothing to lose," he said. "I don't have a family. If I lose it all, I'd start over again."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
A Crowd-Pleaser With a Mission

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: SOMERSET

 BODY:
ON a recent Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens here, the Rev. DeForest Soaries Jr. stepped to the pulpit, looked out at one of the largest black congregations in New Jersey and announced that he had an important story to tell.
There was an incident the week before in Franklin Township, he said, involving white police officers and a black youth with a gun. The youth had been firing into people's windows. When a 27-year-old rookie officer approached him, the young man pointed a 9-millimeter handgun at the officer's head. The rookie and his partner wrestled the gun away and arrested him. 
 Just another police story? No, the minister said.
"You didn't hear about this because the officer didn't shoot," said Mr. Soaries, who then introduced the officer, his partner and several of his colleagues to the applauding crowd of 1,500. "We salute you for your courage. We believe in what's right. We'll fight you to the death if you mess with us, but we'll stand by you to the end if you do what's right.
"Lord," he continued, "we thank you for your grace that has spared our community pain at a time when tensions are high between blacks and whites. You raised up these two police officers who dared to use courage rather than power."
In its mix of showmanship and sincerity, it was a vintage performance by "Buster" Soaries -- a very public man who says it is his goal to improve the lot of the people who populate the tough Route 27 corridor that his ministry serves.
When the 43-year-old Mr. Mr. Soaries (pronounced SOR-ease) talks about his work and his mission, he speaks of a ministry with a hand in economic development, education, politics and, of course, religion. When his admirerers talk about him, they use words like dynamic and trustworthy, visionary and innovator.
"He is extremely bright and articulate, and his views are always thoughtful and well expressed," said Peter Verniero, who, as chief of staff for Governor Whitman, has consulted with Mr. Soaries, a political independent, from time to time. "He will tell you what he thinks is right rather than what he thinks you want to hear."
Local newspapers have called Mr. Soaries an unabashed self-promoter whose ego matches his desire to help people. And Mr. Soaries doesn't disagree.
"I'm not bashful or shy of my intent to make my voice known," he said in an interview at his church office, which is filled with books and awards. "We can send the message that there is something else happening besides complaining and anger and conflict. There is some good news."
Drive by the church, and you might mistake it for a white-brick schoolhouse in an open suburban setting. But a closer look reveals a church not far from neighborhoods where teen-age pregnancy, crime and drug abuse are common. As Mr. Soaries puts it, the church faces "the challenges of urban life without the environment of urban life."
The First Baptist Church was founded in the 1930's and has always been an important institution here. Under the direction of Mr. Soaries, who has been pastor since November 1990, the congregation has grown from 1,500 to 3,700 members. On a recent Sunday, the 11 A. M. service -- the third and last of the day -- was so packed that the overflow crowd watched the proceedings on a big-screen TV in the basement.
AWAY from the church, Mr. Soaries is a very busy man, overseeing the building of a nascent empire. In the pulpit, he touches on subjects like economic empowerment, educational challenges and spiritual growth, and, he says, these are the cornerstones of all his plans.
He is chairman of the First Baptist Community Development Corporation, a non-profit organization that is working with the state and local businesses to rebuild an 880-acre area near the southwest border of New Brunswick. Under a program called Renaissance 2000 that is being underwritten largely by corporate and community grants, the organization hopes to establish new low- and moderate-income housing, small businesses, primary-care health services, job training, day care, a credit union and a loan program. Youth development programs focusing on counseling and teen-age pregnancy prevention would be also be included. So would a new $4 million church complex (with seats for 2,000), scheduled to break ground this summer behind the existing church. Much of the cost will come from the congregation.
Mr. Soaries has also started a report card collection program at the church that assigns tutors to students who do not maintain a B average. He is the author of "My Family is Driving Me Crazy," a book geared to help adolescents deal with family issues. And he has produced three videos encouraging teen-agers to practice sexual abstinence.
"There are many churches in depressed neighborhoods, yet those churches often exist in spite of the neighborhood's needs," he said. "Our church has got to be more than simply a place where people pray."
Mr. Soaries says he is also preparing to start a Christian music record label, Proclaim Records. He is a member of the New Era Bank board of directors and chairman of the board of directors of the Boys and Girls Club of Newark. And writes a column for The Home News of New Brunswick.
"He writes about a variety of things and he's a pretty good writer," said Barbara Frankel, director of the newspaper's editorial pages. "He seems genuinely concerned about helping people not only in his church but in the community. I think he's very well-regarded in education and community circles."
This was not the line of work Mr. Soaries had intended for himself when he was growing up in Montclair, where his father was pastor of a small church. He aspired to be a professional baseball player.
When those dreams faded ("I was too short," he says) he became politically active, working with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH organization from 1973 until 1976.
He turned toward religion in the mid-1970's after his father died suddenly at age 48. "I felt that religious understanding was the most fundamental need that humans had," he said.
He received a bachelor of arts in religious studies from Fordham University in 1986, a master of divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1989, and a doctor of ministry degree from United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, in 1992.
But political activism continues to be the hallmark of his ministry. In 1991, he led a coalition of black moderates and conservatives who declared their support for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. Two years later, he was often quoted in papers and television broadcasts denying claims made by Ed Rollins, Mrs. Whitman's political strategist, that black ministers had been paid off to suppress the black vote during the 1993 election, in which Mrs. Whitman became Governor. Mr. Rollins later retracted the claims.
"He asked me to pray for him," Mr. Soaries said about Mr. Rollins at the time. "I said I'd pray for his soul, but in the meantime I have to do something about his mouth."
These days, Mr. Soaries says he is questioned several times each week about whether he himself would consider running for office. Some people think he's up to the task.
"Buster possesses great integrity, a great intellectualism," said the Rev. Donald Hilliard, senior pastor of the Second Baptist Church Cathedral in Perth Amboy. "I feel that he has the guts for politics. I think he possesses great political and business savvy. I think he has the makings of a great visionary politician that will lift us to greater heights."
But Mr. Soaries says no.
"The last thing I'd want to do is run for office," he said, adding that he would prefer to concentrate on pursuing his various interests and spending more time with his wife, Donna, and their twin sons, Malcolm and Martin, named after Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Not everyone agrees with his approach.
"One fellow said to me, 'If you spent less time trying to help the community, you'd be a better pastor.'
"But people can't just send their souls to church. They have to their bodies -- and sometimes those bodies are hungry and without jobs. We must do something for mind, body and soul, because religion should be meaningful to all three."

A Legal Battle Is Bubbling Over Fat-Free Cheese Patent

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD

 BODY:
Call him a dreamer, but Carl Wolf envisions a day when Americans will find rich foods downright unappealing.
As low-fat sweets, meats and dairy products flood supermarket shelves, he says, palates will evolve. That is why Mr. Wolf, the chief executive of Alpine Lace Brands here, has engaged in a battle to protect his recipe for fat-free cheese. 
 On March 7, Alpine Lace won apatent for its intricate process of making several kinds of no-fat cheeses. That same day, Mr. Wolf sued his much larger competitors -- Borden, Healthy Choice, Kraft and Schreiber Foods -- charging patent infringement.
"We spent a lot of money developing the technology for this product," he said. "Now we would like an economic reward."
Over the years, Mr. Wolf said, he has spent about $14 million in a quest for the perfect fat-free cheese. In 1990, he bought the rights for a specific recipe from a Wisconsin dairy scientist, Aly Gamay. Almost immediately, he applied for a patent to protect it.
But in the meantime, larger companies introduced their own healthful cheeses and began to dominate the market. Through "reverse engineering," Alpine Lace determined that certain parts of the rival companies' formulas violate its patent, Mr. Wolf said.
None of the companies sued would comment, except to say that they were reviewing the suit and the allegations.
"It was out of the blue," said Walt Casey, vice president of corporate communications for Conagra Inc., which makes the Healthy Choice brand. "We're studying all the information and trying to come to some conclusion."
For Alpine Lace, which has annual sales of about $132 million and represents a tiny fraction of the $6 billion cheese market, the suit could bring substantial profits. Mr. Wolf is hoping for unspecified damages and royalties from the four companies. If he wins, Alpine Lace could collect annual royalty payments of $3 million to $8 million from each.
Meantime, the company is reaping the benefits of publicity. Since it received the patent, its stock price has increased by more than 80 percent.
Mr. Wolf and his wife, Marion, started their cheese company in 1983 and have been focusing on low-fat products ever since. Alpine Lace products are manufactured in Illinois and Wisconsin, but about 40 employees work at the company headquarters in Maplewood, where all the accounting and marketing are done. The office also has a test kitchen, with industrial-size refrigerator, cheese slicer and toaster oven.
"We were one of the first to see an opportunity for this business in the early 80's," said Mr. Wolf, who grew up in Newark and now lives in South Orange. "It took a lot of work to make the product taste right and get the public interested, but now the time is right."
The Alpine Lace fat-free product line includes American slices, Parmesan and cream cheese. A trim 51-year-old, Mr. Wolf has the peculiar ability to make his products sound succulent.
"Last night after my tennis game, I ate a bagel with our low-sodium Muenster," he said. "If you want something more filling, our fat-free garlic and herb cream cheese can be mixed with fettuccine for a terrific fettuccine Alfredo."
The market for low-fat and fat-free cheeses is indeed growing, even if at first bite they might have been less than toothsome. Early low-fat cheeses tended to have a waxy consistency and would not melt well, Mr. Wolf said, but now they are tastier.
Mr. Wolf said that as baby boomers age, they are driving a national trend toward healthier, low-fat diets. Just as thousands of Americans have converted to diet cola and skim milk, he said, they will soon prefer fat-free cheese.
But if older Americans are filling their grocery carts with guilt-free treats, he said, teen-agers and people in their 20's are hesitating. To lure them away from Twinkies and Big Macs, Alpine Lace has hired a new spokeswoman: the model Kim Alexis. "She's young, she's healthy," Mr. Wolf said with an explanatory shrug. "And she loves her cheeses."

Modest Rise in Tuition at State Colleges, With an Exception

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
In a departure from the dramatic increases of several years ago, most of New Jersey's state colleges will not raise tuition significantly next fall. An exception is Kean College in Union, where tuition will increase by almost 10 percent because of declining enrollment and stagnant state aid.
An improved economy is the main reason state college tuitions have stabilized in recent years, said Darryl G. Greer, executive director of the New Jersey State College Governing Boards Association, an advisory board to the colleges. Another major factor, he said, is that the state is now paying for costly salary increases negotiated with the unions for faculty and staff members. Tuition increases that sometimes rose above 10 percent in 1990 and 1991 were partly due to those increases. 
 "All of the unionized personnel received huge pay raises, but the state did not fund them," Mr. Greer said. "So the colleges bore the entire burden of that expense."
Although Governor Whitman recommended in 1994 that state college tuitions should not rise by more than 3.5 percent, she has not imposed an official cap. Tuition will rise by an average of about $125, or 5 percent -- a sharp drop from the 1990-91 average, 14 percent.
Usually, tuition increases do not differ significantly from one state college to the next. There have been exceptions: in the 1992-93 school year, Trenton State raised its tuition by 19.3 percent while the other schools hovered in the 4 percent range. That year, Trenton State added a $500 surcharge to its tuition to help offset higher salaries.
Even with an impending increase of 9.73 percent, or $203 per student, Kean College will still have the lowest tuition of all the four-year state campuses, at $2,288. Patricia Molden, the spokeswoman at Kean, said that without the increase, the college would have a deficit of $1.25 million. Besides covering the deficit, the increase will help underwrite several projects, including a library renovation.
Since the State Department of Higher Education was abolished last year, public colleges are required to conduct public hearings before their trustees vote on tuition increases. But officials at several state colleges said that so far, only a handful of students had attended.
"There seems to be hardly a whimper out there," Mr. Greer said.
At Kean last week, several students interviewed were not even aware of the increase. David G. Brown 2d, a Kean student who is president of the campus group that represents full-time students, said few people had voiced objections.
"We never, ever want an increase, but the fact is we are the most underfunded state college," Mr. Brown said. "The increase is definitely a big hit on us, but we since we are demanding improvements, we pretty much have to support it."
If tuition costs have stabilized somewhat, fees have not. To cover the cost of student clubs, athletics and other extracurricular activities, state college fees have risen by as much as 23 percent in recent years. This year, for example, the fees at Kean will increase by 9.9 percent, or $139, to help cover the operating costs of a new student center. And at Rowan College in Glassboro, students will pay $282 more to cover items like a new recreational complex and computer upkeep.
"There seems to be a lot of apathy on campus," Jason Levin, president of Rowan's student government, said of the fees. "People just don't realize they can affect the outcome of a tuition increase."
Mr. Greer, of the state college advisory board, said tuition increases would continue to depend on state financing, which is not keeping pace with inflation. Next year, the colleges will receive an average state-aid increase of less than 1 percent. He stressed that tuition covers only about a third of the cost of a state college education, which is about $10,000 per student.
Even though it has the second-highest enrollment of all the state colleges, Kean receives the least state aid. Next year, the average amount of state aid per student will be $5,100; Kean is scheduled to receive $4,053 per student. Enrollment has little to do with the amount of aid a school gets, Mr. Greer said.
This month, Kean will graduate one of its largest senior classes ever, a result of peak enrollment several years ago when the economy was unstable and more people were either returning to school or staying within the state for college. The projected enrollment for freshmen next year is not enough to make up for the loss of more than 2,000 seniors, Ms. Molden said. About 11,000 students are enrolled now.
"If a higher tuition means we can put more money into attracting students, that's fine with me," said Mr. Brown, the Kean student. "The more people we can get, the lighter our tuition burden in the long run."

From Japan, Wall St. Looks Down Hill

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE American stock market rose to record highs last week -- at least if you measure it in dollars. But viewed from Tokyo, this market looks very different.
Measured in yen, the Standard & Poor's 500 fell to its lowest level in more than four years in April. Even with last week's surge in stock price, which coincided with a strengthening dollar, the index, measured in yen, is only 17 percent above the low hit in the 1990 recession. In dollars, the index is up 76 percent since then.
A chart-reader would immediately see a triple-top in the S.& P. yen chart. The American market peaked on June 12, 1990, challenged that high but fell short in April 1992 and then did it again in February 1993. It is now 23 percent below the peak. 
 Those statistics help explain why some foreigners are dismayed by dollar-based investments, but they also explain the increasing talk of foreign takeovers. In yen, American stocks look like bargains.
The accompanying chart shows the S.& P. 500 in dollars and yen since the end of 1969, when the index stood at 92.06. At its high close last week, the S.& P. was at 520.54, a gain of 465 percent. But over the same period the dollar has fallen from almost 360 yen, to about 84 yen. Measured in yen, the S.& P. has risen just 91 percent over more than a quarter of a century.
Those figures do not include dividends, and so understate total returns. An American investor who bought the S.& P. 500 at the end of 1969, reinvested all dividends and somehow avoided paying taxes throughout the period, would have earned a compound annual return, through the end of April, of 11.2 percent, with an inital investment of $100 growing to almost $1,500. But a Japanese investor would have seen an initial investment of 100 yen grow to 349 yen, a compound annual return of just 5.1 percent.

Why Does the Market Keep Going Up . . . When Economic Trends Are Pointing Down

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
AMERICA'S trade deficit is as big as the gross national product of Switzerland. Ten dollars hardly buys a cappuccino in Tokyo. And President Clinton is telling Newt Gingrich that the ballooning budget deficit is now a Republican problem. Yet the stock market just keeps flying upward, and bond prices have recovered smartly from last summer's doldrums. Go figure.
Actually, the figuring is not so hard. While there is a gap between the apparent state of the United States economy and the markets that are supposed to be its barometer, economists are having no trouble coming up with theories to explain the paradox. What is hard is discerning the diamonds among the cubic zirconiums -- to make sense from sometimes overlapping, sometimes inconsistent views of what has put the wow in the Dow. Here are a few interesting ones.
 
Good News and Bad News
 No indicator of American economic decline stands out like the fallen dollar. Where just months ago commentators were aghast at the prospect that the greenback might slip below 100 Japanese yen, they are now wondering whether it will ever again see the light above 85 yen. Indeed, if the dollar hadn't fallen 15 percent against the yen since Dec. 1, hardly anyone would be puzzled why the Dow Jones industrial average had risen 16 percent in the same period. 
 And if it seems odd that the prices of securities are rising, even as the currency in which they are denominated is falling, that is because it is odd. M.B.A.'s bearing spreadsheets are puzzled, too. After all, if foreigners expect the dollar to keep falling, one would expect them to insist on higher returns.
But Richard Cooper, a Harvard economist and a former adviser to President Jimmy Carter, offers a plausible explanation. While some money managers have undoubtedly sold bonds and stocks to get out of dollars, he suggests that the extent of the globalization of capital markets has been exaggerated: Most dollar-denominated assets are still owned by people and institutions who count their wins and losses in dollars alone. "When all is said and done," Mr. Cooper argued, "the American securities markets are still domestic markets."
From this perspective, the depreciated dollar should increase the value of United States stocks because it increases the profits of American corporations abroad. The companies with Japanese and European subsidiaries benefit directly from the rising yen and German mark because the same level of earnings translates into more dollars in the earnings report. But the biggest winners are American companies that export -- or compete against imports. Detroit, for example, is now in the enviable position of being able to raise prices without fear that Japanese auto makers will be able to make further inroads into their home market.
When both the windfall earnings and the increased competitiveness are taken into account, concluded Paul Krugman, an economist at Stanford University, "there just isn't much left to explain."
 
Good News and Good News
 In the 1960's and 70's, inflation was seen as the Godzilla of economic problems. Each boom in the business cycle brought a frightening spike in prices, as the costs of raw commodities rose along with wages in response to increased demand. But prices -- especially the price of labor -- proved sticky: wage-driven inflation did not disappear as the economy cooled off. Indeed, the economy seemed cursed with an ever-accumulating residue of inflation as it entered each fresh economic recovery.
But the monster has retreated. Inflation fell more rapidly than predicted in the recession of 1980-82, and never rose much when the economy expanded for most of the rest of the decade. More surprising yet, the red-hot growth over the last year, which pushed unemployment to the lowest level since 1989, has seemed to have little impact on wages.
Perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve's determination last year to raise interest rates in the face of uncertain economic growth apparently convinced money managers that Washington's tolerance for inflation was near an all-time low. Better yet, when the Fed acted, it acted with finesse, steering the economy toward that magic place between inflation and recession known as the soft landing. "Everything is going right from the point of view of a long expansion," said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
News of victory on the inflation front perks up bond prices for obvious reasons. Bonds are obligations to pay a fixed amount of interest each year. The lower the rate of inflation, the higher the purchasing power of future interest payments and the higher the value of the principal returned when the bond matures.
Thus, the market's relief that the new year did not ring in inflation helps explain the boom in bonds. But why would expectations of price stability add sizzle to stocks?
There is plenty of evidence for a strong relationship between stable prices and rising stock prices. "The stock market detests inflation," said Robert Lawrence, an economist at Harvard.
On the other hand, economic theory offers no straightforward explanation. Indeed, older textbooks suggest that investors in stocks should be indifferent to inflation because stocks represent claims on corporate earnings that rise with prices. One possibility, of course, is that investors' attitudes are colored by prejudices about unstable prices: Franco Modigliani, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggests that stockholders just don't get it -- they don't understand that inflation won't hurt them.
The more widely accepted view these days gives investors more credit. That's because they know about monetary policy and taxes. The worse inflation gets, says James Tobin of Yale University, the less likely that the economy will escape a recession once the Fed clamps down on credit. And because recessions cut corporate profits, inflation is the enemy of stockholders.
A more elegant argument is that investors, unlike economists, read the fine print in the tax laws. Because corporate depreciation schedules are not indexed to inflation, higher inflation rates mean higher effective rates of taxation on profits.
Whatever the reason, said Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale and a specialist in the psychological underpinnings of economic choice, it is no longer in dispute that "the markets hate inflation." Because of this consensus, the success of the economy in weathering another peak in the business cycle without significant inflation is a plausible explanation for the bull market of 1995.
 
Hollowing Out
 Since the mid-1970's, the rich have become richer, the poor have become poorer and middle-class families have managed to hold their own only by working longer hours. Just why is still a matter of dispute: Explanations put varying weights on technological change, international competition, immigration, de-unionization and education.
What is hardly in dispute is Washington's failure to hold back the tide of redistribution with tax and spending policies. Indeed, changes in Federal tax laws in the 1980's favored high-income Americans at the expense of those in the middle.
Thus one explanation of the stock market boom that followed the 1994 election is that the income-distribution revolution of the Reagan years had been confirmed. Indeed, Congressional Republicans are pledged to cut the tax on capital gains. And most of the conservative flat-tax proposals would reduce tax rates on dividend and interest income, raising the after-tax return on capital.
A more tortuous link between higher securities prices and widening income inequality involves the fact that human skills are worth more than ever. Wages for unskilled workers and earnings on investments on physical capital apparently have not changed much in recent decades. What has changed is the reward for white-collar skills.
Much of this change has been captured by individuals in the forms of higher wages for specialized labor and profits in closely held businesses. But a portion is also being taken by corporations organized around human skills -- computer software companies, media conglomerates, investment banks and for-profit health care providers. The AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, depended on profits from its computer reservation system to carry it through the long recession in the airline industry."Companies that are good at marshaling intellectual skills are doing very, very well," said Robert Hall, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford.
Of course, knowledge-driven industries have been on the rise for many years. But it is striking how public awareness of their role has grown only in the last few. And it is at least plausible that bullish expectations for the knowledge industries are driving stock prices higher.
"The information sector," said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University, "is half the economy."
 
Through a Glass, Darkly
 One way or another, most explanations for the current securities boom turn on expectations of higher profits -- and for good reason. Stock and bond prices are rooted in real-world prospects, and in the long run they reflect expected future income from securities adjusted for future interest rates. But the long run can be very long and the roots can be very loose.
Fischer Black, a pioneer in the mathematical modeling of securities prices, defined an efficient market as one in which prices are no less than half and no more than double the actual value. By that criterion, the run-up in both stock and bond prices since last November may be an accident, like the haphazard course of a tornado.
But why should the haphazard be so important? John Maynard Keynes, who among his many careers was a successful financial speculator, once likened securities investment to a contest in which the participants are asked to pick the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs. The prize goes to the "investor" who most closely guesses the preferences of the other investors. Thus, while beauty -- here, akin to value -- acts as an anchor to choices, the process is riddled with the short-term consequences of second- , third- and fourth-guessing.
Mr. Keynes's analogy fits the Alice-in-Wonderland world that Mr. Shiller of Yale calls home to many investors. Mr. Shiller says rational stock players have no choice but to take the irrational very seriously.
"Symbols matter," he said,, "because they lead to self-fulfilling prophecies." Thus Mr. Shiller argues, for example, that breaking the 4,000 barrier on the Dow two months ago may explain subsequent gains.
Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard, agrees. "Explanations for why the stock market went up or down" she said, "belong on the funny pages."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: AT THE GATE;
Eyeing a Veterinary Chain? Be Sure to Check the Teeth

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
INVESTORS are a soft touch for the pet business. As they scoop up shares of Petsmart, the superstore chain, or of Veterinary Centers of America, they often think fondly of their own cat or dog and don't fret overmuch about the economic fundamentals.
But these sentimental favorites -- Pet smart sells at a hefty 97 times trailing earnings and Veterinary Centers commands 124 -- are hardly bargains. And the latest member of the litter is no exception. 
 Pet Practice, a chain of veterinary clinics, is the creation of John H. Foster, a well-known venture capitalist who has taken four health care companies public since 1986. Typically, he targets a fragmented business like physical therapy and, by developing a network of facilities, achieves cost efficiencies unavailable to individual practitioners. Pet Practice, based in King of Prussia, Pa., approaches the structurally similar $7 billion veterinary care business the same way.
"The consolidation of the industry makes all the sense in the world," said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst with Robertson Stephens. And animal health care is a lot simpler than the human variety. Investors don't have to worry about whether insurance companies will continue to pay for flea baths, financing for Medicare will be cut or political reformers will vote to change all the rules.
But shares of Pet Practice, which is to go public in June, are not as warm and fuzzy as they appear.
Although the company runs 55 clinics in eight states, it isn't making money. Last year the chain lost $1.5 million on sales of $36 million. That looks lackluster even against the modest profits of Veterinary Centers -- the only other publicly held company in the business -- which earned $589,000 on 1994 revenues of $42 million. (Petsmart has clinics in its stores, but they are leased to outside veterinarians.)
Pet Practice, which is less than two years old, "is at a much earlier stage of development," said Linda Killian of Renaissance Capital, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn. She thinks the company must expand geographically or into related fields, like pet food, if it is to succeed.
Despite the lack of a track record, Pet Practice shares are expected to be offered at between $13.50 and $16.50 -- roughly three times the company's sales per share, compared to Veterinary Centers, which sells for less than two times its per-share revenues. And Veterinary Centers isn't exactly cheap. Based on this year's estimated earnings of 40 cents a share, its stock has a lofty price-to-earnings ratio of 28.
Veterinary Centers has another leg up on its soon-to-be-public rival: it has expanded into related fields. The company bought several veterinary laboratories recently, and has entered into a joint venture with H. J. Heinz to produce specialty pet food. Also recently, Heinz invested $10 million in Veterinary Centers, raising its stake in the company to 27 percent.
Veterinary Centers doesn't have Mr. Foster and his proven track record behind it. While he is not personally involved in running Pet Practice, Mr. Foster does sit on its board. And its chairman, Stephen Nagy, is an executive vice president of Foster Management, the Philadelphia-based venture capital firm Mr. Foster founded and runs.
The Foster advantage can be big. While he refused to be interviewed about the pending deal, Mr. Foster's ability to reward investors, including himself, speaks for itself. Of the four ventures he has brought public, three have recorded sizable gains and the fourth, issued 11 months ago, is hovering around its offering price.
But there's a catch. Gains for two of those companies came in part from their takeover by Novacare, the rehabilitative services company Mr. Foster heads. No one thinks Novacare will buy Pet Practice.
And Mr. Foster's group, which will still own about half of Pet Practice after it goes public, plans to cash out some of its preferred stock and debt in the deal. That payment will eat up nearly a third of the $53 million Pet Practice wants to raise, while another $16 million or so will go to pay the company's other lenders, U.S. Trust and PNC Bank. After fees -- including a $500,000 payment to Foster Management for its help with the offering -- only $16 million will be left to open new outlets or finance growth.
So, investors in Pet Practice may be chasing the wrong tail. Then again, when people willingly pay $700 for a CAT scan for their cat or more than $1,000 a year for chemotherapy for their dog, it may be hard not to get excited about the investment possibilities.

New Generation on Restaurant Suppliers Row

SERIES: SHOPTALK: An occasional look at commercial districts around New York

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
When Peter Chang, a 43-year-old native of Hong Kong, opened his store at 103-105 Bowery 12 years ago, there were just two other Asians in the restaurant supply business on the street. But when Mr. Chang walks along the Bowery today, he sees more than a dozen Asian restaurant suppliers.
He's not happy about it. The competition has caused Mr. Chang's profits to dwindle. "The profit is bad, very bad," said Mr. Chang, owner of Bowery Restaurant Supplies, a cluttered store between Grand and Hester Streets that offers everything from bamboo steamers to meat grinders. 
 The Bowery has long been home to the city's largest concentration of restaurant suppliers. Along a seven-block stretch from Hester to Houston Streets, there are roughly 30 businesses that keep most of the city's 22,000 restaurants stocked with 80-quart pots and six-burner ranges.
For years, the industry was overwhelmingly dominated by Jews and Italians, attracted in the early part of the century by low rents on a rundown street peopled by vagrants -- a source of cheap labor. "People would come by and ask to load and unload trucks or sweep up the floor," said Sheldon Lewis, 62, the owner of Empire Restaurant Supply, founded in 1923 by his father-in-law, Sam Mesirowsky.
But as Chinatown stretched north in the late 80's, ownership increasingly switched to Asians, many of them wealthy Hong Kong emigres fleeing the island before it reverts to Chinese control in 1997.
Not all the newcomers became suppliers. On Mr. Chang's block, where every storefront once housed a supplier, stand a Chinese restaurant, a nail salon, a greengrocer and a fish and meat market. Mr. Chang is the only supplier on his side of the block.
Mr. Chang estimates that 40 percent of suppliers in the area are Asian immigrants, 30 percent from Hong Kong and China and 10 percent from Korea. But Fred LaMay, 66, co-owner of King Glassware, at 112 Bowery, puts the number much higher. "I'd say 60 percent are Asian," he said, adding that there are 30 percent more restaurant suppliers than there were 10 or 15 years ago.
Wealthy Hong Kong natives have bought out many members of the old guard by offering astronomical prices for their buildings. Mr. LaMay said several people had come into his store, making enticing bids for his building. "We tell them we're not interested," he said. "We'll sell when we retire."
Mr. Lewis, who runs Empire at 114 Bowery with his sons, Craig, 39, and Jeffrey, 36, has also been offered large sums. "A guy across the street sold his building for 30 percent more than its market value," he said. The Lewises say that as 1997 nears, they expect prices to go even higher, and then they will entertain bids. Besides, they say, right now business is pretty good.
It wasn't always so. The 80's recession walloped many suppliers. "Every year since then, it's gotten a little better," said Mr. LaMay. But business is still not as good as it was in the early 80's when there were fewer suppliers doing more business.
Mr. Lewis said despite the many Asians in the business, he is able to attract Asian customers. And Mr. Chang estimated that 25 percent of his customers are non-Asian.
Language differences are sometimes a problem, but not impossible to bridge. A while back, a Chinese customer walked into Empire, and when Mr. Lewis asked him if he needed help, he tugged on his belt. "He wanted a belt for a mixer," Mr. Lewis said. "I finally figured it out. Sometimes they'll point to their eye, which means that they're just looking around." M.W.

Anarchist Picnic: Pig and Pot (Dress: Casual)

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
It was 4 P.M. on a cool, overcast day. A multiethnic, multiracial cluster of 25 New Yorkers sat on stone pilings in La Plaza Cultural, a lot on the corner of Ninth Street and Avenue C. Their clothes were tattered and grimy. Most were squatters or homeless; they looked anywhere from 20 to 50 years old. Their long hair was straight and greasy, or multicolored, spiked or in dandruff-flecked dreadlocks. Some sported nose, lip and eyebrow rings.
With a few unwashed pocket knives, they carved up half of a roast pig, eating it with dirt-encrusted hands. They guzzled Midnight Dragon beer (straight from 40-ounce bottles). They smoked a lot of marijuana (in joints bigger than the average cigarette). And they shared their feast (just the pig, not the beer and marijuana) with a Rottweiler, a German shepherd and two pit bulls. 
 So it went at the second annual May Day "pig roast," an anarchist celebration with the look and feel of a pagan ritual. The daylong picnic was organized by a local squatter who goes by the name Jerry the Peddler.
"May Day was originally an anarchist holiday," said Jerry, a graying, blue-eyed Ninth Street resident who writes for a local underground newspaper, The Shadow, under the byline J. T. Peddler. "The Communists stole it and turned it into a workers' holiday."
And the significance of the pig (purchased for $170 from the Happy Joy restaurant in Chinatown)? "The pig symbolizes dead cops," one celebrant, Jerry Levy, 41, said with a broad grin. An adjunct professor in the social science department of La Guardia Community College, Mr. Levy, who appeared to be more interested in personal hygiene than most of his company, groused about what he termed "the police occupation of the neighborhood," specifically the authorities' response to the Tompkins Square Park unrest in 1989 and their more recent crackdown on Avenue C peddlers, which has pushed the vendors into La Plaza on Sundays.
Despite Mr. Levy's polemics, the group was mild mannered enough -- that is, until a photographer for The New York Times attempted to capture the event on film. The picnickers chased him, and then another photographer, away, before allowing a few snaps.
"It's a privacy issue," said Stanley Sydorowitz, 44, an unemployed pit-bull trainer who wore an army fatigue jacket and black jeans hardened with dirt. "They just can't come in and start taking pictures. When you're poor, your privacy is all you have left."
But they said they had nothing personal against the paper: in fact, many said they were faithful readers.
"Did you see the piece in the Sunday Times magazine about marijuana?" someone asked, referring to a cover article, "How Pot Has Grown," which appeared on Feb. 19. "That was great."
Much of the talk centered on drugs. One man went on about the virtues of exotic rolling paper for several minutes, as marijuana smoke filled the air.
A block east, police thronged Tompkins Square Park, the site of another May Day celebration replete with punk rock bands and rappers. It was organized by squatters on 13th Street, who are fighting eviction from the city.
"We're not in opposition to that group," said Jerry the Peddler. "It's just that I have a bad ear and I needed an alternative."
Jerry admitted that this year's pig roast was poorly attended. Last May Day, 200 people flocked to the event.
"Last year, we advertised with fliers," Jerry said. Next year, he promised a bigger celebration. "We're going to have three pigs," he said. "One for Giuliani, one for Pataki and one for Clinton."

Ground Rules For the Great

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
NO less a social philosopher than Wilt Chamberlain, in the days when he literally stood head and shoulders above everyone else on the basketball court, put the matter succinctly: "No man roots for Goliath."
 In business, as in sports, giants often attract not only resentment and envy, but they also find themselves accused of competing unfairly. And those crying foul often call for change in the rules. The designated Goliath of the technological world is the Microsoft Corporation, a 20-year-old company cofounded by a Harvard dropout named Bill Gates, who has become the richest man in America, both feared and admired. 
 Ten days ago, the Justice Department took its latest step in trying to curb Microsoft's relentless advance in computer software by suing to block its $2 billion purchase of Intuit, whose Quicken financial software is in 7 million American homes. The Government challenge can be seen narrowly as a garden-variety antitrust case, which contends that the merger would reduce competition in the market for personal-finance software. But the real worry -- shared by Government antitrust officials, Microsoft's rivals and some economists -- is that Intuit could give Microsoft a sizable lead in the emerging markets for home banking and electronic commerce, which have the potential to make billions of dollars. Microsoft, they point out, has already used its dominance of personal-computer operating systems with Windows to establish leading positions in word processing and spread sheets.
 Later this year, the Microsoft juggernaut plans to move into the fast-growing market for on-line computer networks, all of which are frontiers of the information highway. The fear is that Microsoft could end up hogging the road, at the very least collecting tolls for access and supplying many of the services over it, like home banking and electronic publishing.

 
 
<SC0>Fish or Cut Bait
 The Microsoft case is an important test for the Government, and its effects could be felt for years. It will help set the ground rules for competition in the information age.
 The stakes are especially high because the industries involving information technology are an engine of growth for the American economy and a huge supplier of well-paid jobs for American workers. The Government must carefully tailor any actions it may take, because a clumsy but well-intentioned effort could squelch innovation. The outcome could also mean higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.
 Everyone agrees that the economic principles that apply to the old smokestack industries do not apply to high-tech industries. But the debate focuses on what the new terms of trade in these industries mean for Government antitrust policy: Do they argue for a hands-off approach, or an enforcement that is guided by an enlightened view of how these markets work?
 "In these new markets, we're seeing a new kind of competition," said William F. Baxter, a professor at the Stanford University law school, who was chief of the antitrust division at the Justice Department from 1981 to 1983. "It presents a new problem for Government, and we're going to see it again and again."
 Economists and antitrust experts traditionally viewed competition in terms of prices and output. The assumption was that as the number of companies making a product declined, output would be restricted, prices increased and consumers left worse off. "Perfect" competition is a market where producers are plentiful and none can influence prices.
 In the world of computer software and microchips, markets are often guided by different rules, which can result in a near-monopoly position for the winner. For example, a company gains an enormous advantage if it can grab an early leadership position: It can dictate the standard for the industry. Microsoft and the Intel Corporation did exactly that when I.B.M. entered the personal computer business in 1981. Big Blue engaged Microsoft to supply the operating system software, which gives a computer its basic running instructions, and Intel to supply the microchip, the processing "brain" of a PC.
 Though many companies besides I.B.M. now make PC's, the I.B.M.-compatible machine dominates nearly 90 percent of the market, with Apple's Macintosh accounting for most of the rest. No one has yet been able to unseat Microsoft and Intel as the standard bearers in the industry. Their profits let them invest in the creation of succeeding generations of software and chips.
 Microsoft's Windows is the market winner, and has become the lingua franca of personal computing for millions worldwide. Yet many experts argue that Apple's Macintosh operating system is easier to use, even superior to Microsoft's. Today, though, new software applications are designed primarily to run on Windows.
 "In high-tech markets where standards are important, the big get bigger," explained Charles F. Rule, a partner at Covington and Burling, a law firm in Washington, who was head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department from 1986 to 1989. "That's how these markets work, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with it."
 Economists call this a "bandwagon" effect. "And in the last five years," said W. Brian Arthur, a professor of economics at Stanford, "the bandwagon has really been rolling from Redmond, Washington," where the Gates empire is ensconced. Size and success should not be penalized, he says. Yet he and an economist at the Stanford business school, Garth Saloner, have helped supply the intellectual ammunition for Government intervention to restrain Microsoft.

 
 
A Trojan Horse
 Mr. Arthur argues that Microsoft has used its clout to gain great advantage in applications like word processing (Microsoft Word) and spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel). Bundled with Microsoft 95, due in August, is the company's on-line service, Microsoft Network, which will almost instantly be on millions of more computers than rivals like America Online, Compuserve and Prodigy. If Microsoft acquires Intuit, it would have a major head start in electronic banking, he says.
 The Government, Mr. Arthur contends, should intervene to make sure that a company's control of one market does not give it a major edge in new high-tech markets -- to prevent one runner in a 100-yard dash starting at the 40-yard mark. In his view, that could mean blocking the Intuit merger to preserve competition in home banking and in on-line services making Microsoft Network have an arms-length relationship with Microsoft's Windows.
 The opponents of such intervention in the brave new frontiers of high-tech markets say the case for Washington stepping in is unproven, and criticize its surgical tools as blunt and risky. "We may not always like the results of market forces," said Mr. Rule, the Washington lawyer and former antitrust chief, "but I think the real danger here is having the Government try to direct and fine-tune the innovative process."

 
 
A Swift State of the Art
 Besides, says Jerry Hausman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is no evidence that Microsoft's dominant role in computer software or its purchase of Intuit would harm consumers. "If you restrain Microsoft, it is clear that it would help its competitors," Mr. Hausman said. "But even if Microsoft has a natural advantage in new markets, that is only bad if it uses its power to jack up prices. And that's a lot easier to do in old, static markets than in high-technology industries, which change quickly."
 The speed-of-change argument seems a powerful reason for the Government to be circumspect in pursuing antitrust cases in high-tech fields. And after a wide-ranging four-year investigation of Microsoft, the Justice Department last summer decided against trying to break up the software company or order sweeping changes in its business practices. Instead, Microsoft agreed only to alter the way it licenses its operating system to PC makers. The settlement was regarded as little more than a wrist slap for Microsoft, and it is now being challenged in Federal court.
 The classic cautionary example was the Government's 13-year case against I.B.M., which was abandoned in 1982. It was new technology -- small-scale computing using microchips -- that broke I.B.M.'s stranglehold on the industry instead of any actions taken in Washington.
 Mr. Baxter, the Stanford law professor, was the antitrust chief at the Justice Department who tossed out the I.B.M. case. Still, he believes there is an appropriate role for enforcement. He noted that merger cases require Government officials to make guesses about the likely effect on competition in the future.
 "No one would argue that we need more government in these industries," he said. "But there is a danger when a company's dominance is so prolonged that its power and entrenched position retard innovation. Just when those conditions are present, however, is not an easy call to make."

Feeling Down? How About a New Pollster?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Bill Clinton's Presidential crusade plunged into scandal in the 1992 primaries, his pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, told him the campaign was in "meltdown" and helped devise a plan to cool it off. When Mr. Clinton faced George Bush in the general election, Mr. Greenberg explained to the candidate what was on America's mind. When Mr. Clinton scored gutsy legislative victories with his first budget and Nafta, Mr. Greenberg, by now the official White House pollster and political tactician, pshawed modestly. "I'm dealing with a President who has an intuitive sense of what's going on in the country," he told a conclave of political sages.
 So when Mr. Clinton's intuition, legislative agenda and political support headed south last year, the President did what seemed logical. Now he has four pollsters, including one, Dick Morris, who worked on his political comeback in Arkansas more than a decade ago. 
 Such is the allure -- the digital, high-level-of-confidence attraction -- of poll-takers to politicians. The public may regard pollsters as puppetmasters, dictating policy by telling Presidents and congressmen what will and won't win votes. But the analogy is inaccurate. Modern politics is a sort of gray magic, and pollsters are its sorcerers: cloaked Merlins at the sides of kings, with powers to foretell the future, smite enemies and recapture lost loves.
 Naturally, this is humbug. As pollsters themselves will tell you, they have no such powers. Yet the myth persists, for if politicians did not believe pollsters could tell the future, smite enemies and court friends, it is doubtful that they would hire one, much less four.
 And they are hiring a lot. Mr. Clinton may well be the most voracious consumer of survey data in Presidential history, but he is only a symbol of the times. Modern public officials and advocates pop polls like candy -- and, as Mr. Greenberg's case suggests, try new ones to catch the flavor of the moment.
 "They generally have the reputation of Svengalis," said William Schneider, the Washington political analyst, "because pollsters never just sell the numbers. They sell an insight into the minds of the American people. The pollster is supposed to have some mystic communion with the American electorate."
 "You got numbers, nobody else does," said one Democratic surveyor who demanded anonymity. "I go in to see the candidate, and this hack who's been in more campaigns than I'll ever see goes in. His argument's right; my argument's wrong. But I've got the numbers, and I'll win every time."
 Not that polling is sleight-of-hand. It has advanced leagues since Louis Harris gave John F. Kennedy survey results in his bathtub, and even since President Nixon read the polls and decided to ban oil drilling off the California coast. Computers and sophisticated sampling methods have made polls vastly more accurate. Pollsters have edged away (they say) from influencing policy and styled themselves as analysts.

 
 
Big-Name Surveyor
 But the mystique has only grown. In the health-care debate, for example, both political parties and virtually every lobbying group with a major stake has had big-name surveyors on retainer. Among Republicans and their ilk, the young pollster Frank Luntz -- adviser to Ross Perot and Newt Gingrich during their ascents -- now boasts a sort of rock-star cachet.
 Senator Phil Gramm of Texas employs the Republican pollster Linda Divall to crunch numbers for his Presidential campaign, but recently added Mr. Luntz to the payroll. That led Ms. Divall to note pointedly that she remained lead survey dog, a true enough assertion. "You don't hire someone like Luntz for his numbers," one Republican said. "You hire him for his advice."
 Among Democrats, Mr. Greenberg's dispassionate liberalism seemed perfectly suited in 1992 for Mr. Clinton's disciplined, economy-oriented campaign. But when key intiatives like health-care foundered and Democratic popularity began sagging last summer, the President broadened his polling circle to include Geoffrey Garin, an unpaid adviser. When the political roof fell in last winter, the White House added Penn+Schoen Associates, a New York firm.
 The latest addition, Mr. Morris, could be seen as a retreat to a battle-tested ally; Mr. Clinton recaptured the statehouse with his help. Or it might be viewed as a bow to the right. Mr. Morris's more recent clients have included Senator Trent Lott, the deeply conservative Mississippian, and former Senator Paula Hawkins of Florida.

 
 
Where Next?
 Some of this may be the casting about of a politician in difficulty. But much of it may simply reflect the fact that pollsters' worth increasingly lies in telling officeholders where public opinion is headed next. Any pollster with a Packard-Bell can generate an ocean of numbers; the trick is to find the one who can spot in them the next big wave.
 To be sure, political polls still ask about officeholders' popularity and ratings of national or local concerns, a sort of boilerplate whose results often speak for themselves. But their sorcery lies elsewhere, in questions that politicians and lobbying groups use to road-test their spiels, evaluate hypotheticals and otherwise probe for their strong points and opponents' frailties.
 "Seven or eight years ago, polling evolved into a system where you try to predict arguments," said David Doak, a Democratic political consultant. "You use polls as laboratories to pre-test messages, to see what works and what doesn't, for media guys like me to hone down later on."
 The public sees only the fruits of that research. In the last week, Republican leaders abruptly began to argue that Medicare must be reined in, not to balance the budget but because the program is careening toward bankruptcy and must be "saved." To no one's surprise, a nonprofit arm of the Republican National Committee, the National Policy Forum, has lately tested just that proposition in polls and focus groups.
 Mr. Greenberg used similar road-tests to help the White House construct its Nafta campaign in 1993, including the critical -- and ultimately inspired -- decision to take on the treaty's chief opponent, Mr. Perot.
 Other decisions are not so inspired. Last fall, the White House flooded news outlets with results of polls showing that buzzwords like "trickle-down Reaganomics," turned many voters against Republican campaign pledges. Mr. Clinton dutifully recited the words in speeches, and Democratic commercials parroted them on the air.
 Some experts say the blitz backfired, helping to turn the election from a series of local contests where Democrats stood a fighting chance into a national contest between an unpopular President and resurgent Republicans.

 
 
Perpetual Campaign
 In the American Enterprise Institute session where Mr. Greenberg spoke in 1993, Mr. Caddell told him that the White House he described sounded more like a perpetual campaign than a Presidency.
 Mr. Greenberg scoffed, but his reply was revealing. He said that these days, being President "is not simply a question of developing a policy proposal, presenting it to Congress and leaving Congress to do its work." Rather, he said, few politicians succeed without "a focused and sustained initiative to bring people forward."

HEADLINE: The World;
Vietnam Speaks English With an Eager Accent

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

 BODY:
QUOC KHOI carries the history of Vietnam on the tip of his tongue. As foreign powers have come and gone, Mr. Khoi, who is now in his 50's, has learned French, then Japanese, then English, then Russian. Vietnam is on its own now, and Mr. Khoi is again riding the linguistic wave of history: He is making his living teaching English.
 "Now I forget my Russian and my Japanese," he said recently, speaking his English words carefully to avoid mistakes. "Even French I almost forget. But English everybody in Vietnam must know because English is the language of commerce." 
 In the dimly lit classroom of Mr. Khoi's private language school in the center of Ho Chi Minh City, once called Saigon, students ranging in age from 12 to 50 gathered for an evening class, like many thousands of others across the nation. Asked why they were here, their answers were a jumble of eager but barely intelligible English. But the words "international language" came through clearly.
 Twenty years after the end of the war and the disappearance of Americans from Vietnam, this Communist country is in the throes of an English-language boom that has little to do with the past and everything to do with the nation's rush to join the international marketplace. The war seems all but forgotten as ordinary Vietnamese welcome American visitors not as former soldiers but as future investors.
 The titles of the English-language tapes for sale in the Xuan Thu bookstore tell the story: "International Business English," "English for Business," "We're in Business," "Good for Business." And for those who wish to refine their accents, there is "Sheep or Ship."
 The study of English seems to carry little cultural or historical baggage for the Vietnamese. There is neither resentment against American culture nor a deep fascination with it. Mary Kay Crouch, a professor of English at California State University at Fullerton who has helped set up English courses in Vietnam, said, "One of our proposals was to do some teaching of American culture, and I can tell you, people were not interested. They want to know how much money do I make and do I have a car and how do I live, and that's about it."

 
 
The Common Tongue
 Most American businessmen arrived in Vietnam only after the lifting of Washington's trade embargo a little more than a year ago, but their language preceded them. English was already established as the common tongue among the Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Southeast Asians and Europeans who dominate the foreign presence and the market. Now that more Americans are arriving and the Government is encouraging foreign trade, the language is more prized than ever.
 "English has become the universal language in Vietnam, just as the dollar is the currency of choice," said Jeffrey Brody, a journalism professor at Fullerton who has spent time in Vietnam.
 The Vietnamese, in their eagerness to learn English, often approach foreigners to practice it. They listen to lessons on radio and television, both of which are state-controlled, and to tapes in their cars. In the evenings, farmers keep their families' suppers warm while their children attend English classes.
 Colleges are busy turning out English speakers as fast as they can. The Teachers Training College of Ho Chi Minh City offers night classes to 30,000 students, said Diane Fox, an English teacher at Portland State University who has also taught English in Vietnam. She said some of her former students in Vietnam -- and not even the best of them -- have quickly become wealthy teaching English.
In the midst of this bustle, there are few lonelier places in Ho Chi Minh City than the local Russian Cultural Center. At midday, the secretary, Nguyen Thi Nhi, sits alone in her office, and when a rare visitor knocks, she must telephone the director, Victor Stepanov, at his home. He is the only remaining member of a staff of 12 Russians that once included science and technology specialists, several language teachers and a specialist in propaganda. "We call it the lowering of interest in the Russian language," Mr. Stepanov said. "Now, no question about it, there is an overwhelming rush to speak English. It seems everybody speaks English now, if only a few phrases."

 
 
The Dead Language
 Not long ago, everybody was learning Russian. For the 15 years that Moscow was Hanoi's chief patron, more than 100,000 Vietnamese workers and 3,000 students were in the Soviet Union at any one time. Then the Soviet Union collapsed, Vietnam turned outward and Washington lifted its trade embargo. Russian quickly became a dead language for most Vietnamese, and a generation of Russian-language teachers had no one left to teach.
 Meanwhile, many qualified English teachers went into business with high-paying foreign companies. So the Russian teachers retrained, by the hundreds, to teach English. "My cousin was a Russian teacher," said T. T. Nhu, a Vietnamese-American who is a columnist for The San Jose Mercury News. "Now they are all madly trying to learn English."
 As a result, in a country where an older generation still speaks English with a French accent, a new generation of English speakers with a Russian accent is emerging. In search of what they hope will be a more authentic accent, Ms. Nhu said, some students are now traveling to Australia.
 In a land where youngsters once learned to shout "Hey, G.I.!" before they learned to read and write, children are again learning how to greet foreigners, even in places where they are rarely seen.
 One recent sunny morning in the mountain city of Da Lat, a 10-year-old girl holding a small boy on her hip stared curiously at an American as he sipped tea at an outdoor table.
 "Do you want to study English in school?" the American asked her, speaking in Vietnamese.
 "No," the girl said, walking away. "I don't want to study at all."
 But then she stopped and looked back. "Thank you!" she said in English. "See you again!"
 And the small boy on her hip waved and said, "See you again!"

HEADLINE: Many Cubans Don't Share Havana's Pride in Pact With U.S.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 6

 BODY:
For days now, the sea has been calm and the sky clear along the waterfront and beaches that stretch for miles here. It is just the sort of weather that for more than 30 years has beckoned Cubans to board rafts and try to make their way across the Straits of Florida to seek political asylum.
But with the door to the United States now suddenly closed to migrants as a result of the immigration agreement that the United States and Cuban Governments announced on Tuesday, only fishermen, strolling couples and the unemployed are congregating at Havana's seaside promenades. 
 "Nobody is going to be going anywhere now," said one of those staring out at the sea, a young man with no job who gave his name as Gerardo Aviles and his age as 20. "There is no point in even trying to leave if you know the American Coast Guard is only going to hand you back over."
The Cuban Government has repeatedly stressed that point on television and in newspaper reports about the agreement. It has also described the accord as a major turnabout in United States policy and a triumph of Cuban diplomacy that obliges Washington to stop treating departing Cubans as refugees fleeing political oppression.
Last summer, when more than 30,000 people took to the seas, President Fidel Castro argued that the flow of people was no different than that from Mexico or many other third world countries: people leaving economic difficulties in search of a better life in a more prosperous place. This week's agreement, Cuban officials said, shows that the Clinton Administration now agrees.
"This agreement places migratory relations with Cuba at exactly the same level as migratory relations with other Latin American countries and other places," Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and the chief representative in the talks with the United States, said shortly after the accord was made public. "In sum, this involves applying the same rules and procedures applicable to immigrants from other nations."
In an interview here, Cuba's Deputy Minister of Foreign Relations, Fernando Remirez, described United States policy toward Cuba as having shifted "180 degrees, undergoing a radical change" as a result of the immigration agreement. He said the accord could pave the way for direct bilateral talks on other issues, suggesting that some sort of cooperation in the war against drug trafficking, whether formalized or not, was a particularly promising area.
Mr. Alarcon and other officials have predicted that Mr. Clinton will soon lift the sanctions on travel and remittances that were imposed last August at the height of the refugee crisis. As Mr. Remirez put it, Cuban-Americans have already found ways to get around the restrictions, which have therefore lost their usefulness.
"These measures are going to be lifted at any moment," Mr. Alarcon said. "The situation of conflict that led to the implementation of these measures is increasingly distant."
Reaction to the accord on Cuban dissidents has been mixed. Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz, director of the Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, described the measure as "on balance positive" because it will discourage "people desperate to leave" from risking their lives at sea, but he also expressed doubt about the Cuba's willingness to abide by the it.
"I am worried that there is no independent system to supervise the implementation of this agreement, and would like to see representatives of the United Nations or the International Red Cross involved," he said.
Mr. Remirez, however, said Cuba had a history of "rigorously abiding by all international agreements it has signed" with Washington and others. He pointed to the agreement that led to the end of the conflict in Angola and Namibia.
Another dissident leader, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the accord would prove to be a valuable recruiting tool, a notion that has also been advanced by some diplomats here. The new situation is likely to encourage disgruntled Cubans to "channel their efforts into a greater willingness to work in Cuba, rather than just getting out of the island," said one.
But other diplomats said the agreement created a situation more complicated than either the United States or Cuba was willing to admit. "Yes, both sides have rid themselves of an unwanted and unwelcome problem," said one. "But there are also risks, especially for Cuba."
Cuba has said it will soon begin laying off hundreds of thousands of workers because of the economic crisis that began with the collapse of the Soviet bloc. With shortages of electricity, food and fuel looming again, there is concern that without the "safety valve" of immigration to the United States, outbreaks of discontent such as those that sparked last summer's crisis could recur.
"I hope that all of this encourages the Cuban Government to accelerate the pace of economic reforms," one European diplomat said. "They seem to think that the worst of the economic crisis is over, but they could be wrong, and if they are, the prospects for this country are too grim to contemplate."

13 Refugees Returned
 MIAMI, May 6 (AP) -- The Coast Guard ferried 13 refugees back toward Cuba today as angry exiles planned civil disobedience to protest President Clinton's reversal of 35 years of refugee policy.
A Coast Guard cutter transferred the refugees from a Caribbean cruise ship just before midnight on Friday, but the Guard disclosed few details about they were being taken.
"We really, truly don't know," said Lieut. Comdr. Pat Philbin, chief of Coast Guard media in Washington. "We don't know which port we're going to. The details are being worked out as we speak."
The refugees would be the first to be repatriated under the policy that has angered Cuba's exile community, whose leaders met today to map a response that some said could include civil disobedience.
The Coast Guard picked up the 13 men from the Majesty of the Seas cruise ship, whose crew found them adrift in two boats south of Little Cayman Island late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: VIOLENCE;
Anger of the 60's Takes Root in the Violent Right

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
On the surface, few eras would seem to have less in common than the tie-dyed turmoil of the 1960's and the edgy, armed-to-the-teeth anger of the 1990's.
But many historians who track the nation's mood swings say they detect an odd and striking inversion in which the anger, discontent and distrust of authority that erupted on the left in the 60's have become the signatures of the right 30 years later. 
 The notion is not that the rumblings of the old left have been transformed into today's right-wing agenda or that the sporadic and largely inept violence of the 60's is mirrored in the horror of Oklahoma City. Instead, there is a sense that Vietnam War-era turmoil tore a hole in the post-World War II social fabric, and that although it was the left that opened the rift, it is the right that has driven a truck through it.
Indeed, many experts say that to understand today's right-wing anger it is necessary first to make sense of the tumult three decades ago.
"What happened in the 1960's was that the Government was successfully 'delegitimated,' " said Gerald Marwell, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin who studies American political movements. "We had a period from World War II through the 1950's where the Government was seen as having rescued the nation from the Depression and successfully prosecuted the war, and then we were told in the 1960's that the emperor has no clothes and people shouldn't accept what they're told."
Historians acknowledge the limitations of comparing different eras. Many say any understanding of the passions and paranoias of the 90's must begin with the recognition that the nation's history is rife with bitter rifts and conspiratorial vapors.Indeed many historians find the relative, though hardly universal, degree of national consensus that marked the 1940's and 1950's to be the exception in American life rather than the norm.
"This is the most anti-state country in the Western world, probably on earth," said Michael Kazin, a historian at the American University in Washington and the author of "The Populist Persuasion: An American History" (Basic Books, 1994). "Throughout American history groups on the right and the left have seen the Federal Government as an alien force inimical to their interests, so you see this sort of thing over and over again."
What happened in the 60's, he wrote, is that the left "only discredited the old order without laying the political foundation for a new one."
Many scholars of American history have long acknowledged what the historian Richard Hofstadter called "the paranoid style in American politics," a tendency to view the world in terms of dense conspiracies that in various eras have centered on groups as diverse as Masons, Catholics, Jews, international bankers, Mormons, foreign gold traders, and the Bavarian Illuminati.
To cite a more recent example, Senator Joseph McCarthy, during his campaign against Communist infiltration in 1951, described "a great conspiracy, a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man," to undermine the United States Government from within.
The Soviet threat is gone, but conspiracy theories spring up with numbing frequency, exemplified most recently by the claim that the attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City was a Government plot to discredit the paramilitary groups that call themselves militias.
Even the details of the supposed conspiracies faxed and E-mailed among right-wing groups from Montana to Michigan are eerily similar to those alleged by the John Birch Society and other right-wing groups of the late 50's and early 60's.
Today there are claims that United Nations troops have taken over Yellowstone National Park and that sinister military vehicles identified with an inverted V are prowling rural Michigan. Three decades ago allegations included reports that 35,000 Chinese Communist troops were poised on the Mexico border ready to invade California, that the Army had been turned over to a Russian colonel in the United Nations and that an Army guerrilla warfare exercise in Georgia called Water Moccasin III was actually a United Nations operation prepared to take over the United States.
Still, the suspicions of today are hardly limited to the right.
Not far from Professor Marwell's office, Karlton Armstrong runs an outdoor juice stand on the University of Wisconsin Library Mall. Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Armstrong, then an antiwar activist, was one of the campus radicals who planted a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb at Sterling Hall, home of the university's Physics Department and of the oil bomb's target, the Army Math Research Center. The explosion killed a graduate student, in one of the most infamous episodes of the era.
Mr. Armstrong, who served 7 years of his 14-year sentence for murder and arson in the bombing, is now 48 and has no sympathy for today's far-right fringe groups. He now views the Sterling Hall bombing as a betrayal of his own beliefs, even though the bomb was detonated with the intention that the building would be unoccupied.
But when asked about the sense of frustration and alienation abroad in the land, he said: "These people are rapidly becoming dispossessed, like they are losing what little power they had. I totally empathize with that sense of alienation."
And just as it was alienated hippies who preceded ring-wing groups in retreating to the woods to create communes free from the corrupting influences of the Government and urban life, the sensibilities of the 60's have left many with the same kind of distrust of Government now so endemic on the right.
"I don't consider myself a paranoid by any means, but I've been given plenty of reasons to fear my Government," said Susan Spangenberg of Madison, who is active in the Wisconsin Alliance for the Medicalization of Cannabis, which seeks to make marijuana more readily available for medical uses. "The militias have the same civil rights as I do, as we all do, and if the Government can intrude on civil rights on the right, it could just as easily do it for someone who gets labeled a left-wing liberal."
To many on the left, there is something utterly perverse in any effort to link their philosophy with the armed extremist right of the 1990's. Many say the incessant anti-Government rhetoric of the right says more about the present than the turmoil of the 60's.
"Don't insult me," said Paul Soglin, the former anti-war activist who is now Mayor of Madison. "That's the thinking of very stupid people who need an elementary education in civics and political science."
He and others said the left of the 1960's was rooted in nonviolence and sought to prod the Government toward what it saw as appropriate action in ending the war in Vietnam and enforcing civil rights laws, while the extremist right is steeped in weapons and violence and opposed to almost all Government activism. Those on the right say a more telling difference is that the 1960's were also steeped in a contempt for traditional values.
But many experts see important points of convergence. Professor Marwell of Wisconsin and Professor Kazin of the American University see a libertarian strain from the 1960's that, intentionally or not, became more of a legacy than leftist politics. To the 60's left it might have meant the right to smoke pot, while to the 90's right it might mean the right to own guns, but the instinct is similar.
"My favorite button from the anti-draft S.D.S. was, 'Not With My Life You Don't,' " Mr. Kazin, a former anti-war activist himself, said, referring to the radical group Students for a Democratic Society. "It could be the slogan of the right wing today, a don't-tread-on-me, get-off-my-back kind of statement."
Others say that rather than the politics of the student movement of the 1960's and early 70's, it was the various upheavals and shocks of the era -- from the Kennedy assassination to the Vietnam War to Watergate to unresolved issues of racial and sexual equality -- that produced fault lines in American life that have never been bridged.
"There's a culture war, particularly the part of it that has to do with gender, that's still playing out today, whether it's overtly talked about or not," said Emily Rosenberg, a history professor at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn.
Professors Kazin and Rosenberg both said a more compelling historical parallel than the 1960's may be the 1890's, when structural changes in the economy, anger at immigrants and the widespread sense that communities and individuals were losing economic control produced an angry populist movement and widespread social turmoil. Ms. Rosenberg noted that the last decade of a century has almost invariably produced a sense of momentous change, whether manifested as dread or as anticipation. She said she suspected the discord of the 90's could have further to run.
But the ripples of the 1890's are merely historical. The reverberations of the 1960's are still very real. Professor Marwell said one to watch would be whether the violence of Oklahoma City would discredit the right in the 1990's in the way that the Sterling Hall bombing short-circuited the left in the 1960's. He said he thought it would.
"The bombing here in Madison almost ended the anti-war movement all by itself," he said. "The whole right may not be at fault for Oklahoma City, but I think they're underestimating the price they're going to pay."

HEADLINE: CLINTON ADVISERS CALL FOR TARIFFS ON JAPAN IMPORTS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
President Clinton's top economic advisers recommended yesterday that he impose record-breaking sanctions against Japanese imports, chiefly automobile parts, in retaliation for Tokyo's refusal to open the Japanese automotive market to America.
The recommendation came at a two-hour meeting of the National Economic Council in Washington, after last-minute negotiations broke down Friday night between the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, and Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto. 
 The centerpiece of the retaliation is expected to be tariffs ranging up to 100 percent on billions of dollars in Japanese automobile-related imports. Japanese automotive goods accounted for more than 55 percent of America's $66 billion trade deficit with Japan last year.
American officials would not specify the total value of the products subject to sanctions, but it has been reported that the initial range could be from $5 billion to $10 billion. But that figure is expected to decline during a review process.
In Tokyo, Japanese Government officials and car manufacturers said the United States was to blame for the impasse and called on the Administration to back down from its sanctions threats. [Page 10.]
Mr. Kantor would not describe the specific recommendations made, but said that a range of actions was "unanimously agreed to after a thorough review, but very little debate." Administration officials said they expected Mr. Clinton to approve the sanctions before he leaves for Moscow on Monday.
But the formal announcement may be delayed for days, while officials refine the list of Japanese goods affected. They may also consider imposing broader, nontariff sanctions against Japanese industry like prohibiting the opening of new Japanese automobile dealerships in the United States or restricting Japanese investment.
In Auburn Hills, Mich., the Chrysler Corporation issued a statement in which its chairman, Robert J. Eaton, praised the Administration's efforts to open Japan's market and pledged support for any further action Washington takes.
"The key to opening Japan's closed market has always been in Japan's hands," Mr. Eaton said.
Under American trade law, the tariffs cannot go into effect for 30 days, giving American firms a chance to review the list and seek the removal of items that cannot be obtained from non-Japanese suppliers.
But the sanctions are unlikely to go into effect anyway until late June. The delay is intended to increase the pressure on Japan to resolve the dispute when President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama meet at the annual summit talks of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries on June 15 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Trade disputes are often settled on the brink, and American officials hope a deal can be struck in Halifax, if not before. But they insisted that they are not bluffing. The recent trade dispute with China was settled just before sanctions were imposed.
"The President is very determined in this matter," Mr. Kantor said yesterday. "This has gone on for too long, and the President will act decisively."
If effected, the tariffs would raise costs for Japanese auto manufacturers, though it is unclear whether they would pass those costs on to consumers -- a move that would inevitably hurt their business. That would be welcomed by the American industry, which is increasingly concerned that the overall automobile market is falling off dramatically, a cyclical event that generally focuses attention on Japanese competition.
The tariffs could also harm America's Big Three automakers, however, because some major components are only manufactured in Japan. That is why Commerce Department officials have been working for weeks on a proposed tariff list that would primarily cover products for which a substitute American product is available.
Administration officials have insisted that the dispute with Japan can be contained and that it will not spill over into Japan's political relationship with the United States. But there is growing doubt about that point among younger Japanese leaders, who say that the increasingly angry confrontations, combined with the ravaging effects of the high yen on Japanese competitiveness, are eating away at the underpinnings of the relationship.
For the Administration, the confrontation with Japan is also an implicit acknowledgment that one of its major foreign policy goals -- to break the cycle of pressure, threats and counterthreats that have marred Japan's relations with the U.S. -- has so far failed.
Only two years ago, President Clinton signed a broad "framework accord" with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that was supposed to lay out a schedule and method for resolving trade disputes. At the time Mr. Clinton talked of a new era of cooperation between the world's two largest economies.
Since then, however, Japan has changed prime ministers three times, its effort to overhaul its political system and deregulate its economy has largely stalled, and officials on both sides of the Pacific acknowledge that trade relations between the countries have plunged back into their old patterns.
"It is enormously frustrating," one of Mr. Clinton's closest economic advisers said late last month. "What we thought was a new beginning turned out to be more of the same, a bureaucratic blockade."
Some trade and political specialists argue that the Administration also bears some of the blame, chiefly for its failure to convince the Japanese public that more deregulation is in its interest. The Administration is also blamed for its inability to convince American industry to invest more heavily in the Japanese market, rather than bypassing it to move into China and Southeast Asia.
"It was not inevitable that we would find ourselves in this situation," said Mike Mochizuki, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Because of the way we pursed out policies, we forced the Japanese into a defensive position," he said. "And after all these talks, it is remarkable how little communication there really is between the two governments."
Sanctions are nothing new in the rocky economic relationship between the two countries; the Reagan Administration imposed tariffs on Japanese electronics products in the 1980's to force an opening of its semiconductor market. But the sanctions were relatively small, and partly hurt American manufacturers who depended on Japanese suppliers.
Mr. Hashimoto, one of Japan's most experienced politicians and a man viewed as a candidate for prime minister in the near future, charged again on Friday that the United States was insisting on managed trade with Japan by pressing Japanese automakers to agree to "voluntary" plans to purchase a vastly increased amount of American-made auto parts.
"It is regrettable," Mr. Hashimoto said. "The U.S. insistence on voluntary plans has remained as an insurmountable stumbling block to a negotiated agreement."
He has threatened to take the United States to the newest court of international trade, the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Mr. Kantor says he would welcome such a challenge, because "it would give us an opportunity to make clear to the world the full range of Japan's discriminatory practices" in the auto market.
As in any trade argument with Japan, there are numbers to support the contention that the market is essentially closed, and numbers to support Japanese arguments that things are changing.
American officials say that by their measurements, Japan imports only 2.4 percent of its auto parts, while the United States imports 32.5 percent and the United Kingdom imports 60 percent. Exports of automobiles and parts from the United States to Japan totaled $3.5 billion last year -- a 54 percent jump -- but the flow from Japan to American shores was more than 10 times higher, $40.3 billion.

Chart: "Issues in Dispute"
 The three main points of contention in United States-Japanese auto trade.
 
ACCESS TO DEALERSHIPS
 Washington argues that American companies have been systematically prevented from access to "high quality" car dealers in Japan, those who already own showrooms for Toyota, Nissan and Honda. The Japanese say that Americans have failed to invest in dealerships.
 
REPLACEMENT PARTS
 The Japanese government regulates car repairs heavily, requiring "inspections" every two years or so that include the replacement of parts worth thousands of dollars. The repairs are done by shops closely tied to Japanese auto makers, and the result is that competitive, less expensive American parts are seldom used.

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT
 American companies say that if Japanese makers can use American parts in cars they in the United States, they can use the same parts in Japan. But in Japan, parts are usually made by companies with deep ties to to the auto makers. (pg. 10)

HEADLINE: Japan Cites U.S. Demands In Collapse of Auto Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 6

 BODY:
Japan's Government and car manufacturers closed ranks today, placing the blame for a breakdown of automobile trade talks with the United States squarely on what they called Washington's unreasonable demands for Japan to set numerical targets for purchases of American auto parts.
The show of solidarity indicated that Japan, for the moment at least, will not budge, even as the Clinton Administration moves to impose sanctions on billions of dollars of Japanese products exported to the United States. 
 "The Japanese Government did all it could to settle the issue in line with international rules," Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who was traveling in China, was quoted as saying by the Kyodo News Service.
Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of the Nissan Motor Company, said, "It is truly regrettable that the auto trade talks have broken down due to continued insistence by the United States that the voluntary purchase plans be increased and revised." In a statement, he called on the Clinton Administration to "react sensibly" and not impose sanctions.
Japanese officials today reiterated their intention to fight American moves toward sanctions by taking the dispute to the World Trade Organization, the successor to the world group that administered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Japan could still make concessions before any sanctions take effect, perhaps in late June. But the fact that Tokyo has not caved in so far to American demands is remarkable, and somewhat puzzling to American negotiators. In the past, such as in last year's negotiations on Japanese Government construction projects and cellular phones, the threat of sanctions prodded Tokyo to reach agreements.
Last February, when talks on autos and other issues also broke down, bureaucrats and businessmen here were elated at first that Japan had actually said "no" to the United States' demand for numerical targets.
But within days the yen started to climb against the dollar and panicky business leaders began calling for Japan to resolve the trade issues. Less than two months later, Japan's five leading auto makers issued new voluntary plans to increase their purchases of foreign parts. The United States, however, did not think those plans went far enough.
Japanese officials said today that they wanted to draw a line in the sand against numerical targets, so that they are not requested in future trade negotiations. "It's a vicious cycle," said one Japanese trade official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
This official said governments should not meddle in the purchasing decisions of private companies. Even if the purchase goals are supposedly voluntary, he said, Washington has demonstrated in the past that it will threaten retaliation if the targets are not met.
But ideological support for free trade cannot be the only reason for Japan's opposition. For one thing, Japanese auto makers could have issued the plans on their own, freeing the Japanese Government from being involved in private-sector matters. Indeed, the companies indicated a willingness last year to issue such plans. The question is whether as businessmen it would have been better for them to revise last year's plans upward rather than risk huge tariffs imposed on the Acuras and Lexuses sold in the United States.
Auto executives say their bleak and unpredictable business outlook leaves them little room to make any commitments, especially of the size required to satisfy Washington. "The business environment surrounding us has been very fragile," Toshiaki Taguchi, a director of Toyota Motor Corporation, said in an interview today.
Japan's car exports and production have been shrinking for years, and are likely drop further because of the yen's recent surge. Japanese companies are struggling to cut expenditures on parts by up to 30 percent in the next two or three years. That makes it very hard to increase parts purchases from new foreign suppliers, especially as domestic parts companies are suffering.
The auto makers were also involved in stringent cost-cutting efforts last year, but still came out with voluntary plans. And the strong yen, which makes imports cheaper, is a good reason for increasing purchases of foreign parts.
Another factor behind Japan's resistance appears to be a belief that the United States will not go through with sanctions. "We're counting on the sound judgment of American Government executives," Mr. Taguchi of Toyota said.
Japanese trade officials say they know there is ideological opposition in the United States to such tactics. Moreover, any American consumers or companies hurt by higher-priced imports will raise a fuss.
If sanctions are imposed, they may end up being relatively light in comparison with Japan's total trade with the United States. In Washington today, the National Economic Council recommended the imposition of tariffs ranging up to 100 percent on billions of dollars Japanese automobile-related imports. Japan's exports of automobiles and parts to the United States totaled $36 billion in 1993.
Japan also hopes to have the sanctions removed in as little as half a year by the new World Trade Organization, which came into existence in January. Under the older GATT rules, resolution of a trade dispute could take two or three years, a Japanese official said.
Japanese officials said referring the matter to a referee like the World Trade Organization might ease tensions, not escalate them. "We'd like to de-politicize the matter and have the talks move out of Washington and Tokyo to Geneva," one Japanese bureaucrat said.
Japanese officials say they think Japan has a good chance at the World Trade Organization against any unilateral sanctions applied by the United States. A highly favorable ruling for Japan might also make it harder in general for Washington to apply Section 301 of American trade law, which empowers the United States Government to take retaliatory measures against nations it deems unfair traders.
But Takeshi Kondo, general manager of the office of political and economic research at Itochu, a large Japanese trading company, said it was possible for Washington to fashion sanctions that are consistent with World Trade Organization rules. Also, he said, if Japan wins its case, there might be a rebellion against the World Trade Organization in Congress that would fatally weaken the new international trading body.
Some analysts here, as well as some Clinton Administration officials, think the Japanese auto companies would be willing to increase voluntary plans but are being held back by Japan's Government. One reason could be that Mr. Hashimoto, a likely future candidate for Prime Minister, wants to look strong in negotiations.
But once the sanctions are actually proposed or the yen starts to rise, Japanese auto makers will be able to argue to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and their domestic parts suppliers that such plans are unavoidable. Already, there are some mumblings from Japanese auto executives about "management plans" to cope with the rise of the yen, in part by buying more foreign parts.
"It's safer for them to wait until the last moment," Mr. Kondo of Itochu said about the Japanese auto companies. "And they consider that the last moment hasn't come yet."

HEADLINE: Christopher To Cut Jobs At State Dept.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans to eliminate about 500 State Department jobs as part of a streamlining effort intended in part to head off a more sweeping overhaul proposed by Republicans.
Mr. Christopher's aides say his plan aims to save tens of millions of dollars a year, to make his department more flexible in responding to crises and to derail Republican efforts to revamp the Government's foreign policy agencies. 
 Democrats in Congress have been pressing Mr. Christopher for weeks to present a plan, which will be announced Monday, to give them an alternative to Republican reorganization efforts.
But Republican lawmakers insist that what they have heard so far about Mr. Christopher's new plan is far too modest to dissuade them from their efforts, which call for the most sweeping overhaul of the foreign policy apparatus since World War II.
Sometime this month, Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to introduce a bill that would eliminate 30 senior positions in the State Department, reshuffle its responsibilities and reduce budgets by at least 15 percent by cutting more than $3 billion a year from the $21 billion foreign affairs budget.
The Helms bill would eliminate the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Mr. Helms has proposed closing the development agency's overseas missions, cutting about half of its 9,000 jobs and using a semi-independent foundation, rather than the Government, to distribute aid grants through private organizations.
"Our foreign policy institutions are a complete mess," Mr. Helms said. "Over the past four decades, key foreign policy functions have been spun off into a constellation of money-absorbing, incoherent satellites, each with its own entrenched, growing bureaucracies."
Mr. Christopher's plan would cut the managerial staff in State Department headquarters by 10 percent, close about 20 overseas posts and emphasize the use of teams to make the department more nimble in handling crises. Those moves are intended to save at least $50 million a year, his aides estimate, although most of that money would be plowed back into modernizing the department's obsolete computer system.
"This plan is an efficiency-enhancing plan, not a cut-and-slash plan," said a senior State Department official. "The Secretary doesn't think the foreign affairs budget should be cut. He thinks it should be enhanced, and he's going to try to make that case."
Another Republican plan, proposed in a bill by Benjamin A. Gilman, the New York representative who heads the House International Relations Committee, is far less radical than the Helms proposal. Mr. Gilman's bill would merge the aid, information and arms control agencies with the 26,000-employee State Department, but unlike the Helms plan, it would preserve much of their organizations.
Republican and Democratic aides say Mr. Gilman believes that a more extreme proposal would push moderate Republicans to join Democrats in defeating any overhaul plan.
Although the Clinton Administration favors the Gilman plan over the Helms proposal, it has stepped up its efforts to defeat both.
"I don't think abolishing agencies insures that we are conducting foreign policy in the best interests of the American people," one senior State Department official said.
But Several Congressional Democrats are sympathetic with the aims of the Helms bill.
At a recent Senate hearing, for example, Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, told Administration officials: "I'm not persuaded by your arguments that maintaining independent fiefdoms is in the best interest of American foreign policy. I am persuaded that the present structure is outmoded."

HEADLINE: In Philippines, Wary Hopes For a Shift From Stagnation

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: MANILA, May 6

 BODY:
It became the nightmarish symbol of a desperate nation -- thousands of Filipinos swarming over a mountain of garbage as tall as a 10-story building, scavenging through this Everest of rotting trash with their bare hands.
A generation of rag-pickers settled in shanties atop Smokey Mountain, named for the noxious haze pumped out by methane fires smoldering beneath the refuse. 
 Across town, Manila's rich had their own evidence of the collapse of a nation that was once the most prosperous in Southeast Asia: they could not even keep the lights turned on. In the early 1990's, the capital's business districts were blacked out for as much as half the day when the antiquated power grid failed.
William S. Tiffany, president of Caltex Philippines, an American-owned oil company, saw the blackouts as evidence of a nation "with no direction for the future, with no commitment for sorting out its problems." He added, "It was a terrible time." Many large American investors talked openly of giving up on this former American colony.
But could the terrible times finally be over? Almost three years after the inauguration of Fidel V. Ramos as President, the symbols of stagnation have begun to disappear, replaced by the hope that this nation of 67 million might finally be shaking its decades-old reputation as "the sick man of Asia."
The optimism is not universal. The modern history of the Philippines is one of lost opportunity, and Mr. Ramos's leadership has been tested this spring by the uproar over the execution in Singapore of a Filipino maid, Flor Contemplacion, whose name has become a rallying cry for the nation's poor.
Many Filipinos do not believe the 42-year-old maid was guilty of the two murders that sent her to the gallows, and they blame Mr. Ramos for not having done enough to save her. The furor could cost Mr. Ramos's supporters at least a few seats in the Philippine Congress in elections on Monday.
But the controversy has not dampened the enthusiasm of many economists and foreign investors who say that under Mr. Ramos, the Philippines appears to have come to the end of an era of decay that began during the rapacious dictatorship of Ferdinand E. Marcos and continued through the chaos of the presidency of Corazon C. Aquino.
The economy grew 5.1 percent in 1994 -- modest by the standards of Southeast Asia but dazzling for the Philippines -- and is projected to grow by at least 6 percent this year. Exports rose in 1994 by nearly 20 percent, while commitments for foreign investment quadrupled, reaching $2.5 billion.
Michael Taylor, an economist with Morgan Stanley, described the accomplishments as "a truly unexpected Asian economic miracle."
Smokey Mountain is being bulldozed and its 10,000 residents are being moved to a new housing development that will offer them running water, most for the first time in their lives.
"It will be good for my kids to have a clean house and a toilet," said Anna Mae Paronda, a 33-year-old rag-picker with four children. Across town, the lights are back on, the result of a crash program to build electricity plants.
"The vision of President Ramos is changing the Philippines," said Mr. Tiffany, whose company plans to spend an additional $600 million on new oil refineries here.
Still, the question for Mr. Ramos is whether the problems of the Philippines are too entrenched to allow this country ever to achieve real prosperity. While the official unemployment rate is about 9 percent, as much as one-third of the work force is considered chronically underemployed. And there is little hope that before he leaves office in 1988 -- under the Constitution, he is permitted only one six-year term -- Mr. Ramos will have made any real improvement in the lives of tens of millions of the poor.
'Sick Man of Asia' Takes Up Jogging
 Malacanang Palace has changed little since the days of Mr. Marcos, whose 20-year rule left the country in tatters by the time he was forced into exile in the United States in 1986.
The former First Lady, Imelda R. Marcos, converted the presidential palace into a gaudy showplace, a monument to excess with French antiques perched on gilded tables set in front of wall-sized murals of carefree Philippine peasants tilling their fields. Her famous shoe collection is on display downstairs.
The ostentatious decor is at odds with the informality of the palace's newest tenant, President Ramos, a cigar-chomping, West Point-educated general whose decision to turn on Mr. Marcos in 1986 made him a hero of the "people power" revolt led by Mrs. Aquino.
Mr. Ramos, 67, allowed ash from his cigars to drift to the thick palace carpet, laughing when asked if the Philippines could still be described as the "sick man of Asia."
"Oh, no," he said. "The sick man has been out of the hospital for a long time. And he's up and jogging."
Mr. Ramos has done much to reassure foreign investors who fled from the Philippines during the presidency of Mrs. Aquino. Her Government faced almost daily coup threats from disgruntled soldiers.
An investment in the Philippines is still a gamble, of course. Investors on the southern island of Mindanao have been alarmed by a new wave of violence by Muslim militants there who may have allied themselves with suspected Middle Eastern terrorists, including Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, accused of masterminding the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in 1993.
The Contemplacion case has frightened away investors from Singapore, the authoritarian city-state that had been a large source of investment in the Philippines. But even as Singaporeans pull out, other, much larger foreign investors have announced that they are here to stay.
"I have the impression that the Philippines is back on track for good," Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motors, said during a recent visit. He said the dispute with Singapore would have no effect on plans by the carmaker to build a second assembly plant here.
Breaking the Hold Of the Oligarchies
 Not everyone is convinced that the economic revival of the Philippines will last, and there was alarm here last winter over the collapse of the Mexican economy, which had been seen as a model for the Philippines and other developing countries.
"Is this bubble going to burst?" asked Solita Collas-Monsod, an economist at the University of the Philippines. She said that too little foreign money was being spent to build job-creating factories, and that too much of it was being poured into the stocks and bonds of Philippine companies. "Mexico had an enormous amount of portfolio investments and look what happened there," she said.
But other economists say the Philippines has done a far better job than Mexico in managing its economy and its currency, the Philippine peso.
The reputation of the Philippines as the economic laggard of Southeast Asia has begun to fade.
Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo remembered attending the World Bank conference in Washington in 1993 and finding himself sitting alone. "Nobody wanted to talk with us about anything," he said.
But when he arrived at the World Bank summit meeting in Spain last fall, he found himself a celebrity. "My schedule was full every day because suddenly everybody -- everybody -- wanted to talk about the Philippines," he said. "People think there has been a sea change here."
Once among the most protectionist nations in Asia, the Philippines under Mr. Ramos has freed up currency controls, cut import duties and moved to court foreign investors, offering them 100 percent ownership of companies in key industries.
Mr. Ramos's most lasting contribution to the economy may be his assault on the handful of oligarchic families who control most of the nation's wealth, including the Cojuangco family, the clan that controls the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.
For millions of Filipinos, the phone company symbolized not just what was wrong with the economy but also what was wrong with the country. Effectively a monopoly, it provided some of the worst phone service in Asia at some of its highest prices. In 1993 there was a backlog of hundreds of thousands of people seeking phone lines, with many told not to expect installation until well into the next century.
But the monopoly-like grip of the Cojuangcos, relatives of former President Aquino, ended last year, when the Government opened the telephone industry to competition. New phone companies have been formed. In just a year, telephone service has improved markedly.
The Church, the Poor And Birth Control
 Mr. Ramos's most notable challenge may be the one issued from behind the white stucco walls of a Manila hacienda that is the home of the second most powerful man in the country, Jaime Cardinal Sin.
As the head of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines, Cardinal Sin is the spiritual leader of 85 percent of the population, and he insists that Filipinos reject a centerpiece of Mr. Ramos's development program for the country: birth control.
The Philippines has one of the highest birth rates in Asia: 2.3 percent growth a year. If it holds, the population will double by 2035, which economists say would condemn the Philippines to eternal poverty as farmland is devoured by slums.
In an office decorated with an autographed portrait of Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Sin insisted that he was a friend of Mr. Ramos.
"He is a good person, a good manager," the Cardinal said of the President, who is a Protestant. "I want him to succeed."
But the Cardinal says he will not compromise over Government programs that encourage the use of condoms and other "artificial" methods of contraception. The Government, he said, is encouraging promiscuity and masturbation -- "and this is a sin, naturally."
Besides, the Cardinal said, the despair among large, impoverished families is overstated. "They are very happy when they have so many children," he said.
But if they are content, it is despite living conditions that are among the most desperate in Asia. Malnutrition is as common in the Philippines as it is in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
A survey of more than one million children entering the first grade last year found that four out of five were malnourished, and that the vast majority were severely underweight.
Malnutrition is evident in the sickly, stick-thin bodies of the children of the village of Waling-Waling on the island of Mindanao. The village offers a typically bleak portrait of Philippine rural life.
Guialuson Maulana, a tenant farmer, hands over a fifth of his earnings from his tiny rice farm to the landlord. That leaves Mr. Maulana with about $80 a year.
Mr. Maulana's face is drawn, his shoulders slumped, and his four children look no healthier than their 32-year-old father. None of the children have ever seen a doctor or a dentist.
Mr. Maulana says his family survives on three meals a day of seasoned rice -- and most days, only rice, because there is no money for meat or fish.
"Sometimes I can find a few vegetables," he said with a shrug of resignation. "I am thankful for the rice. At least our stomachs feel full."

One Man's Parade, Another's Parking Lot

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
This weekend, like every other spring weekend, the streets are filled with people exercising a privilege cherished by every group of citizens in New York: the right to inconvenience every other group of citizens in New York.
Yesterday, Times Square and Columbus Circle were occupied by throngs protesting the Contract With America. This morning, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and streets in all five boroughs are to be closed for 20,000 touring bicyclists. This afternoon, as Knicks fans drive in for the playoff game, they will find the Avenue of the Americas closed for a parade of Cubans, Fifth Avenue closed for a parade of African-American veterans, and stretches of Broadway and First Avenue closed for street fairs. 
 You could call it a fine day for New York's gorgeous mosaic, but people trying to go crosstown probably will see it differently. So do some economists, budget analysts and traffic engineers, who wonder if it is sensible to give away so many streets to private groups. They estimate that these events cost the public tens of millions of dollars a year -- partly in the pay of police and street cleaners, but mainly in the time wasted by people sitting in traffic jams.
In recent years, city streets have been closed for more than 100 parades annually, and since 1989 the annual number of large street fairs has doubled, reaching 400. There are thousands of other street closings for smaller fairs, political demonstrations and film production. Organizers of some of the largest street fairs pay a fee to the city and hire their own cleanup crews, but many of the city's costs are not reimbursed.
These events sometimes require extra police officers and sanitation workers on overtime pay at about $35 an hour, and the annual overtime bill for parades alone has amounted to $5 million for police, half a million for sanitation in recent years. Although police officials have cut some of these overtime costs -- they expect this year's tab to be less than $3.5 million -- they are still concerned about the number of officers on their regular shifts who must be reassigned to parades.
"We're tring to reduce the number and the size of parades by looking at the applications a little more carefully and encouraging some groups to combine their parades," said the police Chief of Department, Louis R. Anemone. "Parades not only cost us money for overtime, they force us to divert cops from normal duties."
It is hard to measure the inconvenience that parades cause, but engineers like to try. They estimate congestion costs by calculating how much time is wasted by people sitting in idling cars. For instance, according to a study by Brian Ketcham, a transportation consultant in Brooklyn, the daily parade of cars into the Lincoln and Holland tunnels produces $50 million in congestion costs for the motorists who are not using the tunnels but are stuck in the traffic jams near the entrances.
Mr. Ketcham said that no one has estimated the total toll taken by the city's parades, but he provided one small measure by calculating the disruption to be produced by today's parade celebrating Cuba's independence. He estimated that the parade, by closing down the Avenue of the Americas from 44th to 58th Streets for three hours, will delay 180,000 people an average of 15 minutes apiece as they drive through midtown. Valuing their lost leisure time at $5 an hour -- a relatively conservative estimate -- Mr. Ketcham calculated that the parade will produce $225,000 in congestion costs for motorists, as well as 10,000 extra pounds of carbon monoxide from their idling cars.
Like others, the Cuban parade does not pay fees, and its organizers do not see why it should. People who complain about inconvenience miss the point, said Jorge Mascaro, the president of the parade.
"Maybe those people are not tied into any roots," he said. "Maybe those people don't understand the multicultural status of New York City. The parade keeps our culture and our roots alive, and it brings all ethnic groups together. Parades make us understand each other."
His view is shared by plenty of others, who believe that it is churlish to do a cost-benefit analysis of events that produce so much intangible public good.
"Parades serve a big social function by validating a lot of marginal groups," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center. "They are for the middle classes what charity events and debutante balls are for the elite: a chance to show off your latest hairdo and to reflect in the halo of other people. This is one of the last cities where people still thrive on the streets and sidewalks, and I think we ought to encourage parades."
Nevertheless, a few people -- most of whom are not running for office anytime soon -- suggest that there might be fairer ways to pay for parades and other street events.
"When times are tough and services to New Yorkers are being cut, everyone should be asked to do their share," said Dean Mead, a senior research associate for the Citizens Budget Commission, the business-supported nonprofit group. "We should cut down the number of fairs and parades, and we should have the organizers contribute to the city's costs of running them."
Robert H. Frank has a more radical proposal. Dr. Frank, an economist at Cornell University, suggests that the city charge fees for parades according to all the costs they produce, from police to street cleaning to wasted time in traffic jams.
"The city could offer a menu of fees by location," Dr. Frank said. "A parade would cost you big bucks on Fifth Avenue, a lot less on Coney Island. Fees would encourage groups to minimize disruption and to look for creative alternatives for demonstrating that they've come of age. It's probably possible to find a way of proclaiming your presence that doesn't involve calling out the police and tying up traffic."
In some ways, Dr. Frank's proposal might be fairer to new groups, since they could at least bid for a parade on Fifth Avenue. Responding to complaints from merchants and residents along the most coveted parade route, the city has decided not to allow any new annual parades on Fifth Avenue, effectively discriminating in favor of established groups like the Irish against newcomers like the West Indians, whose parade in Brooklyn is now the city's largest.
City officials are setting up a central office to keep track of the various events -- parades, street fairs, movie shoots -- that are approved separately by different agencies. Until now, a lack of coordination, they said, has produced schedules like the one for May 21 -- a Sunday featuring the AIDS Walk, the Israeli Day Parade and the Ninth Avenue Food Festival -- and today's.
"This is exactly the kind of weekend we want to avoid in the future," Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter said. "Some commitments were made by people without knowing what else was going on. Street activity does help the city, but over the years more and more people have wanted to use the streets, and it's causing problems."
Ms. Reiter said that the city requires street fairs and some parades -- those that left behind exceptional messes in the past -- to post a bond covering cleanup costs. "We have never charged for police services," she said, "and I can't imagine that we ever will, except possibly for a profit-making event."
Not many other politicians can imagine trying to extract money from a parade organizer. They would offend not only the parade marchers themselves -- a voting bloc -- but also the affection that many other New Yorkers feel for parades, even noisy, inconvenient ones held by other ethnic groups.
"Every St. Patrick's Day the noise and the crowds and the litter are annoying," said Menachem Weinglas, a diamond dealer on West 47th Street. "The guys are out in front practicing on their drums and tubas, scaring away potential customers. But it's a small price to pay. The disruption does not outweigh the joy that it brings the people in these parades. I know how good I feel when I walk in a parade or watch one."
Tom Cusick, the president of the Fifth Avenue Association, agrees with that sentiment -- up to a point. "We know that people love parades, and we understand that everyone wants to be on Fifth Avenue," he said. "We certainly don't want to abolish parades here, but we want to remind people of other options. For instance, we think Park Avenue would be a wonderful place for a parade."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Moscow Visit: A Climate of Mutual Doubt

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, May 6

 BODY:
Not since the grim old days of the cold war have relations between the United States and Russia been quite as problematic as they are this weekend, on the eve of President Clinton's visit for celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe in World War II.
The man on whom Mr. Clinton has counted so heavily, President Boris N. Yeltsin, has been severely weakened at home and abroad by his army's devastating suppression of dissent in Chechnya. No longer Bill and Boris, buddy-buddies, the two leaders have squabbled over NATO expansion, Moscow's plans to sell a nuclear reactor to Iran and the fighting in Bosnia. 
 It is by no means certain that they will be able to patch things up when they meet on Wednesday after Tuesday's anniversary bash.
Indeed, American policy makers are not nearly as sure as they were only a year ago that Russia will evolve into a democracy, and they doubt that the United States can count on forming a solid strategic alliance with Moscow anytime soon.
Michael Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations, like other students of East-West affairs, speaks of "containing a smaller, no longer Communist, but still aggressive Russia" goaded into hard-line policies by resurgent nationalism.
But the Clinton Administration remains determined to make the best of the cooling relationship with Mr. Yeltsin. Describing Chechnya as a tragic setback, Richard C. Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, wrote in the spring issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, "If the forces of reform are embattled, the United States must reinforce, not retreat from, its support for them."
During the long debate over whether Mr. Clinton should make the trip, Secretary of State Warren Christopher argued for using the occasion to try to pry some concessions from the Russians on dicey issues. The President was able to win few if any guarantees during a long phone conversation with Mr. Yeltsin last week. American leverage now seems limited, with the Administration unwilling to cut American aid any further, despite growing disillusionment in Congress.
As a sign of disapproval of the overwhelming use of force in Chechnya, Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister John Major of Britain will shun a military parade in Moscow on Tuesday. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France will boycott not only that one but also a parade of World War II veterans in Red Square that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Major will attend.
Even so, it will be an uncomfortable moment for some in the Western delegations. Heroic as the Soviet Army and the Russians on the home front were, the record of Soviet soldiers in the war was "extremely mixed, to put the best possible face on it," the senior American diplomat said.
In addition to winning celebrated victories at Stalingrad and elsewhere, they forcibly occupied the Baltic republics and killed thousands of Poles in the massacre in Katyn Forest.
Here and in Moscow, the streets are decked with banners and posters and bunting, many bearing the hammer-and-sickle emblem of the old Communist regime whose troops fought the Nazis. On one of the first sparkling days of spring, young women in cotton dresses, young men in army uniforms and old-timers dressed in shabbier clothes carried flowers today to St. Petersburg's imposing war memorials.
Nearly 27 million Russians died between 1941 and 1945, more by far than died in all the other combatant nations combined. More than a million perished in the gruesome 900-day siege of Leningrad, as St. Petersburg was then known, many starving or freezing to death in temperatures that neared 30 below zero.
It was that immense Soviet sacrifice half a century ago that prompted Mr. Clinton's decision -- "a supremely personal decision, against the advice of some of us," one White House aide called it -- to celebrate V-E day not in Paris, London or Washington, as he well might have, but in Moscow.
Officials involved in planning the trip said Mr. Clinton planned to devote more time to meeting other Russian officials, including Mr. Yeltsin's rivals, than he did on his stay here in January 1994. Mr. Christopher sounded the theme in a briefing in Washington on Friday: "In the long run we will only have a good relationship with the Russian Government when we have a good relationship with the Russian people."
As he did last time, Mr. Clinton is expected to speak directly to them on television next week.
Though beleaguered by crime and government corruption, the Russians are beginning to feel the first slight benefits of economic reform. Yet bitterness over the loss of empire and their place in the front ranks of nations has proven a fertile forcing ground for nationalist extremists and hard-liners in the Russian military.
Mr. Yeltsin and other leaders are therefore determined to recover some of their influence in adjacent countries, not to lose more through the admission of Central European nations to the NATO alliance.
At a meeting in Budapest in December, Mr. Yeltsin denounced NATO expansion as anti-Russian. American officials hoped that was just a phase and that Russia would accede to plans for countries like Poland and the Czech Republic to join the alliance, so long as the pace was not too quick. The Americans are talking about admitting the new members within the next five years.
They consider it absolutely essential to stabilize Central Europe, the cockpit of conflict during the cold war and the point of origin of both of this century's world wars.
But Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, warned last month in Copenhagen that NATO enlargement would lead "to a nightmare of renewed confrontation." He also lamented that "the nationalists are using the enlargement of NATO to demonstrate the failure of our Government, including myself."
In an interview last week with Time magazine, Mr. Yeltsin sounded equally uncompromising. "Expanding NATO to the east" would "leave not only a dividing line on the map of Europe, it would also carve a deep scar in people's minds," he declared.
Some Administration officials think that a form of words can be worked out that would save face for Mr. Yeltsin; some do not. But all insisted that Moscow will not be given a veto over the fact or the timing of the expansion program. When the Czech Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, met with Mr. Clinton at the White House on Thursday, an American official reported, he asked a direct question.
"I want to know only one thing," he was said to have asked the President. "Are you going to Moscow and allowing Yeltsin to slow up this procedure?"
Mr. Clinton answered, "No."
On Chechnya and Bosnia, little progress appears possible, although Mr. Clinton may press for the extension of the cease-fire that the Russians have declared in Chechnya for the May 9 holiday.
Mr. Kozyrev has hinted at various times that Moscow might cancel or modify its $1 billion sale of nuclear equipment to Teheran. But Mr. Yeltsin has been adamant on this issue, too, and it is possible that Mr. Clinton will go home empty-handed.

HEADLINE: Poor Illinois Tenants Face Eviction After Public Complaint

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALORTON, Ill., May 6

 BODY:
There is a hole in the floor of the mobile home in which Pamela Taylor lives with her two young children. Cracks in the kitchen linoleum are big enough to trap her 1-year-old daughter.
Ms. Taylor, who is 24, single and unemployed, pointed to gaps under the kitchen sink. "I keep salt right there to keep the snails out because my baby tries to eat them," she said. 
 She said she was being evicted by her landlord, Callie Mobley, for speaking with a reporter last month about the poor housing conditions. Ms. Taylor said that she had sought help from half a dozen state and local agencies, but that they had said they had little or no say in the matter.
The problem is, she said, Ms. Mobley is also the Mayor of Alorton, a poor town in southwestern Illinois, just outside East St. Louis.
With Ms. Mobley as Mayor, it is virtually impossible to appeal an eviction, Ms. Taylor said. She did not even ask the six-member village board for help because she says it is nothing but a rubber stamp for the Mayor.
Another of Ms. Mobley's tenants, Vernard Harris, also spoke to the reporter, from the Belleville News-Democrat, and is also being evicted.
He agrees that it is hard to fight a landlord who is also the Mayor. "She's the boss out here," he said.
The two were told last month that they would be evicted, days after they had talked to the newspaper.
Ms. Mobley said they were being evicted because they were habitually late paying their rent. Although Ms. Taylor and Mr. Harris admit that they had fallen behind, they have offered to pay Ms. Mobley in full. The tenants are planning to go to court to challenge the evictions as retaliatory.
Mayor Mobley, in response, pointed out that she had not tried to evict two other tenants who had spoken to the newspaper. They pay their rent regularly, she said.
One of them is Ms. Taylor's neighbor, Monica Young, who told the newspaper that her heat had been broken since December.
The problem was fixed, but Ms. Young said her landlord "just doesn't really do her job like she's supposed to."
"You have to really beg or something, and I don't like that, especially when I'm paying my money every month," Ms. Young said.
Mayor Mobley rejects the accusation that she fails to maintain the property, which she and her husband own. She said that she had never been told about the problems and that the residents had caused most of the damage.
"Alorton is a poor community, but my property is no worse than anybody else's," said Ms. Mobley, who has been Mayor since 1981. She was re-elected in 1993.
Many residents of Alorton live on lots overrun by weeds, in ramshackle houses and more than 200 rusty mobile homes, where the smell of burning garbage fills the air.
The city requires that houses be inspected before people move in, but no inspection records are available. The Mayor said they might be among the village records seized in October by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for an investigation the agency would not discuss.
Mr. Harris, his wife and their three children lived in a two-bedroom house owned by Ms. Mobley for about two years; the rent is $300 a month.
The Harrises' house is across the street from the Mobleys' house, where a camper and a Cadillac are parked.
Mr. Harris said his 10-year-old daughter had fallen through a hole in the bathroom floor. It has been repaired, he said, but the heat does not work and standing water under the house attracts bugs and rats.

HEADLINE: The Measure of a Summit

 BODY:
There was a sense of history in the making eight years ago, as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev unexpectedly extended their Iceland summit talks into the night. With their planes poised for departure, the two men groped their way along the unexplored boundaries of nuclear arms control, only to turn back when the leap ahead seemed too great. The instant Mr. Reagan grimaced as he stiffly bade farewell to Mr. Gorbachev, a waiting world knew the meeting had ended in disappointment.
 The stuff of such high drama will be largely absent this week when President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin meet in Moscow at a time of strained relations. Except for discussion of missile defense systems and Russian doubts about the still unratified 1992 arms reduction agreement, the likely agenda lacks the gravitas that invested cold-war summit meetings with singular importance. 
 Yet the nuclear stalemate, while far more threatening, was in some ways more ordered and manageable than relations today. The tidy universe of arms negotiators seeking the precise number of warheads acceptable to both sides has given way to disorderly wrangling over Russia's nuclear energy deals with Iran. The familiar issues of military demarcation in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact have been replaced by a recondite debate over NATO expansion. Instead of concrete talks about the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan there are now inconclusive exchanges about ending the Russian offensive in Chechnya.
 As the relationship has changed, the American calculus used to evaluate summit meetings has not. It is still based predominantly on agreements reached and differences narrowed or more clearly defined. Those remain important considerations, but a broader definition is needed now that American interests revolve less around keeping the peace with Russia than building democracy in Russia.
 In an interview with Mr. Yeltsin published last week, Time magazine portentously asked him about "relations between the superpowers." That flattering formulation mistakenly perpetuates an image of Russian parity that makes this week's talks seem yet another summit meeting of contending and equal powers. Russia is a European and Asian power today primarily because of history and geography. Its struggling economy, hollow military and volatile political environment have long since rendered it considerably less than a global superpower.
 That precipitous fall has reinforced the defensive streak in Russian foreign policy and the nationalist streak in Russian politics. These may be the invisible forces that shape the Moscow meeting, and make it difficult to judge. No one in Washington can predict how Mr. Yeltsin will balance the need to build ties to the West with the domestic pressure to make Russia look strong and independent. With the rapid devolution of power in Russia, no one really knows for whom Mr. Yeltsin speaks.
 While one measure of summit success may be whether Moscow gives up its nuclear deal with Iran or drops its posturing about the 1992 arms agreement, evaluation should also rest on the quality of Mr. Clinton's conversation with the Russian people. For many Russians, the American President is the respected symbol of a stable, prosperous democracy, and they will listen intently when he speaks. As their own experiment in democracy proceeds unevenly, there is much Mr. Clinton can tell them about managing and maintaining liberty, and the benefits they will realize if they do.
 That may be the single most important thing he can do in Moscow. Mr. Reagan would no doubt have gladly exchanged the drama of his unplanned evening with Mr. Gorbachev for the opportunity to encourage a free Russia to remain that way.

In My Next Life

BYLINE: By Thomas L. Friedman 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
In my next life I want to be a European statesman.
 I want to be able to turn up my nose at the United States when it puts principle before profit and naively imposes an embargo on Iran to prevent this medieval theocracy from acquiring nuclear arms. I want to be able to tell the Americans with great arrogance that the right way to deal with Iran is through what European statesmen call "a critical dialogue." Which I assume means the Europeans criticize America and carry on a dialogue with the Iranians, while pocketing their cash. 
 If I can't be a European statesman, then in my next life I want to be a Japanese trade negotiator. I want to erect trade barriers around my country and then accuse whoever tries to break down those barriers of engaging in "managed trade." I want to be able to grossly underpay my country's workers, while I plow all my profits into building new markets abroad. And then when my currency soars in value against the dollar -- because I don't import anything from anyone -- I want to say with a straight face that the whole problem could be solved if the U.S. would just choke off its growth and raise its interest rates.
 If I can't be a Japanese trade negotiator, then in my next life I want to be a North Korean diplomat. I want to be able to defy the world, build nuclear weapons and then get the U.S. to bribe me with a safe nuclear reactor to halt my program -- without having to give up any of my bombs. And then, when the deal is done, I want to tell the Americans that I changed my mind, that I won't accept the reactor they are giving me free because it's made by my archenemy, South Korea, but that I still want Coca-Cola to open a bottling factory in my country.
 If I can't be a North Korean diplomat, then in my next life I want to be the head of the Russian Atomic Energy Commission. I want to sell nuclear technology to Iran, so that its cynical, hate-filled ayatollahs living near Russia's southern border will one day have a nuclear weapon with which to threaten Moscow. I want to do this because I can make lots of money and be a real power player in the Kremlin -- until the Iranians blow it up.
 If I can't be a Russian energy czar, then in my next life I want to be President of Serbia (or Croatia). I want to slick back my hair and wear tailored suits, while I stand before the world and deny perpetrating ghastly atrocities in order to cleanse my homeland of strangers. I want to give lots of interviews on CNN and declare that if only the world remembered the Battle of Kosovo, in 1389, it would understand why my people were the true victims and justified in slaughtering their neighbors.
 If I can't be President of Serbia, then in my next life I want to be a Republican Presidential candidate. I want to be able to repeal the ban on assault weapons so that paranoid private militias trying to subvert the Constitution will be much better armed to resist the police, F.B.I. and A.T.F. the next time they try to blow up a Federal building.
 If I can't be a Republican Presidential candidate, then in my next life I want to be Speaker of the House. I want to be able to have my mother call the First Lady a "bitch" on national TV. I want to denounce editorial writers and certain bureaucrats as "socialists." And I want to delegitimize the Federal Government. Then I want to be able to say it's "obscene" to suggest that my obscene language might have contributed to an atmosphere in which right-wing anti-government extremists feel so alienated from their fellow Americans that they would blow up a Federal building with a day-care center inside.
 If I can't be Speaker of the House, then in my next life I want to be one of O. J. Simpson's lawyers. Yes, I want to be a Harvard-trained hired gun who -- just like gun fanatics -- tries to undermine public faith in our legal system by inventing government conspiracies behind every drop of spilt blood.
 But if I can't be any of these, then in my next life I think I just want to be an American citizen.
 I want to be a member of the freest society in the world. I want to have a government that, with all its flaws, is occasionally ready to stand up and act on principle, not just profit. And I want to understand that preserving such a society is not automatic. It is something that has to be worked at every day. And it has to be worked at by nurturing a society where people appreciate that the government-is-us, that hate speech leads to hate acts, and that the civic courage to be a tolerant, law-abiding, tax-paying citizen is the greatest courage of all.

HEADLINE: DIARY

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Jobless Rate Heads Upward . . .
So is it over? Did the Federal Reserve manage, all too well, to yank the economy to a crawl? It may seem so on the news that April unemployment jumped 0.3 points, to 5.8 percent, and payrolls fell for the first time in more than two years. But no, analysts said, the expansion is still alive -- but humbled. "This is not a recession," said the head of the National Association of Manufacturers. And Labor Secretary Reich saw "no evidence that the economy's going into reverse." The bond market like it just fine, as long-term interest rates headed down close to 7 percentCHECKKKKKKK, the lowest level in a year.
 
. . . but Layoffs Slow Down
But look at it another way. The truly wrenching part of the job picture in recent years has been the mass layoffs, which, properly placed, can devastate whole neighborhoods or towns. But according to the latest employment report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, fewer layoffs were announced in April than in any month since May 1993. In fact, for 1995's first four months, the report said, layoffs were down by nearly half from last year. So even though unemployment is up, "wholesale cuts are slowing," said John Challenger, the firm's executive vice president. And "layoff figures are more indicative of how companies are looking at workforce reduction."
 
LIABILITY
 
Bankruptcy Over Implants?
The breast-implant mess keeps taking a toll -- and not just on the true victims, the women involved. Last week Dow Corning, facing 20,000 lawsuits, said it might have to file for bankruptcy protection, which would put a halt to all the litigation. Not that it would be broke. The company is owned by Dow Chemical and Corning, and also last week came news that Marion Merrell Dow -- 71 percent owned by Dow Chemical -- would be bought by Hoechst of Germany. What that means in the industry is yet another huge merger, this one creating the world's No. 2 drug maker, right after Glaxo Wellcome. And what it means for Dow Chemical is $5.1 billion (out of a total purchase price of $7.1 billion) to help it with implant settlements.
 
TELEVISION
 
Danger! Ad Rates on the Loose!
Wait a second. Hasn't everyone in the universe already seen "Jurassic Park" 11 times? Well, NBC clearly hopes they'll make it an even dozen, for it paid $50 million for the rights to broadcast it, the first showing being tonight. And advertisers are paying $650,000 for 30-second spots -- an otherworldly figure that puts the event (that's the way NBC wants you to think of it, as an "event," not a mere "movie") up there with such pivotal moments in world history as this year's Academy Awards or the "Cheers" finale in 1993. (Of course, it's still well behind recent Super Bowl ad rates, which are too absurd to mention.) Among the advertisers, of course, is the Ford Explorer -- which, you'll recall, got rather unkind treatment from Mr. Rex.
 
AUTOS
 
It's Drizzling in Detroit
Well, Chrysler has been saying -- to fend off pesky takeover offers -- that it needed its $7.5 billion nest egg in case rainy days returned, and it may be right. Last week auto makers said sales were slipping badly -- off 6.1 percent in April, the fourth straight monthly drop. (One exception: Ford keeps selling light trucks; they rose 16 percent.) What's up? For one thing, even as interest rates ease, car-loan rates stay stubbornly high -- not to mention car prices. Maybe it's just part of a slowing economy. And maybe, with so many good used cars around -- thanks in part to leasing -- buyers don't care so much about shiny and new. But whatever the reason, watch for more rebates and good deals.
 
BLAME GAME
 
A Team Effort at Barings
Nicholas Leeson is still in a Frankfurt jail, taking most of the heat for the collapse of Barings two months ago. But the new owner of what's left of Barings -- the Dutch company ING -- decided last week that it was unlikely that Mr. Leeson was the lone gunman, the supervillain of the piece. Without ladling out fixed doses of guilt, ING ousted 21 top Barings executives, saying they had "functional responsibility" for the mess at the Singapore outpost. The clear message: Even if those executives didn't know the disastrously risky road Mr. Leeson was taking, they should have known.
 
BANKING
 
Tellers With a Difference
Yes, First Chicago had any number of sound, sober reasons for that $3 teller fee. And who knows -- maybe it is the best way to keep banking costs low for the low of balance. But let's face it: walking freely up to a teller (after waiting in line, of course) is right up there with sunshine and tulips -- it seems almost a constitutional right. Tinker with tulips and you make yourself an awfully easy target for all manner of reactions, from indignant to teasing. And sure enough, some Chicago-area banks had a field day, as Lake Forest Bank gave $3 to customers after their transactions were finished, and a Harris branch handed out dollar bills to customers who asked whether it charged fees. What did Richard Thomas, First Chicago's chairman, think of all this? "A little silly," he said.
 
NEWSPAPERS
 
NEWS TO 42D ST.: SO LONG
In 1930, The Daily News built an Art Deco temple for itself on -- where else? -- 42d Street, the center of the known universe. The building so resonated with nostalgic newspaperdom that it was used as a set in the "Superman" movies. But like the world, The News has changed. In 1947, its daily circulation was 2.4 million; today, the paper's bruises still healing from labor battles, it's scarcely a third of that. The payroll has plunged from 9,000 to a little over 1,000. The presses left the 42d Street building more than a decade ago. And last week The News made its biggest symbolic break with its past, leaving that home behind and moving to a single floor across town -- one with the high-tech bells and whistles deemed necessary for a modern paper.
 
PUBLISHING
 
Today's News (Net Wt., 12 Oz.)
And here's another sign of changing journalistic times: when Times Mirror named a new chief executive last week, it wasn't someone from the ranks but Mark Willes, a General Mills vice chairman with no media experience. His message: "Start from the consumer," strive to be "the low-cost producer," "refresh" products just as food companies tinker with cereals and cake mixes. Yes, many newspapers are hurting -- Times Mirror's two big papers, The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, reported big circulation drops last week. But what's coming? Banner headlines saying "Light and Fluffy" or "Only 17 Calories"?
 
BROADCASTING
 
The Murdoch Exemption
Some matters, it seems, transcend the laws of the land -- matters like Rupert Murdoch's ownership of American TV stations. Yes, the F.C.C. said last week, Mr. Murdoch and his News Corp. had violated foreign-ownership laws -- but the agency said it had no intention of doing anything about it. No fines, no drastic cutbacks in his ownership stake. Why? As one commissioner, James Quello, put it, the "compelling public interest" lay in the creation of a fourth network to promote competition. As for Mr. Murdoch, he rejoiced that the "meritless, wild and malicious charges of some of our competitors" had been rejected. But of course the ownership issue was clearly not meritless -- just rejected.

HEADLINE: Isolating Nuclear Iran Endangers World Health

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "The Iran Embargo" (editorial, May 2) ignores the most serious side effect of further isolating Iran through pressure on Russia to cancel its planned sale to Iran of nuclear reactors. Technologically isolating Iran would result in a vicious cycle of more radicalization and isolation. 
 Iran, determined to develop its nuclear energy option, will acquire components for reactor systems from many sources, which could be scattered in different countries. This could result in a piecemeal assemblage of incompatible parts of questionable reliability in an untested reactor with no operational track record and obsolete safety systems.
 The radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine spread death and disease across the world, including the United States. Chernobyl taught the harsh lesson that a nuclear accident anywhere is an accident everywhere. An Iranian reactor that is hastily or secretly designed and untested will pose much higher risk to the health of Americans and to the environment than a well-designed, tested and safely operated one.
 The best control is through the integration of one country's technology with that of other countries, such that no one component can operate independently of the whole system. Interdependency and correlation among technologies provide more oversight, control and assurance than restrictions and isolation.
 The United States deal with North Korea for developing and installing light-water reactors is a step in the right direction and an example of a new paradigm in foreign policy that should be duplicated elsewhere.

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
The Mayor of Kentucky Avenue

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
HE IS an example of what Atlantic City politics have never, ever been. In a city of blustering movers and shakers both inside and outside the casino industry, Sidney Trusty is so soft-spoken that if he weren't six feet tall, you wouldn't know he was there.
Yet when he lumbers past a low-income housing project, settles in to a plate of ribs and greens at Shotgun's Westside Restaurant on Hummock Avenue or sits down to watch a council meeting in City Hall, so many people wave at him, call him "mayor" or buttonhole him with the latest gossip that you know you're with an authentic power broker. 
 When Mayor James Whelan, who is white, was asked if he'd needed the support of Mr. Trusty, who is black, when he won his second term, he replied: "Unquestionably. Sid's a bridge builder. He can go into any neighborhood, deal with anybody from the highest to the lowest, and he will be received, well respected and liked. In a racially divided city, he's been able to help heal the racial divisions."
In a city where local politics has wide-ranging effects on the way casinos operate and the manner in which state revenue is spent, Mr. Trusty likes to operate as an almost, but not quite, invisible man. He attends every public meeting and takes careful notes on who votes and why. He rarely makes public comments. He doesn't give speeches. His most visible job, and the one he's proudest of, has to do with history, not politics: he is historian of the city's small black history museum, the Kentucky Avenue Museum.
He got into politics almost as an afterthought. The adopted son of an Atlantic City butler and a maid, he performed as a drummer in local nightclubs. He was a policeman and a waiter in the hotels, ran a Boardwalk bowling alley, was a vice president and business agent of Local 708 of the musicians' union and edited a national bowling newspaper. He drove a cab for 34 years, retiring at the age of 70. At that point, he said, "I had the time to follow up on things."
"I never got involved directly in politics," he went on, "but I kept my eyes on what was going on. In the beginning, when somebody wanted to know why it was that all the money from the casinos that was supposed to help the city was going out of the city, I could tell them that it was the greedy politicians, and I could tell them who these politicians were.
"I was like a drummer, you know, in the back, keeping the time. You show off, you try to get attention on yourself, you're going to miss the beat. Your power comes from staying on the beat."
Because he doesn't gamble, Mr. Trusty doesn't have much use for the casinos. But unlike many residents, he doesn't blame the casinos for the city's problems.
"The casinos have done their share, as far as I'm concerned," he said. "They're here. They're open for business. You stick your nose into what a business has to do just to stay open in this town, and you'll have a lot of respect for them."
Respect, but not necessarily admiration. The benefits of legalized casino gambling have eluded many grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the black and Hispanic working people who were once the backbone of the city's economy -- hotel workers, restaurant cooks, fishermen. They have claimed few significant positions in casinos' upper management. They have seen entire neighborhoods destroyed before casino-financed low- and middle-income housing projects could take hold in the North and South Inlet. Many are still resentful of a state corruption investigation that ended the political career of James L. Usry, the city's first black Mayor.
As cruel as the city's racial polarization has been, Mr. Trusty says, it could have been much worse. "I am fundamentally a historian," he said. "Sure, there was racism in this city, but not as bad as other cities. There was a life here, a vitality that attracted people, white and black, from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., to Kentucky Avenue, where the greatest entertainers worked the greatest nightclubs you ever saw. On Kentucky Avenue, there was no racism -- just people having a good time.
"That's my city. That's the city I remember. We're going to bring that back again. Just you wait."

HEADLINE: Downsizing Impedes Rebound

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE road to recovery is full of potholes, commercial real estate professionals say. The county's office market got off to a slow start in the first quarter of the year, with corporate downsizing leaving vacancy rates higher and resulting in a surplus of office space.
While much of the action in the market is a result of steady leasing activity of small to mid-size companies -- the industry's "bread and butter" -- the continued downsizing by Westchester's largest corporate employers remains a hindrance to sustained recovery of the office market, said William V. Cuddy Jr., senior vice president of the Rostenberg-Doern Company, an independently owned real estate concern in the Westchester-Fairfield region specializing in corporate real estate brokerage and consulting. 
 "Most of the vacant space in the county, over 75 percent of it, has been generated by just two corporate downsizings, I.B.M. and Nynex," Mr. Cuddy said, adding that consolidations by Advantis, an I.B.M.-Sears joint venture, and Nynex returned almost 370,000 square feet of leased office space to the marketplace during the first quarter.
A recent survey of the Westchester office market made by Rostenberg-Doern showed a negative absorption of 489,596 square feet of Class A and B office space for the quarter. The countywide vacancy for the quarter was 24.9 percent, up from 22.3 percent at the end of last year.
"The good news is that there are positive signs that the market will begin to rebound," Mr. Cuddy said. "Steady leasing activity looks good for the rest of the year. I think it's safe to anticipate that the pace we will see will be similar to that we had during the early to mid-80's with the same brisk market."
There have already been encouraging signs of change, he said, "Companies in Manhattan are looking at space in downtown White Plains partly because of the good train service but primarily because of the rent differential, which is significant. There is a spread of $10 to $15 a foot for Class A office space."
Despite the unfortunate contractions of I.B.M. and Nynex, John Halpern, president of Halpern Enterprises in Tarrytown, says the resurgence of office leasing activity proves that tenants believe real estate in Westchester is a good product. "They are further attracted by the quality of life here, which is a big draw," Mr. Halpern said.
At Halpern Enterprises Tarrytown Corporate Center, a multi-use office park of 1.2 million square feet in Tarrytown, 98 percent of the space in the park has been re-leased in the last 12 months, Mr. Halpern said.
"I think of our center as a microcosm of the larger market," he said, "There are so many similarities. Even at the depths of the recession, when I.B.M. pulled out and left us with 450,000 square feet of vacant space, which was 35 percent of the Tarrytown Corporate Center, at the end of the day, the bread and butter companies kept on leasing. Big users, those who take large blocks of space -- 100,000 square feet or more -- like Ciba and Mastercard, will change the market, but it's the small and mid-sized users who are the guts of the industry."
Ciba's decision to relocate its corporate headquarters and additives division from Ardsley into two existing buildings at the Tarrytown Corporate Center was completed at a closing in March. Now under renovation are 540 White Plains Road, a 120,000-square-foot, six-floor office building purchased by Ciba, and 520 White Plains Road, a 170,000-square-foot, six-floor office building leased by Ciba. In addition, a 160,000-square-foot, $40 million laboratory is under construction at the Tarrytown Corporate Center.
"Ciba's renewed commitment to Westchester means that 1,000 jobs will remain in Westchester and tens of millions of dollars will be invested in the county," Mr. Halpern said. "Ciba and deals like it are a sign the recession is behind us."
Among the companies signing significant leases in the first quarter were Dansk International Design. Dansk's lease for 25,873 square feet at 108 Corporate Park Drive in White Plains was the largest new lease in the county for the first quarter.
Frank Tomasulo, first vice president of CB Commercial Real Estate Group in White Plains, which is representing Dansk, views the company's move from Mount Kisco to White Plains "as a positive indicator of Westchester's vitality and continuing ability to attract and retain national and international corporations who want to enjoy prime facilities and comfortable life style."
"There is good leasing activity going on in the county," he continued. "We have leased in excess of 426,000 square feet this quarter, primarily to small and mid-sized tenants."
At the end of last month, Mr. Tomasulo said, his company completed a major deal, the sale for more than $18 million of the 213,000-square-foot Christiania Building at 120 White Plains Road in Tarrytown to J. P. Morgan Investments in Manhattan.
"The Christiania Building is 90 percent leased," Mr. Tomasulo said. "The J. P. Morgan Company bought it as an investment property. What is significant is that it shows that Westchester is viewed as being desirable and one of the most highly regarded locations in the country."
When Eastridge Properties took over 18 buildings that formerly belonged to the Shulman Group on Westchester Avenue in White Plains, the vacancy rate was 25 percent.
"That was a little over three years ago," said Michael J. Ziatyk, Eastridge's managing director. "Now 90 percent of the space, two million square feet total, is rented to small and middle-size users. Most of them in the range of 2,000 to 25,000 square foot space requirements."
Rents, he said, have risen only slightly but concession packages -- free rent and tenant improvements -- have become less generous.
"Much of the activity we're seeing has been from intra-county upgrades," he said, "mainly coming from law and accounting firms, architectural practices, entrepreneurial companies, whose principals are seeking a good location close to home in order to shorten commutes with only a handful -- 10 percent -- of our tenants relocating to Westchester from Manhattan."

HEADLINE: FOR AMERICA, IT TRULY WAS A GREAT WAR

BYLINE: By ALAN BRINKLEY; Alan Brinkley, professor of American history at Columbia University, is the author of "The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War," recently published by Knopf.

 BODY:
AMERICA WAS BOOMING. America was at war. Men and women were working again. Men and women were dying. There were dreams of a new world order. There were fears of a new Depression. For Americans, more than for any other combatants, World War II was a paradoxical experience -- simultaneously horrifying and exhilarating. For all the fervor with which Americans committed themselves to a great national cause, they were terrified at the possibility of losing the struggle -- a possibility that seemed particularly real in that first difficult year after Pearl Harbor -- and of having to live in a world dominated by tyranny. Even as the war neared its end and victory seemed assured, optimism mingled with doubt; and several very different ideas about the nation, the world and the future seized the American imagination. Fifty years later, many of those ideas seem relics of a more innocent time. But perhaps for that very reason, they resonate still in the stories World War II veterans tell about themselves, and in the imaginations of their children and grandchildren.
FEW AMERICANS WHO GAVE SERIOUS THOUGHT TO WHAT THE WAR had been about could avoid feeling profound anxiety in 1945, as they contemplated the beginning of the postwar era. World War II had revealed a human capacity for evil and destruction that exceeded even the darkest assumptions of previous eras. It had been a war against militarized tyrannies, a war to stop nearly a decade of brutal, naked expansionism. It was a war to avenge what Franklin Roosevelt called the "dastardly" Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. And gradually, as news of the Holocaust had filtered out of Europe to an incredulous world, it became for some Americans a war against genocide, against a madness so terrible that many people, even when faced with incontrovertible evidence of its existence, found the knowledge of it unassimilable. 
 How could anyone absorb such horror and not fear for the future of mankind? A world that could create so terrible a war, a world that could produce Auschwitz and Dachau, the Katyn Forest, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a world capable of such profound evil and such inconceivable destruction: it was necessary, some men and women now began to argue, to regard such a world suspiciously, even fearfully.
For some Americans, those fears led to an increased skepticism of the power of government -- a skepticism driven by the kind of state power that in Germany, Italy and Japan had produced tyranny, war and genocide. Many liberals continued to argue that an active government need not lead a nation down so dark a path. But others were less certain. In 1944, the Austrian-emigre economist Friedrich Hayek published "The Road to Serfdom," a stark warning against any increase in the powers of government (including, he made clear, the New Deal reforms of the 1930's). For any such increase, he argued, represented a step toward fascism. "It is necessary now," he wrote in his impassioned introduction, "to state the unpalatable truth that it is Germany whose fate we are in some danger of repeating." "The Road to Serfdom" was a major best seller. Not unlike Allan Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind" decades later, it captured some of the popular anxieties of its moment.
Less conservative figures rejected the starkness of Hayek's warnings. But they, too, were suddenly racked with doubts. Among them was the great liberal theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. "The rise of totalitarianism," he noted somberly late in the war, "has prompted the democratic world to view all collectivist answers to our social problems with increased apprehension." Hence "a wise community will walk warily and test the effect of each new adventure before further adventures."
For some, the lessons of the war included a deeper challenge to one of the nation's oldest faiths. Americans, they argued, must resist the temptation to think of themselves in their hour of triumph as a chosen people. No nation could afford to revel too much in its own virtue because in doing so it might ignore the darkness near the center of its (and every society's) soul. Niebuhr spoke for many liberals when he wrote of the dangers of "a deep layer of Messianic consciousness in the mind of America" and warned of liberal culture's "inability to comprehend the depth of evil to which individuals and communities may sink, particularly when they try to play the role of God in history." Americans, he said, would do well to remember that "no nation is sacred and unique. . . . Providence has not set Americans apart from lesser breeds. We too are part of history's seamless web."
But Niebuhr's statement was obviously meant to refute a competing assumption. As it suggests, there were also very different cultural forces at work in America during World War II. The war, after all, had been that rare thing in American life: a universally shared experience, a truly collaborative, collective effort (perhaps the nation's last) that had engaged the energies of almost everyone and had propelled the nation to victory and prosperity. As terrible as they knew the war itself to be, the men and women who remained in the United States -- thousands of miles from the fighting and the death -- drew considerable satisfaction, even joy, from their experiences in the war years.
They did so in large part because the war had brought an end at last to the Great Depression and had ushered in a great economic boom that would last, with only a few interruptions, for 30 years. The vast productive power of the United States supplied its own armed forces and those of its allies with airplanes, ships, tanks and ammunition. It fed, clothed and housed the American people. And it helped feed, clothe and house much of the rest of the world as well. Alone among the major nations, the United States faced the future in 1945 with an intact and thriving industrial economy.
Abundance created a striking buoyancy in American life during the early 1940's. Suddenly, people had money to spend again and -- despite the many shortages of consumer goods -- at least some things to spend it on. The theater and movie industries did record business. Resort hotels, casinos and race tracks were jammed. Advertisers, and at times even the Government, exhorted Americans to support the war effort on the grounds that victory would insure a future of material comfort and consumer choice for themselves and their children. "Your people are giving their lives in useless sacrifice," The Saturday Evening Post wrote in a mock letter to the leaders of wartime Japan. "Ours are fighting for a glorious future of mass employment, mass production and mass distribution and ownership." Even troops at the front seemed at times to justify their efforts with reference to the comforts of home more than to the character of the enemy or the ideals America claimed to be defending. "They are fighting for home," the writer John Hersey once wrote from Guadalcanal (with at least a trace of dismay), because "home is where the good things are -- the generosity, the good pay, the comforts, the democracy, the pie."
And yet, as Hersey's assessment suggests, abundance was not necessarily the enemy of idealism. Democracy, he argued, was part of the mix. In the 1930's, the fear was often voiced that democracy had exhausted itself because it had failed to produce the economic success on which a good society depended. By 1945, democracy had become America's central "fighting faith," triumphantly vindicated by prosperity and prepared to take on new challenges, both at home and abroad.
NOWHERE WAS THE CONFLUENCE OF ABUNDANCE AND democracy clearer than in the experiences of African-Americans during the war. Prosperity transformed the economic circumstances of many black men and women; the war -- and its democratic rationale -- transformed their expectations.
Nearly two million African-Americans left the rural South in the 1940's, most of them in search of the industrial jobs in the North that the war had helped produce. Among the results of this massive migration were new demands for racial justice. A. Philip Randolph's threat to stage a great march on Washington in 1941 spurred Franklin Roosevelt to create the Fair Employment Practices Committee, which sought to guarantee blacks access to jobs in war industries. But protests continued throughout the war. In Washington, Detroit and other cities, there were demonstrations against discrimination -- picketing, sit-ins, at times violence -- that anticipated the civil rights movement of the 60's.
Early in 1944, the publication of a remarkable book -- Gunnar Myrdal's "American Dilemma" -- helped galvanize the urgency of their cause. Myrdal, an eminent Swedish sociologist whom the Carnegie Foundation had commissioned in 1938 to supervise a major examination of America's "race problem," described the "American dilemma" in part as an economic problem -- the failure of American society to extend its riches to its black citizens. But it was also a moral dilemma -- a problem in the hearts and minds of white Americans, a problem born of the impossible attempt to reconcile a commitment to freedom and democracy with the willingness to deny one group of citizens a set of basic rights guaranteed to everyone else. In the shadow of Nazi tyranny, such a contradiction seemed to Myrdal -- and to many readers of his book -- especially glaring. "An American Dilemma" helped define a moment in history, and its reputation grew so rapidly that to many Americans, white and black, its findings soon came to seem almost unassailable. The war didn't provoke a stern resolve to address what most Americans still called "the Negro problem," but it altered the country's racial geography. A system of segregation and oppression that had been dismally stable for more than half a century would never be stable again.
IN MUCH THE SAME AMBIGUOUS WAY, THE WAR ENCOURAGED many women to question their place in American life. More than 4.5 million women joined the paid work force during World War II (raising the total number of working women by almost a third). Many of them took traditionally male jobs that were suddenly vacant as young men left the factories to join the military -- hence the famous image of Rosie the Riveter. And a lot of them found the experience transforming. In the absence of fathers, brothers, husbands and boyfriends, many women lived, worked and traveled alone for the first time in their lives. Some joined unions. Others wore uniforms. For some, it was an experience of unprecedented freedom; as a female aircraft worker later recalled, "It really opened up another viewpoint on life."
The popular folklore of the time depicted Rosie the Riveter as a woman pitching in to win the war but eager to get home to her family. In fact, most working women came to the end of the war determined not to resume a purely domestic life. Some lost their jobs when peace arrived and the men came home, but most of those who did looked for work somewhere else. The number of females in the paid work force never declined to its prewar levels, and it continued to grow throughout the 1950's and beyond.
The war created very different expectations among many men, especially those at the front -- expectations that they would return to a world where things were more or less the way they had been before. Fighter pilots gave their planes female names and painted bathing beauties on their fuselages. Sailors pasted pinups inside their lockers; infantrymen carried them (along with pictures of wives, mothers and girlfriends) in their knapsacks. Such images were not just a reflection of desire. They were a reflection of how many soldiers and sailors wanted to remember home.
The most popular wartime female icon was Betty Grable -- five million pictures of her found their way into the hands of fighting men by 1945. She was a mildly erotic figure to be sure. But as the historian Robert Westbrook has noted, she was not really a sex goddess. In her films, she generally played wholesome, innocent young women, the kind any guy would want to marry. And she became a model at the front for the supportive, nurturing girlfriend or wife many servicemen dreamed of finding on their return. After she married the bandleader Harry James and had a child in 1943, the men at the front seemed to find her even more appealing. When John Hersey compiled his list of the comfortable images that motivated many G.I.'s to fight ("the generosity, the good pay, the comforts, the democracy, the pie"), he might well have added another: the image of a world of traditional heterosexual romance.
THE WAR INSPIRED A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN DREAMS OF NEW freedoms and comforts at home. Among some men and women, it inspired a vision of a world made over in the American image. Despite the warnings of Niebuhr and others of the dangers of self-righteousness, World War II greatly reinforced the vision of America as a special moral force in the world; America as a country insulated from the sins and failures and travails that affected other nations, standing somehow outside of history, protected by its own strength and virtue. "America stands at this moment at the summit of the world," Winston Churchill told the House of Commons as the war neared its end. Walter Lippmann wrote at about the same time: "What Rome was to the ancient world, what Great Britain has been to the modern world, America is to be to the world of tomorrow."
World War II did not create those beliefs. They are as old as the nation itself. But the American experience in the conflict, and the radically enhanced international stature and responsibility of the United States in the aftermath of the war, gave them new strength. Bringing American values and institutions to the world became, for some, a crusade -- as vital to the future as the war itself.
It was not just the contrast between America's democratic potential and the autocracies of Germany and Japan that shaped these expansive visions. There was also a strengthened sense that the United States -- triumphantly prosperous, anointed by victory -- had something worth sharing with all nations, a unique commitment to freedom and justice that could serve as a model for the rest of the world. Certainly that was the message of Henry R. Luce, the crusading founder and publisher of Time and Life magazines. In 1941, Luce published a small book titled "The American Century." In it, he sketched a picture of the nation's destiny that only slightly exaggerated what would come to be, by the late 1940's, a widely shared and increasingly powerful view -- a vision in which American abundance and American idealism seamlessly merged. The American century, Luce wrote, "must be a sharing with all peoples of our Bill of Rights, our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, our magnificent industrial products, our technical skills." For "we are the inheritors of all the great principles of Western civilization -- above all Justice, the love of Truth, the ideal of Charity."
Luce's language may have been bombastic, but the ideas he expressed -- the belief that America had a postwar mission and special virtues worth sharing with other peoples -- penetrated deep and helped reconcile many Americans to the crusading international role that victory had thrust upon the nation.
In the glow of that victory, in the sense of old orders shattered and a new world being born, came an era of exuberant innovation, an era in which, for a time, nothing seemed more appealing than the Modern, the New. The allure of the new was manifest in the confident vision of architectural modernists, whose controversial legacy is so much a part of the postwar American landscape. It was manifest in the explosive growth of the innovative and iconoclastic American art world, which made New York in the 1940's and 1950's what Paris had been in the 19th century: the capital of international art. It was manifest in the increased stature and boldness of the American scientific community, and in the almost religious faith with which Americans welcomed technological progress.
And it was manifest in the way it excited, and then frustrated, a generation of American liberals imagining new forms of progress and social justice. For out of the war they brought, and sustained for 20 years, a commitment to a new political order. Wartime abundance, they believed, had vindicated Keynesian economics -- the alluring conviction that governments could sustain prosperity and economic growth indefinitely through enlightened use of their fiscal powers (spending and taxation) rather than by intervening directly in the affairs of capitalist institutions. Liberals also envisioned an abundant nation expanding and perfecting a generous welfare state to redeem the blighted lives of those cast aside by capitalism's imperfections. Such visions found only limited popular sympathy in the turbulent and divisive years immediately following the war. But they survived to become the basis of some of the great, and now controversial, liberal crusades of the 1960s.
In 1943, the poet and war administrator Archibald MacLeish gave a speech at Berkeley in which he expressed something of the extravagant hopes embraced by so many men and women of his time. He described the "Unimagined America," the new society the war was encouraging Americans to create:
"We have, and we know we have, the abundant means to bring our boldest dreams to pass -- to create for ourselves whatever world we have the courage to desire. We have the metal and the men to take this country down, if we please to take it down, and to build it again as we please to build it . . . to brighten the air, to clean the wind, to live as men in this Republic, free men, should be living. . . . We stand at the moment of the building of great lives, for the war's end and our victory in the war will throw that moment and the means before us."
In retrospect, of course, it is easy to see the many flaws in these expansive visions of a new postwar world: the dangerous arrogance they at times helped create, the reckless and at times disastrous experiments they helped launch, the intractable problems they helped bring to the surface and then proved unable to solve. But it is also difficult to look at today's world -- a world of diminished expectations and profound cynicism -- without finding something appealing about the brief and admittedly deceptive moment when large numbers of Americans, at the close of the most catastrophic war in human history, found it possible to believe that a brave new world was at hand.

RULE OF THE BONE
By Russell Banks.
390 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $22. 
ERNEST HEMINGWAY'S famous mot regarding "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" -- that all modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain -- is no less apt for being an overstatement. In its pioneering of the vernacular first person, its search for authentic American experience among the dispossessed and traditionally voiceless and its use of comedy to bring home grim realities in ways that gravity cannot, "Huckleberry Finn" is a bantamweight story with a heavyweight's impact. Of the many writers working in the great tradition today, one of the best is Russell Banks. In novels like "Affliction" and "Continental Drift" Mr. Banks has deepened Hemingway's investigation of American maleness, lending a voice to working-class fathers who want to be "good" men but are reduced, by economic brutalities and some essential rage riding on the Y chromosome, to bad ones. Now, in "Rule of the Bone," his 12th book, Mr. Banks has returned to the source of sources and reinvented "Huckleberry Finn."
The narrator of "Rule of the Bone" is not a river rat but a mall rat, a boy named Chappie from Au Sable Forks, N.Y., who sports a nose ring and a Mohawk and tells his story in underpunctuated deadpan sentences: "Anyhow my life got interesting you might say the summer I turned 14 and was heavy into weed but I didn't have any money to buy it with so I started looking around the house all the time for things I could sell but there wasn't much." In his parents' closet, Chappie finds a cache of old coins that he can pawn in small batches. It's a teen-age weed fiend's dream, but, as he sadly admits, he's a clumsy thief. His mother and stepfather throw him out of the house, and he embarks on a lowlife tour of upstate New York, dealing dope at the local mall and hiding out with a brutish motorcycle gang called Adirondack Iron. Mr. Banks has the milieu down cold. "I can hear Megadeth thumping through the walls," Chappie says, "and I can smell dope smoke and pizza and can hear the refrigerator being opened and closed and the top-popping of beer cans. Adirondack Iron is having its breakfast."
Chappie shares with his precursor Huck Finn an abusive (step)father, against whom his only defense is to harden himself into a criminal. He shoplifts and trespasses, indulges in some random vandalism and (in a pinch) helps steal a truck; he is also, like Huck, presumed dead for a while. Skipping town, he has himself tattooed with a crossbones and rechristens himself Bone. This is potentially a Beavis and Butt-head moment, but Mr. Banks is so sure of Bone's voice that he can instill silly posturing with the poignancy of an adolescent groping for an identity.
Rewarding his loyal readers, Mr. Banks weaves into "Rule of the Bone" the fishing boat from "Continental Drift" and the school bus that crashed in "The Sweet Hereafter," a bus now inhabited by a pair of crackheads who claim to be the brothers of the girl who was crippled in the accident. Returning to this bus after various adventures, Bone encounters the novel's Jim character, a runaway migrant farm worker from Jamaica who calls himself I-Man. Bone and I-Man make a home in the bus, with a kitchen garden and a cash crop of cannabis, and it's here, as Mr. Banks trades the aimless fun of the picaresque for the moral responsibilities of the Bildungsroman, that the story flags a little. The genre dictates that Bone learn lessons from I-Man, and although Mr. Banks is too good a novelist to dehumanize I-Man with saintliness, the reader may squirm at the alacrity with which Bone embraces the manners, the philosophy, even the cooking, of the old Jamaican. In these middle chapters, Bone verges on the naive sanctimony of white Rastafarians who have found a Better Way.
Fortunately, I-Man's homesickness propels the story southward to Jamaica, where drug dealing, sex and violence re-energize it. Along the way, Bone sneers at American vacationers who are "too scared of black people to buy ganja from them," and you wonder if the author, whose knowledge of backwoods Jamaica is obviously firsthand, isn't sneering a little himself. More bravely than almost any other contemporary writer, however, Mr. Banks is wrestling with what it means to be a white man in a multicultural world. A central insight of his oeuvre is the kinship of frustrated Snow Belt whites with desperate black Caribbeans, and in "Rule of the Bone," by reinterpreting Twain, he extends that insight to the whole tangle of race relations in America: the evil isn't whiteness but the white political economy, and the abuse of any child, black or white, is tantamount to slavery. This may sound somewhat heavy, but for the most part the book itself is not. Mr. Banks is a mythmaker who understands that before a myth can matter it has to entertain.
"Rule of the Bone" invites comparison not only with "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" but also, somewhat unflatteringly, with "The Catcher in the Rye." Bone is more generic and less funny than Holden Caulfield, and unlike Holden, he displays an odd immunity to pop culture. It's as if J. D. Salinger registered 40 years in advance a commercialized teen-age reality that Mr. Banks himself shies away from. Mr. Banks also falls short of Mr. Salinger's artistry in filtering acute psychological observation through vernacular distortion. But the comparison is not entirely fair. In his social and economic privilege, Holden Caulfield is so familiar to educated readers that Mr. Salinger can afford the luxury of subtlety. Bone, on the other hand, has had as little exposure to "sivilization" as Huck Finn did, and in order to rescue him from muteness Mr. Banks is compelled, a la Twain, to place him in fantastic situations. If the resulting story seems unrealistically bleak and its hero incompletely lovable -- if you balk at the unrelenting depiction of white adults as selfish, cruel and criminal -- it's worth remembering that for kids like Bone the state of innocence to which Holden longs to return has never been an option; they would be happy to meet adults whose worst sin is phoniness. Intoxicating and unsparing, "Rule of the Bone" is a romance for a world fast running out of room for childhood.
 
 
 
Just Another Dropout
 My stepfather probably thanks to my mom decided not to let the cops put me away for my Christmas shoplifting so long as I didn't try to move back in with them again, which was funny since the cops'd signed me over to my parents in the first place only on condition that I move back with them and take eighth grade over. The new rule was basically don't bother your parents and don't bother the cops or one of them will sic the other on you. All I had to do was stay out of the way of both and not flag either by going back to school who didn't want me anyhow. Which wasn't hard because they both tended to look in the other direction when they saw me, my parents on account of my bad attitude and drug use . . . and the cops because as a criminal I was more trouble than I was worth, just another homeless stoned dropout dealing small-load boom to the locals.
But even the cops know that a little weed can't hurt anybody. Most of them when they bust you are only trying to score for themselves anyhow and once they take your stash if you lick their boots and promise never to smoke reefer again so long as you live and thank them for saving you from a life of drug addiction and criminality they keep your drugs and let you go. Unless they're after you for something else you're not worth the paper work. I've learned that's generally true of life, if you're not worth the paper work adults won't hassle you. Except for the truly dumb and the nut cases of course, people who act on principle. They'll hassle you. From "Rule of the Bone."

HEADLINE: Rent Control Process Sets New Emphasis on Landlords' Needs

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
In past years, the annual ritual of setting rents for New York City's rent-stabilized apartments has gone something like this: A rancorous crowd of tenants and landlords loudly plead their cases before the nine-member Rent Guidelines Board, which then adopts rent increases loosely based on the last year's changes in landlords' operating costs.
But last week, the board deviated from the usual script, proposing to increase the rents of tenants in the cheapest apartments by a higher percentage than those of tenants in more expensive apartments. 
 The board member who proposed the increases, Barbara Gordon-Espejo, said she was prompted by the agency's research, which suggested that many landlords of low-rent buildings were under the greatest financial strain. With poor tenants and little rental income, she argued, higher rent increases were needed to insure that the landlords did not abandon their buildings, causing a housing crisis.
The board will meet two more times before voting on Ms. Gordon-Espejo's proposal. But the fact that the plan is even being suggested reflects the increasing difficulty of keeping rents affordable while giving landlords sufficient rental income to keep buildings in good repair.
Beyond that, her proposal is yet another sign of the board's wavering support of the present system of rent control.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, remains firmly committed to rent regulation. "The Mayor has supported rent control in the past and that support continues," said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor. "'He believes rent control serves as protection for fixed-income people who would be hurt by its elimination."
Rent protection has always been sacrosanct in a city in which nearly 70 percent of the residents are tenants. But in the last two years, the State Legislature and the City Council have reduced those protections for apartments that rent for more than $2,000 a month and whose tenants make $250,000 or more a year.
And on less expensive apartments, even some advocates for the poor acknowledge that rent rules intended to keep low-income tenants in their homes are worthless if their landlords cannot make enough to operate their buildings.
"This is an economic fact," said Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit community preservation, research and advocacy organization. "There is no point in putting regulations on landlords that they cannot meet. You will ultimately lose housing."
In the past, Mr. Braconi said, challenging rent regulation by elected officials has been tantamount to political suicide. But recently, more and more people have argued that rent regulations keep rents artificially low, leading strapped building owners to neglect or even abandon their properties.
"The difference between then and now," he said, "is that the ravaged neighborhoods and disasters of the 60's and 70's are clear evidence of the consequences of ignoring this economic fact."
Mr. Braconi said that between 1963 and 1978, an estimated 400,000 apartments were either lost to fire or abandoned. Mr. Braconi said that he supports changes in the rent regulation system, but that he believes some form of rent protection is needed.
The proposal given initial approval by the guidelines board last week calls for rent increases of 4 percent on one-year lease renewals and 8.5 percent on two-year leases in apartments renting for less than $400 a month. Landlords of these apartments would also be entitled to a $15-a-month surcharge for each apartment.
Apartments renting for more than that would be allowed increases of 1 percent on one-year leases and 2 percent on two-year leases.
The increases would cover nearly a million leases signed between Oct. 1 and Sept. 30, 1996. Last year, the board voted to allow increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for two-year leases for rent-stabilized apartments, the smallest increase in 25 years.
The board's proposal comes as there are mounting indications of a housing crisis on the horizon. The most telling sign, housing experts say, has been the sharp rise in the number of apartment buildings defaulting on their property taxes in recent years. Tax delinquency, they say, is often the first signal that a building is vulnerable to abandonment.
But a more graphic reminder of the fragile state of some buildings was the collapse in March of a decrepit Harlem apartment building. The collapse, which killed three people, was blamed on a crack in one exterior wall. The building had been all but abandoned by its owners, and had deteriorated to the point where it was barely habitable.
Edward Hochman, chairman of the Rent Guidelines Board, said the board needed to address the problems distressed landlords are having.
"We can no more discount the difficulty of operating housing with very low rents than we can discount the difficulty some tenants will have paying increases," said Mr. Hochman, who was appointed to the board last year by Mayor Giuliani.
Ms. Gordon-Espejo, an appointee of Mayor David N. Dinkins, based her recommendation for the two-tiered rent schedule on a study that showed that on average, it costs landlords of rent-stabilized apartments $396 a month to operate one apartment. According to the United States Census Bureau's 1993 Housing and Vacancy Report, about 212,000 apartments in New York City rent for less than $400 a month.
But it is far from certain that the two-tiered system will go into effect. Some board members have signaled their opposition to the proposal in their initial vote, in which the measure passed by 5 to 2, with two abstentions. The board will not take its final vote on the matter until June 26.
Tenants and their advocates are certain to challenge the board's proposal fiercely at hearings June 19 and 22. William Rowan, of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenant advocacy group, said he will present evidence showing that many tenants paying less than $400 a month are already paying more than 30 percent of their income in rent -- a figure economists say should be the maximum.
Mr. Rowan faulted the two-tiered proposal. He said the guidelines board's own study found costs for operating and maintaining buildings increased last year by one-tenth of one percent.

HEADLINE: Republicans Warn Russia That Deal With Iran Threatens Aid

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
As President Clinton prepared for summit talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin, Republican leaders warned today of "catastrophic consequences" for United States aid to Russia if Moscow goes ahead with plans to sell nuclear technology to Iran.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Russia's insistence on selling Iran light-water nuclear reactors and equipment useful in making bomb-grade material threatened to jeopardize relations between Moscow and Washington. 
 "Unless the Russians are prepared to accept very, very severe safeguards to insure that it's only a reactor for power purposes, that none of the raw material can be used to make a bomb, that there's very careful records kept and very careful inspections, I think that this is a very serious problem," Mr. Gingrich said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
"I'm not prepared to say today what we would do, but I think it would have catastrophic consequences in the Congress."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, left no doubt that the Senate would swiftly re-examine American aid to Moscow if President Clinton failed to win assurances from Mr. Yeltsin that the deal would be canceled or modified.
"It would be almost immediate," Mr. Dole said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
"Congress is a little leery of aid right now in any event, and with Chechnya and other problems that Russia's had," Mr. Dole added.
Without Moscow's acquiescence, Mr. Dole said, "it's going to really cool relations with Yeltsin, with the Russian Republic."
The comments from the two senior Republicans came on the eve of Mr. Clinton's departure for Moscow, where he is to join more than 50 other world leaders on Tuesday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany. He is to meet with Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday to discuss the Iranian deal and Chechnya, as well as Russia's concerns over plans to expand NATO.
In recent days the Administration has expressed serious concerns over Russia's nuclear deal with Teheran, and made it a top priority in this week's talks. "If this sale does go forward, Russian national security can only be weakened in the long term," Mr. Clinton said tonight in remarks to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
Russian officials say there is no reason to object to the agreement because Iran has signed the treaty to prevent the spread of atomic weapons and permits international inspectors to examine its nuclear installations.
In his remarks, Mr. Clinton said disputes over Iran's nuclear program and Russia's fighting in the breakaway region of Chechnya were disagreements that must be handled "openly, constructively and resolutely."
"I believe Russia has a powerful interest in preventing a neighbor -- especially one with Iran's track record -- from possessing these weapons," Mr. Clinton said.
But the Administration has shied away from threatening to cut off foreign aid. Indeed, in his remarks, President Clinton pledged to nurture ties with Moscow despite the agreement with Iran. "Crises come and go," he said. "But interests endure."
"We must not hold our relationship hostage to any one issue," he said.
On Saturday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggested that Russian aid was imperative, regardless of what Moscow does on the Iran-nuclear issue. "Every bit of aid we give them is in our interest," Mr. Christopher told CNN.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Welfare: Interstate Migration -- A special report.;
Larger Benefits Lure Chicagoans to Wisconsin

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
In its heyday of counterculture chic a generation ago, the streets of this Wisconsin capital pulsed with protesters demanding a fair share for America's poor people and its racial minorities.
Yet the profile of the city itself was not exactly proletarian: overwhelmingly white, highly educated and relatively affluent. Madisonians might have been champions of the downtrodden, but they were rarely their neighbors. 
 In recent years, however, issues of race and poverty have become a bit less abstract here, as a small but growing number of poor Chicagoans are fleeing gang-torn neighborhoods and moving the 150 miles to Madison for better schools, safer streets and, some of the newcomers acknowledge, more generous welfare benefits.
"It's not the only reason I came," said Austina Moore, 26, who moved here from Chicago last fall with her four young children, and later persuaded her mother, Hester Moore, who is also on welfare, to follow them. "But it sure helps to get $200 more a month."
She now receives $708 a month, and the cost of living is generally lower in Madison than Chicago.
The influx of poor people from Chicago is testing this city's historical liberalism. About one-quarter of the 3,300 Madison families receiving welfare are former Illinois residents.
Even Mayor Paul Soglin, who earned his liberal stripes in the anti-establishment politics of the 1960's as a leader of Vietnam War protests, now talks of "finite limits of resources" for the poor. He warns against "the duplication of old ghetto neighborhoods" with the same problems that families came to Madison to escape.
"We're like a lifeboat that holds 12 people comfortably," Mr. Soglin said. "We've got about 16 in it now, and there's a dozen more waiting in the water. Since we're already in danger of going under, what can our community be expected to do?"
Despite benefit levels that have been frozen for nearly a decade and eligibility rules that have been tightened under Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, assistance checks for the poor in Wisconsin are still about 40 percent higher than in Illinois. A family of four living in poverty in Wisconsin is entitled to $617 a month while the same family would receive $414 in Illinois.
Some experts on poverty say migration of welfare recipients would increase sharply under the Republican plan in Congress to replace the main Federal program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, with a system controlled by the states.
Under the current A.F.D.C. program, the Federal Government pays about half the benefits, at levels set by the states. Already the payments vary; for example, in Mississippi the amount is $120 while New York pays $703.
In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani drew criticism last month when, in defending welfare cuts, he suggested that lower payments might persuade some welfare recipients to leave the city.
Under a block-grant system approved by the House of Representatives, the Government would give the states lump sums for welfare, to be spent as they saw fit. Many experts say this system could widen the differences in benefits because states would have more freedom to set eligibility criteria and benefit levels.
"States that are concerned about welfare migration now, just wait," said Thomas Corbett, associate director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. "They'll really be concerned under the block-grant system."
Governors are already trying to throw up fences to reduce their states' appeal to welfare migrants. In Connecticut, for example, Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, has proposed slashing benefits and adopting the toughest eligibility requirements in the country to discourage poor people from moving there.
Newcomers to four Wisconsin counties, not including Madison's, are only eligible for aid at the level paid by their former state for six months. After that, they receive the same rate as other Wisconsin residents.
A vibrant economy in Wisconsin surely accounts for much of the migration among poor people, most of them looking for jobs. The state's unemployment rate has dipped below 4 percent while that in Illinois is 4.4 percent.
In Madison, it is less than 2 percent, the lowest of any large city in the United States. That has put pressure on the city's employers to raise wages. Even fast-food restaurants are advertising jobs at $6 and $7 an hour, plus benefits.
But Mr. Thompson insists that many poor people are coming to the state principally for welfare. "If you don't think so, just look at the statistics," he said.
Since Mr. Thompson took office in January 1987 and began efforts to trim the welfare rolls, the number of recipients has dropped nearly 25 percent, to about 75,000. In one program, now being tested in two counties, welfare benefits end after two years.
Mark Rom, the author of "Welfare Magnets: A New Case for a National Welfare Standard" (Brookings Institution, 1990), said most studies have found that such migration "is real, but is quite modest." Decisions to move are "as complicated for poor people as they are for rich people," he said, and rarely boil down to a single factor.
"But while there is some disagreement among social scientists about whether this kind of migration exists," Mr. Rom said, "there is no doubt among state legislators that it is real. Under the block-grant program, states will trim benefits to make sure they're not any more generous than their neighbors, worried that they'll be seen as welfare magnets."
One terminus for newcomers here, the Broadway-Simpson neighborhood, is one of the city's poorest, but its rows of tidy brick apartment buildings would never be mistaken for a rough section in Chicago. Nonetheless, some gang members and drug dealers have settled among the families that came here to flee such problems.
"This was our neighborhood before the gangs and drugs took it over," declared the hand-printed sign in a neighborhood center here, written by 9-year-old Keisha Robinson. "And we want it back." Next to the message, someone has written in large letters: "Now!"
While the migration of poor Chicagoans has brought some problems, it has also brought redemption for many families that had once virtually given up on life.
Cindy Wells, 37, recalled hearing gunshots every day in her South Side neighborhood in Chicago, where her three young children were not allowed to play outside, and where she said she watched a police officer take a bribe from a drug dealer in broad daylight.
Ms. Wells, who had been on welfare when she arrived in Madison eight years ago, said a network of charitable organizations and social service agencies helped her get squared away. She was given temporary housing in the Y.W.C.A., furniture, clothes, food and transportation vouchers for the children to get to school.
"People in Madison smiled at me, shook my hand, answered my questions," she said. "For once, I could walk the streets without wondering, 'Who is going to jump me? Who is going to beat me up?' "
Within a couple of months, she got a job working with poor children. And today, her family is thriving. Her eldest son, Irwin, 16, an honor student at James Madison High School, was recently awarded a college academic scholarship.
"I blossomed here," said Ms. Wells, an ebullient woman in dreadlocks and a "Beverly Hills 90210" sweatshirt. "I became a whole person."
But Ms. Wells said she planned to move out of her apartment complex and into a nearby town house because drug dealers in her building had created an unsavory atmosphere. She said her children had complained of headaches from the stench of marijuana and crack.
She said that when she told a man smoking crack in the hallway to have the decency to go inside his own apartment, "he spit in my face."
Groups of former Chicagoans, intent on preserving the good life in Madison, have established support groups like the Moms of Simpson Street. The Simpson Street group holds festive dinners to honor men in the community, like police officers, teachers and ordinary fathers, who are good role models.
One of the best things about life in a place like Madison, many of the newcomers say, is that ill-mannered behavior is not tolerated. "It's strict up here," said Ruthie Debrow, a former Chicagoan who moved here on welfare and now works for a social service agency, "and the young people learn that in a hurry." She added, "If a kid gets into trouble, you can be sure the social workers are going to be coming to the home, asking, 'Now what's going on here?' "
The police say keeping a lid on trouble is easier in a smaller city like Madison, with a population of about 190,000, which is not overwhelmed by crime. Selling drugs on street corners might be considered old hat in Chicago, officers say, but it is not tolerated in Madison.
Dorothy Doheny, a police officer here, said one young drug dealer had asked incredulously, "For just one rock of cocaine, you're going to throw me in jail?" The officer replied, "Yep."
Ms. Wells, among other newcomers, said she would never consider returning to live in her old home town: "I only go back to Chicago for funerals."
 
RETHINKING WELFARE
Block Grants
 
THE GOAL -- Block Grants, or lump sum Federal payments made directly to the states, would gove more states control over Federal aid to low-income people without the bureaucratic strings attached in Washington. House Republicans say a block-grant system would control costs and rein in the growth of entitlements.
 
THE PROPOSALS
 
HOUSE PLAN
Under a welfare bill passed by the House, Federal entitlement program including family assistance and school lunch subsidies would by replaced by block grants that states could use as they wished to aid the poor. The money would be earmarked for specific purposes, but states would be able to set benefits and eligibility criteria.
 
GOVERNORS PLAN
Republican governors say the House bill would still impose too many restrictions on them. It would, for example, set a five year limit on Federal welfare payments to a family and would bar the use of Federal money to provide cash assistance to unmarried teen-age mothers. The governors have devised an alternative proposal that would give them more say over eligibility rules. They would also replace the food stamp program, which the House bill would keep at the Federal level, with block grants.
 
EFFECT ON STATES -- Some governors fear that under the House proposal many poor people would be out of luck if demand for services outran a state's grant or if state officials were unable to administer such complicated programs. Some critics also fear that the money would not be evenly distributed among the states.

German Central Bank Chief Urges U.S. to Act on Dollar
 The dollar is not going to rise against the Japanese yen or German mark, according to Hans Tietmeyer, the head of the Bundesbank, until the currency markets see President Clinton and Congress taking steps to reverse the United States' declining savings rate and to reduce the budget deficit. 
 Mr. Tietmeyer also said that the current American economic performance did not justify the roughly 12 percent fall of the dollar against the mark this year. "It is not only the presence of the current deficit that seems to concern the markets, but also the prospect for the future," he said. D2.

What of Chad? And the Ratings?
 Soap operas once ruled the daytime, but televised trials, talk shows and specialized cable channels now vie for the same audience. The biggest single cause of the soaps' recent ratings slippage has been the addiction to the O. J. Simpson trial. In the first three months of 1995, at least a million fewer households tuned in to 'All My Children,' 'As the World Turns' and 'The Young and the Restless' than in the similar period a year ago.

Coast Air Shuttles a World Apart
 On the West Coast, $69 fares are being offered for flights between Los Angeles and Oakland, a distance of more than 300 miles. But to go the roughly 250 miles between New York and Washington, a traveler pays $147, despite the competition from Amtrak. And it does not seem to bother the airlines running Northeastern shuttles that ridership has dropped by roughly a quarter since 1987. D3.

HEADLINE: On Philippine Ballot Today, Well-Worn Names

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: MANILA, May 7

 BODY:
When Filipinos vote on Monday, they will face a ballot that resembles both a social register and a rogues' gallery, a reminder of how name recognition can mean much more than anything else in this country's messy democracy.
For Senate, the candidates include Ferdinand (Bong Bong) Marcos Jr., son of the late dictator; Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan, a former army colonel who was implicated in several coup attempts, and Rosemarie (Baby) Arenas, a socialite who does not hide her close friendship with President Fidel V. Ramos and who is often called the Second Lady. 
 Certainly the best-known candidate seeking election to the lower house of Congress is Imelda R. Marcos, the widow of Ferdinand E. Marcos. Mrs. Marcos is almost certain to win the race in Leyte, her native province, despite the widespread assumption among Filipinos that she helped her husband loot the Philippine treasury of billions of dollars. She is now appealing a conviction here on graft charges.
Although more than 17,000 races are being contested across the country, the most important are those in the Senate, where the outcome could determine the fate of Mr. Ramos's three-year-old economic-reform program. In the Senate races, voters are asked to select 12 names from a national list of candidates.
While the economic reforms have brought billions of dollars in foreign investment to the Philippines, opposition candidates assert that the investment has meant little for the tens of millions of Filipinos who live in dire poverty.
Recent opinion polls suggest that the President's supporters should add to the 17 seats they now hold in the 24-member Senate, a gain that would be a relief to Mr. Ramos because his personal popularity has plummeted in the furor over Singapore's hanging of a Filipino maid in March.
The maid, Flor Contemplacion, is described here as a martyr to the cause of more than two million Filipinos who are forced by poverty to work abroad. Many Filipinos blame the President for not having done enough to save her from the gallows in Singapore, where she confessed to two murders.
Opposition candidates have tried to capitalize on the hanging at the expense of Mr. Ramos.
But if polls are right, the issue will not result in many new Senate seats, if any, for the opposition. Mr. Marcos and Mr. Honasan no longer seem assured of victory in their races. That Mrs. Marcos, her son and Mr. Honasan could get this far would seem to support the idea that in Philippine politics, memories are remarkably short and that ideology and political parties count for little.
Mrs. Marcos and her son spent most of the last decade in exile in the United States, while Mr. Honasan, 47, spent several years on the run for his part in the coup attempts against Mr. Ramos's predecessor, Corazon C. Aquino.
Political scientists say the willingness of voters to forgive these once-vilified figures can be explained by the relative youth of the electorate: the voting age is 18, with millions of voters living on remote islands in an archipelago nation.
Mrs. Aquino, who led the popular revolt in 1986 that overthrew President Marcos, has become a chief sponsor of a movement called Never Again, formed to stop Mr. Marcos and Mr. Honasan. She argues that they have already proved to be a threat to democracy here.
As for Mrs. Marcos, it is not clear that she would be allowed to take her seat in the next Congress because the national elections commission ruled last month that she had failed to satisfy a residency requirement.
The election is seen as the last formal referendum on the presidency of Mr. Ramos, who is barred by the Constitution from seeking a second six-year term.
Before the furor over Mrs. Contemplacion's hanging, Mr. Ramos was hugely popular among Filipinos and had predicted that his candidates would win all 12 of the Senate seats available in the Monday election. But he is now saying his supporters will take at least 5 seats, the number needed to secure passage of his economic program.

HEADLINE: Shuttles in Northeast Keep Fares Up and Thrive

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
America's two coasts have always seemed like worlds apart. Their air shuttles make it more so.
On the West Coast, the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation and Southwest Airlines are fighting it out with $69 fares for so-called walk-up passengers who want to fly between Los Angeles and Oakland, a distance of more than 300 miles. Even after a $10 increase last month, the price of a one-way shuttle ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco is $99. 
 But to go the roughly 250 miles between New York and Washington, or New York and Boston, you pay not less, but more -- $147 to be exact -- despite the competition from Amtrak. And it does not seem to bother the airlines operating the Northeast shuttles that ridership has dropped to slightly more than 3 million last year from a peak of 4.2 million a year in 1987. Indeed, on average the East Coast shuttles are less than half full each flight.
Normally, keeping the fare high -- it is twice what it was in 1987 -- is not the way to win back disaffected passengers. R. E. G. Davies, for one, curator of air transport at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington and the author of 12 books on world transport, should be a natural shuttle passenger. But he takes the train when he travels to New York.
"It's easier to write or read proofs on the train," he said, "and you don't lose productive time in traffic jams, checking in, and not having enough elbow room once you're aboard. Besides, it's cheaper."
Teleconferencing and other stops along the electronic highway could further erode the shuttle business, but both Delta Air Lines and USAir -- the current competitors on the Northeast shuttle -- are not budging.
Why?
One reason is that more than 80 percent of their passengers are business travelers, whose employers or clients often pick up the tab. Another is that the limited number of takeoff and landing slots at LaGuardia Airport in New York and National Airport in Washington insulates the two airlines from additional competition.
"Because of the limit on slots, the shuttle's effectively a duopoly," said Lee Howard, president of Airline Economics Inc., a consulting company in Washington. "So why should they get in a cat fight when they're both doing well? It isn't like the West Coast shuttle, where anybody can go into that market." (The West Coast shuttles operate among many more airports.)
In the Northeast, Delta and USAir can count on passengers like Hartmut W. Stauss. A divisional vice president for Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, Mr. Stauss takes the shuttle from New York three or four times a month to check on Hyatt hotels in Washington and Boston. He has been doing this for more than five years.
"It's not as comfortable as the train," he said, "and there always seems to be a traffic jam or some other delay. But the shuttle frees you from schedules and timetables, because you don't have to be at the gate by a certain time." After all, Delta flies on the half-hour and USAir on the hour.
Not engaging in price wars means that while Delta lost $159 million last year, its shuttle operation may have earned as much as $20 million, Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley, said. USAir lost a whopping $685 million in 1994, but its net shuttle income was $4.4 million for the first nine months of the year, according to estimates by Avitas, an aviation consulting firm in Reston, Va. According to the Air Transport Association, the airline industry has lost $13 billion since 1990, much of it from heavily discounted fares.
In addition to their 64 scheduled daily flights, both the Delta and USAir shuttles continue to keep standby crews available for the many unscheduled planes they roll out during rush hours for passengers who could not get seats on crowded scheduled flights. In Delta's case, that has been as many as 22 added flights in a single day.
Each shuttle also regularly adds "enhancements" -- amenities and services to set it apart from its rival.
In September, for example, Delta added Starbucks coffee both inflight and at the terminals. Passengers may use Delta cellular phones for the day, paying only for their phone calls. Delta is installing new self-ticketing machines at its three shuttle terminals, machines that will issue tickets in 30 seconds instead of two minutes. Later this month, it plans to issue to 5,000 shuttle customers a credit-card-size Smart Card with an imbedded computer chip that enables the user to make reservations, bill his or her credit card, get a receipt and earn frequent-flier miles.
In November, USAir began offering a special coffee blend of its own. In January, it introduced ticketless travel. It is also experimenting with an in-flight system that will allow passengers to shop, make hotel reservations and play video games.
Neither shuttle thinks it can raise fares as high or as fast as it wants, despite increased costs. "Our $147 fare has been stable since September 1993," said Terry Hallcom, president and chief executive of the USAir Shuttle. "We've been lucky that fuel costs have been relatively stable, but we've had increases in rent and permits and landing fees."
Both shuttles operate at airports where parking space is inadequate and fees are sky high, and they contend with total costs that are almost three times the industry average. Moreover, the shuttles' load factor -- the total number of seats occupied by paying passengers -- averages only about 46 percent, almost 20 points below the industry's overall break-even threshold.
But in some respects, Delta and USAir have an easier time of it than their near counterparts on the West Coast. (On the West Coast they do not roll out extra planes when the scheduled flights are full.) The West Coast shuttle route stretches from Phoenix to Seattle. For flights between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, there are six airlines from which to choose.
With the West Coast's dearth of business travelers, said Ed Scerbo, an industry analyst in Arlington, Va., "business travelers get the benefit of lower fares, but Southwest really positioned its low-cost fares on the West Coast as an alternative to driving." The Northeast, on the other hand, offers many transportation alternatives, including Amtrak's 36 daily roundtrips between New York and Washington that include 17 Metroliner express trains that reach Penn Station in New York from Union Station in Washington in less than 3 hours.
USAir is so optimistic about its shuttle service that it hopes to exercise its option next year and buy the shuttle from the group of banks that owns it. The bank group had financed Donald J. Trump's $350 million purchase of the former Eastern shuttle in 1989, then acquired the Trump Shuttle two years later when the cash-short Mr. Trump stopped paying interest on the debt. In April 1992, USAir paid $16.2 million to manage and operate the shuttle for five years, with an option to buy at the end of four and a half years.
"The shuttle has met all our expectations to date," said Seth E. Schofield, chairman and chief executive of USAir. "The opportunity to acquire it is a high priority for USAir."

HEADLINE: U.S. Policy a 'Betrayal,' Cuban Exiles Protest

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 7

 BODY:
The anger is unmistakable. In news conferences, on picket lines and in caravans, groups of Cuban exiles have been lashing out at the United States for negotiating with Cuba and then deciding to send back all future illegal refugees leaving the island.
At a demonstration on Thursday, one sign read: "Bay of Pigs, Part II." 
 "The betrayal continues," said Jose Miro Torra, a veteran of the Bay of Pigs, the 1961 failed invasion of Cuba. Mr. Torra said that exile groups were planning a strike that he said would "paralyze" Miami and a march in Washington to "recover the dignity of the Cuban people, which has been trampled on."
But if the loudest voices heard in reaction to the American policy reversal were familiar, coming from conservatives for whom any deals with Fidel Castro amount to treason and the repatriation of Cubans to murder, there is also a softer but steady rumble from Cuban Americans who agree to talk to Cuba, who hope negotiations go beyond immigration issues to normalization of relations, who call the hard line against Castro a failure.
They include people like Nati Morales, 28, a mixed-media artist born in Philadelphia of Cuban parents who went to the island for the first time last summer to bring pain killers to an older relative who had fallen and broken her hip. On her visit, she says, hardly anyone talked about the political situation or even mentioned Fidel Castro. They were just hungry, she said.
"If this is the means to an end and if the end is to end Castro's dictatorship, then it's great," Ms. Morales, who lives in Miami, said of the Clinton Administration's new policy on Cuban refugees. "If that's the dead end, then that's pathetic and in line with previous policies in that it doesn't do anything."
Cubans in the United States speak with one voice on certain points, like opposition to Mr. Castro and Communist rule and support for human rights groups on the island, opinion surveys show. But the spectrum of views widen significantly on what to do to quicken the pace of bringing democracy to Cuba.
A Florida International University poll last month of 1,500 Cubans in Florida's Dade County and in Union City, N.J., found that a strong majority -- 63 percent of respondents in Dade County and 79 percent in Union City -- favored negotiations to facilitate peaceful democratic change in Cuba. But the same poll found that more than half also favored military action by the exile community and even an American invasion of Cuba.
Researchers said that although seemingly contradictory, the answers reflect an openness to consider a variety of options, preferably a stick-and-carrot approach. They said that age, time in exile and even location had been factors in the responses. Those most likely to support negotiated solutions were younger, had arrived since the 1970's and lived in New Jersey, where more Democrats were found, despite a Republican majority among respondents. There is a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent for the Dade County sample and plus or minus 4 percent for the Union City sample..
The differences in opinion were in evidence last week when Attorney General Janet Reno announced that while most of the 21,000 Cuban refugees held in camps at the American naval base in Guantanamo Bay would be allowed into the country, those leaving the island illegally from now on would be intercepted and returned to Cuba.
The decisions came after meetings with Cuban Government officials in order to control a migration characterized by periodic massive waves of Cubans -- more than 30,000 last summer alone -- leaving for Florida in rafts and boats. The United States would still grant 20,000 visas to Cubans each year.
While news of the release of the Guantanamo refugees was widely welcomed, the policy of intercepting rafters sparked a furious reaction in some quarters. The Cuban American National Foundation, the leading conservative exile organization, immediately withdrew 15,000 sponsors it had recruited to take over resettlement expenses for the Guantanamo refugees, saying the Federal Government should pay for a decision it made without consulting exiles.
A few hundred people protested at the Port of Miami today, sporadically disrupting traffic. City Manager Cesar Odio defended the acts of civil disobedience, comparing Fidel Castro with Hitler.
Brothers to the Rescue, a volunteer pilot group that spots rafters for the Coast Guard, says it will no longer report sightings unless the refugees themselves consent.
"If the Coast Guard picks you up it is possible that you would be returned to Cuban authorities," reads a flier to be dropped to the refugees, or rafters. "If you want us to alert the Coast Guard, wave your arms. If not, stay motionless when we fly by again."
Some experts said the new policy cuts through the heart of an exile community that identifies the evils of the Castro Government with a sense of urgency in leaving the island. Many would never buy into the idea that worsening economic conditions is what has driven many of the rafters to the seas, they say.
"It's really a difficult situation for the hard line in the exile community," said Max Castro, a sociologist with the University of Miami's North-South Center who came here from Cuba as a child. "They only had one ally in the world and that was the United States."
But almost as quickly, a national coalition of Cuban groups called the Cuban-American National Alliance said it would take over efforts to find sponsors and refugee assistance. And in interviews since the Administration chipped away at the special status Cubans have enjoyed for three decades as political refugees, many Cuban Americans say they see the policy changes as positive.
Alfredo G. Duran, a Miami lawyer, former chairman of the state Democratic Party, is a member of the board of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, a coalition of "moderate and progressive" business executives, academicians and other professionals who favor talks with Cuba.
"If they give the 20,000 visas, which has never happened, the policy establishes an orderly immigration process that prevents more deaths near Florida," Mr. Duran said. In the long run, he said, "it internalizes the opposition in Cuba."
"Now the regime's opponents will have to solve the nation's problems internally," he said.
Many Cuban-Americans said the Administration should next rescind restrictions imposed last year on travel and cash remittances to Cuba, then move toward easing the trade embargo, to allow exports of food and medicine and commercial and cultural exchanges that they say would force Cuba to change quicker than punitive measures would.
A widespread concern is whether the Cuban Government can be trusted not to take reprisals against the repatriated, and whether those with valid cases of persecution would be given political asylum. Ms. Reno said that persons with "a genuine need for protection" would be "examined before return."
The first 13 Cubans to test the policy were picked up at sea late Wednesday by a cruise ship and were turned over to the Coast Guard late Friday night. After more than 30 years of unconditional welcome in the United States, most Cubans here find repatriations hard to stomach.

HEADLINE: U.S. Savings and Deficit Key to Dollar, German Says

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 7

 BODY:
The head of Germany's central bank, in his most pointed remarks to date on the prospects for the beleaguered dollar, said it would not rise against the Japanese yen or German mark until the markets were convinced that President Clinton and Congress were taking steps to reverse the United States' declining savings rate and reduce the budget deficit.
"The problems for me are clear," said Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the reserve bank, widely known as the Bundesbank. "Low savings ratio, relatively high budget deficit, no absolute assurance it will come down in the long run, and a high net debtor position" on the part of the United States. "These are the points that have to be addressed." 
 Mr. Tietmeyer said the current American economic performance -- low inflation, moderating growth and a soaring stock market -- did not justify the roughly 12 percent fall of the dollar against the mark this year. But, he added, currency speculators were no longer basing their buy or sell decisions just on current economic factors.
"It is not only the presence of the current deficit that seems to concern the markets, but also the prospect for the future," Mr. Tietmeyer said. "The markets seem to think that there is not enough correction on the way, as far as these fundamentals are concerned. The markets of today are more and more looking to the future, more than just the present."
When they look there, he said, they seem to be seeing no change but an increase in American indebtedness.
Mr. Tietmeyer spoke extensively about his views on the dollar and the recent gyrations in world currency markets in an interview in his office late last week. He said he would not comment on specific American legislation. But he was not shy in criticizing the United States for making little progress in finding a long-term way of bringing down future deficits.
His remarks followed by a little more than a week a tension-filled meeting in Washington of the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of Seven industrial nations. The falling dollar has driven the cost of German and Japanese exports up, causing outcries by industries in those countries. Others in Europe blame the weak dollar for dragging down currencies like the French franc, Italian lira and Spanish peseta. Thus, almost all of Washington's major trading partners are calling for corrective action that would bolster market confidence.
Criticism of American policy has been particularly sharp from Germany, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Mr. Tietmeyer have repeatedly pointed at American policy and said it was coming up short.
Mr. Tietmeyer said there was no coordinated plan on the part of the German Government to criticize Washington, but he conceded that he did not remember such outspoken criticism from Germany of American policy since the early 1980's, when the deficit ballooned under dual Reagan Administration policies of tax cuts and a military buildup.
"I am not interested in interfering in the policy of the United States," he said. "I am only saying that it is important to understand what are the problems behind the dollar's low value, and that the markets are not only looking at the present problems but they are looking always at what will happen in the future."
President Clinton took a somewhat different tack last month in responding to questions on the dollar's troubles at a televised news conference. "In the present climate," he said, "the ability of governments to affect the strength of their currencies may be limited."
"The United States does want a strong dollar," he continued. "We believe in the importance of fundamentals in our economy. We believe in getting the deficit down, getting jobs up and pursuing a responsible course. We do have an interest over the long run in strong currency. But we have to look at it, for Government actions need to be directed toward long-term fundamentals, sound economic policies, sound growth policies, sound investment policies."
Mr. Tietmeyer and his Bundesbank colleagues are amply familiar with criticism of their own monetary policy. Frequently in 1992 and 1993, the central bank, the most powerful in Europe, came under bitter charges that it was keeping interest rates so high that this hindered economic recovery in Europe. The bank developed a reputation as a cold, heartless organization, unmoved by complaints from weaker European economies that its policy promoting a powerful mark was creating unemployment outside Germany.
Yet it is such discipline that has earned the bank, and the German mark, such credibility among international investors that in times of uncertainty, many of them buy the mark as a safe-haven currency.
Mr. Tietmeyer, though characterized as stiff and heartless, gave the opposite impression, as he rested his large frame on a sofa in his office in the bank's headquarters here -- one leg propped up, clearly relaxing. He laughed as he reminded an interviewer that he was not about to comment on what he thought the real value of the dollar should be against the mark.
And he repeated several times that "every country has to take care of its own currency," and that a strong dollar was in the interest of the United States as well as the rest of the world, since most nations stored their excess cash in dollars.
But time and again, he emphasized that currency markets were looking more at prospects two to three years from now. And he pointed to two events in recent months when the markets seemed to believe that there was little hope of the United States' moving to end growing deficits.
One was Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in February. Mr. Greenspan indicated that the Fed might not have to raise interest rates and that with signs of a weak economy, might indeed be moved to cut rates. The other came on March 2, when the Senate failed to approve a balanced-budget amendment.
Mr. Tietmeyer said that vital to reducing the United States debt would be promoting higher savings by Americans. Private households save only 4 percent of the gross national product, compared with 12 percent in Germany and 17 percent in Japan. Because of the low savings rate, the United States is much more dependent on foreigners' buying its debt paper, and is thus more subject to swings in market sentiment.
While he would not predict when or if the markets would shift more in favor of the dollar, he said he believed that the Clinton Administration had finally accepted that the dollar needed to be strengthened.
"I believe that the United States Administration now has a clear policy of saying that it is interested not in a weak dollar but a strong dollar," Mr. Tietmeyer said. "I think the Administration knows that it is in the interest of the United States to have a strong dollar. This is important to say, but convincing the markets cannot be done only by statements. The markets are looking at what are the policy decisions behind those words."

HEADLINE: Rich Life Style and Looted Church;
Ex-National Episcopal Treasurer Plans to Make Restitution

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

 BODY:
Before the scandal, Ellen F. Cooke, former treasurer of the national Episcopal Church, and her husband, the Rev. Nicholas T. Cooke 3d, an Episcopal priest, paid nearly $1 million for an 18th-century house with a wraparound porch and five fireplaces in Montclair, N.J., and a 23-acre vacation farm in a peach orchard in the Virginia countryside. Thousands more went into a new kitchen for the Montclair home and for tennis courts and a new 140-foot dock on a river flowing by the honeysuckle patch at the edge of the Virginia farm.
"Everybody said they must have had an awfully big congregation -- they had so much money," said M. S. Harcum, a neighbor in the sleepy hamlet of Ottoman, Va., about 90 miles east of Richmond. "I couldn't get any masonry or woodwork done, they kept everyone so busy." 
 But the money the Cookes spread among the craftsmen of Virginia, among other places, came from $2.2 million that church officials say Mrs. Cooke, 50, looted from the church treasury from February 1990 to last January.
The church's Presiding Bishop, Edmond L. Browning, said last week that outside auditors had found that Mrs. Cooke "systematically diverted" the $2.2 million, much of it from the Bishop's discretionary accounts.
Bishop Browing said he had not decided whether to press charges against Mrs. Cooke but would "cooperate with the appropriate authorities in any investigation that may ensue."
In a letter released by her lawyer, Mrs. Cooke said she planned to make restitution and was receiving psychiatric help. "In the psychiatrist's opinion, I experienced a breakdown precipitated by many factors external to me and related to the workplace." Mrs. Cooke's husband, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, told his congregation at St. John's Church in McLean, Va., at services yesterday that he would resign at the end of the month.
Church officials and parishioners expressed shock and anger at what they called Mrs. Cooke's betrayal. They said it was particularly galling that she led such a grand life style while helping to arrange staff reductions and other cuts in the national budget in recent years. Since 1991, the Episcopal Church has had to cut its national budget by several million dollars and its national staff by a third, to 200 people.
"While we're cutting staff and budget, she's putting in a tennis court at the Virginia farm and adding a guest house," said James Solheim, a church spokesman.
Over the five years cited, Mrs. Cooke, who is listed with her husband in the Social Register, often indulged in limousines and bought lavish gifts for her staff at Episcopal headquarters in Manhattan, including cut-glass bowls and glass apples, church officials said. Church funds, they said, paid these bills.
Church money also is said to have gone to private school tuition for her two teen-aged sons by her first husband, also an Episcopal priest, and for airline tickets for friends visiting Virginia from the New York area. And church officials said there were purchases of clothing and jewelry, including a $16,000 Tiffany necklace.
Friends in Montclair, acquaintances in Virginia and Mrs. Cooke's brother all said they had thought the opulent life style was rooted in old family money, shrewd investments or comfortable Episopalian salaries. (Mrs. Cooke was paid $125,000 a year as church treasurer before her forced resignation early this year, and her husband about $70,000 as rector at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Montclair before he transferred to the McLean church.)
Apparently, few eyebrows were raised at Manhattan headquarters about the Virginia spread and the Cookes' move a year ago to the fancy Montclair home. The Virginia farm cost the Cookes $500,000 in July 1991, and the Montclair home, just up Union Street from St. Luke's, cost $465,5000 in March 1994, records showed. A building permit on file in Montclair's Town Hall put the price of the Montclair kitchen renovation at nearly $38,000.
Bishop Browning, once one of Mrs. Cooke's most ardent supporters in the power politics at church headquarters, now says his trust was betrayed. The Rev. John S. Spong, Bishop of the Diocese of Newark, who is a family friend and frequent dinner guest at the Cookes' Montclair home, said the same thing in a meeting last week with about 150 parishioners at St. Luke's. He asserted that Mrs. Cooke was a skillful and deliberate embezzler.
"The church has lost a lot of intregrity, the church has lost trust," Bishop Spong said. "People are disillusioned and we'll pay for that in a thousand ways."
Father Cooke's former parishioners at St. Luke's were stunned and angry and some called for criminal charges against Mrs. Cooke. One woman said criminal prosecution "helps get you on the road to redemption."
"I don't disagree," Bishop Spong said.
Mrs. Cooke's parents, Evelyn and John, were "floored" by the accusations, said her 42-year-old brother, Kevin Gerrity, associate editor of The Kansas City Business Journal.
"They're extremely proud of her," Mr. Gerrity said. "They could always point to Ellen. They could say, 'Look at what she's accomplished for the Episcopalian Church.'
"If it's true she took all that money, it's a mind-blower," Mr. Gerrity added. "I don't understand why."
In a statement issued through her lawyer, Plato Cacheris of Washington, Mrs. Cooke said she would make full restitution. She contended, however, that some of what the church called $325,000 in improper charges on her corporate credit card were justified business expenses.
Her statement said an Episcopal priest now counseling her stressed "the truth of my inappropriate and wrong response to the situation in which I found myself." Mrs. Cooke said the priest, who is a woman, "has also helped me acknowledge the pain, abuse and powerlessness I have felt during the years I have worked as a laywoman on a senior level at the church headquarters."
Colleagues at the Manhattan headquarters and ranking church officials elsewhere disputed Mrs. Cooke's comment about powerlessness. In fact, they said, she had considerable power, as both treasurer of the national church and chief administrator of day-to-day operations at the headquarters, and exercised her authority vigorously.
"She was tyrannical," said a top-ranking female official who asked to remain unidentified.
Others who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Mrs. Cooke enjoyed the confidence of Bishop Browning, who hired her as national treasurer in 1986, and also named her administrator, a position customarily filled by a bishop.
Amid deepening staff unrest last fall, Bishop Browning decided to seek Mrs. Cooke's resignation, officials said. When she agreed to step down in late January, the church said she was leaving because of her husband's transfer from Montclair to St. John's Church in McLean.
The real reason for the departure, the Bishop disclosed, was that "her working style did not serve our common mission."
The $2.2 million in diversions was uncovered, the church said, only after Mrs. Cooke improperly took $86,000 in back pay and unused vacation on her departure. An accounting firm, Coopers & Lybrand, found she had switched $1.5 million that was to have been deposited in church accounts in a bank and brokerage house into personal accounts she kept at the institutions, the church said. In addition, it said, she wrote $225,000 in church checks to third parties for nonchurch purposes and piled up $325,000 on church credit cards.
The diversions went undetected for years, Bishop Browning's statement said, because Mrs. Cooke had "absolute control" over auditing at the headquarters and prevented others from checking the books.
Church officials said they expect to recoup the lost money with a $1 million insurance policy and the sale of the two homes. The Cookes have surrendered titles to both. The Montclair home is on the market for $695,000 and the farm for $850,000.
As the church tries to recover, some at headquarters say they are wondering how well they really knew Mrs. Cooke. Her resume says she graduated from Georgetown University in 1969 with a degree in economics. But Georgetown officials say they have no record of her attending the university.
Officials at George Washington University say she was enrolled in its business school in the summer of 1962 and during the 1962-63 academic year but left without graduating.
The oldest of six children, Ellen Fahey Gerrity was raised in Vienna, Va. In 1967, she began two years of part-time work in the business office at the Washington Cathedral, the main church of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. In 1969, she became business manager of the church's school, the National Cathedral School.
She left that job in 1971 and married an Episcopal priest, William C. Koch. In 1973, Father Koch became rector of All Saints Church in Brookline, Mass. In 1977, his wife began working for the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts and eventually became its assistant treasurer from 1980 to 1986. While she was there, her two sons, Michael and Jamie, were born.
In the mid-1980's, the couple divorced. Mrs. Cooke apparently met her current husband when she was working for the Massachusetts Diocese and Mr. Cooke, a Richmond native and a lawyer, was a seminarian at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge.
After his ordination, Father Cooke was assigned in 1983 to a parish in Alexandria, Va. In early 1986, she left the Massachusetts Diocese to become assistant treasurer briefly of the Diocese of Virginia.
That fall, Presiding Bishop Browning named her the church's national treasurer and she transferred to Manhattan. Two years later, in 1988, Father Cooke was transferred from Alexandria to Montclair.
Two years after that, the suspected diversions started.
Father Cooke has not been officially implicated, but church officials say they want to question him about sloppy bookkeeping of about $64,000 Mrs. Cooke is believed to have transferred to a St. Luke's fund that her husband maintained without any independent oversight. One person was paid $17,000 of that money, and Bishop Spong said he wanted to know why.
During their summer and holiday visits to the Virginia farm, the Cookes were casual and chatty and they fit in comfortably with local residents.
"Everybody worked and got paid, and that's all that was said," said Sammy R. Berry, 42, a painter who lives next to the farm. "Some people you work for, they're fussing all the time -- you can't suit them to save your life. The Cookes were the nicest people you ever want to meet."
The couple became so impressed with a local cabinet maker, John Bielo, 55, that they rented him a car to drive to Montclair so he could do carpentry work in St. Luke's rectory, he said.
Sometimes, Mr. Bielo recalled, Mrs. Cooke came home from Manhattan stressed out from work. "She'd make dinner for everybody," he said, "or we'd go out to eat, and then she'd be in her office working when I'd go to bed at 10."

HEADLINE: Dorothy Whipple, 94, Doctor Who Advanced Women's Rights

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.
Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929. 
 "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."
As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."
She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."
Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.
In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.
In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."
In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."
The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.
Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Taxes a Hard Sell in Orange County

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., May 4

 BODY:
Before he goes to bed at night, Bill Mello sets up his personal computer, and while he sleeps, it sends out fax after fax urging voters to reject a sales-tax increase on a special ballot in Orange County next month.
As the head of the Committees of Correspondence, a local anti-tax coalition that takes its inspiration and its name from the organizers of the Boston Tea Party, Mr. Mello is part of a broad-based movement propelled by a mix of fiscal conservatism and outrage as Orange County struggles to overcome bankruptcy. 
 After chipping away at a $1.7 billion deficit with plans for layoffs, asset sales and privatization of some county services, a proposed increase in trash-dumping rates and several other measures, the five county supervisors last month took what had seemed a politically unthinkable step and put on the ballot for June 27 a measure to increase the county's sales tax by a half cent, to 8.25 percent.
The move initiated a political campaign that goes to the soul of this wealthy and conservative county where low taxes are an article of faith and politicians who advocate tax increases rarely last long.
"When did you ever hear of taxes going up and prosperity following?" asked Anita M. Mangels, a political consultant who is not a participant in the tax campaign but who expressed serious doubts about the measure. "They have got to convince people that it's a good idea to give more money to the same people that lost it the last time, and that's a hard sell."
One leading proponent of the tax is Sheriff Brad Gates, who has stepped into a leadership vacuum and spends much of his time arguing for the tax increase at various forums around the county.
"Basically, we are all angry," he said at a recent luncheon of business leaders here. "Everybody is angry, including Brad Gates. It's O.K. to feel angry. But we do have a $1.7 billion hole we have to fill. We have to pay off our debts. That's the reality."
The sometimes complacent affluence of the county was shattered last Dec. 6 when Orange County declared bankruptcy, becoming the biggest public body ever to seek protection from its creditors. Together with some 200 other local government entities including cities, school districts and public utilities, the county had placed some $7.6 billion in the county investment pool.
Last Thursday the former county treasurer, Robert L. Citron, pleaded guilty to six felony counts of defrauding investors after employing a high-risk strategy with the pool that included heavy borrowing to buy rate-sensitive derivative securities. When his bets on stable or lower interest rates crashed, the county lost $1.7 billion in investments.
At the luncheon at a hotel here, near the John Wayne Airport, which the county is now struggling to find a way to sell, opponents of the tax argued that it was a quick fix that ignored deeper problems with county management.
"They are rushing to the altar of new taxes to get things behind us as fast as they can," argued Bruce W. Whitaker, a consultant who is active with the Committees of Correspondence. "This offends the sensibilities of taxpayers: there apparently is no Plan B."
On this, Sheriff Gates agreed. "I'm telling you there's only one plan, and that's the one we have on the table. There's nothing else we've got on the table to solve the problem."
One question neither side seemed to be able to answer clearly was what would happen if the sales tax failed. The county faces a deadline this summer to pay $1.1 billion on its bond debt and to find a way to prevent broad layoffs among teachers.
Sheriff Gates warned that if the county did not pay its debts promptly it would find it prohibitively expensive to borrow in the future, schools would face painful cutbacks and vital services including public safety and health care would suffer.
Mr. Whitaker argued that the county was underestimating the amount it could recover in a suit against Merrill Lynch, which advised Mr. Citron in his investments, was backing away from deeper cuts in government operations and was failing to push privatization of services and sales of assets.
Independent analysts agree that the sales-tax measure faces an uphill battle. "It is a huge challenge for the proponents of a tax increase, within a very short period of time, to convince voters that they ought to go against their basic instincts," said Mark Baldassare, a professor at the University of California at Irvine. In a county that is 55 percent Republican, he said, voters are hearing a "counterintuitive" message from their party leaders, many of whom are advocating the tax increase at a time when Republicans in Sacramento and Washington are pressing an anti-tax, small-government message.
In a poll he conducted a month ago, soon after the ballot measure was announced, Mr. Baldassare found that 57 percent of potential voters opposed the sales tax increase, with just 36 percent in favor and 7 percent undecided. The margin of error of the poll was plus or minus 4.5 percent.
Tellingly, older voters, who are the ones more likely to vote in a small-turnout special election, were even more strongly opposed to the tax, Mr. Baldassare said.
With the campaign just getting under way, the momentum still seems to be with the anti-tax forces.
Hugh Hewitt, a radio and television commentator who strongly opposes the tax, said a major problem for the pro-tax campaigners was that despite the immensity of the county's bankruptcy, people here still live well.
"It's been six months, and people are still not seeing doom and gloom," he said. "They are not feeling the pain. So why tax themselves?"

HEADLINE: Cars, Trade Sanctions, and a Legacy of Frustration

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur touched off the United States' half-century of troubles with Japan over automobiles, banning the sale of Fords and Chevrolets there in the early years of the American occupation, in the hope that excluding competition would speed the rebuilding of the country's shattered domestic industry. It worked.
Richard M. Nixon was the first President to try to undo the damage, forcing the Japanese to allow American automobile companies to invest in Japan, even though most of them were hardly interested at the time. 
 During the next quarter-century, cars came to symbolize the frustrations in trying to manage trade conflicts between the world's two largest economies, a deficit that refuses to shrink no matter how much Japan argues that its markets are opening and no matter how much Detroit says it is learning to make products that suit Japanese tastes.
Today, as President Clinton met with his top economic advisers at the White House to draw up a final list of sanctions to announce against Japan later this week -- including tariffs that could double the price of everything from a Lexus to Japanese-made engines -- he found himself battling habits that have changed little in half a century.
But as his economic advisers are quick to acknowledge, the current argument is as much about exasperation as it is about exports. Mr. Clinton came to office determined to coax along the reformers in Japan, convinced that he could solve the problem by helping the Japanese fix their system.
He has just about given up, and he finds himself returning to pressure tactics -- relent in a month's time, he says, or suffer the tariffs -- that the Japanese say remind them of MacArthur's mandates about how to run their economy. Such demands, they say pointedly, no longer work.
Mr. Clinton, they maintain, is violating all the free-market principles he espouses, trying to micro-manage trade down to telling Toyota how many American-made parts they must buy. Washington shoots back that every other approach has failed, and that the Japanese are hardly suited to lecture anyone on the evils of managed trade.
"They are not only being hypocritical," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, the other day. Noting that Japan had in the past agreed to restrict exports to the United States and Europe, he added, "They are being inconsistently hypocritical."
After 20 months of fruitless talks, Mr. Kantor insisted, Washington was driven to threaten retaliation. "We're not going to settle for something nice sounding that doesn't solve the problem," he said.
It is a move that is taking Japan somewhat by surprise, because all the usual warning signs were missing. Almost no one in Congress, the usual source of pressure to get tough with Tokyo, is focused on Japan these days. That usually happens when the American economy is in a downturn.
And while Detroit grumbles about closed markets, no one pretends that Japan remains at the center of the auto industry's Asia strategy. When Big Three executives fly across the Pacific these days, they usually bypass Tokyo and head for Shanghai and Beijing, where the race is on to build factories for the world's biggest untapped car market.
"You can build a whole plant in China for what it costs to open five new showrooms in Tokyo," a Ford Motor Company executive said recently.
So why bother? The answer, Mr. Kantor and others say, goes far beyond sending a message to the Japanese. The centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's international economic strategy has been encouraging free trade with the world's biggest emerging markets, many of which view Japan's development strategy in the 1950's and 60's -- absorbing technology and building networks of interrelated industries -- as their guiding star.
Forcing Japan to change habits that should have melted away decades ago sends a message, the theory goes, and makes it far easier to sell free trade to Americans who see it only as a threat to their jobs.
In fact, Mr. Clinton has relatively little to lose, save for the value of the dollar. Getting tough now helps pre-empt any political challenge -- in his party or from Republican challengers -- that his devotion to free trade is naive. The biggest risk is that the confrontation with Japan will send the yen soaring even higher, a problem that Washington would not welcome but that would put even more pressure on Tokyo because it makes Japanese exports more expensive.
The yen, of course, has made this an extraordinarily difficult time to get the Japanese to relent. Its strength has already sent Japanese car makers and their suppliers into the red, because they have decided that they must eat into profits rather than become uncompetitive. Some weaker members of the industry, like Mazda, are at risk of not surviving. Clearly all the auto makers could save money by buying American-made parts, which in yen terms are 16 percent cheaper today than they were at the beginning of the year.
But in Japan, such decisions are not dictated by price and never have been. The Japanese economy is relationship-driven, and its first priority is to preserve its own industrial base. So, in one of the great paradoxes of market economics, as American cars and parts become more competitive, it becomes more essential than ever, to the minds of officials in Tokyo, to assure Japanese manufacturers a sanctuary market.
Add to this a political factor: As both countries move gingerly toward the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, Japanese politicians stop and think whether it is a ripe time to be viewed as giving in to American pressure.
That is especially true for Mr. Kantor's chief negotiating opponent, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry. Mr. Hashimoto is a favorite of war widows' and veterans' associations. If he hopes to win the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party, and with it perhaps the prime ministership, standing up to American pressure may pay off.
But that is a risky strategy, as other Japanese politicians have found. Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the reformer on whom Mr. Clinton staked his early bets, gave the President the stiff arm -- on autos and other matters -- when they met in Washington in February 1994. He was briefly hailed for his gumption, then dumped a few weeks later, though for reasons unrelated to trade. "It was the right thing to do," Mr. Hosokawa said on a recent return visit to Washington. "If we are to deregulate our own economy, we can't be managing trade for Mr. Clinton. It makes no sense."
So Mr. Clinton is making a new bet -- that when the leaders of seven of the largest industrial economies meet next month in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Japan will see that it has little to gain from a long fight, and will relent.
"It's a good guess that this will follow the usual script," said Richard Samuels, who heads the Japan program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has tracked many battles over trade and technology. "But there is always a chance that this is the one they will decide has to be different. And maybe it will."

HEADLINE: Patents;
Guidelines Are Being Prepared to Evaluate Software, But Only If It Is Part of a Floppy Disk or a Computer

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
THE Patent and Trademark Office is looking anew at the way it judges software inventions.
The agency does not patent mathematical formulas, scientific principals, laws of nature or mental processes. And for a long time, computer software had been considered too close to mental processes. Software was treated like printed material that happened to be on a disk and not paper -- and, as such, not patentable. 
 But now the agency says that rulings last year in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the court that hears appeals of rejected patents, made it plain that software should be patented if it is part of a product like a floppy disk or computer. So for about a month the agency has been working on new guidelines for evaluating software inventions that it expects its examiners to be following by this summer.
"Software is such an important aspect of the country's economy today that we're taking the court's admonition," Nancy Linck, the agency's senior attorney, said. "The real change the guidelines will make is to provide protection for software programming as an article of manufacture, as in a floppy disk."
In other words, software may be patented, but not alone. Computer code, by itself, is still too abstract to win a patent. But software that causes computer hardware to perform a specific function is not.
"The software program itself has to be embodied in a tangible medium, like a floppy, that is useful, new and non-obvious," Ms. Linck said. "The real hard question is whether to limit it in some way to use. A mathematical algorithm in the abstract, even if it's embedded in a disk, may not be patentable."
The move to adopt new guidelines appears to fit neatly into Commissioner Bruce Lehman's plans to reshape patent rules and regulations to give American businesses a competitive edge in worldwide markets for high-tech products. And Ms. Linck said the agency's ideas had won support from the software industry.
But as late as December, the agency was still resisting software patents. It was in court then, defending its decision to deny a patent for data structure in memory -- a floppy disk, for example. The agency did not think the invention qualified.
"The Patent and Trademark Office attempted to reject the claims as not patentable," recalled Barry N. Young, an intellectual property lawyer from California who represented the inventor's appeal. "They said 'all you have is a memory with a data structure stored on it.' "
"They would not," he continued, "give patentable significance to that because that would give weight to the content, which would be analogous to patenting a book. We argued that the claims did not cover the content of the information, but specifically covered the data structure in terms of the hierarchy of elements."
The court agreed, and overturned the patent office's rejection of the patent. Ms. Linck said the ruling was a benchmark for the agency.
The ruling came after another case last fall "reaffirmed the proposal that when you put new software programming on an old computer, you make it into a new machine and therefore a patentable machine," Ms. Linck added.
The two rulings occurred as other court findings seemed to restrict the kinds of copyright protection available to software inventions. So just as it got harder to get a copyright, winning a patent became easier.
Some question whether any software is eligible for a patent just because it is embedded in a disk or a computer.
"Suppose you have information stored, something like an encyclopedia-type data base," Mr. Young said. "It has a flat structure; it's not hierarchical; it's only information in categories. That kind of arrangement of data is clearly not patentable."
The re-evaluation follows a couple of years of tumultuous software debate at the Patent and Trademark Office. A patent issued in 1993 to Compton's New Media created an uproar from software developers who argued that the technology was commonplace and complained that patent examiners did not know enough about software. The patent office agreed there was truth to that -- at the time of the Compton application, a degree in computer programming did not meet the agency's education requirements for examiners.
The firestorm compelled Commissioner Lehman to hold public hearings on software-related inventions and to order a re-examination of Compton's patent. The agency was deluged with advice and research material from people in the computer industry pointing the examiners toward proof that Compton's technology was in the public domain. As a result, the patent office voided Compton's patent.
The agency also started hiring computer programmers as examiners, and began to expand its library of software manuals, textbooks and reference materials. Then came the court rulings that software could be patented.
Specifics of the new guidelines have yet to be decided, but Ms. Linck said she expected they would at least make it clear that software was patentable when part of a floppy disk, a computer or as an element of a process.
Those are fairly broad requirements, and some skeptics have pointed out that such software could include music and literature on disk. But Ms. Linck said that at the very least the guidelines would make it impossible to patent songs or novels.
"Just how we will reject those claims isn't clear yet," she added. Ms. Linck said that when the guidelines were ready, they would be published in the Federal Register and the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office so that the public could comment on them.

HEADLINE: In New York, the Dying Days Of Expansive Government

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
For more than half a century, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, built New York City's government into the nation's most expansive, sheltering municipality, one that protected its citizens from some of the harshness of the free market and provided an array of subsidized services unavailable anywhere else.
But for several years, a growing chorus of fiscal analysts and public officials has warned that New York might no longer be able to afford the government it has built. They urged gradual and planned shrinkage because, as Eugene J. Keilin, the departing chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, put it, "decompression was better than the bends." 
 Now, however, change is coming, far faster than many people wanted or expected. All at once, three levels of government are rushing toward the same goal: a smaller, less ambitious, less expensive bureaucracy.
Congress, the Governor and the Mayor are all cutting spending and reducing or eliminating programs because each rejects the very idea of the welfare state. All see it as an anachronism that smothers private initiative.
And so, academics and economists say, no place is likely to face a greater transition than the city that built the prototype.
Indeed, while the debate about what is ahead is just beginning, and the ultimate shape of Federal, state and local legislation and budgets is still unclear, some economists are already speaking of New York City's future in phrases once reserved to describe Eastern Europe's bumpy transition from Communism to capitalism.
"In the long run, the lesson of the next few years may be that New York is simply not wealthy or economically vital enough to afford the extensive public sector that it has created over the post-Great-Depression period," the investment banking firm J. P. Morgan said in a recent report to investors in the municipal market. "But dismantling it will take time: the new financial plans share a brand of shock therapy that may not be acceptable to the public."
At Salomon Brothers, David G. Hensely, a vice president and regional economist, said that New York City needed to reduce taxes and the costs of doing business to become more competitive. But, he added, "I think the transition will be messy. There's also this big issue about the transition socially to a lower-government-service economy. People in the region are very accustomed to a high level of government service. I worry about how we make that sort of transition."
 
Welfare Pioneers
The City and State Created Public Aid
 In many ways, it was New York, both the city and the state, that pioneered modern government regulation, and the New Deal. The Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire in 1911, which saw women factory workers leap to their deaths because of blocked fire escapes, led to a host of labor and safety measures -- from the minimum wage to laws on working conditions.
Franklin D. Roosevelt created New York's first welfare program as Governor in 1931, six years before he told the nation in his second Presidential inaugural address that "the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little."
And now, 64 years later, the city's public assistance rolls are up to 1.1 million in about 300,000 families -- as compared with the 2.8 million people who are working.
Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, a Republican, built a vast network of public housing. Decades later, when the Federal Government stepped out of the construction of low-income housing, another Mayor, Edward I. Koch, a Democrat who liked to call himself a "liberal with sanity," stepped in, transforming acres of urban blight with 50,000 new houses and apartments.
The city that never sleeps has a 24-hour subway system, unlike those of Washington, Boston and Philadelphia. Its university system is larger than those of many states. The Health and Hospitals Corporation -- manager of 11 acute-care hospitals -- dwarfs any other municipal hospital system. New York's homeless are granted an unconditional right to shelter.
But after the Federal Government cut back aid to localities under President Ronald Reagan, and after the Wall Street and real estate boom of the 1980's ended in the stock market crash of 1987, dwindling tax revenues left the city with a structural deficit, unable to pay for the vast government it had built.
The last recession was so severe for New York that 580,000 jobs disappeared statewide, more than 300,000 of those in New York City alone. That was 10 percent of the city's job base. Since the recession ended, the state and city have lagged stubbornly behind as the nation saw a 6.2 percent growth in jobs.
City property tax collections not only stopped growing but started declining. Layoffs and shrinking bonuses on Wall Street depressed income tax levels. At the same time, city Medicaid costs have been growing at a rate of 10 percent a year, and the city's welfare population is hovering at a record high.
 
Equation of the 90's
Less Government Equals More Jobs
 Just as Washington is considering tax cuts, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have staked their economic policies on the presumption that the way to jump-start the economy is through tax reductions of their own.
"As we confront our state's fiscal crisis, let us remember a simple truth," Mr. Pataki said in his inaugural address. "More government means higher taxes and fewer jobs. Less government means lower taxes and more jobs."
Mr. Giuliani has focused primarily on reducing select taxes on businesses, Mr. Pataki on the personal income tax. To afford these tax cuts, they are shedding workers, making multimillion dollar reductions in subsidies to the city's mass transit system, cutting aid to education and higher education.
Congress, meanwhile, in a drive to cut taxes and balance the budget by 2002, will be reducing funding to the same programs. Although the battle over the Federal budget is just beginning, reaching the goal of a balanced budget would almost inevitably require millions, if not billions, of dollars in aid cuts to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the city hospital system, education, public housing and social programs -- just as both the Mayor and the Governor are pushing for cuts of their own.
When fully in effect in 1998, Governor Pataki's tax cuts, if not altered by the Legislature, would reduce state revenue by $6.8 billion, or 20 percent of the state's current budget. By 1999, the city's own tax cut program would amount to nearly $1.1 billion in lost revenue, or 3.5 percent of the city's proposed budget for fiscal 1996.
The gamble is whether the tax cuts will work to expand the economic base -- or simply require even further cuts in government. A debate is already under way among academics and public officials over how much local taxes actually spur the economy, and whether New York can achieve competitive advantage when everyone's cutting taxes.
 
Will Plan Backfire?
Cuts May Erode Quality of Life
 And there's another question: whether the cuts in city services will so erode the quality of life that employers will turn their backs on the city despite the tax cuts.
Mr. Keilin, the departing M.A.C. chairman, said, "It is not certain that lower taxes always produce a better business climate, but high taxes never do." He added, pointedly, "Good services don't always improve the economy, but poor services never help."
Mr. Giuliani's own budget, which his budget director, Marc V. Shaw, said reflected the most cautious scenario, forecasts only sluggish job growth for the rest of his term, with a net gain of 4,000 jobs in 1995 and an additional 9,000 in 1996. In 1997-99, it paints a more optimistic picture with an increase of 79,000 jobs.
Part of the reason for the low figures is that in the drive to reduce government spending, the city, state and Federal governments all are reducing their own work forces at the same time. Each of them also wants to cut poverty and health programs that have fueled specific growth areas in the city economy in recent years -- health care and social services employment -- even as they have been a rising burden to the city and state governments.
The Governor and Mayor say that New York has created a Medicaid system that is the costliest in the country, and both are trying to rein in Medicaid spending.
How this will affect health care employment in the city is under debate. The Giuliani administration projects a slowdown in the 8,000 to 10,000 jobs that would otherwise be created in the industry each year. The Greater New York Hospital Association predicts that 33,000 jobs could be lost this year if the Assembly agrees to Medicaid cuts backed by the Governor and the Republican-controlled State Senate.
Over the next five years, the association predicts that health care employment in the city would then grow by 22,400 jobs, far slower than if current programs were continued.
"Our expectation is that these cuts flatten the New York economy not only initially, but for a protracted period of time, well into the next century," said Kenneth E. Raske, the hospital association's president. He said that the job loss will get worse if Congress, trying to balance the budget by 2002, seeks deep cuts in projected spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly.
Donna Arduin, Mr. Pataki's first deputy budget director, said the administration had no projection of what would happen in the health care industry. "The first thing you can do is hope that the cut will force industries into creating efficiencies," she said. "We can only hope for the best there. Other industries have had to do it."
 
The Gap Widens
 Rich Get Richer And the Poor Don't
 Many of the people who are likely to lose their jobs hold low-paying positions with few benefits, including home care workers, nursing attendants and social service counselors. They will be looking for new employment at the same time that Federal, state and local cuts in welfare programs are being redesigned to push thousands of public assistance recipients into work.
In a variety of ways, if Mr. Pataki's proposals -- endorsed by Mr. Giuliani -- were enacted, the poor would find it harder to make it, particularly in New York City, where rents are high.
In a significant change in the state's welfare program for single adults, Mr. Pataki has proposed that recipients be allowed to collect benefits -- which average $325 a month -- for only 60 days, rather than the current unlimited time. Mr. Giuliani has said he would eventually like to see the program, under which about 240,000 people get aid in New York City, eliminated altogether.
The Governor has proposed cutting the basic welfare grant by $38 a month for a family of three. That would reduce the stipend from $577 to $539. For welfare recipients living in public housing or shelters, another $53 of the grant, which is designed for energy costs, would be cut.
Because the welfare grant is low enough to leave a family in New York City strapped for rent, the state has in the past paid a special supplement to families in the city facing eviction, to allow them to make up the difference between their welfare money and rent. The Governor has proposed ending the supplement, which averages about $250 a month for 20,000 families.
Mr. Giuliani has also started a more rigorous screening process for home relief applicants that has cut by 60 percent the number of people being accepted onto the rolls. He plans to put a similar screening process into effect in the summer for women applying for the main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
Further cuts in welfare programs are likely down the road, depending on the final shape of Federal welfare legislation. The House bill passed in March would give states more control of welfare policy but also cut projected spending on social programs by $69 billion over the next five years.
Will grant reductions prompt welfare recipients to work? When Michigan eliminated its general assistance program for single adults in 1991, only 38 percent of those dropped from the rolls found formal employment in the following two years, a study by the University of Michigan found.
What that could suggest is that the new government policies will accelerate the trend of the 1980's. Recent census data shows that during that decade, New York City went from 11th to 5th among cities with the biggest income gaps between rich and poor. New York State moved from fifth to third among states.
"This raises the whole dual city hypothesis," said Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-financed advocacy group on fiscal policy, "whether long term we will see a continuing trend in which a smaller and smaller share of New Yorkers receive a larger and larger share of income provided by the New York economy."

With Voice of Cuban-Americans A Would-Be Successor to Castro

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 4

 BODY:
In any debate about American policy toward Cuba, few figures loom larger than Jorge Mas Canosa, considered by many in both countries to be a principal architect of the hostile, uncompromising approach toward Fidel Castro that guided Washington until the Clinton Administration announced on Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with Havana on immigration.
Mr. Mas, a 55-year-old construction entrepreneur, came to Miami 35 years ago as a penniless refugee and has amassed not only a net worth of more than $80 million but also immense political power. Fourteen years after setting up the Cuban American National Foundation at the behest of the Reagan Administration, he is arguably the most influential of the nation's 1.5 million Cuban-Americans. 
 He has shaped the content of United States Government broadcasts to Cuba, has held unprecedented control over a Government-financed resettlement program for Cuban refugees, and, through three administrations, has found an open door both at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
When President Clinton announced reprisals against President Castro at the height of the Cuban refugee crisis last summer, Mr. Mas, a Republican, was quick to claim credit for the tough new stance. But when the Administration announced that Cuban boat people would henceforth be returned, it appeared to undermine Mr. Mas's position with the White House.
Administration officials involved in the decision to alter the immigration policy said they had consulted with only two outside people, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, both Democrats. They said they had not talked to Mr. Mas -- or any other Cuban-American leader -- because they feared that Cuban-Americans would mobilize to block the decision.
Ultimately, it may have come down to Presidential politics. One official said that relations with Mr. Mas had always been edgy and that the White House was dubious about his support in 1996.
After the announcement, Mr. Mas realigned himself with his party and pulled his group out of a Government refugee program. Mr. Mas's political influence remains strong, especially with a Republican majority in Congress. Mr. Mas has been pushing for legislation to tighten the three-decade-old American embargo of Cuba, and he has found an ardent ally in Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the new Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman.
At an emotional rally here on April 17 to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Senator Helms heaped praise on Mr. Mas and the foundation and, with Mr. Mas at his side, endorsed their call for a naval blockade of Cuba.
"I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the United States stands with you," Senator Helms said.
Mr. Mas is a bulldog of a man whose explosive temper has plunged him into several lawsuits, including a libel case he lost to an estranged younger brother. He is often spotted at football and baseball games or sipping cafe Cubano and soaking up the adulation of fellow exiles in Little Havana.
Mr. Mas founded a construction company, now called MasTec, that made him a fortune laying telephone cable. Before that, he served in the United States Army and worked as a milkman, stevedore, shoe salesman and dishwasher.
Mr. Mas's Mercedes, with bodyguards, is often seen in the southwest Miami suburbs, where he lives in a walled compound. He presides over an empire that includes the foundation, claiming 50,000 members, and a political action committee that has donated more than $1 million to Congressional and Presidential candidates of both parties in little more than a decade.
Anticipating Mr. Castro's fall, Mr. Mas has built a power base that resembles a government in exile, to the point of bestowing medals on visiting heads of state, warning foreign governments that they will be punished if they trade with Cuba and writing a new Cuban constitution. Through the foundation, he also runs a commission, with some of America's largest corporations as members, that has drawn up a plan to overhaul the Cuban economy once Mr. Castro goes.
He is also on a first-name basis with Latin American presidents and, through the foundation, has even sponsored a visit to Miami by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr. Clinton, as a candidate in 1992, sought Mr. Mas's blessing by arranging to have lunch with him at a restaurant in Little Havana. Both Ronald Reagan and George Bush have also paid tribute to him.
"I salute Jorge Mas," President Bush told several hundred Republicans at a $1,000-a-plate dinner here during the 1992 campaign. Mr. Bush called Mr. Mas, a Bay of Pigs veteran and the son of a Cuban army veterinarian, the living embodiment of Cuban immigrants' success.
Ultimately, however, Mr. Mas is said to have grander ambitions. In both Washington and Miami, it is widely assumed that he will be satisfied with nothing less than replacing Mr. Castro as Cuba's paramount leader.
"Jorge Mas Canosa is a man of enormous ambition who makes no secret of his desire to become the next Cuban president," a study published in 1993 by the Strategic Studies Institute of the United States Army War College concluded. "In many respects, Mas is a capitalist mirror image of Fidel Castro: demagogic, intolerant, dictatorial, with an enormous ego and a propensity for delivering 'thundering speeches,' exuding 'hatred and intransigence.' "
In recent years, human rights groups like Human Rights Watch/Americas, based in Washington, have criticized Mr. Mas and the foundation for what they call "attempts to discredit" critics and opponents. In 1992, after Mr. Mas accused The Miami Herald of harboring Castro sympathizers, Human Rights Watch/Americas issued a report blaming "the dominant intransigent forces in Miami's Cuban exile community" for efforts to silence and intimidate opponents.
In 1989, after Federal Treasury agents raided the home of Ramon Cernuda, a Miami book publisher who represents Cuban dissidents critical of foundation leaders and policies, Mr. Mas was quick to take credit for the raid and to warn other exiles of the dangers of opposing him.
"In effect, we are responsible for this and other investigations that I hope will materialize," he boasted on a Spanish-language radio station loyal to the foundation. He also warned that he was "going to continue trying to get an investigation of Cernuda and 20 other Cernudas who are here in Miami." He added, "In other words, the holiday is over for these people and Cernuda."
During the same radio interview, Mr. Mas also said he had "taken steps with Congress, the Executive Branch and the Treasury Department" to get them to move against his rivals. In the next year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided Mr. Cernuda's offices, the Internal Revenue Service audited his personal and business tax returns, and state labor inspectors investigated his business.
Mr. Mas did not respond to numerous requests for an interview to discuss his activities and plans. Last month, Jose Cardenas, a foundation representative in Washington, said that no official of the foundation would consent to an interview with The New York Times because the group regards the newspaper's coverage of Cuban affairs since the 1950's as sympathetic to Mr. Castro.
 
 
The Rise
A Briar Patch Of Broadcasting
 Although Mr. Mas founded the Cuban American National Foundation late in 1980, the group achieved its first big political coup only in 1985, when the Reagan Administration, at Mr. Mas's urging, established Radio Marti, named for Jose Marti, the father of Cuban independence.
The idea was to provide Cuba's 11 million people with an alternative to President Castro's version of the news, even though many Cubans could already listen to commercial Spanish-language stations broadcasting from Miami. Five years later, TV Marti went on the air.
Radio Marti built a sizable audience in Cuba, but TV Marti did not. Because of global communications agreements, TV Marti broadcasts only from 3:30 A.M. to 8 A.M. and is completely jammed by Cuba. Even so, the United States has spent more than $238 million to keep the stations going, and efforts to reduce Federal support as part of budget-cutting efforts have largely failed. This year the two stations have requested an additional $26 million.
The Office of Cuba Broadcasting, a division of the Voice of America, runs the two Marti stations. It is supervised by a nine-member advisory board that Mr. Mas has led since 1986, when Mr. Reagan appointed him chairman. Current and former employees said Mr. Mas had often influenced the tone and content of broadcasts, the employment of station personnel and decisions to award contracts to consultants.
Radio and TV Marti are required to adhere to the same Federal guidelines of fairness as the Voice of America. But many current and former employees, as well as academic experts on Cuba and rival Cuban exile groups here, say Mr. Mas has systematically ignored those regulations and used the stations to advance his own political agenda.
"The pattern has been disastrous," said Ernesto F. Betancourt, who was director of Radio Marti from its inception until early in 1990, when he clashed with Mr. Mas over programming and resigned, saying he had been forced out. In an interview, Mr. Betancourt contended that the collapse of governments in Eastern Europe in 1989 had led Mr. Mas and other foundation leaders to expect a similar upheaval in Cuba.
"At that time, a basic change took place in the behavior of the Cuban American National Foundation," Mr. Betancourt maintained. "Their goal was no longer limited to the liberation of Cuba. Instead, the foundation became a political organization whose goal was to take power after Fidel Castro."
A General Accounting Office study of TV Marti released in 1992 concluded that the station's coverage "lacked balance and did not meet established Voice of America standards." The authors expressed concern "about the extent of TV Marti's coverage of the Cuban American National Foundation."
Early last year, an Advisory Panel on Radio and TV Marti commissioned by Congress recommended that the board Mr. Mas leads not become involved in daily operations and that its members be rotated every three years. Those recommendations have not been implemented.
The board voted recently to move the stations from Washington to Miami. Critics contend that such a move would make it easy for Mr. Mas to influence the stations even if he eventually surrendered his post.
Asked about Mr. Mas's role, Penn Kemble, deputy director of the United States Information Agency, which includes the Voice of America, said in a telephone interview: "It's doing the job right now and looking to the future that interests us, rather than expending ourselves in debates about rights and wrongs in the past."
Radio and TV Marti have been "something of a briar patch," he said, adding, "I don't doubt mistakes have been made and that there have been problems in the past. But there's also been some very impressive work done."
"Jorge cuts a wide swath," Mr. Kemble said. "He's a remarkable character, and he really played a huge role in getting these things started. I've no doubt there are things he has done that have been faulted, but there are also people who are envious of him or who have a disagreement with him and will challenge him for illicit influence or illegal conduct of one kind or another. He's a gigantic figure, and he's going to generate a lot of dispute."
 
 
The Power
Favoring Friends For Their Support
 In Washington, the Cuban American National Foundation exerts its influence through its lobbying arm, the Cuban American Foundation. Both foundations, in turn, are linked through their overlapping leadership to the Free Cuba Political Action Committee Inc. The president of that group, Domingo Moreira, a Miami seafood importer, is a member of the executive board of the Cuban American National Foundation and has been a business partner of Mr. Mas.
According to Federal Election Commission records, the Free Cuba PAC and its predecessor, the National Coalition for a Free Cuba Inc., have contributed more than $1 million to candidates for President, the Senate and the House of Representatives in little more than a decade.
In addition, Mr. Moreira said in a 1992 interview, the directors and trustees of the parent foundation have contributed "probably triple that amount" under their own names. Currently, the foundation lists 126 directors and trustees.
In the Free Cuba PAC's most recent F.E.C. reports, it reported giving more than $175,000 in 1993 and 1995 to both parties' candidates for Congress, with many donations going to members of the Congressional committees that deal with foreign relations and communications.
"Our philosophy is that we contribute to those who are friends of the Cuban cause and those opposing enemies of the Cuban cause," Francisco J. Hernandez, president of the foundation, said in an interview in 1992. "We do not care if they are Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives."
 
 
The Plan
First the Carrot, Then the Stick
 Encouraged by signs of Mr. Castro's vulnerability, the foundation began to recruit American companies in 1991 to join what it called a blue-ribbon commission to "establish a blueprint for a free-market economy in a post-Castro Cuba."
Mr. Mas said the group, advised by the investment firm Lazard Freres and with Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. as its honorary president, would provide the guidelines by which Cuba's future leaders "would deal with issues essential to the rebuilding of the economy." The group's prospectus said it would focus on subjects like selling off Cuba's state-owned enterprises to private investors, including American companies.
In asking some of the nation's largest companies to join, the foundation explained that an initial membership fee of $25,000 or more would entitle them to "studies of fundamental reform guidelines." But a senior Fortune 500 executive, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified, said he had doubts about the venture.
"The way it was presented to us," he said, recalling a meeting of Mr. Mas with the company's directors, "was that these guys were going to be the leaders of Cuba when Castro goes down and that we would be in their good graces by being part of this committee. That was the pitch, and though it was initially presented in the most patriotic of terms, it made us extremely uncomfortable."
Mr. Hernandez said last fall that "about 40" companies had joined. He and other officials and members said the group included companies specializing in tourism and communications, like Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines Ltd. and Bell South, as well as hotels, airlines, car rental companies and "tobacco interests."
"We want to help the Cuban community here in their efforts to move Mr. Castro out, and then, being a cruise line, we would like to see Cuba open," said Peter G. Whelpton, executive vice president for hotel operations for Royal Caribbean.
"We felt the foundation is the strongest, most level-headed and best-funded group, with a solid and reasonable legal and economic platform with which to move forward when the time comes."
American companies are currently prohibited from doing business in Cuba, and Mr. Mas has warned foreign firms that have already invested on the island that they may face the seizure of their assets in Cuba when Mr. Castro falls.
The companies now doing business in Cuba "are well aware of the risk they took," Mr. Mas said at a transportation convention in Fort Lauderdale on Feb. 20. "They should not expect to profit."
 
 
The Tactics
Once Thwarted, A Step Back
 After the Cuban refugee crisis last summer, the foundation sought to revive one of its most controversial ventures, the resettlement of refugees, formerly carried out through its Cuban Exodus Relief Fund.
Almost from its inception, the foundation has run refugee programs. At first, the effort was modest, with the costs borne by members and supporters. But in 1988, the Reagan Administration said the group could bring in up to 4,000 Cubans a year from third countries.
The foundation promised to pay all the costs of resettling the refugees. "It is the first time that the American taxpayers don't have to pay for social services of new refugees," Mr. Mas said when the first group arrived in September 1988.
Three years later, however, the foundation's Cuban Exodus Relief Fund was certified as a "voluntary agency," entitling it to $588 in Federal support for each refugee it brought in. In addition, the Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human Services authorized $1.7 million for 2,000 more Cuban refugees under another Cuban Exodus Relief Fund program.
The foundation's refugee resettlement program came under fire from other exile groups, nonpartisan refugee-resettlement agencies and experts on Cuba, who called the special treatment accorded the foundation highly unusual and irregular.
"I do not know of any other political organization in the United States that has ever received this kind of privilege," said Wayne Smith, the State Department's senior representative in Havana during the Carter and Reagan Administrations. "It is one they have clearly used to their advantage, saying to people, 'We can get your uncle in Madrid to the U.S. and, oh, by the way, you do support the foundation, don't you?' "
In 1991, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services investigated the Cuban Exodus Relief Fund and concluded that "it appears the role of the foundation consists only in processing the refugees till they arrive at the airport." The agency said newly arriving Cubans had reported that "they have not received any orientation concerning the community or the health care system" and "no assistance was received in obtaining job training or employment from the C.A.N.F."
Although the state agency urged that the foundation's program be audited, no audit was ever performed. When the report was made public, foundation officials protested vehemently, and Nancy Kelly Wittenberg, the director of the state's refugee program, was asked by the Governor's staff for what she called "a letter of clarification."
"The State of Florida applauds the tremendous contribution made by the Cuban American National Foundation in their humanitarian role of uniting families separated for years by a Communist dictator," Ms. Wittenberg wrote. "The State of Florida supports the C.A.N.F. program and desires a relationship of mutual cooperation with the foundation."
By 1993, the Cuban Exodus Relief Fund had brought more than 9,500 Cuban refugees to the United States from countries other than Cuba. That year, following budget cutbacks and complaints by other refugee-resettlement groups, Federal financing was withdrawn. Early last year, the foundation stopped accepting applications for resettlement.
After last summer's exodus of Cuban refugees, the foundation was unable to revive its resettlement effort. It then joined other community and exile groups in a program that has sponsored several thousand Guantanamo rafters for resettlement. But on Tuesday, the foundation withdrew its promise to raise millions of dollars to help resettle the remaining 20,000 refugees.
Speaking of the Clinton Administration, Mr. Mas said at a news conference here: "They made this policy alone. Let them now solve the problems of Guantanamo alone."

For several years, fiscal analysts and public officials have warned that New York City might no longer be able to afford the government and services it had built over half a century. They urged gradual and planned shrinkage. But now, change is coming far faster than many people wanted or expected because three levels of government are rushing toward the same goal: a smaller, less ambitious bureaucracy. While the ultimate shape of Federal, state and local legislation and budgets is still unclear, some economists are already speaking of New York City's future in phrases once reserved to describe Eastern Europe's bumpy transition from Communism to capitalism.
 "In the long run, the lesson of the next few years may be that New York is simply not wealthy or economically vital enough to afford the extensive public sector that it has created over the post great Depression period," the investment banking firm J. P. Morgan said in a recent report to investors in the municipal market. "But dismantling it will take time: the new financial plans share a brand of shock therapy that may not be acceptable to the public." A1.

CORRUPTION CASES MAY BE EASIER
As the cases against 16 officers who were indicted last week in the 48th Precinct in the Bronx begin to move through the courts, some legal experts and police officials said they believe that prosecutors may have a better chance of making the charges stick than in other recent police corruption scandals. In the last two months, prosecutors have been stung by a series of courtroom defeats in cases against officers in the city's two largest corruption investigations, in the 30th Precinct in Harlem and the 73d in Brooklyn. B3.
 
POLICE COMMISSIONER PLEDGES VIGILANCE
Pledging a renewed effort to attack corruption, the Police Commissioner said he had created a new post to speed the dismissal of corrupt officers who escape the wrath of the legal system. "I have just created the position of special prosecutor in my own department to get these people off the job within 30 days," Commissioner William J. Bratton said. "Just get them in, get them tried and get rid of them." The creation of the new post is part of an overall "integrity strategy" that the Commissioner said he intends to present to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani later this week. B3.
 
MAN SEEKS TO HONOR VICTIMS OF A SINKING
As the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe, a former New York police officer is trying to make sure the sinking of the S.S. Leopoldville becomes more than a footnote in the history books. The troopship was sunk by a German torpedo in the English Channel on Christmas Eve 1944, with the loss of 802 American infantrymen, one of the worst naval disasters in the history of the United States.

PUBLIC MONEY FOR CAMPAIGNS
With big-money campaign contributions more important than ever, the Connecticut Legislature is considering a move that could make its governor's race the first in the nation to be financed almost entirely with public money. Secretary of the State Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat and the state's chief elections official, has proposed slashing the maximum contribution in the governor's race to $250 from $5,000, making it the lowest in the country, and using tax money to finance as much as 94 percent of a candidate's campaign.

BATTLE RESUMES OVER ELLIS ISLAND BRIDGE
New Jersey generally loves it. New York hates it. And both sides are again marshaling their forces for a renewed struggle over construction of a proposed bridge from New Jersey to Ellis Island. This year's contest is especially rancorous because each side is trying to club the other into submission with portions of a new report by the National Park Service on the bridge's environmental impact.

HEADLINE: An Unwinnable Welfare Race

 BODY:
One of the most disheartening aspects of the current budget squeeze in New York is that its elected leaders seem eager to join a nationwide race to lower welfare benefits. Both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki seem determined to insure that the state not serve as a magnet for the poor because of its allegedly generous welfare benefits. But their quest is founded on dubious premises and will only harm poor families with children. This is a race that cannot be won, economically or socially.
Washington should take note. The nationwide slash-a-thon in welfare benefits will only accelerate if Congress transfers responsibility for welfare to the states. Republicans are gaining in their bid to eliminate welfare as an entitlement, turn the program into a block grant of limited size and give states broad discretion on how to design their welfare programs. 
 But as many critics, including this page, have long pointed out, once welfare becomes a block grant there will be no incentive for states to maintain benefits, since they will not lose Federal matching aid if benefits are cut. A kind of reverse beggar-thy-neighbor approach has already started as each state tries to beggar its own program.
In Connecticut, a bill slashing welfare benefits has gained broad bipartisan support. In New York, aides to Mr. Pataki are arguing that the Connecticut plan offers another reason for the Governor's own proposed welfare cuts. The cuts, they say, would make it less attractive for all those poor folks from Connecticut to suddenly migrate here. Mayor Giuliani added recently that in supporting welfare cuts he was not trying to drive welfare recipients out of the city, but that mobility by the poor is a "good thing" in principle.
Since the 1930's, income programs for some of the poor, mostly families with children, have been shared between the states and the Federal Government. In reforming welfare, the Federal Government should bear more of that responsibility, not less. Because poverty is a product of national forces, it is not appropriate for states with large concentrations of poor people to have to bear the overriding burden of caring for them.
Governors and mayors of the United States used to be the most articulate advocates for a national approach to poverty. In the 1980's, at the height of the Reagan-era budget cuts, they led the states and cities to spare their own safety nets from destruction. But now, as Republicans govern in statehouses and city halls in New York and elsewhere, there are no articulate voices demanding that poverty be taken seriously as a national problem rather than one to be thrown on the doorsteps of localities.
Instead, it is the mayors and governors themselves who seem most prepared to give up and let poor families fend for themselves. A conspicuous exception has been Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who opposes cuts in welfare benefits because of the damage they are likely to inflict on families. But no one has led the fight nationally to remind Americans of the true nature of the poverty problem.
By all means, let Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki and others lead the way in more rigorously scrutinizing the welfare rolls to reduce fraud and abuse. That may save some money and will certainly help strengthen public support of welfare. The Mayor is also right to demand more work requirements for those recipients able to work. But trying to compete in a race to cut welfare benefits is cruel and futile.

HEADLINE: Victory Remembered

 BODY:
This week in Washington, London, Paris and Moscow the World War II Allies are marking the surrender of Germany 50 years ago today, and saluting those who fought, and those who died, on the scorched road to V-E Day. The surrender was a moral and political landmark fully deserving of commemoration, for V-E Day marked not just the end of the European war but the unconditional defeat of a Nazi regime whose evil character still defies comprehension.
The end came in a chaotic rush after the Red Army burst through the outskirts of Berlin on April 21. As Soviet soldiers were storming the Reichstag on April 30, Hitler killed himself after naming Adm. Karl Doenitz as his successor. Within days, Nazi armies were disintegrating from the Baltic to the Adriatic. Berlin fell on May 2. Six days later Doenitz spoke for an already vanished regime in authorizing his generals to surrender unconditionally. The Fuhrer's Thousand-Year Reich had lasted 12 years.
The final battles left much of Europe in ruins, leaving victors as well as losers homeless and hungry. Having escaped devastation in World War I, Germany in the Second War reaped what it had sown. 
 But the bells pealed on V-E Day not just because the killing had stopped. Millions of Europeans and Americans also rejoiced in what they believed was a victory for freedom and decency, and in good measures this was so. The horrors of Auschwitz and Buchenwald made plain that it was imperative to rid the world of Hitler. Skillful American leadership preserved the wartime coalition with the Soviet Union. That made possible the birth of the United Nations, whose charter foreshadowed the end of colonialism. In the Pacific, meantime, the tide was at last turning against Japan.
When Franklin Roosevelt died in April, Hitler saw it as sign from heaven that his foes would finally divide. Instead Harry Truman moved quickly to establish himself as successor to F.D.R. In two weeks Hitler committed suicide. The transition in America was followed in Britain by a return to elective democracy after years of national government under Winston Churchill.
Soon enough, the exhilarating sense of rebirth in 1945 gave way to the realization that victory had brought Soviet arms deep into Europe. There was a confrontation over Poland as Stalin scorned his promises for a free election, jailed non-Communist leaders and installed a puppet regime. Refugee camps were filled with desperate peoples, and in a sad sequel, the Allies acquiesced silently as tens of thousands of the displaced were forcibly removed to the Soviet Union.
In the West, cold-war calculation was presaged by the scramble for German rocket scientists, and the recruitment of former Nazis like Gen. Reinhard Gehlen, an intelligence chief who turned his files and networks over to American authorities and later became West Germany's head of counterintelligence. But such cynicism was only part of the story. When the terrible winter of 1947 seemed to doom hopes for postwar recovery, Truman and his Secretary of State, George Marshall, threw out an economic lifeline of unparalleled generosity. Out of the solidarity nurtured by the Marshall Plan grew the European Union that flourishes today.
Small wonder that the glow of V-E Day endures, as evidenced by the longing felt for its unifying ideals in a disordered world. The euphoria of 1945 has long since vanished, but not the glimpse of a saner more peaceful planet.

HEADLINE: There's No Such Thing as a Forest Health Crisis;
Timber Tinderboxes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposed legislation referred to by Mary Christina Olmsted and Chad Hanson in "The Gordon-Hatfield Forest Giveway" (Op-Ed, April 30) would not "allow unlimited clear-cutting of publicly owned forests all over the country." The legislation would permit removal of diseased, dying, dead and downed timber, which constitute a tinderbox potential for catastrophic forest fires that, as history records, cause horrendous losses, including human lives. 
 The legislation would prohibit the delaying and costly law suits that have wreaked havoc on Oregon's timber-based economy and employment.
The most misleading untruth in the article states, "Whatever the public may think about forest management policies, they should be alarmed at their senators' disregard for basic principles of democracy."
For a law professor at the University of Oregon to imply that Senator Mark O. Hatfield has a "disregard for basic principles of democracy" is preposterous. His continued election to public office for more than 40 years, including service in the Senate since January 1967, validates his adherence to the basic principles of democracy.

Lawsuit Liability Bill Is Set Back in Senate
Senate Republicans failed again to act on a measure intended to reduce the number of civil lawsuits, even though Majority Leader Bob Dole had scaled back the proposal to attract needed votes.
The Senate now plans to take a scalpel to the bill this morning to pare it back even further. The measure that is expected to emerge would set limits on damages awarded only in lawsuits involving faulty products. A1.
 
U.S. Bancorp to Buy West One
U.S. Bancorp said it would acquire West One Bancorp of Idaho in a $1.6 billion deal that will create a banking powerhouse in the Pacific Northwest. The merger will mean the elimination of 1,100 jobs, or 7.5 percent of the banks' combined work forces. D2.
 
Falling Dollar Deters Foreign Travel
The falling dollar has forced many Americans to drop Germany and other costly European destinations -- now even more costly than they had been -- from summer plans. Many are booking trips elsewhere. A1.
The dollar dropped broadly after the U.S. and Japan failed to reach an accord on opening the Japanese auto market. D20.
 
Sherwin-Williams in Hostile Bid
Sherwin-Williams began a hostile tender offer of $19.50 a share, or $320 million, for the Grow Group, topping a bid of $18.10 a share, or $290 million, from Imperial Chemicals Industries of Britain. Grow had accepted Imperial's offer last week. D9.
 
New York City Losing Jobs
New York City's economy has lost about 9,000 jobs over the last nine months, including a slowdown in employment growth on Wall Street, advertising and the law, the State Comptroller said. B2.
 
Potential Risk in Electric Cars
Electric cars are being promoted to improve public health by limiting smog, but a new study indicates that the production of the cars' batteries may create a new health risk. A1.
 
King Stock Up on Buyout Report
Shares of King World Productions jumped nearly 5 percent after Turner Broadcasting was reported to have discussed buying the company for $1.6 billion in stock. D6.
 
No. 2 at A.F.L.-C.I.O. to Retire
The secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has decided to retire, even though he was considered a leading candidate to succeed Lane Kirkland as president. Thomas Donahue's retirement almost certainly means a knockdown battle over the labor federation's leadership. A14.
 
Drug Makers and University in Deal
Chiron, Ciba-Geigy and New York University have agreed to collaborate on the development of a new approach for the optical mapping and sequencing of genes. D8.
Chiron reported a first-quarter loss of $385.8 million, reflecting additional costs associated with its partnership with Ciba-Geigy. D8.

Taco Bell Giveaway Draws Millions
Taco Bell gave away an estimated 8 million reduced-fat tacos and burritos in a promotion of its new menu. The one-day campaign, believed the largest restaurant giveaway ever, is expected to cost the company up to $16 million in labor, food and advertising costs. D2.
 
Looking Back With Alaska Air
Commercials for Alaska Airlines are re-creating a world in which milk is still delivered, women wear white gloves, "all the paper boys are named Rusty," and everyone smiles. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. D7.
 
Supply Problem Trips STB Stock
STB Systems has the problem of too much demand for its product. The stock of the producer of graphic adapters for computers fell $4, to $7.25, after saying it was unable to obtain some components it needed, while others arrived so late that shipments were delayed. Floyd Norris: Market Place. D10.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 40.47, Pushing a Rally Into 5th Month

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After a retreat on Friday, the stock market resumed its rally yesterday, pushing up the Dow Jones industrial average 40.47 points, to a record 4,383.87.
The strength of the advance was surprising given the concerns that were raised by the April employment report on Friday. The report showed a surge in unemployment to 5.8 percent, providing compelling evidence that the economy was sharply decelerating. Traders became unduly pessimistic about the possibility of a slowdown slipping into a recession and sold stocks, sending the Dow down 16.26 points. 
 With the weekend to think it over, "everybody got off the floor and dusted themselves off" and bought stocks yesterday, said Tracy Herrick, chief investment strategist for Jefferies & Company.
What was clear yesterday was that the stock market is entering its fifth month of a substantial rally. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.84 points yesterday, to 523.96, also a record, up more than 14 percent for the year. The smaller-company Nasdaq index rose 5.76 points, to 849.29, up 13 percent for the year.
But the Dow has been rising so far so fast lately that the usual assumptions of market analysis may no longer work. For one, the main indexes are magnifying the rise of the market. An increase of $1 in the price of a Dow component stock leads to a rise of almost 3 points in the Dow, compared with a rise of only 2 points in 1993. So, if all 30 Dow stocks rose just $1, only a modest gain, the Dow would still leap 90 points, a rise sure to prompt headlines.
Thus, market analysts say that over-interpreting daily market moves is a real danger when the Dow is nearly at 4,400. "At this point, it's silly to guess how high is high," said David Holt, vice president of research and strategy for Wedbush Morgan Securities. "We've never been here before."
While some analysts see an unbroken bull market ahead, Mr. Herrick of Jefferies said he was troubled by the four-month rally. "Clearly, this is euphoria and euphoria doesn't last," he said.
For one thing, the Government's report on April producer prices on Thursday and the report on consumer prices may contain nasty surprises, Mr. Herrick said. Recent rises in petroleum and gasoline prices were not fully reflected in the March price indexes and may at last show their full impact in the April figures.
And analysts agreed that the stock market may live and die by what happens in the bond market, in which long-term interest rates have been falling since early November. With capital no longer chasing rising yields for bonds, much of that money is rushing to the stock market and helping to lift prices.
For much of the session yesterday, the market was up only modestly. But by 2 P.M. the Dow had risen substantially, and it was up 52.92 points by 3:30 P.M.
The rise set off the "circuit breaker" rules at the New York Stock Exchange, which are intended to discourage high-speed computer-guided trading. But the rules more often take effect when the Dow falls more than 50 points.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was less than normal, with 291.8 million shares changing hands, about 12 percent lower than the daily average of 333 million shares this year.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.78 points, to 281.68, with almost two stocks advancing for every one declining, or 1,480 to 770. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.32 point, to 482.94.
Among the advancing stocks was Geico, the insurer, which rose 3 7/8, to 54 3/8, after reporting strong earnings. American International Group, another insurance company, rose 3 3/4, to 112 1/4, perhaps on the outlook for stable interest rates and low inflation, which help insurers.
Intel, the maker of computer chips and also the most active stock yesterday, at 7.3 million shares, rose 3, to 111 5/8. Traders were betting that the future demand for computer chips would be favorable.

HEADLINE: Gottfried Haberler, Resolute Free-Market Economist, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Gottfried Haberler, an Austrian-born economist known for his staunch defense of free-market principles in international trade and national economic policies, died at his home here on Saturday. He was 94 years old.
Mr. Haberler died of respiratory failure caused by pneumonia, said James E. DeVol, a funeral director at the DeVol Funeral Home here. The pneumonia was a complication from Parkinson's Disease, he added. 
 In the 1930's and early 40's, Mr. Haberler was a highly articulate critic of large-scale Government intervention in the economy. Such intervention had gained intellectual favor as a response to the worldwide Depression. Mr. Haberler's early critiques of the work of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, produced some adjustments in how the school of economic theory known as Keynesianism dealt with the effects of falling prices on economic growth.
Mr. Haberler pointed out in 1941 that falling prices may make people feel wealthier as they contemplate the additional buying power of their holdings of cash and other easily spent assets. As people realize they are wealthier, they tend to spend more, which may limit the severity of an economic depression. Mr. Keynes had argued that the government needed to intervene in economic depressions because other economic forces were to put spending back on track.
"He ended up helping making not Model T Keynesianism but latter-day Keynesianism a better and more viable set of analysis," said Paul A. Samuelson, a professor emeritus of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Economics and Mr. Haberler's former student at Harvard University,
Mr. Samuelson said his teacher had been consistent in his writings over the last seven decades. "At bottom, he stuck to the view of a very limited welfare state with most of the work of economics having to be done by the market," he said.
Mr. Haberler also broadened the mathematical basis for the theory of "comparative advantage," which deals with analyzing the mutual gains that countries reap from free trade, even when one country has higher costs than the other country for every product. He also produced in 1937 a comprehensive review of existing business cycle theories, "Prosperity and Depression," that remains a classic.
Mr. Haberler was descended from aristocratic families in Austria and Liechtenstein. He received his bachelor's degree and doctorates in law and economics from the University of Vienna, where he was part of a group of brilliant Austrian economists that also included Friedrich von Hayek, the late Nobel prize-winner. Mr. Haberler then moved to the United States and taught at Harvard University from 1936 to 1971.
Following his retirement as Galen L. Stone Professor of International Trade at Harvard, Mr. Haberler became a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a research group here that stresses free-market approaches to public policy issues. Mr. Haberler stayed at the institute, and continued to write on economics, until his death.
Mr. Haberler's wife, Friederike Kaan Haberler, died in 1991. He is survived by a sister, Maria Haberler, who lives in Liechtenstein, and by several nieces and nephews.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Chief Proposes 10-Year, $1 Billion Plan to Fix or Replace Military Housing

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Defense Secretary William J. Perry today announced a $1 billion plan to encourage private developers to renovate or replace more than 200,000 units of dilapidated housing for military families on bases throughout the country.
If approved by Congress, the plan would give the Pentagon broader authority to speed the refurbishment and new construction of family housing for the armed forces, a majority of whose members are now married. 
 Defense Department officials view improved housing as an important benefit to retain the most talented enlisted personnel and officers in the 1.6 million-member all-volunteer force.
But most of the military's family housing was built 30 or 40 years ago, when 60 percent of the members of the armed forces were single and lived in barracks. At the current pace of replacing the aging structures and building more, it would take $20 billion and 30 years. Mr. Perry's plan aims to compress that project into a decade, and to use private capital to pay for much of it.
"I believe today's professional military people deserve a home, and not just a bunk," Mr. Perry said at a news conference here today. "The military housing we have today is in terrible shape."
The Defense Secretary's proposal is the latest in a series of steps he has taken in the last year to improve the quality of life of service members, particularly enlisted troops. Last fall, Mr. Perry proposed spending an additional $2.7 billion over six years to improve the armed forces' salaries, housing and other benefits.
For someone whose reputation coming into the Secretary's job was as a technical expert more interested in new weapons than housing allowances, Mr. Perry has surprised many in Congress and in the military with his concern for the well-being of troops in the field. He travels to bases and meets every three months with his senior enlisted advisers, something none of his predecessors ever did.
The Pentagon's latest housing plan would guarantee mortgage payments or rental contracts to developers who build family housing, commit the Pentagon to more commercial-style lease agreements, and make it easier for developers to team up with the military to build on Government property.
"With the right structure, the private sector would be enthusiastic about getting involved again," said Ronald Nahas, a residential builder in Orinda, Calif., who led a workshop in January that brought real estate developers and Pentagon officials together to discuss the proposal.
Using private-sector financing to build military housing is not a new idea. Much of the existing family housing was built in the 1950's and 1960's using private financing. But subsequent laws and regulations made it less attractive for private developers to build and maintain military housing.
About 60 percent of those now in the armed services are married, compared with 42 percent in 1955. About 600,000 single troops live in barracks, which are gradually being improved but not under this plan.
Although only about one-third of married troops live in military housing, the waiting lists for that limited housing among service members living off base are usually very long. Proximity to other services on base and security are often mentioned as reasons that many members of the armed forces prefer to live in military housing.
If the Defense Department's plan wins approval, which seems likely given Congress's interest in improving service members' housing, Mr. Perry said the department would experiment with new financing techniques and other expanded legislative authority in a five-year pilot plan.
Most of the $1 billion included in the plan to guarantee mortgages or rentals is already included in long-range Pentagon budget projections. Some of the test sites under consideration include Fort Hood, Tex.; San Diego; Keesler Air Force Base, Miss., and Camp Lejeune, N.C. These are bases where the total number of troops far exceeds available military housing or where the commercial housing market is very expensive for military families.
Lawmakers who are to begin in the next few weeks to consider the military budget for the fiscal year 1996 generally praised the Pentagon's plan.
"I welcome Secretary Perry's proposal to bring more private capital into military housing," said Representative Joel Hefley, a Colorado Republican who heads the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Installations. "We've worked closely on the issue, and although the Secretary doesn't go as far as I would, it's a good first step."
Joshua Gotbaum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for economic security, told reporters that the proposal would try to renovate about 2,000 units of family housing in its first year.

HEADLINE: State Lawmakers Urge House to Reject Changes to Clean Water Act

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Breaking with most other organizations of state and local officials, a group representing state legislators today urged the House to reject proposed changes to the Clean Water Act when the bill is debated this week.
In a letter to all members of the House, the lawmakers' group, the National Conference of State Legislatures, urged them to vote against the bill unless it was "significantly amended," since as drafted the legislation would "permit increased degradation of our nation's waters and allow for delay in achieving the Clean Water Act's goals." 
 Partly by allowing representatives of state and local governments into negotiations while the bill was drafted, its sponsors in the House have amassed considerable support for the water pollution bill, which the Clinton Administration vigorously opposes. Among the organizations that have voiced general support are the National Governors' Association and groups representing local governments, who approve of the new flexibility they would be granted in reducing water pollution.
But as the House prepares to consider the measure beginning on Wednesday, the views expressed by the states are turning into a more vigorous debate, especially over the provisions to greatly reduce Federal protection for wetlands.
The proposal before the House would, in effect, change the definition of wetlands, reducing by at least half the acreage under Federal jurisdiction and making it much more difficult to limit their development.
Organizations representing governors and water pollution control officials have endorsed the bill despite disagreeing with the wetlands provisions, while both the state legislators' group and an organization of state officials in charge of managing wetlands have criticized this section of the bill.
The letter to House members was signed by Jane L. Campbell, a Democratic State Representative from Ohio who is president of the organization of state lawmakers. It strongly criticized the wetlands provisions. "Wetlands are an integral component of both the environmental and economic health of our nation," Ms. Campbell wrote.
The group also questioned a portion of the measure that would limit the ability of states to impose pollution standards stricter than Federal ones, and a portion that would relax standards requiring industries to treat wastes before sending them to public treatment plants.
The bill -- which is strongly opposed by conservation groups but favored by major industries -- would substantially reshape the 23-year-old Clean Water Act, one of the broadest and most familiar of the nation's environmental statutes.
The bill includes many provisions that major industries, from chemical manufacturing to agriculture, have long sought, and it also aims to relieve many of the burdens the law imposes on state and local governments, which play a major role in treating sewage.
The additional flexibility the bill gives state governments has attracted general support from most of them. But on specific issues, some of the states have expressed reservations.
In recent letters to members of Congress, some state officials have expressed reservations about the bill that go well beyond concerns about wetlands.
"In general, the bill as proposed undercuts much of our progress and creates new problems without solving old ones," wrote Virginia B. Wetherell, secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, in a letter to Representative Corrine Brown, Democrat of Florida.
Conceding that the bill has "some good points," Jack McClanahan, the Louisiana secretary of natural resources, said its wetlands provisions were "of great concern to us."
"The bill contains numerous provisions which will weaken water quality standards," he said in a letter on April 19 to Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana. "This is particularly important to Louisiana, through which much of the United States drains."
But in an unusual rebuke, the Governor of Louisiana, Edwin W. Edwards, repudiated Mr. McClanahan's views in a May 4 letter to Representative W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, a Louisiana Democrat who favors the wetlands provisions in the bill. "In spite of any other communication you may receive from anyone else in state government, my position and the official position of our state is that we support the much needed changes," Governor Edwards said.
The House bill would redefine what kinds of land can be protected under Federal laws, limiting protection to lands that are saturated to the surface for 21 consecutive days during the growing season and that exhibit all three classic signs of wetlands function: soil type, wetness, and wetlands vegetation. Other provisions would also lessen regulation of wetlands and would require compensation for landowners who are prohibited from developing their wetland properties.
The wetlands provisions, many of them based on proposals that were abandoned during the Bush Administration, have been strongly criticized as being based on flawed science. On Tuesday, the National Academy of Sciences will publish a comprehensive review of wetlands science that is expected to dispute the validity of virtually every criterion used in the House bill to delineate wetlands for protection.
The Association of State Wetland Managers has also condemned the wetlands provisions of the bill.
"We must not create a program that will be scientifically unsound, exclude most wetlands from Federal regulatory oversight, cannot be implemented, cannot be funded, and is not acceptable to the states and local governments," the organization said in a letter to Representative Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House subcommittee that drafted the bill. Mr. Boehlert, a Republican from upstate New York, is himself critical of the measure.

HEADLINE: Lack of Job Growth Creates 'Sobering' Economic Outlook

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a report on what he called a "disappointing setback," State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said yesterday that New York City's economy, which had already been lagging behind the rest of the nation's, took a turn for the worse over the nine months ending March 31. In that period, 9,000 jobs were lost.
The report appeared to support arguments, offered by several economists in recent weeks, that aggressive cuts in government spending are undermining the city's economy. It found that the heaviest job losses were in government agencies, where 29,700 jobs were cut, compared with a gain of 20,700 in the private sector. 
 But Mr. McCall, who said deep cuts in government employment had been expected, maintained that the biggest disappointment was a sharp slowdown in the growth of employment on Wall Street and in banking, advertising, manufacturing and other private industries.
For now, the report found, the city's slow climb out of its deepest recession in decades has come to a halt. In that recession, from the begining of 1989 through 1992, 342,000 jobs were lost. Only 70,900, or about 21 percent, of those jobs have been recovered.
Not only are private businesses failing to compensate for government cuts, but their prospects over the next year are grim because of the slowdown that has begun across the nation after a sharp increase in interest rates.
As things get worse for the nation, Mr. McCall said, they are bound to get worse for the city.
"Given the prospect of weaker national growth and rising unemployment, the near-term outlook for New York City's economy is sobering, at best," Mr. McCall said.
Despite its largely bleak conclusions, the report found some pockets of strength in the city. One is in personal income, which has continued to rise even while employment has declined.
"Increasingly, the city's economy is characterized by profit and income growth in the absence of meaningful job growth," the report said. It found that average wages for workers in New York City rose by 3.5 percent in 1994.
Among the strongest sectors of the city economy is tourism, which has surged since late 1993, raising hotel tax revenues by 31 percent in 1994, the report said. Retail sales have also been buoyant, rising 6.2 percent in the 12 months that ended in February, it said.
But Mr. McCall said those areas of expansion were far from enough to compensate for a mix of slow growth in private businesses and continued government cuts that will continue to take their toll over at least the next year.
Job cuts in health care, resulting from Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to reduce Medicaid reimbursement, could be significant, the report said, although it did not forecast how many jobs would be lost.
It said the city was also vulnerable if national policies miss the mark in controlling inflation and creating an environment of slow, steady growth, as has been the intention of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates seven times over the last year.
A national recession would have a particularly harsh impact on the city, the report said. It also said the city would suffer if the dollar continued to sink against other currencies, which would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates even higher.
In either case, the report said, many of the city's industries would be hurt, particularly its banks and Wall Street investment firms.

HEADLINE: Round 1 on Republican Budget Begins in Senate Committee

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The Senate Budget Committee took the first tentative step today in the long march toward enacting the first Republican budget in history, with one senator after another staking out a political position for the days of debate that lie ahead.
In a morning devoted to opening speeches, Republicans held that the country's economic future rested on their plan to balance the Federal budget over the next seven years, the details of which have yet to be announced. 
 Democrats countered with the argument that the Republicans were not interested so much in fiscal discipline as they were in protecting the privileged at the expense of the poor and the aged.
On Tuesday, the committee's chairman, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, will reveal the details of his budget proposal. The plan was developed in consultation with other Republicans. It is likely to be adopted intact by the committee later this week, over the solid opposition of Democrats.
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, also plans to release his balanced-budget plan on Tuesday.
These proposals, called budget resolutions, are broad outlines that set spending levels for large categories of Government spending. The specific program reductions needed to meet those levels will not be determined until later.
The Senate and House plans are expected to be similar, with large cuts in projected spending for Medicare and many other areas of the Government, the abolition of several Government departments and agencies and a freeze more or less in military spending.
The cuts in Mr. Kasich's proposal will be deeper than those in Mr. Domenici's because the spending reductions in the House measure offset about $350 billion in tax cuts over seven years that the House approved last month. Mr. Domenici has said that the budget he proposes will not include a tax cut.
One reason for the high political stakes is that this is the first time Republicans have been in control of Congress since it began adopting comprehensive budgets in the 1970's. Before that, spending and tax bills were approved piecemeal with little consideration of their overall effect.
In his opening speech this morning, Senator Domenici declared, "Our Government must be reined in."
"Over the next few days," he said, "we will have the debate so many of us have said we want -- a debate to balance the Federal budget. America's future, for young and old alike, will be shaped by the outcome."
He promised to slow the rate of growth in Medicare spending to 7.1 percent from 10 percent and said his proposal would order the creation of a "bipartisan Congressional commission" to recommend the changes needed in the Medicare system to reduce spending that much and prevent the system, which covers health care for 37 million elderly and disabled Americans, from running out of money by 2002. He also said he would recommend that lawmakers' salaries be frozen for the next seven years.
As for taxes, Mr. Domenici said, "It's not that I'm opposed to cutting taxes; it's just that I believe our first responsibility is to get to balance."
Democrats seized on the Medicare proposals to underscore their argument that the Republicans were out to do harm to the most needy Americans. Jim Exon of Nebraska, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, said: "They will take a hatchet to Medicare -- but not to save the system. Oh, no! No one here is fooled by their Medicare crocodile tears. They will hack away at Medicare to pay for the House-passed Republican tax cut."
An influential Republican Congressman said today that, as one way of holding down spending, the age of eligibility for Medicare, now 65, should be gradually increased to 67.
The Congressman, Representative Bill Thomas of California, is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. He has been working with Speaker Newt Gingrich on proposals to restructure Medicare.

HEADLINE: Air Force Plans to Mothball Plane Used in Icy-Flying Tests

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Air Force is planning next month to mothball a special plane used in icy-flying tests, a cost-cutting move that aviation safety experts say will handicap efforts to test the performance of commercial and military planes.
The tanker plane, the only one of its kind, is used to spray water onto other airplanes in flight to test how icy conditions affect them. It was used extensively to test turboprops made by Avions de Transport Regional, the type that crashed last October in Indiana, killing all 68 people aboard. 
 The plane was also used to test an expanded de-icing system intended to better protect those ATR aircraft in conditions far more hazardous than the ones for which it and other planes were originally certified.
In a typical test, the modified KC-135 tanker aircraft, which can carry 2,000 gallons of water, uses a nozzle to spray small water droplets over a trailing plane at rates as high as 55 gallons a minute.
Through such tests after the Indiana crash, the Federal Aviation Administration and ATR found that a small but potentially dangerous ice shape could build up on the wings of the ATR aircraft in certain conditions. This prompted ATR to modify the ice protection system on the wing.
The aviation administration has asked manufacturers of similar planes to test how their aircraft perform in such extreme conditions. Its goal is to identify and correct any problems before the start of the next icy weather season in November. The F.A.A. has asked manufacturers of about 20 models of planes to test their aircraft.
The tanker, based at Edwards Air Force Base in California, is widely considered one of the most effective ways to re-create such weather conditions, and has been used to test military planes as well as commercial jetliners like the Boeing 737 and 757. Tests on commercial aircraft are paid for by the manufacturer.
"It's the best tool available at this time," said John P. Dow, a safety engineer and an icing expert for the F.A.A. An additional benefit of the tanker plane tests, Mr. Dow said, is that they can point out other visual cues for pilots that develop on the plane as early warning signs of dangerous conditions.
Other testing methods include high-speed runway taxi tests, computer simulations and wind-tunnel studies, each of which has limitations. Anthony J. Broderick, the F.A.A.'s associate administrator for regulation and certification, said that if such tests showed that a problem might exist, the F.A.A. would probably suggest that manufacturers then test their planes in actual flight tests in known icing conditions, meaning either in naturally occurring weather or behind the tanker. However, natural icing conditions can be time consuming to find.
Although the Air Force has operated icing tankers since the late 1950's, their importance has grown in recent years with the introduction of advanced wing shapes that are more sensitive to icing, said Russ Ashenden, a former manager of the tanker program and currently a research associate at the University of Wyoming's department of atmospheric science.
But Air Force officials said their decision to stop using the plane -- which they said was likely but not final -- was based on economics. The aircraft, which requires a staff of more than 20 to support it, was scheduled for a comprehensive maintenance check in October that would have cost about $2.3 million. The Air Force also saw few sure outside customers in the near future for its icing tanker program.
Mr. Dow said the F.A.A. hoped that the program might be extended for several months, allowing the F.A.A. and manufacturers to complete any required testing before the icing season begins.
Air Force officials said a final decision on the program would probably be made around June.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Are Down in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were down yesterday, fluctuating slightly in thin trading, as traders awaited a new supply of bills and notes and new data on inflation.
The market, which staged a powerful rally on Friday, began the week on a more cautious note. The Treasury begins its quarterly refinancing today with an auction of three-year notes. It will auction 10-year notes tomorrow. And the Government will report on producer prices in April on Thursday and on consumer prices on Friday. Some traders wondered yesterday whether last week's rally was overdone. 
 There is much uncertainty with the market still wanting to track higher but lacking the strong conviction regarding economic fundamentals, traders say. They see it as a euphoric mood that may only be feeding on itself.
"Fully aware that the market has moved so fast, traders are afraid to be in and afraid to be out all at the same time," said Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed- income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
Amid the uncertainties prompted by the coming inflation data and the new supply of Treasury securities, there is also a flood of money waiting to be invested, Mr. Roden noted. "The traders are scared of long end of the market, and also scared of being out of it, for fear of missing the boat," he said.
Trading, however, was quiet yesterday, with little activity coming from overseas. Financial markets were closed in London and Paris, and markets in Tokyo reopened after a five-day holiday weekend.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32 , to 10714/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, edged up to 7.03 percent, from 7.02 percent on Friday. Long-term interest rates remain at their lowest in nearly a year.
Bond prices surged on Friday after a Labor Department employment report showed unexpected weakness. The report provided compelling evidence that the economy was sharply decelerating, with no threat of inflation. Ahead of the inflation data this week, traders will receive more clues about the pace of economic growth. The Federal Reserve will release its so-called beige book survey of regional economic conditions tomorrow and the Government will report on April retail sales on Thursday.
Mr. Roden of Josephthal, Lyon said he expected the market, after rising so quickly, would decline if the data this week do not support the view of an economic slowdown.
Still, he noted that the market had come a long way. "What a difference in the market in just a few months," he said, "from talk of 'When will the Fed raise rates again?' to whispers of 'When will the Fed ease?' "
Rates on shorter-maturity bills were also a bit higher yesterday, with a three-month bill up a basis point, to 5.58 percent, and a six-month bill up 4 basis points, to 5.64 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Treasury began financing $72.6 billion this week with yesterday's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills.
At the auction, rates were moderately lower, with the three-month bill averaging 5.63 percent, down from last week and the lowest since April 17, when it was 5.56 percent. The six-month bill rate averaged 5.65 percent -- the lowest since Oct. 31, 1994, when it was 5.51 percent.
In the corporate debt market, the first group of issuers looking for cheap financing amid the lowest government bond yields in a while, Motorola sold $400 million of 30-year debentures with a 7.50 percent coupon at a price to yield 7.559 percent, or about 48 basis points more than a 7.50 percent Treasury due 2024.
Noncallable, the debentures are rated Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Quarterly Earnings at Goldman, Sachs Fall 47%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs Group L.P.'s fiscal first-quarter pretax profit fell 47 percent as earnings from trading bonds and currencies evaporated amid rising interest rates.
Profits at the nation's biggest investment banking partnership fell to $160 million in the three months ended Feb. 28 from $301 million a year earlier, according to a report by Canadian Bond Rating Service. Goldman's pretax profits do not include partners' income taxes. 
 While earnings plunged from the comparable quarter a year earlier, Goldman's results improved from its fourth quarter, when the firm lost $42 million before taxes, the rating company said.
"They are doing better," said Mark E. Bachmann, managing director at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. "The trading markets are better and the volumes are up. I think other people are having the same experience."
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. The privately held securities firm does not release its results to the public.
Goldman expects higher profits for the current year than for the last one, when its pretax earnings fell 81 percent, to $508 million, Canadian Bond Rating Service said in the report, in which it affirmed Goldman's bond ratings.
"In 1994, Goldman, Sachs's trading results suffered from difficult conditions in the currency and fixed-income markets, reversing what has been an impeccable earnings record," the rating company said.
The 126-year-old firm, the parent of Goldman, Sachs & Company, was in the black in the first quarter, partly because it cut about 1,000 jobs and trimmed employee perks last year.
The year-to-year decline in earnings reflects the difficulty Wall Street faces in recovering from last year's bond rout. Earnings on Wall Street fell about 80 percent from 1993's record profits and last year was the worst for the United States securities industry since 1990. Trading profits disappeared and underwriting slowed to a trickle.
Goldman benefited from the rally by participating in some of the first-quarter's biggest stock sales. The firm was the lead underwriter for Nabisco Holdings' $1.1 billion initial stock sale in January. It also led securities firms in AT&T's $1.8 billion stock sale this year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in Widespread Decline; U.S.-Japan Trade Friction Cited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen and other leading currencies after the United States and Japan failed to reach an accord in talks aimed at opening Japan's market to more American cars and car parts.
The last-minute negotiations in Vancouver, British Columbia, broke down Friday night. The Clinton Administration is expected to announce this week a list of sanctions on billions of dollars of Japanese goods imported into the United States 
 "The reaction of the market to the breakdown in the auto talks has been to sell dollars for yen," said Karl Halligan, vice president of strategic trading at CIC Bank New York.
The trade friction also indirectly hurt the dollar against the German mark and the Swiss franc. In times of dollar instability, the mark and the Swiss franc typically gain because of their reputations as safe-haven currencies.
"With the U.S.-Japan trade problem, the mark and Swiss franc become obvious offsets to that as security," said Steve Flanagan, foreign exchange trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "Any escalation in U.S.-Japan problems will benefit the mark."
The dollar fell as low as 82.72 yen in Asian trading yesterday, its lowest level since April 26. In New York trading, the dollar settled at 83.27 yen, down from 83.96 yen on Friday.
The dollar fell to 1.3677 German marks from 1.3730 marks and to 1.1281 Swiss francs from 1.1346 francs.
But trading was lighter than usual yesterday because of holidays in London and Paris. In addition, dealers in Tokyo returned to their desks after a five-day holiday weekend.
While few currency dealers had expected an agreement to emerge from last week's trade talks between Japan and the United States, the possibility of an accord, however remote, had helped to underpin the dollar against the yen, dealers said. With that prop gone, the way may be clear for further dollar declines.
"The exporters still need to sell dollars," said Joe Francomano, foreign exchange trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York.
In other currency trading, the French franc gained against both the mark and the dollar after Jacques Chirac, the conservative Mayor of Paris, won the French presidential election on Sunday. Many currency dealers and analysts view Mr. Chirac as more likely to pursue prudent fiscal policies than his rival, Lionel Jospin, the Socialist Party candidate.
Doubts persist, though, about the commitment of Mr. Chirac to a strong franc, especially given his pledge to reduce unemployment.
In New York, the dollar fell to 4.8427 French francs, from 4.9055 francs on Friday.

HEADLINE: President Chirac

 BODY:
Unyielding determination and a populist campaign have at last won for Jacques Chirac the presidency of France, the prize he has sought for 14 years. Like the man he will replace, Francois Mitterrand, it took Mr. Chirac three tries to achieve his goal.
Mr. Chirac fought his way to a close victory, commendably resisting deals with the racist far right. He now restores the presidency to center-right control after 14 years of Socialist incumbency under Mr. Mitterrand. Conservatives have held a share of power since triumphing in parliamentary elections two years ago. But the Fifth Republic Constitution, designed for Charles de Gaulle, gives supreme power to the president, who names the Cabinet and directs foreign policy. 
 Like his mentor, General de Gaulle, Mr. Chirac is more of a socially minded nationalist than orthodox conservative. His main campaign theme was attacking France's 12 percent unemployment rate, for which he prescribed tax incentives and other government subsidies.
Americans will be interested in his positions on Bosnia, Europe and agriculture. He has hinted at a possible withdrawal of French peacekeepers from the former Yugoslavia, argued for more democratic checks on Brussels bureaucrats and made protection of French farmers a lifelong cause. But all of these positions involve other countries too, and Mr. Chirac will learn, as Mr. Mitterrand did, that even the powers of a French president are limited by the need to coordinate with allies and partners, especially other members of the European Union.
Lionel Jospin, the Socialist candidate defeated by Mr. Chirac in Sunday's runoff, did far better than anyone imagined at the start of his campaign. All the same, his party is now virtually shut out of national political power, with only the tiny parliamentary minority it retained in the 1993 conservative landslide.
If Mr. Chirac can now reunite the right, he will enjoy a concentration of power unrivaled in other Western democracies and unseen in France since the heady beginnings of the Mitterrand presidency in the early 1980's. May he use it well, for France and for Europe.

A decade ago, battered by three straight years of losses totaling $953 million, Caterpillar Inc. was a deeply wounded company that seemed to represent everything that had gone wrong in America's industrial heartland. And even after the company made its first efforts to slash bloated payrolls and overhaul outmoded factories to stave off tough foreign competition, it still lost $404 million in 1991, during the last recession. 
 Talk to Mr. Owens today, though, and he almost sounds as if he is looking forward to the next downturn. "We'd be profitable, in my opinion," if a slump like that of the early 1990's were to hit, he said. With another wrenching upheaval under his belt, said Mr. Owens, one of two group presidents at Caterpillar, "We are prepared to weather a recessionary environment now."
Even as businesses set new profit standards today, analysts say, it is inevitable that the economy, already slowing, must eventually fall into another recession. But the experience at Caterpillar, which has chalked up record earnings as it continues to operate through a bitter strike by the United Automobile Workers, is just one of a host of examples convincing many experts that Corporate America is better prepared than ever to ride out a future downturn without the horrendous financial losses of the past.
"Clearly companies have lowered their break-even points," said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. "They can do better in a low-volume situation, which is what we are likely to run into at some point."
While the overall economic rebound of the last few years has been moderate, Mr. Chimerine said, "it has been superb in terms of cash flow and debt reduction and profits; companies have accumulated a lot of cash."
How American business set itself up to generate big profits today while positioning itself to better absorb the shock of the next recession is a story that stirs mixed emotions. The millions of white-collar and blue-collar workers who suffered through wave after wave of layoffs in the last decade are still paying the price for Corporate America's hard-won financial rigor. They represent the human side of today's obsession with profits and efficiency.
Caterpillar, for instance, has continued to operate with replacement workers despite the yearlong U.A.W. walkout. The company insists it is just trying to create a more flexible and productive workplace. The union contends that the company, based in Peoria, Ill., has engaged in unfair labor practices. While an extreme case, Caterpillar's toughminded attititude toward labor unrest is now a central element of America's new corporate ethos.
The Big Three auto makers, which were struggling badly during much of the 1980's, have also sharply reduced costs and shortened the time it takes to get vehicles from the drawing board to the showroom floor.
In 1991, during the last recession, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler lost a combined $7.5 billion. "If it happened today, they'd come in slightly above break even, I believe," said David Healy, an independent analyst. "I don't think any of the companies would fall into real financial difficulty."
Many other companies have managed similar turnarounds. Harley-Davidson's heavy debt burden and lumbering culture made it look like a dinosaur a decade ago, when it came within days of bankruptcy. Now, after a remarkable revival aided by temporary tariffs against foreign competitors, it is enjoying soaring profits and strong demand for its motorcycles.
Harley-Davidson's share of the American market has grown from 3 percent in 1980 to 20 percent today. Based on suggestions from its customers -- who range from the Hell's Angels to clean-cut college students -- the company has done everything from lowering its seats to improving its engines.
"They've come back from the dead, and they're probably on the threshold of another big growth spurt," said Jill S. Krutick, an analyst at Smith Barney. "They could double their capacity and still not meet demand."
Most telling, even dynamic companies that have never lost a dime are taking drastic steps to streamline operations in response to heightened competition and the desire to sustain growth through tough times.
Consider Sun Microsystems Inc., the leading manufacturer of powerful work station computers. It dominated its industry even before starting a zealous efficiency campaign several years ago. Since then, Sun Microsystems has slashed the production time for one of its systems from three months after an order arrives to just 10 days.
Factory space was cut by two-thirds even as output jumped five-fold. Revenue per employee is up to $403,000 a year from $90,000 in 1989.
The company's executives believe they are in much better shape than their rivals. Consequently, when the next recession comes, says John Shoemaker, Sun Microsystems' vice president for worldwide operations, "we'll do better in that kind of environment than in good times."
A decade ago, companies argued that they were forced to cut shop-floor workers and layers of management primarily to meet the demands of a global marketplace. The strong dollar added to pressure by making imported goods less expensive. But now, the dollar is weak and many companies are sprinting to stay ahead because of their own profit goals and fear of domestic rivals.
To be sure, some experts warn against excessive optimism. The economy, while slowing, is still in the midst of a long expansion. That cyclical improvement may be covering over many remaining problems.
"Corporations are generally in a better position," said Michael Boskin, an economist at Stanford University who was President George Bush's chief economic adviser. "However, nobody should believe the American economy is immune to serious problems in a downtrend."
Meanwhile, corporate profits are expected to climb again this year, but by 10 percent or less, not the big jumps of 30 percent or more posted last year.
And some sectors, like retailing and apparel, are already in trouble and could suffer a great deal in the next economic downturn. The aerospace industry, now a victim of dwindling military budgets, is never expected to regain its former glory and profitability.
Moreover, some experts say the job of refitting corporations to be faster on their feet is far from finished. "Yes, American multinationals have gone a long way toward becoming more competitive," said James Champy, a consultant and a co-author of "Re-engineering the Corporation," one of the biggest business best sellers of recent years. "But this is a permanent revolution that we're going to be going through for the next 10 to 25 years or so."
Still, there are several reasons so many executives and experts are not as frightened as they once were at the prospect of a recession.
For one, profits have soared. First-quarter earnings, according to estimates by Standard & Poor's, rose more than 40 percent from a year earlier. That has helped fill corporate coffers with cash.
Chrysler's $7.5 billion stockpile of cash is the focus of the company's battle with its largest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian. Mr. Kerkorian contends that the company is now so efficient it does not need such a big cushion, while Chrysler says it needs the money to sustain crucial investments in the next recession.
Second, even some of the most vibrant American industries are going to extraordinary lengths to improve efficiency. Manufacturers of computers and electronic hardware, for example, have cut overall employment even as they continue to grow by leaps and bounds.
Bill Lewis, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, said, "We're going to see layoffs in the traditional parts of the economy on a continuing basis; we're always going to be shedding those jobs."
But that has been understood for years. What is surprising is that "even in computers it is going to continue," he said, adding, "It just shows how fast an industry like this matures these days."
Third, with inflation low and most people relieved just to have a steady job, wage demands are modest and pay increases have been held down for years. Companies are now moving to the next step by squeezing the costs of employee benefits. They are hacking away at everything from the costs of medical benefits to the generosity of retirement plans. Such costs were up a minuscule two-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.
Overall employment costs rose just 2.9 percent for the year that ended on March 31, the smallest increase since the Government began collecting the figures in 1982. Indeed, adjusted for inflation, wages for production workers are down by 12 percent since 1978.
Finally, manufacturing companies are continuing to upgrade their factories, improve just-in-time delivery systems to hold down excess inventories, and increase productivity, leading to an explosion in business investment.
Caterpillar has slashed its employment from nearly 90,000 in 1979 to 54,000 today. It closed nine manufacturing plants and spent $1.8 billion to modernize its remaining factories while reorganizing to give its 13 operating divisions more autonomy. Now, some components that once took 25 days to produce are stamped out in 6.
"We've almost doubled our productivity since the mid-1980's," Mr. Owens said.
This trend has affected nearly every industry. Despite the recession, which cut sharply into output, manufacturing productivity rose by 3.2 percent a year in the United States from 1990 through 1993. That is more than double Germany's 1.5 percent pace and Japan's 1.2 percent rate.
But the successes have come at a high price in terms of careers shattered and communities disrupted. And for all the traumas of the recent past, the experts concede that there is still more pain to come.
"I hate to use the term quick deaths," said George Shaheen, worldwide managing partner of Andersen Consulting, "but we'll see winners and losers very quickly in the next recession. The market is not very forgiving."

HEADLINE: Let That Be a Lesson;
Rutgers Ousts a Well-Liked but Little-Published Professor

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., May 5

 BODY:
As a teacher at Rutgers University, Richard L. Barr was called "outstanding," "exceptionally talented," "one of the best." But the stack of scholarly publications he submitted was described, in the precise grammar one would expect from an English Department tenure committee, as "not so thick as the usual packet for tenure."
So as of July, Dr. Barr, an assistant professor of English, will be just Richard Barr, lecturer, forbidden even to sign university letters of recommendations for his students and required to be gone entirely from Rutgers by the summer of 1996. In the hard world of publish or perish, Dr. Barr has crashed and burned. 
 At age 38, Dr. Barr has discovered that even at Rutgers, which promotes the idea of undergraduate-friendly teaching, the only guarantee of lifetime employment at a major research institution is to have a list of scholarly credits somewhat longer than two articles, two theater reviews and an unpublished book.
"Professor Barr has not achieved a level of scholarly accomplishment to justify promotion to the rank of associate professor with tenure," wrote Joseph J. Seneca, university vice president and chairman of the promotion review committee, in March.
The decision has distressed many of the devoted students to whom Dr. Barr has fed pizza and puns during his six years at Rutgers. After all, they point out, he has won three teaching awards, including the school's own Award for Distinguished Contributions to Undergraduate Teaching. To them, the denial of tenure is a repudiation of the promise Francis L. Lawrence made when he became president in 1990: to re-emphasize undergraduate education.
"I have to say that I'm terribly demoralized to be going out into the job market after seeing what the university has done to Rick," said Abby Attias, a doctoral candidate under Dr. Barr's supervision.
Dr. Barr is a cheerful man for all his worries, and one who speaks in the metaphor of the theater, his chosen field, and of the things the audience knows and does not know, which is his specialty.
"In the foreground there is a commitment to undergraduate excellence," he said. "The problem we have is that my case was widely perceived as the best test case of the rhetoric, and Rutgers flunked. This is a victory for the idea of excellence very narrowly displayed for a scholarly audience whose international membership is smaller than the undergraduate enrollment at Rutgers."
But to hear senior Rutgers faculty members tell it, the decision to give lifetime employment is rarely clear cut, and it has become still more complicated these days. For one thing, they say, New Jersey's eight state colleges have in recent years polished their national reputations as centers of undergraduate teaching, offering employment for great teachers who are less driven to do pure scholarship.
"Almost every Ph.D. student knows the situation nationwide that there are two kinds of institutions," said Richard Foley, dean of the School of Arts and Sciences. It was Dean Foley who informed Dr. Barr of his demotion, and who responded for the university to a request for comment on tenure issues at Rutgers.
(When Dr. Foley won tenure at the University of Notre Dame at age 33, he had published 20 scholarly articles and had won one teaching award. Like Dr. Barr, he had not yet published his first book. He has had two books published.)
While state colleges would welcome a teacher with Dr. Barr's record, reduced levels of state aid have made Rutgers hungrier for faculty members with reputations that attract grants and contracts that help pay the cost of running the vast network of campuses, said an economist at Rutgers's business school in Newark.
"It's a hard thing to say, but you don't get that way by being popular with the kids," the professor said, on condition of anonymity, citing a university rule against commenting on the specifics of a tenure matter.
Indeed, popularity with undergraduates can be a kind of warning flag, said another senior faculty member.
"We have seen patterns where some young faculty members are close to their students in age, they get along well with them, they play up to them, and maybe 25 years ago they would get tenure on that basis," the professor said. "But as time goes by, their teaching does not become rejuvenated because it was based on having values similar to the students, and as they get older they have no research to fall back on."
Sometimes a great teacher remains a great teacher, the professor conceded, "but in 90 percent of the time that doesn't happen," adding, "They hit 50 or 60 and they're no use to the university."
Ms. Attias, the graduate student, rejected this argument. "To suggest that Rick is some kind of social Pied Piper to the undergraduates is tremendously patronizing to Rick and to undergraduates," she said.
Defending the university, Dr. Foley said that the tenure process at Rutgers now took far longer than before precisely because the university was trying so hard to give recognition to gifted teachers, whose talents are harder to measure than those of prolific writers.
"There's a national recognition that there was some imbalance in the promotion process whereby teaching didn't always count enough," he said. "We do look for something in a candidate that is truly outstanding and I'm afraid what is often not understood is that, when it is a lifetime employment decision, the benefit of the doubt cannot go to the candidate for tenure."
During office hours in Dr. Barr's cramped, windowless and nearly chairless office in the basement of Murray Hall, Seema Lal, a junior who had a problem with an end-of-term paper, came in and sat comfortably on the floor next to Chris Haskell, a senior.
"I was an accounting major," Ms. Lal said. "I took Rick's introductory course on theater just to see what it was. He made me an English major."
Some of Dr. Barr's friends have urged him to file a grievance, which is allowed under the tenure review rules if an oversight can be proved. Dr. Barr said the committee had failed to notice several articles he had in the works.
But he did not seem to have much interest in going another round with the university, and in the next breath he spoke of walking away from campus life altogether.
"In three years I could become accredited as a psychotherapist," he said.

HEADLINE: Find Suggests Weaving Preceded Settled Life

BYLINE: By BRENDA FOWLER 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
SOME 27,000 years ago, an innovative group of hunters and gatherers were in the habit of setting up their summer base camps near a river along the Pavlov Hills in what is now the southeastern Czech Republic. They mixed the fine soil with water and molded it into human and animal figurines and fired them, creating the oldest known fired ceramics. They took the two-and-a-half-million-year-old technology of flaking stone tools a step further by grinding them into smoothly polished pendants and rings, the earliest known examples of ground stone technology in Europe.
And now, at a meeting here last week of the Society for American Archeology, scientists announced that this same group, contemporaries of the earliest cave painters of France and northern Spain, has left the oldest evidence of weaving in the world. The site has yielded clay fragments bearing impressions of textiles or basketry, which according to Dr. James M. Adovasio of Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa., and Dr. Olga Soffer of the University of Illinois at Urbana, push back the known origin of these technologies at least 7,000 years, to 27,000 years ago. 
 It also validates a suggestion long offered by some archeologists that the origin of textile technology by far predates the Neolithic period of plant and animal domestication to which it had traditionally been assigned. Archeologists tended to believe that people did not weave until they abandoned the migratory hunting and gathering way of life and settled into permanent agricultural villages with domesticated plants and animals, a process that was getting under way in many parts of the world by around 8000 B.C. and is known as the Neolithic. Once they were sedentary, the story went, they could develop such technologies as ceramics and weaving.
"I think this will really blow the socks off the Neolithic people because they always think they've got the first of everything," Dr. Soffer said in an interview. "We have this association of fabric and ceramics and ground stone technology with the Neolithic although we've known about ceramics from these people at Pavlov for a while, but it was written in Czech or German and it didn't make an impact."
Some scholars of the Upper Paleolithic, which in that part of the world stretches from about 40,000 to 12,000 years ago, had predicted that textiles might have been around at that time. "It's not very unexpected but it's very important," said Dr. Anthony Marks, an archeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
Textile specialists, especially, were encouraged by the discovery.
"It indicates how important textile structures are," said Dr. John Peter Wild, an archeologist at the University of Manchester in England. "You're way ahead of metals. The only technologies you have to compare it with in sheer brilliance of execution are stone implements. This is the organic technology that matches it."
Previously, the earliest known basketry dated to no earlier than around 13,000 years ago and the oldest piece of woven cloth was a 9,000-year-old specimen from Cayonu in southern Turkey. The oldest known twisted fibers, which could have been woven into basketry or textiles, were found in Israel and date to about 19,300 years ago.
Because baskets and textiles are made of organic materials, they perish rapidly once deposited, Dr. Adovasio said in an interview. Not surprisingly, the absence of hard evidence for textiles in the Paleolithic molded the theories on the origins and development of weaving technology.
The evidence presented last week consists of four small fragments of fired clay bearing negative impressions of a textile or finely twined basket, Dr. Soffer said. Along with hundreds of thousands of other artifacts at the rich site, they were excavated in 1954 by Dr. Bohuslav Klima, a Moravian archeologist. In the summer of 1990, Dr. Soffer, sorting through about 3,000 clay fragments in an effort to categorize them stylistically, noticed four pieces, about the size of a quarter, with markings on their concave sides.
She photographed them, with the notation "plant fibers?" and the next year showed them to her colleague, Dr. Adovasio, who, she said, went "absolutely ballistic."
Three radiocarbon dates of ashes at the site ranged from 24,870 to 26,980 years ago, and Dr. Soffer said the fragments could date from anytime between. She said she was entirely confident of the dating because there was no evidence at the site of any human occupation at all after 24,870 years ago, so the pieces could not have come from any other layers deposited later.
Analyzing magnified, high resolution photographs of the fragments, Dr. Adovasio determined that two fragments bore two different weaves and two bore indistinct parallel impressions that might be from warps, the vertical threads of a weave. He could see the alignment of the plant fibrils in the photographs so he knew the fibers were made of plant material, or bast, and not sinew, which can also be woven. Among the plants that could have provided bast were the yew and alder trees or the milkweed and nettle, the researchers said.
The archeologists did not know whether the impressions were made intentionally or accidentally. Many of the fragments were found in ash deposits. Analysis of all four showed that they had been fired at 600 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is consistent with a simple kiln or a bonfire, or even a dwelling burning down, Dr. Soffer said. One possibility is that the woven item was unintentionally pressed into wet clay near a hearth -- perhaps by walking on it -- and subsequently fired.
Because the fragments are so small and no selvage, or defined edge, is apparent on them, Dr. Adovasio could not determine what they came from. He said the mesh would have been similar to that in a potato sack and might have come from a bag, mat, clothing or a basket. While it would have been possible to make the pieces without some sort of loom, it would have been far easier using one, he said, even if that meant only tying one end of the warp around a tree and the other around one's waist.
"This demonstrates an amazing investment of energy," he said.
Dr. Elizabeth J. W. Barber, a prehistoric textile scholar at Occidental College in Los Angeles, noted that plain, or true weave, involved passing a weft, or horizontal, thread over one warp thread, under the next warp thread, over the next and so one. If a nonflexible stick is woven through the warp like this, then the process can be mechanized halfway. Raising the stick lifts up every other thread of the warp (or whichever warp threads are required for the desired weave) and the weft thread can be speedily pulled through. For the following pass, the position of the separated warp threads must be reversed and that is where a heddle, which individually holds the warp threads of the second group and attaches them to a bar, comes in.
The type of weave in the Pavlov clay fragments is "twining"; though it too can produce a cloth, it cannot be mechanized because the parallel weft threads cross each other. Dr. Barber said twining produced a more stable weave because the weft threads twisted around each other and prevented sliding.
"When you see them switching from twining over to the true weave or plain weave by around 7000 B.C., then they've figured out mechanization," she said. "They've given up stability of weave for speed of production."
Dr. Adovasio noted that twining itself was already a relatively advanced form of weaving technology. He suggested twining might even be as much as 40,000 years old.
"If they're making this, then they're making cordage," said David Hyland, an archeologist at Gannon University in Erie, Pa. Cordage, essentially plant fibers twisted together, includes string and rope.
"And if they can make this, they can make anything in the way of a net, trap or snare," said Dr. Adovasio, who believes that because of the scarcity of evidence, prehistorians had underestimated the importance of woven materials in early peoples' lives. Conversely, he said, because of their relative abundance, stone tools have been overemphasized in archeologists' interpretations of prehistoric economies.
"I don't buy a lot of the gender studies stuff," began Dr. Adovasio. "But mostly men have done the analysis of Paleolithic sites and they have in their minds the macho hunter of extinct megafauna. Guys who hunt woolly mammoths are not supposed to be making these."
The model of the Paleolithic men going off with spears to hunt while the women stayed home and gathered plants around the camp may be too simple, he said.
"Maybe they killed one mammoth every 10 years and never stopped talking about it," Dr. Soffer said.
At the Pavlov and nearby Dolni Vestonice sites, for example, Dr. Klima unearthed far more bones of smaller animals than of mammoths. While the former may have been hunted with spears, it is more likely that nets were used to capture small animals like rabbits, the archeologists said.
"This tool," noted Dr. Hyland, of cloth, "represents a much greater level of success where used for hunting than lithic tools."
Dr. Adovasio, who has been working with textiles for more than 25 years, said he hoped the discovery would inspire archeologists to learn more about how textiles and basketry decayed and to pay more attention to the possibility that textiles or their impressions are preserved on sites.
One mystery is what became of the apparently advanced technologies of these Central European hunters and gatherers after 22,000 years ago, when, as the weather gradually turned colder, the archeological record of their presence in the Pavlov Hills suddenly ceased.
"You've got the huge Scandinavian ice sheet coming down from the north and glaciers coming from the Alps and you get this no-man's land and people get out of there," Dr. Soffer said.
She suspects that some went east and some southeast. But except for a few random fired ceramics and bits of net or cord in eastern Europe, the technologies themselves remain silent for the next 7,000 to 10,000 years. When they resurface, the skills the Pavlov people employed so fancifully have been converted to practical purpose. The technique of stone grinding, instead of being used in decorative items alone, is now applied to making hoes and axes. Fired clay turns up not in figurines but in cooking and storage vessels.
"It had never dawned on these people that they could make a pot," Dr. Soffer noted.
Textiles and basketry, too, anchor themselves firmly into the technological landscape.
"It's like who invented the first flying machine? Leonardo da Vinci," Dr. Soffer said. "But Boeing didn't start making them until this century. There has to be a social and economic context for new technology. If you don't have the context, then it won't really go anywhere."

HEADLINE: Lead-Based Battery Used in Electric Car May Pose Hazards

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
For years, electric cars and vans powered by lead-based batteries have been promoted as a way to reduce health-damaging urban smog. But now the potential risk from production of the batteries, long quietly acknowledged, is drawing more careful scrutiny from scientists, and their findings are alarming.
In a forthcoming study, three researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh suggest that emissions from mining, smelting and recycling the lead needed for a large fleet of electrical vehicles would pose serious threats to public health. 
 Thus, while Government regulations requiring the sale of electric cars are intended to improve public health by limiting smog, they may have the indirect effect of exposing thousands of people living or working near industrial sites to toxic doses of lead.
"We're talking about very real health hazards," said Robert Hahn, an environmental economist at the American Enterprise Institute. "This could be the kiss of death for electric vehicles."
The potential risk from lead batteries illustrates a fundamental conundrum for policy makers. Aggressive efforts to clean up the air, water and land often drive rapid changes in technology, which in themselves may prove hazardous. Even seemingly more benign battery technologies based on other materials could have unintended consequences.
"Loading the environment with any primary metal is going to lead to problems," said Dr. Ellen Silbergeld, a toxicologist at the University of Maryland Medical School.
Exposure to low levels of lead can harm the brains of young children, reducing intelligence and impairing neurobehavioral development, studies have found. Very severe exposure can cause coma, convulsions and death.
The electric car question has its origins in the Clean Air Act, which set tough health standards for ozone exposure. To meet them, California, New York and Massachusetts are demanding the introduction of "zero emissions vehicles" by 1998, with 10 percent of all new cars meeting the zero-emissions test by the year 2003.
The only zero-emissions vehicles close to mass production are powered by electricity that is stored by conventional means. "First-generation electric cars will have lead-acid batteries," said Bob Hayden, executive director of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas.
Electric cars have already run a gantlet of controversy. Auto makers maintain that vehicles using current technology, which have a very limited range, could not be sold at cost -- even in the modest numbers mandated by state rules. Thus, they say, they will be forced to "cross-subsidize" buyers, raising the prices of conventional internal combustion cars to cover the difference.
Many economists who share the policy makers' sense of urgency in containing urban smog are nonetheless critical of the zero-emissions requirement because it does not give auto makers the flexibility to meet the targeted emissions level for automobiles with less radical technology. And even some environmentalists acknowledge problems underlying the electric car remedy. They note that the extra electricity generated to charge car batteries will come from power plants that also generate pollution.
"Of course there are trade-offs," said David Driesen of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
In an article to appear this month in the journal Science, Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon, along with Chris Hendrickson and Francis McMichael, his colleagues in engineering, estimate a life-cycle scenario for emissions associated with lead-acid batteries. Their scenario, "available technology," is based on the specifications of the General Motors Impact vehicle, now being tested around the country. The study was supported largely by the National Science Foundation, with other funds from I.B.M. and A.T.& T.
To create a best-case scenario, the researchers imagine a "goal technology" car with batteries that use one-third as much lead to generate the same amount of power, yet last twice as long. They use data from the Bureau of Mines, an agency of the Interior Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency to estimate the amount of lead that would be lost in the environment during the life-cycle of the battery from both scenarios.
According to their calculations, an "available technology" car would indirectly generate 1,350 milligrams of lead emissions for each kilometer (about five-eighths of a mile) traveled. The "goal technology" car does much better, at 120 milligrams of lead per kilometer. But a car using even this relatively clean technology would push six times as much lead into the environment as a tiny Geo Metro burning gasoline with the lead additives that were gradually eliminated in the 1980's.
The form of the pollutant matters, of course. Lead from leaded gasoline went out the vehicle's tailpipe; the Carnegie Mellon scientists concede that five-sixths of the emissions from smelting and recycling would be more manageable solids and liquids.
As important, emissions from leaded gasoline were concentrated in urban areas, while emissions from the battery life-cycle would be focused near smelters and recyclers. "Location isn't everything," says Rob Stavins, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, "but it's almost everything."
Dr. Silbergeld, the toxicologist, is not mollified. "Lead particles can move long distances," she said. "This is potentially a global problem."
She also worries that in their zeal to encourage the recycling of lead batteries, regulators have underestimated the risks from recycling plants, many of which operate near urban areas.
Thus, while it may be technically possible to clean up lead smelting and reprocessing, there is little indication that the Government has the will or skill to do the job. Nor is there hard evidence about how much cleaner lead technologies would add to the already high cost of electric vehicles.
The magnitude of the health problem depends, of course, on the number of vehicles powered by lead batteries. But even the relatively modest penetration implied by the state mandates could generate large-scale emissions.
If just 5 percent of the 200 million vehicles in the United States were powered by batteries made entirely of lead processed by responsible recyclers, Mr. Lave estimates that an extra 21,000 tons of lead would be released each year into the environment. That would nearly double the amount now lost in smelting and manufacturing.
Environmentalists who want to keep the pressure on Detroit to build electric vehicles expect that technology and economics will eventually favor materials more benign than lead. But that is only a hope.
Batteries based on nickel, nickel-cadmium, sulfur-sodium and lithium all show some promise, as do hybrid systems combining smaller batteries with flywheels or capacitors to meet peak power demands. But they are likely to remain more expensive than lead-acid systems, which in turn cost far more to build and operate than the cleanest-running internal combustion engines.
"We haven't closed the door on other technologies," said Chris Preuss, a spokesman for Chrysler, "but it's not looking good."
David Hawkins, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council and an architect of the Clean Air Act, thinks the risks implied by forcing electric cars into the nation's vehicular fleet are worth taking. The alternative, he said, is dependence on super-clean gasoline engines that require careful, and politically unpopular, inspection and maintenance.
"We think it makes more sense to try to pick winners than to settle for losers," Mr. Hawkins said.
But others are critical of using environmental policy to force industry to invent new technologies in general, and the zero-emissions mandate in particular. "Regulation leads to innovation," says George Eads, a consultant in Washington and a former chief economist at General Motors, "but it is often the wrong innovation."
Mr. Eads also maintains that the strict timetable for zero-emissions vehicles, meant as a wake-up call for Detroit, has already had a perverse effect. Since auto makers are under immense pressure to put electric cars on the road that will not haunt them with repair or safety problems, "the mandate puts a premium on using the most conservative technological option," he said -- in this case, lead-acid batteries.
"Getting rid of lead in gasoline was one of the great public health triumphs of our generation," Mr. Lave said. "It would be a tragedy if we reversed the benefits in the name of environmentalism."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
The Roots of Terrorism In the Power of Speech

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
In a typically acidulous mood, H. L. Mencken wrote in 1929: "The danger of free speech does not lie in the menace of ideas, but in the menace of emotions. If words were merely logical devices, no one would fear them. But when they impinge upon a moron they set off his hormones, and so they are justifiably feared. Complete free speech, under democracy, is possible only in a foreign language."
Mencken, as usual, was referring to the Puritanical spirit, mob mentality and generally dim intellectual powers of the booboisie, particularly when joined in prayer, boostership or vigilantism. How he would deal with the issues of liberty and democracy stirred by the Oklahoma City bombing, we can only surmise. But with much concern being voiced these days over the power of words, his own words retain considerable force. 
 Though always willing to assume the worst about politicians as a class, Mencken could not have resisted doing a job on the politician-hating militia members who have recently been discovered by television. Their comical camouflage, sappy strutting and he-man pretentions, their free-floating charges, rote slogans and bellicose incoherence, all lately displayed on screen, would have been rich grist for a writer who found joy in reviewing the latest vaudeville acts of his countrymen.
The militianiks are a very small bunch, but television interviews in their neighborhoods and the comments of callers to various television and radio programs indicate their ravings are considered worth something by many outside their circle. The ground has been prepared by the ranters of the airwaves. To judge by the popularity and apparent influence of radio and television yakkers, millions of Americans are intellectually deprived or emotionally disadvantaged.
Although President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich may safely inveigh against those whose words may have somehow inspired a terrorist bomber or a mother who killed her children, no politician is likely to suggest in public that the main argument against free speech is the susceptibility of the audience. When an office holder or a campaigner utters the phrase "the American People" (by all odds the most-uttered phrase on the Sunday interview programs) it is in tones of respect shading into reverence. Politicians can teach a thing or two to television producers about pandering to the customer.
Sure there is too much rant, too much hate and of course too much violence on most channels, many radio stations and elsewhere along the ever expanding, mercilessly accessible information highway. The sewage in the flow cannot be good for the national ecology. The legal problem is making the connection between a G. Gordon Liddy instructing his fans on where to shoot a Federal agent and an actual act of terrorism.
But you can't blame television or radio for violence in America; it's as old as the nation. In the past, Americans have by and large resisted the worst rabble-rousers and probably, with outrages like Oklahoma City fresh in mind, will continue to do so. But the times they could be a-changing.
What is new is the reach, impact and audacity of all sorts of what is loosely termed communication, combined today with nervous-making economic difficulties and social strains in big cities and small towns, with the political fragmentation and religious zealotry of the New World Order and with easier ways of making more destructive explosives. The Justice Department would be remiss if it did not take into account the fact that your common run of monomaniac or wishful martyr can build a bomb and be induced to use it.
The stock in trade of the yakkers -- that powerful forces in and out of Government are kicking around just plain folks -- can only agitate receptive hormones. The enduring problem that Mencken so frequently and entertainingly described is the vulnerability of democracy to demagogy, a condition that has been much heightened by the noise explosion. So Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich had better begin worrying more about the audience than about the performers. Whether the fertilizer comes from Oliver North or Oliver Stone or a white separatist or a black nationalist, it seems to find a volatile following.
The current pressure on the yakkers to tone down their agitprop is deserved, but they will assuredly be at it again as long as their shows get the ratings. By comparison, the soap operas they have nudged aside are harmless diversions; the soaps may not do much for the mind, but they do not poison the political air.
It is not for a democratic government to tell people what to listen to or watch. What a reviewer can suggest (how Mencken would have scorned this milk-and-water prescription) is that the welcome being given to the merchants of rant should draw the most urgent attention to the schools that continue not to educate and the conditions that continue to unhinge, with all respect, the American People.

HEADLINE: U.S. Blacks Pledge Aid For Africa

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The American minister who organized a conference in Senegal that brought together 1,000 black Americans and 4,000 African government officials and business executives said today that the meeting was the first step toward building a movement for American blacks to help Africa.
The Rev. Leon Sullivan, the civil rights leader from Philadelphia who organized the conference, said the Americans who attended pledged to promote trade with Africa, defend foreign aid to that continent and set up education and health projects to help dozens of countries. 
 "A new movement is being born among African-Americans," Mr. Sullivan said in an interview. "We're going to build bridges to Africa. We're going to put our skills and training to work to help Africa."
Twenty African Presidents and Prime Ministers attended the Dakar conference, which ended last Friday. Mr. Sullivan said the 1,000 black Americans there represented "the largest number of blacks to return to Africa since the end of slavery."
Among those attending were Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Participants said the conference emphasized trade and investment more than it did foreign assistance.
"Trade, not aid, and the power of Africans and African-owned enterprises in the international marketplace will bring hope and progress to this continent," Mr. Brown said.
He said American business has a crucial role to play to create jobs and teach skills in Africa. "America will no longer concede the African marketplace to Europeans," he said.
African leaders urged the industrial world to forgive much of the continent's $300 billion foreign debt, while American officials and executives said African countries needed to do more to reduce inflation and budget deficits and improve education.
During the official sessions, there was little effort to urge African nations like Nigeria to embrace democracy. Mr. Sullivan said the purpose of the meeting was to promote economic development and education.
He vowed to build a movement in which one million American blacks were committed to help Africa. He said he wanted these blacks to help Africa as much as Polish-Americans help Poland and American Jews help Israel.
In his keynote address, Mr. Sullivan urged American blacks to obtain dual citizenship with an African country as a means of strengthening their ties with that continent.
He said his movement will press Congress not to cut aid to Africa, saying that it is hard for African countries to move toward democracy when tens of millions of people on the continent are hungry.
"What Congress is trying to do to aid to Africa is denigrating to black people in the United States," he said. "American aid is a lifeline to a lot of people in Africa."

Still Pricier Fountain Pens Gain Cachet and Profit

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany

 BODY:
To the generation accustomed to the Web and cyberspatial schmoozing, the fountain pen is about as useful as a quill. But to increasing numbers of people, it is an item of such allure that they think nothing of paying a sum that could get a computer aficionado a down payment on a respectable laptop.
In the $5 billion worldwide market in writing instruments -- everything from plastic ballpoints to gold-nibbed fountain pens -- the fastest-growing segment is in premium pens, those costing more than $50. 
 Spurring this boom is a clientele receptive to the idea that expensive fountain pens are antidotes to the ubiquity and instant obsolescence of many high-tech products. Not since the heyday of fountain pens in the 1910's and 20's has there been a greater variety of pens offered in department and stationery stores.
The potential market for pens is much wider now than it was in the 80's, when fountain pens came back into vogue after a hiatus of a few decades. The traditional markets for fountain pens are the United States and Europe. But, says Christopher Rhodes, marketing director of the Gillette stationery products division in Britain, demand is particularly strong now in the vibrant economies of Asia and among emerging elites in Eastern Europe and Russia.
Elysee, a German-owned company, set up American headquarters in 1991 in the Chatsworth area of Los Angeles, offering pens ranging in price from $65 to $450. Each year since, it has seen a 50 percent increase in sales. Gillette -- the razor, personal-care products and writing-instrument conglomerate based in Boston, and owner of the Paper Mate, Parker and Waterman companies -- had a nearly 10 percent rise last year in premium-pen sales in the United States.
The Geneva-based Vendome Group, parent company of Montblanc, Dunhill and Cartier, all prestige pens, reported 1993-94 sales of writing instruments totaling about $290 million, an 11 percent increase over the previous year.
These days, the customers being sought ever more aggressively by premium-pen companies are not board-room types or collectors who seek the limited editions of pen sets costing thousands of dollars. Increasingly, the targets are those who have not thought of using anything other than the ballpoint or roller ball or people who have just discovered the fountain pen and are willing to venture up into the premium price range.
In their marketing campaigns, pen companies are seeking to persuade the unconverted that when you've made it -- or when you want people to think you've made it -- you should say it in writing. The campaigns tout fountain pens as ego-boosting devices that will transform even indifferent penmanship into what a Montblanc ad campaign calls "the art of writing." The latest Parker ads suggest that a fancy pen will bring out the poet in the purchaser.
Pen marketers don't have to explain why their products are getting more expensive as computers become cheaper. In this fast-changing cyber-age, they can make much of the notion that their products have investment value, and an esthetic far superior to that of the latest wunderchip.
"For the customer today, the idea that a product will be more expensive in five years' time than when they bought it is not worrying," said Norbert A. Platt, Montblanc's chief executive, "because everything you buy today is devalued when you buy it and that's true of all high-tech products." A pen, Mr. Platt noted in an interview here, "might last not only for a lifetime but also for the lifetime of a son or daughter."
This, he added, "is a very reassuring thought."
Over the last seven or eight years, Montblanc's prices have doubled -- far exceeding production costs. The company's limited-edition Writer series -- with pens named after Ernest Hemingway, Agatha Christie, Oscar Wilde and Voltaire -- costs more than $1,500 for a set of fountain pen, ball pen and retractable pencil. In what Montblanc calls its De la Culture series, production is restricted to 4,810 fountain pens, each costing $1,700.
The limited-edition market continues to grow, said Nancy Olson, editor of Pen World in Dallas. The reason seems obvious. Aurora's limited-edition Carlo Goldoni fountain pen, which sold for about $900 when its 1,492 units went on the market in 1993, now sells for three times that.
Montblanc executives say collectors have been known to pay as much as five times the original price for some of their limited-edition pens within a few years of their manufacture.
For the rich collector, Montblanc will build a special-order, diamond-studded, solid gold version of its classic black Meisterstuck fountain pen for around $120,000, probably the most expensive fountain pen in the world. The solid gold Aurora Optima pen sells for about $1,900; the new Waterman model, the Edson, for about $700.
Jostling for an edge over their competitors, premium-pen companies are constantly trying to come up with that extra special product. "There has been a shift to pens that are unusual, that have character, that are much more a statement of personality," Mr. Rhodes of Gillette said.
A. T. Cross, long known for its thin gold pens, came out in 1993 with fatter pens in various lacquer colors. Its newest has a lapis blue coating, using powdered lapis lazuli, that is flecked with gold and costs $350.
To sell itself as purveyor to the carriage trade, Montblanc in the mid-80's discontinued a range of cheaper writing instruments. "We believed we could build a business by focusing entirely on the upper type of manufacturing," Mr. Platt said. He declined to offer details of his company's operations, but said production was kept lower than capacity to maintain scarcity.
Montblanc tries to maintain a certain mystique, as well: the black resin for its pens is made from a mixture as closely guarded a secret as the formula for Coca-Cola. In addition, the number 4,810 -- the height in meters of the highest peak in the French Alps, Mont Blanc -- recurs on nibs, limited editions and in the number of diamonds set in the $120,000 Meisterstuck Solitaire Royal.
Elysee, which was bought by Staedtler Mars, a German drawing-instruments company, in 1991, emphasizes the way its pens are made. According to its promotional brochures, its pen makers in Pforzheim, Germany, use processes particular to jewelry making -- such as layering platinum plating over gold plating or filling sculptured paneling with lacquer or applying yellow gold plate to a layer of black gold.
Manufacturers are coming up with other ways of increasing their sales. In 1992, Montblanc took over Seeger, a high-quality German leather- and travel-goods company, so it could offer leather writing accessories like organizers and pen wallets. It also sells its own high-price writing paper.
With nostalgia a big selling point nowadays -- and capitalizing on a thriving market for old pens -- many high-end pen companies are tapping into that market.
In the United States, Capella just came out with a sterling silver Victorian-look ballpoint that sells for $125. Later this year, Parker will offer a limited-edition fountain pen named Mandarin Yellow that is a throwback to Duofold orange pens of the 1920's.
The price tag: $750.

HEADLINE: Plan to Abolish Commerce Dept. Risky for G.O.P.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The most prominent Government department chosen for elimination in the Republican budget announced today is also the one that the Clinton Administration has declared to be the Government's most potent weapon in an age of international economic conflict: the Commerce Department.
Under the budget proposal, presented by Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the parts of the Commerce Department that have promoted American exports abroad and paid for research in new technology would be ended outright. Other functions of the department, which has a budget of $4.2 billion this year, would be spread among other Government entities. 
 It is an odd political calculus, because American business executives -- including some traditional supporters of the Republican Party -- have been big enthusiasts of the Commerce Department in recent years. They argue that after years of mismanagement, the department has finally learned how to compete with Japan and Germany in securing contracts for American business abroad. But to Mr. Domenici and many other Republicans, the Commerce Department represents everything that the new Republican majority in Congress is out to abolish, a symbol of Government interference in the market economy.
"The budget that we put before you presents hard choices, and I make no apologies for that," Mr. Domenici said. "The American people by overwhelming majorities, 80 percent of them, want a balanced budget."
The Administration was quick to denounce the Republican plan, which predicts savings of a billion dollars a year after the department is dismantled. "I would characterize the proposals as ludicrous," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said in a telephone interview today. "They are best described as unilateral disarmament in the battle for global competitiveness."
It is a theme that the Administration is likely to strike again on Wednesday, when the White House is expected to announce that President Clinton has decided to proceed with trade sanctions against Japan for its unwillingness to agree to purchase more American automobiles and parts. Commerce Department officials have played a central role in the negotiations and in designing what they call advocacy programs to press the cause of American businesses abroad.
Mr. Brown said today that the department's International Trade Administration, which runs the "war room" that tracks American business efforts abroad and uses everyone from President Clinton on down to advance their cause, has helped businesses win $25 billion in contracts, on a budget of $250 million a year.
Many business leaders have come to the defense of the Commerce Department in recent months. C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of Hughes Electronics, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, said today: "It's easy to forget that many of the big deals and large transactions these days are not business to business; they are between American business and some Government entity -- an Indonesian energy project, or a Chinese satellite, or a Norwegian missile. I'm not saying that we can't reduce the size of the bureaucracy, or consolidate the number of Government agencies that deal in exports. But to get rid of these functions, that would be madness."
There are competing theories about why the Commerce Department is seen as such a ripe target. One is Mr. Brown's own political vulnerability: He is under investigation for a variety of private dealings, and many Republicans have said in recent months that he is not in a strong position to defend his own department. He replied today, "If they are expecting me to roll over, they are mistaken."
A second theory is that the constituency of the Commerce Department is limited. Its programs do not have the reach of Medicare or even the Education Department.
And a third is that the Republican leadership is betting that big business, in the end, will not come to the aid of the department. Business leaders, according to this theory, are interested first in lower taxes and second in the dismantlement of Government regulation. Winning business abroad, this argument goes, comes in a distant third.
The Democrats are betting that the strategy will backfire, especially at a time of renewed trade tension with Japan. The business advocacy effort and the department's Advanced Technology Program, which provides seed money for technological ventures, were responses to the kinds of Government initiatives that Japan and other major industrialized nations have promoted for years. "It's a rare chance that you can make the case that Republicans are anti-business and anti-exports," one of Mr. Clinton's advisers said late today. "And this is that chance."
In fact, breaking up the Commerce Department may have more symbolic effect than budget impact. More than a third of its budget, or about $1.78 billion, goes to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the Government's primary weather-prediction operations and would in large part be preserved under the proposal. The contribution of the Commerce Department to research and development -- one of the main targets of the Republicans -- is about 1 percent of all Government R.& D. spending.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Offers Budget That Balances

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
After months of making many promises but offering few specifics, Republican senators today proposed a historic plan that showed in actual dollars and cents how they hope to balance the Federal budget with cuts in projected Government spending of nearly $1 trillion over the next seven years.
Money would be saved in virtually every area of Government except Social Security, which would be untouched, and law enforcement, where spending would be allowed to rise by about 20 percent over the period. Military spending would basically be frozen, with no increase allowed for inflation. 
 The plan, called a budget resolution, is the first step in what is expected to be an arduous journey that will take most of the rest of the year and almost certainly dominate political discourse. Republicans in the House of Representatives will present their budget plan on Wednesday.
In many respects, the Senate plan is short on details. Democrats maintained that the Republicans still had no notion of what some of the biggest spending reductions would entail. They were especially critical of the lack of specifics about how to save money in Medicare. The Republicans would turn over decisions about Medicare to a bipartisan commission rather than bear the political heat of making those decisions directly.
The most prominent Government department that would be eliminated under the plan is also one that the Clinton Administration has declared to be the Government's most potent weapon in global economic battles: the Commerce Department. [Business Day, page D1.]
In terms of dollars saved, the biggest bite would come in the Government's health programs -- Medicare, which covers the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid, which covers the poor. Under the plan, Medicare spending would be $255.6 billion, or 15 percent, below what it would be without changes in the law governing the program. Medicaid spending would be $175 billion less, or 18 percent. But few details were offered about what policies would be changed to achieve those savings.
Spending for the programs would continue to rise, but the rate of growth would be slowed, to 7.1 percent from 10 percent for Medicare and to 5 percent from 10 percent for Medicaid. Republicans said the Medicare savings were needed in part to keep the trust fund that finances hospital care from going bankrupt in 2002.
As an indication of the political wars ahead, dozens of retirees spread across Capitol Hill today to protest the Medicare figures. Many wore buttons asserting that retired people would have to pay $900 a year more for their health care under the Republicans' plans.
Some smaller Government programs would be cut even more deeply in percentage terms than the health programs. Energy programs, for example, would be cut by 39 percent, and spending for community and regional development programs would be 32 percent lower.
The resolution, the first ever offered envisioning a balanced budget, was presented to the Senate Budget Committee by Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman.
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the head of the Budget Committee, plans to offer a parallel measure on Wednesday. Tonight, he issued a sketchy statement indicating that the cuts he would make in projected spending would be even deeper than Senator Domenici's.
That is because over the seven-year period the House measure must offset about $350 billion in tax cuts that were approved by the House last month. The Senate has not acted on the tax bill, and Senator Domenici's proposal makes no allowance for such a loss of revenue.
The purpose of a budget resolution is to set dollar limits for broad categories of Government programs like transportation, agriculture, education and the military. The resolution makes suggestions for how the targets can be met, but they are only for guidance, and the actual policy decisions are left for later.
In many instances, though, Senator Domenici's proposed budget resolution offers precise suggestions for how the savings could be achieved.
It recommends, for example, eliminating Federal operating subsidies for mass transit and Amtrak. In suggesting that the Commerce Department be abolished, it proposes transferring the department's most essential agencies to other departments. It would terminate President Clinton's volunteer service program and cut financing for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities in half.
But in places where the political choices are tougher to make, especially Medicare and Medicaid, the Domenici proposal was shy of specifics. In the case of Medicare, for instance, the chairman proposed only that the bipartisan commission develop the policies necessary to reduce spending by 15 percent.
The administration of Medicaid would be turned over to the states, and poor people might no longer be entitled to benefits merely because they meet the eligibility requirements. Beyond that, no details were offered about how the spending target could be hit.
For Senator Domenici, scarred from many budget battles of the past, the submission of his proposal today was the fulfillment of a dream. "I'm thrilled today to present the first balanced budget in about 25 years," he told his committee. "I'm very proud."
For years, he has argued for a balanced budget. Democrats have always responded, "Put up or shut up."
Today, whatever the drawbacks in his offering, he answered that challenge.
Under criticism from Democrats that he was protecting the privileged while cutting programs for the poor and elderly, Senator Domenici declared, "It's going to turn out to be fair."
But Democrats were skeptical. Referring to the plan to have a commission figure out what cuts to make in Medicare, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina said, "You and I have been in Government long enough to know that's a cop-out."
If Senator Domenici's resolution prevails, no large tax cuts would be at hand, but he held out the possibility that some might come later.
Economists believe that if Congress adopts a credible balanced budget plan, the nation would enjoy a stronger economy because interest rates would fall. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this economic dividend, small at first, might save $170 billion over the next seven years in interest payments on Government bonds.
Senator Domenici proposed that this dividend go for tax cuts. But the amount would be tiny in the first few years and reach a meaningful level only after the turn of the century.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is running for the Republican Presidential nomination, has promised to offer a tax-cut amendment when the budget resolution reaches the Senate floor, probably next week. But by most accounts, the Gramm amendment will be voted down.
In fact, the Republicans' party discipline is such that the budget resolutions are likely to sail through the Senate and House unscathed. But the solid front may crack when the time comes later in the year to tally up who would lose the most from the budget cuts.
Already, Senator Domenici has made some concessions to politics. Cognizant of a furor that developed in March after the House voted to reduce the Federal school lunch program, Mr. Domenici left that popular program alone.
Based on the material presented tonight, the House budget resolution would one-up Mr. Domenici in several respects. Where the Senator would abolish one Cabinet department, for example, Mr. Kasich would shut down three: Commerce, Education and Energy.
"We're doomed without this," Mr. Kasich said tonight after he had outlined his proposal for fellow Republican representatives. "It's now or never."

HEADLINE: BOARD IS GIVING IN OVER SCHOOL CUTS

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Board of Education officials conceded yesterday that they are likely to find a way to cut the school bureaucracy by hundreds of millions of dollars next year without affecting classrooms very much, just as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said they could.
Their conciliatory tone is a dramatic shift. Since last June, each time the Mayor issued orders to slash, arguing that the city could ill afford to support a bloated school system, Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines and other school officials responded that they could cut some, but warned of bigger classes and teaching layoffs. Since then, though, the school system has cut $540 million from the board headquarters bureaucracy by eliminating 2,000 jobs, cutting back on school supplies and ending extras like some sports programs. 
 Now, the same officials are saying that they are close to meeting the Mayor's target of reducing the total budget by an additional $400 million, from $8.5 billion, to $8.1 billion, and the classrooms will largely be insulated from the cuts.
"The billion-dollar problem is going to be solved in one year," Leonard Hellenbrand, the budget director for the Board of Education, said at a budget briefing for reporters yesterday. "It's a daunting challenge, but we have to do it."
There is no doubt that students and parents will feel some of the pain of the budget ax: bigger special-education classes, fewer after-school programs and almost no money for arts and music, officials said. But no teacher layoffs are planned, and class sizes should not grow significantly next year even though school enrollment is expected to rise by about 20,000 students.
The air of resignation at the Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn signals what may be a new spirit of cooperation between school officials and City Hall. Where once there was public feuding between Mr. Cortines and the Mayor over how much the school budget could stand to be reduced, now both sides are working together to find a way to accomplish the streamlining of the giant school system.
"There is a much more positive approach on both sides right now, and it's very, very positive for both the city and the school system," the Mayor said in an interview. "At times in the past, there was a feeling that the city was hiding money on the board, and the board was hiding money on the city, and it took a while for the board to understand that we were not hiding money and we were not playing games with them."
Dr. Robert Berne, dean of New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, said both the Mayor and the Chancellor, in spite of their earlier bickering, both essentially want the same thing: a better public education for New York City children. The two, he said, have probably finally concluded that their feuding was counterproductive.
"Now, the decibel level has lowered significantly," he said.
Yesterday, Mr. Hellenbrand and Barry F. Sullivan, who as chief operations officer for the Board of Education is effectively the system's No. 2 official, said they were still trying to find the last $149 million in savings. This is all spending that they are obligated to do by law or labor agreements.
For example, they said, the labor contract with teachers requires the board to spend $584,043 for teacher sabbaticals, while the city budgeted nothing for that category.
School officials said they needed $2 million for psychologists required in the special education area. The city budget gave them nothing for that category.
Also, school officials estimated that they would need $468,166 to cover postal rate increases because of inflation. The city budgeted no money for such an expenditure.
Mr. Sullivan said school lobbyists in Albany were working to relieve the school system of some of the costly requirements for special education that critics have said are not necessary. That may bring relief in much of the $150 million shortfall.
Mr. Hellenbrand and Mr. Sullivan say the final tally is almost $1 billion from what the system needs. In this total, they are including such things as loss of one-time funds for certain programs and other revenue they counted on for next year's budget.
The board's projection for its budget shortfall constantly changes throughout the year as spending exceeds projections and anticipated revenues do not come in exactly as expected. During this school year, the school system was told to make cuts several times as the Mayor discovered new shortfalls in the city budget, which supplies nearly half of the school budget.
School officials said they did not want to minimize the pain the school system will undergo with a budget that must be tightened even as schools accommodate a larger and larger student population, now exceeding one million. More than 40,000 additional children enrolled this year, and next year 20,000 more are expected.
Next year, they added, there will be a variety of service cuts just on the periphery of the classroom. For example, to reduce spending on transportation, the school system may provide bus service to fewer students. Schools will be asked to look to private industry to provide computer equipment if they want to make it a part of their curriculum. New schools planned to ease overcrowding will not be built.
In the past, the Mayor and the Chancellor have clashed publicly over the amount of cuts they each believed the school system could weather. In April 1994, the Chancellor resigned briefly over a budget dispute with the Mayor -- which included Mr. Giuliani's demand that he dismiss Mr. Hellenbrand. Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly accused the Chancellor of crying wolf over what budget reductions would mean to the school system.
When Mr. Cortines faced midyear budget cuts a few months ago, he told City Council members that teacher layoffs were a possibility, a threat that did not come to pass.
Yesterday's remarks by Mr. Hellenbrand and Mr. Sullivan seemed to be more in line with the Mayor's contentions as he has tackled the city's overwhelming budget problems: that an ax could be taken to the budget without causing New Yorkers any real pain.
"Threadbare is the word I would use to describe the school system under the new budget," Mr. Sullivan said.
Dr. Berne said that what has probably created a more cooperative atmosphere between City Hall and the Board of Education is the involvement of Mr. Sullivan and Marc V. Shaw, the Mayor's budget director, in the talks. Mr. Sullivan, a former banker who was Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economics under Mayor David N. Dinkins, knows his way around City Hall better than some other board administrators. He was named to his post in September, while Mr. Shaw, who was appointed just four months ago, has children in the public schools.
Dr. Berne also said the Mayor and the Chancellor appeared to have toned down their oratory against each other. The Chancellor and the board, not the Mayor, control how school funds are spent, but that was not very evident months ago when Mr. Giuliani was piling criticism on the Chancellor when he resisted some of the budget cuts.
"While the Mayor can make suggestions, now he seems to be acknowledging that it's the Chancellor's call as to how to do that," Dr. Berne said. "They've reduced the public feuding to make good on a bad situation. In the end, the children benefit from that."

HEADLINE: McCall Says He May Run For Mayor

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said yesterday that he was so unhappy with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's leadership that he would consider running against the Mayor in the 1997 election.
Mr. McCall's comments, in a television interview on New York 1, came a day after Mr. Giuliani said that he had asked state officials for permission to stop paying for the section of the Comptroller's office that monitors the finances of New York City. 
 Mr. McCall complained that the Mayor's announcement amounted to bullying, saying that Mr. Giuliani is seeking to remove a fiscal monitor, the deputy state comptroller for New York City, who examines the city's budget and the health of its economy. The office often issues reports critical of the city administration.
Yesterday, Mr. McCall said: "Now, I don't have any plans to run against the Mayor. But if the Mayor continues to demonstrate his inability to deal with all the factions of the city to provide effective leadership to get us out of this fiscal crisis, maybe we would have to change our mind and do what I did with the bully who used to bother me in my neighborhood. One day I walked up to him and popped him in the nose."
There is no indication that Mr. McCall has taken any steps toward organizing a campaign and it is difficult to assess whether he is seriously considering it. But Mr. McCall's name has often been mentioned in political circles as a potential candidate. He is the highest-ranking Democratic elected official in the state and has long been politically active in New York City.
Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, and Mr. McCall have been trading political shots since the Mayor was inaugurated last year. Mr. Giuliani has been harshly critical of Mr. McCall's stewardship, saying that the Comptroller's criticism of the Mayor's performance was politically motivated.
In a news conference yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said, "There is no question that this particular Comptroller has never ever demonstrated even-handedness about looking at the city's budget."
Karen Crowe, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, said, "No one should be surprised that Carl McCall is resorting to political rhetoric." She added that since Mr. McCall became Comptroller, "he has made it clear that he was turning his office into a partisan political operation by firing the professionals in his office. This shouldn't shock anyone."
Mr. McCall said his difficulties with Mr. Giuliani are a result of the Mayor's inability to accept criticism easily.
"I would hope the Mayor could focus on those big issues," he said, "rather than the petty issues of always being confrontational and always assuming that, if people criticize him, they're being political."
In asking the state for permission to stop payments for the Comptroller's office, Mr. Giuliani has maintained that although the Comptroller has a legitimate interest in monitoring the city's finances, the city should not be obligated to subsidize that process. For the current fiscal year, the city is paying $3.2 million of the $5.3 million budget for the section that monitors the city's finances. And the Mayor has insisted that the office's audits are redundant, since several other agencies and offices review New York City's finances.
Terminating payments to the office by the city would require the approval of the State Legislature and the governor.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Up Against the Mark And Other European Money

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark and other European currencies yesterday after two officials of Germany's central bank hinted that the bank might cut interest rates.
The dollar was little changed against the yen as currency dealers waited for the Clinton Administration to impose trade sanctions on Japan with the breakdown of talks last weekend on automotive trade. 
 Many dealers bought marks last week out of concern over the French franc in advance of Sunday's runoff round of French presidential elections. The mark is increasingly considered a safe currency in times of political uncertainty. But the victory of Jacques Chirac, the conservative Mayor of Paris, seemed to comfort the currency dealers, and the mark has since fallen back.
The drop in the mark's value yesterday was spurred by comments of a German central bank official, Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, who said he saw a chance of further cuts in short-term interest rates. Reimut Jochimsen, another official of the bank, widely called the Bundesbank, said further rate cuts could not be ruled out. Lower interest rates often hurt a currency by making investments in it less attractive.
The German officials' comments aided the mark's drop against the dollar, said Stephen Jury, chief currency dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
The Bundesbank's policy makers are to next meet on May 18. The bank surprised currency markets on March 31 with a key-rate reduction.
Yesterday, the dollar rose against a basket of 10 major currencies tracked by Finex, a financial-futures exchange. The Finex dollar index last stood at 81.32, up from 80.80 late Monday in New York.
In trading late in the day, the dollar increased to 1.3805 marks from 1.3677 marks on Monday. It edged up to 83.35 yen from 83.27 yen. It also rose to 4.8521 French francs, from 4.8425 on Monday, and to 1.1406 Swiss francs from 1.1278 francs.
The British pound fell against the mark and the dollar. Some dealers said the selloff had come after The Guardian reported that the Bank of England's inflation report, scheduled for release today, would say that a decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke not to raise rates had put the British Government inflation target in jeopardy. London has fixed a target range of 1 percent to 4 percent and wants the inflation rate in the lower half of that band by May 1997 at the latest.
The pound fell yesterday to a record low of 2.1750 marks, before recovering to 2.1907 marks in late New York trading, down from 2.1945 marks on Monday. It fell to $1.5869 from $1.6044.
The dollar drew only limited support from a rally in Treasury bond prices. Bonds jumped and their yields declined, to 6.94 percent on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, amid speculation that American inflation would remain under control.

HEADLINE: Class Notes

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
On some campuses the question of whether gay groups are entitled to official recognition is a matter of social policy. On others it seems to amount to a struggle for the university's soul.
Two major universities with vital links to the religious establishments from which they sprang -- Yeshiva and Notre Dame -- have wrestled with the issue this semester and come to different conclusions. 
 The University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Ind., has denied recognition to a group called the Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and St. Mary's College. The university said the organization's purpose was inconsistent with the mission of Notre Dame and the moral teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. The group is barred from using campus buildings, receiving university money or sponsoring activities.
Insisting that they, too, are committed to religious principles, officials of Yeshiva University have provided a small office, a telephone and an indirect subsidy to the Cardozo Lesbian and Gay Student Alliance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan.
The president of Yeshiva, Dr. Norman Lamm, said: "As a rabbi, I cannot and do not condone homosexual behavior, which is expressly prohibited by Jewish law. But as president of a nondenominational institution that must accommodate people who reflect a wide range of backgrounds and beliefs, it is my duty to assure that the procedures of Yeshiva University conform to the applicable provisions of secular law."
Although Yeshiva is seen as a pillar of Orthodox Judaism, it has declared itself a nonreligious institution since 1967, to take advantage of tax-exempt bonds and other state aid. Therefore, lawyers for Yeshiva contend, the university does not qualify for exemption from a New York City law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Critics on campus and off have denounced the university for repudiating the basic credo embodied in the words inscribed on its seal, "Torah Umadda," the joining of secular learning (madda) to Jewish law and religious teaching (Torah).
"Torah comes first," said Jeff Stier, a second-year student who is co-editor in chief of The Cardozo Law Forum newspaper. "The second you allow gay clubs at Yeshiva University you are degrading the Torah Umadda symbol.
"It seems like the politically correct environment is having an effect on the university. What should be having an effect is Torah. That's what they stand for. That's what's on the door. That's how they raise money."
Howard L. Hurwitz, chairman of the conservative Family Defense Council in Jamaica, Queens, said it was a legal fiction to describe Yeshiva as a nonreligious institution.
But the university administration has assured the lesbian and gay alliance that it was in no danger of losing recognition or financing. Among the schools at Yeshiva, gay groups have also been organized at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Wurzweiler School of Social Work and the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology.
Michael John Kay, a 1994 Cardozo graduate who practices law in Manhattan, said the presence of the group had attracted him to the school. In his years there, Mr. Kay said, he was not treated disrespectfully by classmates, many of whom knew of his longstanding relationship with another man, Michael Joseph McGrail Jr.
"At orientation I saw persons of color, persons of Asian descent," he recalled. "The school didn't require you to be Jewish. Therefore it didn't occur to me that I would have to subscribe to their principles. It never made me think for a minute that I would be bound by Torah Umadda.
"It's intellectually dishonest to push any part of the community under the rug. If you take the funding away you don't make them go away. You make them invisible."
The Notre Dame group formed in 1984. The university rejected its request for recognition in 1986 but allowed homosexual students to use a room in the University Counseling Center. The administration canceled that arrangement in January, on the ground that the group had advertised its meetings there.
A month later, the Campus Life Council -- a group of residence-hall rectors, faculty members, administrators and students -- called on the university to recognize the gay group. The resolution passed, 13 to 2.
Notre Dame again denied the request. The vice president for student affairs, Prof. Patricia A. O'Hara, said the university calls for chastity from all unmarried students, whatever their sexual orientation, believing that "a genuine and complete expression of love through sexual union requires a commitment to a total living and sharing together of a man and woman in marriage."
While Notre Dame had a "genuine desire to acknowledge and affirm the presence of the gay and lesbian students in our midst," Professor O'Hara wrote in an open letter, the gay organization had shown a "consistent pattern of philosophical dissent from Church teaching."
A day after her letter was published, the Faculty Senate called on the university to recognize the gay group by a vote of 30 to 3.
Dr. John G. Borkowski, a Senate member and professor of psychology, said the controversy "won't go away until the university stops fearing sexuality and until the university accepts people as individuals where they are in life."
"We just have to love one another," he said, "as the university should love them, as Christ loves us."
John Blandford, a graduate student in economics who is co-chairman of the gay organization, said the fight for recognition, now supported by "every major representative body on campus," would continue.
For its last event of the semester, the group invited Cliff Anchor to the campus. Mr. Anchor has identified himself as the companion of Dr. Thomas A. Dooley 3d, a revered alumnus. Dr. Dooley cared for hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees in the 1950's as a naval officer. He returned to Southeast Asia as a medical missionary and built hospitals in Laos. He and Mr. Anchor met in New York in 1959. The doctor died of cancer in 1961, at the age of 34. A statue in his honor stands on the Notre Dame campus.
Until the publication two years ago of "Conduct Unbecoming: Lesbians and Gays in the U.S. Military" by Randy Shilts, it was little known that Dr. Dooley had been discharged from the Navy because of his homosexuality.
"We thought it was important that we give another face to what lesbians and gay men represent at the university," Mr. Blandford said. "We've always been a central part of this place. Dooley is used all the time as an ideal of what Notre Dame students are about. We wanted to be sure people had a complete picture."
Mr. Anchor, who is 58 and lives in Monte Rio, Calif., talked with 45 students while he was in Indiana last week and then met privately with the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president emeritus of Notre Dame. "I told Father Hesburgh that we both loved the same man, but in different ways," Mr. Anchor said. "I felt that he understood that Dooley was the greater hero for having withstood all this bigotry and turning out as he did."

HEADLINE: Restaurant Owners Plan Fight Against Smoking Restrictions

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
New York restaurant and tavern owners yesterday began what they called a counteroffensive against New York City's sweeping, four-week-old restrictions on smoking in public places, lining up members to testify at a city hearing and releasing a survey of owners who said their businesses were hurt by the rules.
About 250 restaurant and tavern owners met yesterday at a midtown hotel in hopes of forging a strategy for the law's repeal. The meeting, called by the Manhattan Tavern and Restaurant Owners Association, attracted people from all five boroughs, all of whom appeared to agree with the organizers' contention that the smoking ban is an unfair invasion of business owners' rights, and is costing them business. 
 "The issue here is not whether smoking is good or bad for people," said Joan Borkowski, the owner of Billy's Tavern in Manhattan, who was the chief organizer of the meeting. "This is a matter of economic survival. We are a service industry, and it is our job to serve customers. It is not our job to be policemen."
Mrs. Borkowski said the next step for restaurant and tavern owners who oppose the ban will be to attend a meeting next Tuesday before the New York City Health Commission, to be held in the commission's offices on Worth Street. At her urging, dozens of people at the hotel gathering filled out forms necessary to testify against the law.
Since it took effect on April 11, the law has banned smoking everywhere in New York City restaurants with more than 35 seats except at their bars. It replaced a law, accepted with little protest by the restaurant industry, that required separate smoking and nonsmoking sections for diners.
The smoking ban was approved by a large majority of the City Council, and has been vigorously supported by medical and antismoking groups as a way to cut down on exposure to secondhand smoke. Advocates of the law have argued that the goal of creating a healthier environment outweighs the possibility of a negative impact on some business owners.
One group, the Coalition for a Smoke Free City, did acknowledge before the City Council that some smokers who had patronized large restaurants might shift their loyalties to those with fewer than 35 seats to avoid the ban. For that reason, the group contended that the ban should be applied to all restaurants.
To provide evidence of what they called the harsh impact of the new regulations, the organizers of yesterday's meeting released the results of a poll of 1,000 restaurant owners and managers from all five boroughs, showing that most said their businesses had been disrupted.
The poll, conducted from May 3 to May 6 -- when the law had been in effect only three weeks -- by a firm from Alexandria, Va., was designed to elicit opinions about the impact of the law instead of provide a precise gauge of its long-term impact on business.
The poll showed that most of those who participated were troubled by the ban. About 56 percent of those surveyed said that they had experienced a decrease in sales, compared with 38 percent who said sales had not been affected by the ban.
The poll also found that a large majority of participants -- 81 percent -- agreed with the assertion that the new smoking ban is "government over-regulation of small business."

HEADLINE: Monrovia Journal;
Old Elite From America Loses All in Liberia

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
Like most Liberians, Clarence L. Simpson does not have to look far for signs of his country's collapse into chaos and barbarism.
What sets Mr. Simpson apart is the distance he has fallen since the 1980 coup that brought a young, semiliterate master sergeant named Samuel K. Doe to power, an event that ultimately set Liberia on the path toward seemingly endless civil war. 
 Mr. Simpson, 62, the son of a former Vice President, was a leading member of the country's quasi-colonial settler class, the Americo-Liberians.
Over the span of his public career, starting as a Supreme Court justice at 31, and including jobs as Attorney General, secretary general of the long-ruling True Whig Party and scion of the Masonic Order, the country's most secretive and influential institution, Mr. Simpson was intimately familiar with virtually all of the power and prestige that his country's elite had to offer.
Now, however, he is reduced to the status of a lawyer in a society where law has hardly any meaning. This holds not just for the illiterate indigenous people who were always treated as distinctly second-class citizens by the recently freed black Americans who began settling this country in 1821, but for anyone without a gun.
Although he maintains appearances, working in his neat downtown law offices, surrounded by the shattered remains of a city that once liked to think of itself as the Manhattan of West Africa, Mr. Simpson, who returned from exile in the United States in 1991, literally cannot go home.
Nowadays, no writ can win for him repossession of the large house he once lived in, filled as it is by members of the Armed Forces of Liberia, just one of the country's dozen or so tribal militias. Worse, he says, were the killings of his peers and the brain drain that followed, with the educated survivors and their children lost to exile, mostly in the United States.
"I woke up one morning and most of the people I associated with were dead," said Mr. Simpson, who was lucky to be abroad when Sergeant Doe took power, executing 13 Government ministers by firing squad as one his first acts. "I wondered to myself, should I ever go back to Liberia?"
Having chosen to return to contribute to the building of a peaceful new society, nowadays Mr. Simpson says Liberia needs "someone who can lead without regard to tribal affiliation," preferably, he adds, someone who is not an Americo-Liberian. The old elite, he says, had already come to this conclusion when it was overthrown.
If Mr. Simpson betrays little irony in delivering his prescription, most of his fellow Americo-Liberians here now acknowledge that their behavior was the very study of tribalism -- though, given their origins, a most peculiar form of it.
Most agree that the settlers' mission, put forth in a Declaration of Independence inspired by America's, "to regenerate and enlighten this benighted Continent," somehow never made it beyond the noble word.
"They might have borne the idea of building a new society for all Liberians on their lips, but that was not what they bore in their minds," said G. Henry Andrews, a former newspaper editor. "What they had in mind was transplanting the feudal system they knew in the States to Liberia, with themselves this time in the master's role."
Driven by a resentment that accumulated over generations from deprivation of everything from roads, schools, hospitals, to voting rights and other benefits of citizenship, the first instinct of Sergeant Doe and his young comrades was to kill their perceived oppressors.
The second instinct, however, was to emulate them. Mr. Doe eventually became a Mason, and made the transition from crude speaker to giver of grandiloquent addresses. Finally, he packed the only institution he fully understood, the army, with his fellow tribesmen, the Krahn, and sought to set up his own ethnic hierarchy.
By the time civil war broke out, in 1989, with an invasion by another ethnically based Liberian force from the Ivory Coast that had been victimized by Mr. Doe's Krahn, each of Liberia's major tribes seemingly had a grievance against another. So far, the violence, carried out in village burnings and urban guerrilla assaults, has taken at least 150,000 lives. Mr. Doe was himself captured and killed by members of a militia in September 1990.
"It was no longer an affair of Americo-Liberians," Archbishop Michael K. Francis, said, mentioning the country's other tribes. "If you were Krahn you were killed, if you were Gio you were killed, if you were Mano you were killed. It was just senseless killing, and before we knew it, our streets were just filled with skeletons and the stench of death."
Still, clinging tightly to the world he once knew, of hat shows and gloved church ceremonies for women in yellow dresses and Masonic rites for men in pinstripes, Mr. Simpson refuses to indict his own.
"History shows that people who try to liberalize after sustained repression are generally swept away," he said. "The pity is that so many thought that the only thing that had to be done to get justice was to get rid of the Americo-Liberian."

HEADLINE: Economic Crisis Hits Mexico's States, With Some Nearly Broke

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 9

 BODY:
The severe economic crisis that has thrown hundreds of thousands of Mexicans out of work and devastated the balance sheets of many Mexican companies is also taking its toll on the country's 31 states, which have asked the federal Government to help them avoid bankruptcy.
Soaring interest rates, which have hit 100 percent, have made it impossible for states and local communities to repay billions of dollars in loans that were used to finance public works projects. 
 President Ernesto Zedillo announced a $2.9 billion rescue program last Thursday that would allow the states to restructure their loans, lowering interest rates and spreading out the time for repayment to as long as eight years.
In return, states that take part agreed to prepay part of their loans. They also accepted conditions imposed by the federal Government to overhaul their fiscal operations, possibly including the privatization of state-owned enterprises.
The 31 Governors have generally accepted the need for such a program but the four who belong to the opposition accused the federal Government of assuming the same intrusive role that they said the United States did when it offered Mexico $20 billion in loans last March to deal with the economic crisis.
Mexico then was forced to change its fiscal policies radically, and will have to report to the United States and international financial organizations on the progress of its restructuring before it can receive full use of the rescue money.
Carlos Medina Plasciencia, opposition Governor of the central state of Guanajuato, said the program is simply "an aspirin," and another indication of the dependency of the states on the central Government.
President Zedillo said the debt restructuring is part of his ongoing attempt to transform the relationship between the federal Government and the states, which he said has been marked by excessive reliance on the center.
"Centralism is a drag on development that inhibits the deployment of social, economic and political energies of the states," Mr. Zedillo said in announcing the program.
The opposition has so far been skeptical of Mr. Zedillo's efforts. Last month, the opposition Mayor of Ciudad Juarez set up his own toll booths on the international bridge connecting with El Paso to protest what he called the federal Government's unfair distribution of funds.
Mexican states rely on the federal Government for about 80 percent of their funds, which have been cut by an average of 14 percent this year.
The total debt of the 31 states is estimated by officials to be around 23 billion pesos, or almost $4 billion at current exchange rates. Most of the debt was incurred by states and local communities that took out commercial bank loans at variable interest rates -- Mexican states and municipalities do not float government bonds -- to pay their share of public works projects financed primarily by the federal Government.
All 31 states have been hurt by the rising interest rates but some, including Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico and Jalisco in the center, have been pushed to the edge of bankruptcy.
States that take part in the loan restructuring agree to prepay 10, 20 or 30 percent of their commercial loans. They will be allowed to use recent increases in sales taxes to make those payments.
Interest rates will range from 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent, depending on the size of the prepayment. The loans will be restructured in such a way as to protect them from the effects of inflation, which is expected to exceed 50 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Scientists Reject Criteria for Wetlands Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
One day before the House begins debate on a bill that would greatly reduce Federal protection for wetlands, the National Academy of Sciences today published an authoritative report to Congress that repudiates the basic approach taken by the bill.
The bill would require that any protected wetland must match a strict set of defining criteria involving water saturation, soil chemistry, vegetation and similar measurements. But the new report rejects these criteria, which critics say would remove Federal limits on development from most of the nation's remaining wetlands. 
 Though the report does not comment directly on the legislation, a revision of the Clean Water Act, its conclusions are sure to be the most powerful argument raised against the bill. The 268-page report, by a panel of 17 prominent wetlands experts, calls for fundamentally different criteria and makes clear that the approach outlined in the bill has no basis in science.
Wetlands serve important functions like absorbing flood waters, filtering pollutants, and giving fish and waterfowl a place to breed. But protecting such areas is bitterly debated, in part because of the giant economic stakes involved in their development.
Two years ago, Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most eminent scientific organization, to settle the debate. But the legislation before the House was approved in a bipartisan committee vote last month, while the academy's work was undergoing final review. Opponents of the wetlands provision have tried unsuccessfully to have the debate delayed while the report was being finished.
The release of the science academy's report today confronts House members with a complex scientific document only a few days before they are scheduled to vote on a large, complicated bill that makes fundamental changes to one of the nation's most important environmental laws.
The Administration strongly opposes the bill before the House, and the Senate has not begun work on a measure to revise the Clean Water Act, which supposed to be revised and extended every five years.
The House bill would exempt many kinds of wetlands from Federal regulation altogether and would require the Government to compensate property owners when it refuses to allow them to develop their wetlands.
The bill would also attempt to rank wetlands in order of ecological value, protecting only the ones that provide the most important functions like wildlife habitat, flood control and filtering pollution. The scientific report said that scientists do not know enough about wetlands ecology to make such a ranking reliable.
The chairman of the science academy's committee, William M. Lewis Jr., called the bill's requirements "arbitrary" and said in an interview that he personally opposed the legislation because it would lead to a continuing loss of wetlands.
"I would personally be opposed to the reduction of the total acreage of wetlands in the United States by 50 percent or more, which would be the implication of this bill over the next generation," said Dr. Lewis, a water scientist who heads the Department of Environmental Biology at the University of Colorado.
Representative Wayne T. Gilchrest, a Republican from Maryland's Chesapeake Bay area who originally sought the science report, called the bill's language "somewhat ludicrous" in light of the report.
But one of the bill's authors scoffed at the report.
"Anybody in academia who wishes to defend the litany of nonsense that has occurred under the Clean Water Act is either unfamiliar with that nonsense or should have his academic credentials questioned," said Representative Jimmy Hayes, Democrat of Louisiana.
The report says there is wide consensus among scientists about what constitutes a wetland, but the criteria it cites bear no resemblance to the definition in the bill.
For example, in requiring that a protected wetland be saturated by water at the surface for 21 consecutive days in the growing season, the legislation deviates from what the scientists considered an accurate definition: one that would look at periodic saturation for shorter periods, in the root zone of plants rather than at the surface, and not necessarily in the months between the spring thaw and the autumn frost.
And the academy's report said that as a scientific matter, it was generally not necessary to independently confirm that a site has typical wetlands soils and plants as well as actual standing water, the requirement imposed by the bill.
A group of moderate lawmakers led by two Republicans, Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New York and H. James Saxton of coastal New Jersey, said today that they would offer a substitute bill that includes relatively modest changes to wetlands provisions that are favored by the National Governors Association.
They said that they had 20 or 30 Republican supporters and that they were also seeking Democratic support for their substitute, which would also make a number of other major changes to the pending bill, which was drafted by a House committee with substantial bipartisan support and the strong backing of industrial and agricultural lobbyists.
Mr. Boehlert, in a sign of the moderate's frustration, said, "We are Davids up against the more powerful, better organized Philistines."
But Representative Hayes said today that he thought the academy was meddling in politics by issuing the report on the eve of the debate.
"This is not science, it is political science," he said.
In any case, Mr. Hayes said in an interview, the question of whether to protect wetlands was at its heart a political decision to be made by Congress, not one that could be dictated by science. And, even though state wetlands regulators have officially opposed his bill, he said the states were better able to regulate wetlands than the Federal Government.
Judy Meyer, president of the Ecological Society of America, a professional scientific organization, said in a letter to members of Congress that she was concerned that the report would not receive adequate consideration before the votes this week.
"Clearly, science cannot provide all the answers in developing policy," she wrote. "But science can and must play a part in considerations of a bill that will affect the future of one of our nation's most vital resources, one that affects every American citizen."
The report said that even though wetlands regulations have been repeatedly changed during a prolonged political tug-of-war since the 1980's, "the Federal regulatory system for protection of wetlands is scientifically sound and effective in most respects."
Carol M. Browner, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said, "I think the report points out that wetlands protection, and the definition of wetlands, has to be based on sound science, not on political expediency as it is in the bill."

HEADLINE: Ford Sees 1995 Auto Sales Falling Below Level of Last Year

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 9

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that after lowering its forecasts for the second time in about a month, it expected 1995 auto sales to fall below the levels of last year.
The company said it cut it projections again because of surprisingly weak sales in April. But it said it expected its own sales to continue to outperform those of the industry over all. 
 Ford now estimates that sales of all cars and light and heavy trucks will total 15.1 million this year, down from 15.4 million last year. Its previous projection was for sales to total 15.5 million. Typically, heavy trucks account for about 300,000 sales.
The Chrysler Corporation is also weighing a cut in its forecast, which is now 15.5 million, including heavy trucks. The Chrysler economists are considering reducing that estimate to a range of 15.2 million to 15.5 million. As recently as January Chrysler was projecting sales of 16.2 million this year.
The auto makers have said that higher interest rates have restrained buyers. But because rising rebates and other incentives to customers have failed to jump start sales this spring, some Wall Street analysts have concluded that higher prices for new cars have convinced potential customers to postpone purchases or buy used cars.
Joel Pitcoff, market analysis manager for Ford, said Ford now expected sales in the second quarter to fall below those in the first quarter, but for the market to improve from then on. Ford still expects 1996 to be stronger than 1995, he said.
"There's nothing fundamentally that's eroding," Mr. Pitcoff said. However, sales in April were so weak that the industry could not hope to meet the old forecast of Ford. "Even if it's an anomaly, you need too steep a climb over the rest of the year to reach 15.5," he said, referring to millions of sales.
The General Motors Corporation projects sales of 15.6 million this year. G.M. has not said if it will change its forecast.
Mr. Pitcoff said the Ford production estimates for April were based on the lower forecasts, and as a result would not be reduced. "This does not augur any further production cuts," he said.
Ford still expects record truck sales of 6.6 million this year. The cut in its sales projection came entirely from anticipated car sales.
Ford announced its reduced projections for auto sales after the stock market closed today. Earlier, shares of Ford closed at $27.125, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of G.M. rose 25 cents, to $43.75, while shares of Chrysler fell 50 cents, to $41.875.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises Only 6.91, Indicating the Market May Stall

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed and little changed yesterday, a circumstance that would normally go unremarked in the fifth month of a substantial rally in stocks.
But with the Dow Jones industrial average up a steep 15 percent for the year, these are not normal times, stock traders say. Market professionals are, if not worried about, then extremely attentive to the possibility of the market stalling. 
 That is because the market ought to have risen sharply yesterday. The dollar's value rose overseas, bond yields fell below 7 percent and the price of gold fell -- all factors that in the past would have sent stock prices soaring.
But the Dow rose only 6.91 points, to 4,390.78, still the 26th closing high this year, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.40 point, to 523.56. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 1.12 point, to 848.17.
Volume on the New York Exchange was unusually heavy, with 365.4 million shares changing hands, up from this year's daily average of 333 million shares.
"Every one is looking for that tea leaf that says the stock market is going to correct," said Todd Clark, managing director for equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw. "It's a little early to say that somehow today is an indication of equities beginning to stall."
But yesterday's trading pattern, with its sharp rise in the morning and feeble performance in the afternoon, if it persists for the rest of the week, could be worrisome for stocks, Mr. Clark said.
For one thing, the Dow Jones industrial average surged past 4,400 twice before 11 A.M., but then fell back from 4,403.58. Last Thursday, the Dow sprinted past 4,400 as well, only to fall back from 4,410.15.
Technical stock analysts call these price thresholds "resistance levels," Wall Street argot meaning the market may not get there from here.
Resistance can become worrisome when so many other signs seem to be positive. Long-term interest rates in the bond market continued to fall. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.94 percent from 7.03 percent, the lowest level since March 1994.
And one of the most widely watched measures of market anxiety -- the price of gold -- fell once again. The contract for June delivery of gold fell $6.30, to $384.60 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange of New York.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.06 point, to 281.74, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,334 to 994. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.70 point, to 483.64.
Among advancing stocks was United Insurance Companies, which rose 7, to 52, on the strength of a 26 percent rise in quarterly earnings reported on Monday as well as a planned 4-for-1 stock split. But in after-hours trading, its stock price fell.
The Picturetel Corporation, a telecommunications equipment maker, rose 3, to 47 1/8, after it announced that it would work with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, one of the world's largest phone carriers, to develop video-conferencing systems for Japan.
Among declining stocks was Unilever, the British-Dutch conglomerate, which fell 7 7/8, to 126 1/2, after it announced that first-quarter profits fell 7 percent. Whirlpool, the big appliance manufacturer, fell 4, to 50, after reports that Goldman, Sachs sold a large block of Whirlpool shares. Following the close of trading, Whirlpool said its second-quarter profit may not match its earnings of a year earlier.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 rose, led by United Technologies, which rose 1 7/8, to 74 7/8. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S,& P. 500, 216 fell, led by Exxon, which fell 1/2, to 69 7/8.
The most active stock, at 8.6 million shares, was Intel, which fell 3/8, to 111 1/4.
