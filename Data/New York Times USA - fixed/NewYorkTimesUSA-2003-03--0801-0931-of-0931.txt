HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: HOUSE TO HOUSE; 
Urban Warfare: Long a Key Part of an Underdog's Down-to-Earth Arsenal

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 26 

 BODY:
Each battered high-rise becomes a sniper's aerie, each deserted thoroughfare an ambush zone. In this kind of warfare, advances and retreats are measured in blocks or half-blocks, or even just houses. In the calculations of battle, the shield of technology gives way to human failings and human skills -- speed and deception, close knowledge of streets and alleys.
 Since Stalingrad and Berlin in World War II, to the American assault on Hue in Vietnam in 1968 and on to the war zones of Beirut or Nablus, Belfast or Mogadishu, urban warfare has become a central part of the underdog's arsenal -- a fight without scruples for the high ground of propaganda that exploits civilian losses and denies the intruder's superior might. 
 It is precisely that messy, manipulative and murderous kind of fighting between conventional forces and elusive defenders that could confront the Americans and British as they try to enter Baghdad, despite their much-publicized reluctance to engage in a close urban brawl. 
"The Iraqis will want to fight close and dirty, with Iraqi tanks darting in an out of garages andbuildings; they will conduct small-scale offensive actions with dismounted soldiers supported by mortars," wrote Gen. Wesley Clark, the American former commander who led NATO forces during the Kosovo campaign in 1999.
"The fighting will be full of the tricks we have already seen and more: ambushes, fake surrenders, soldiers dressed as women, attacks on rear areas and command posts. The Iraqis will be prepared to conduct high-risk missions of a kind we would not consider," he said in an article for the Times of London.
For all that allied commanders in Iraq have expressed outrage at what they see as such dishonorable tactics, though, urban warfare has always set its own rules of guile and deceit -- from the legendary use of a wooden horse at Troy over 3,000 years ago to modern times when war is broadcast live 24 hours a day.
In this post-cold-war era of asymmetric warfare -- the conflict between conventional forces and zealous adversaries seeking the chinks in the high-tech Western armor -- the fight has come to mean a contest to disable the technology that enables American forces to contemplate killing without losses of their own.
That was evident enough in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993 when sophisticated Black Hawk helicopter gunships were brought down by crude, shoulder-fired Soviet-era RPG-7 rocket propelled grenades -- a standard item in the kit of guerrilla armies around the globe along with AK-47 assault rifles, land mines and hand grenades. Indeed, similar tactics were popularized by the Afghan guerrillas who battled the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980's, courtesy largely of more sophisticated American-supplied Stinger missiles.
The downing of the helicopters in Mogadishu not only seemed a victory for the lightly equipped Somali street fighters. It also led to humiliating American casualties, 18 dead, that hastened the United States withdrawal -- just as images of wounded and slain United States marines at Hue and other battle zones of the Tet offensive in Vietnam turned American opinion against the war.
Those memories underscore the perils of street fighting that face allied troops in Iraq. History offers little solace.
In recent decades, urban warfare has taken many forms, with many aims.
When battle-hardened Soviet troops pushed into Berlin in 1945 against the last feeble remnants of the Third Reich, lofting the Red Flag over the battered Reichstag, their intention was clearly conquest, not the liberation Washington says it seeks in Iraq.
In Beirut in the mid-1970's, by contrast, and in Sarajevo in the 1990's, cities were divided along lines of faith. In Sarajevo, it was a Serbian siege against Muslim-led defenders. In Beirut, the fighting between Muslim and Palestinian forces and Christian militias began with an incongruous war for luxury seafront hotels -- the St. Georges, the Phoenicia, the Palm Beach and the Normandie, won and lost in room-to-room fighting.
The weapons were generally low-tech shoulder-fired antitank grenades, assault rifles and mortars, machine guns mounted on pickup trucks that put a premium on stealth and mobility. But when American marines intervened in Lebanon, an equally crude weapon, a suicide truck bomb, killed more than 230 of them in 1983.
In Berlin, Beirut and Sarajevo -- as in successive waves of Russian assaults on the Chechen capital, Grozny -- the fighting reduced large urban areas to rubble. But it is precisely the familiarity of the urban terrain to those who live there that enables them to use it to the advantages of ambushes, surprise attacks and rapid redeployment.
In Iraq, urban warfare "will negate the technological advantage of the coalition," said Clifford Beal, the editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, a leading publication on military matters. "The Iraqis will be jumping in and out of alleyways, he added. "It tends to become a low-tech, house-to-house situation, and that kind of combat can become very costly for combatants and others."
A war depending on low technology and high numbers of combatants and casualties is the opposite of what most of the modern American army is trained to do. Even the British Army, with three decades of experience fighting the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland, would not be familiar either with the Iraqi terrain in cities like Basra or Baghdad or with the much greater firepower Iraqi troops could use in urban areas.
Indeed, said Tom Clonan, a military analyst in Dublin, a more likely comparison for allied troops in Iraq would be the experience of Russian troops fighting Chechen separatist forces in Grozny. "There are striking similarities between Grozny and Baghdad," he said. "Low-tech weapons would form a formidable arsenal in the narrow alleys and back streets of Iraq's capital." 
Others draw comparisons to house-to-house fighting in Hue in 1968, which not only sent home bloody images of American casualties but also forced United States commanders to loosen the rules of engagement in a way the Pentagon says it is seeking to avoid in the Iraq war.
That reflects the differences in the role of public opinion for defenders and attackers in any urban warfare in Iraq, where ruthless irregulars and ultra-loyal forces would have few qualms about civilian casualties or using civilians as human shields. The United States and Britain face opinion at home that may prove fickle, constraining their ability to use overwhelming force, military analysts said.
"The allies are fighting with kid gloves on, but it'll be very difficult to keep this clinical if urban warfare ensues," said Mr. Beal of Jane's Defense Weekly. "Urban warfare takes longer. It can bog down large numbers of troops. This war is being fought on a clock. And the longer it goes on, the more carnage is seen, the more difficult it is for the Bush administration to continue."
In the region's recent history, there are some ominous parallels. When Israeli troops invaded Lebanon in 1982, they evicted Yasir Arafat from Beirut, only to find him depicting his departure as a victory, validated simply by his ability to survive superior force.
Moreover, as The Economist magazine noted last week, the Israelis' welcome was short-lived. "When Israel invaded here in 1982, we met them with showers of rice and roses," a spokesman for the Hezbollah Shiite Muslim militia in Lebanon was quoted as saying. "One hundred days later, we blew up their headquarters."

But in October of that year, two American Black Hawk helicopters were downed by guerrillas using relatively unsophisticated weapons, illustrating one of the dangers of urban warfare. (Associated Press) Chart/Diagram: "Soldiers in the Streets"United States Army and Marine Corps doctrine recommends isolating and bypassing urban areas when possible, because cities are difficult, dangerous and costly to fight in. Still, most soldiers undergo some form of training in the very complicated business of urban combat. If American forces must fight in Baghdad, here are just a few of the thousands of special considerations they may need to keep in mind as they hit the streets. DOUBLE COLUMN -- The double column is the preferred method for moving along an urban street. It provides 360 degrees of security and allows for overlapping coverage. WINDOWS AND DOORS -- A common danger is passing by windows and doors without being aware. One technique is to pie off the opening. Using the near wall for cover, a pointman aims along the edge of the window or door while another soldier covers his back. Both soldiers cross the opening as the pointman pivots completing a 180 degree sweep of the opening. URBAN BATTLEFIELD: PHYSICAL FEATURESThe blend of horizontal and vertical geometry, and the variety of surfaces and spaces make urban areas vastly more complex than a similarly sized piece of natural terrain. Some of the dimensions: AirspaceThe area usable by aircraft and aerial munitions. It is broken up at low levels by manmade structures. Interior spaceThe unseen battle space behind the exteriors. Exterior spaceThe visible battle space. Supersurface areasThe roofs, balconies, and upper floors that can be used for movement and advantage. Surface areasStreets, alleys, parks, fields that follow the natural terrain and are broken up by manmade features. Subsurface areasSewers, drains, subway tunnels and other underground corridors that provide a concealed means of movement and engagement. TARGET MARKING AND FRIENDLY POSITIONSSupport from aircraft, artillery and other combat elements is critical in urban warfare, so locating and marking friendly positions and enemy targets is important. Soldiers can use a number of techniques to mark buildings, but the simplest methods are often best. Sometimes spray paint or bed sheets hung out of windows is enough. Flares, strobes, smoke and mirror signaling or even laser pointer devices might also be used. CORNERS -- The urban landscape is full of corners, each a potential hazard. A technique called popping the corner puts the soldier near the ground, where enemy fire is less likely to hit. The weapon is short stocked (see weapon carrying techniques below) to hide the muzzle. WALLS AND HOLES -- Walls may provide cover or present obstacles. They should be crossed by rolling quickly over the top, keeping a low silhouette. In urban warfare, doors should rarely be used. Soldiers must seek alternate ways to enter buildings. EXPOSURES NEAR THE GROUND -- It can be easy to pass by basement windows or stairwells without noticing, exposing a soldier's legs to enemy fire. Staying close to the walls, soldiers must be careful to either step or jump over these low-lying hazards. Ready to FireThe hallmarks of urban combat are the proximity of the enemy (very close) and the amount of time a soldier has to react to an enemy action (very little). Soldiers are therefore trained to hold their weapons in ways that maximize reaction time while moving through city streets. At right, four basic weapons carries for urban combat. TACTICAL CARRYUSED: When an immediate threat is presentPermits control of the rifle while moving; still allows quick engagement. The stock is placed at hip level and the barrel is angled upward at 45 degrees. ALERT CARRYUSED: When enemy contact is likelyStock placed against shoulder; muzzle angled downward at 45 degrees. As needed, rifle is snapped into firing position with front sight post aligned on target. READY CARRYUSED: When enemy contact is imminent.Stock placed against shoulder; muzzle pointed outward in direction of enemy. Alignment of the front sight on the enemy is made as the shot is fired. SHORT STOCKINGUSED: In enclosed spaces or to conceal the muzzle.Stock is positioned above the shoulders, with hand guard near the cheek. The index finger or thumb is used to pull the trigger.

HEADLINE: With Teacher Unions in Lead, Lobbyists Set Spending Record 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26 

 BODY:
New York State's largest teachers' union and its largest affiliate, in New York City, spent a combined $4.8 million on lobbying last year, more than any other special-interest group seeking influence at the State Capitol or in local governments.
 The figures were included in a report issued today by the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, which said spending on lobbying reached a record high of $92 million last year, compared with $80.4 million in 2001. Only twice in the last 25 years has spending on lobbying declined from one year to the next. 
 Last year, for the first time, those lobbying local governments, like New York City's, were required to report their lobbying activity as of April 1, but those expenses only increased the total minimally. 
David M. Grandeau, the executive director of the commission, said the rise in spending on lobbying was a reflection of the increased value attached to legislation. This year, he predicted, despite the state's budget woes, lobbying will prove to be a recession-proof industry and pass the $100 million mark.
"Some people have a much larger interest in their legislation, because the end results have much more money attached to them," Mr. Grandeau said. "I don't think it's unusual, when you're playing for billions of dollars, that you're going to spend a significant amount of money, in the millions, to get your message across."
Some "good government" groups, like the New York Public Interest Research Group and Common Cause, said they were troubled by the influence of money in politics and government, particularly when the lines between the two blurred.
Blair Horner, the legislative director for the research group, said he was concerned that tens of millions of dollars used to influence government decisions about spending had not been captured in the report. He said lobbyists who tried to influence governmental purchasing decisions were exempt from the disclosure law. 
"And that doesn't make any sense," Mr. Horner said.
The United Federation of Teachers -- the New York City teachers' union -- reported $2.8 million in lobbying expenses. The second-highest spender was the New York State United Teachers, the state's largest teachers' union, which reported spending $1.96 million. Spokesmen for both unions said a significant portion of that money was spent on advertising to draw attention to the need for certified teachers and to argue for higher teacher salaries.
"Our members have a right to have their voices heard," said Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for New York State United Teachers. "This is done through voluntary contributions. What more important issue is there than the education of our kids?"
Mr. Grandeau said anecdotal evidence indicated that clients were hiring separate lobbyists to work with the Assembly, the Senate and the executive branch, a strategy that some lobbyists confirmed.
Also, more nonprofit organizations are spending more to seek influence, said Steven B. Weingarten of Weingarten & Reid in Albany, one of the fastest-growing lobbying firms in terms of revenue last year.
"There are new groups getting involved in a bigger way," Mr. Weingarten said. "And the established groups are paying more. So, that's why the money keeps going up and up."
Of course, as Mr. Grandeau said, the 10 professional lobbying firms that earned the most in the capital last year were the top 10 in 2001. As was the case in 2001, last year, the lobbying firm that earned the most last year, $5.1 million, was Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, based in New York. The firm that earned the second-highest amount, $3.6 million, was Bolton St. Johns.
"It's the same people, just making more money," Mr. Grandeau said.

HEADLINE: Ratings of Tobacco Bonds Face Possible Downgrading 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings said yesterday that it might downgrade the credit ratings for about $18 billion of tobacco bonds in the near future because of last week's $10.1 billion court judgment against Philip Morris.
 The announcement, which includes about $6 billion in tobacco bonds issued by New York, New York City and New Jersey, did not lead to an immediate sell-off in the sector. 
 But if the bond credit ratings are reduced it will mean that many states, including New York, will have to pay higher interest rates if they want to use tobacco bonds to help cover their state budgets. The two top legislative leaders in New York agreed on Tuesday to a compromise that would include the issuing of $700 million in tobacco bonds. 
To generate revenue now, states are selling municipal bonds tied to some or all of the first 25 years of expected payments from the tobacco companies, under a pact signed with 46 states that has been valued at $206 billion. The rush of states to use this deficit plug has already flooded the municipal bond market with about $18 billion in bonds and pushed yields higher to attract investors.
In its announcement, Fitch said that the decision to put the tobacco bonds on what is called rating watch negative was prompted by the decision Monday to put the Altria Group, the parent of Philip Morris, on the same watch list, with the threat of a credit downgrading.
Last Friday, a judge in Madison County, Ill., ruled that Philip Morris must pay a $10.1 billion settlement. To appeal that judgment, Philip Morris has to put up a bond of about $12 billion. Michael Dean, a managing director in the asset-backed securities group at Fitch, said that if all $12 billion were put up for the bond, Fitch would be concerned "about the short-term financial flexibility" of Philip Morris.
It is possible that Philip Morris could obtain a court waiver that would allow a smaller amount to be put up on appeal. In addition, Philip Morris is seeking legislation from the Illinois Legislature that would exempt all the companies that signed the tobacco agreement from such appeal bonds.
With Altria faced with a credit downgrading, Fitch had to re-evaluate the financial health of the tobacco industry and its ability to make the payments under the agreement reached with the government, Mr. Dean said. And that led to the decision to put the tobacco bonds on the watch list.
But the Fitch statement said that a downgrading for Altria did not necessarily mean a downgrading for the tobacco industry as a whole and, therefore, the tobacco bonds. In addition, Fitch can decide after review not to downgrade the current credit rating of the tobacco bonds.
The current rating, which is not official, for the tobacco industry over all is A and all the official ratings on the tobacco bonds are A- to A+. Mr. Dean said he expected a decision to be made within a month.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE MOOD OVERSEAS; 
Press and Public Abroad Seem to Grow Ever Angrier About the U.S.

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 26 

 BODY:
The cover picture this week in Der Spiegel, the German newsweekly, shows explosions in Baghdad under the caption: "Terror Bombing for Freedom." In the magazine Tip, a popular weekly guide to events in Berlin, the cover illustration shows President Bush in cowboy gear sitting on a saddle that, in turn, is strapped onto a missile heading for Baghdad.
 Nearly one week into the war in Iraq, the public mood in many countries around the world seemed to become angrier and more sarcastic than ever, suggesting that if, as Bush administration spokesmen say, the war is going as planned on the battlefield, it is nonetheless provoking widespread global anger. 
 Today, there were huge student demonstrations in Spain, smaller demonstrations in South Korea, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and one that involved angry clashes with the police in Sydney, Australia.
In Japan, a group organizing a "Peace Choice" campaign is urging boycotts of products of American companies like Pampers, McDonald's and Ford. Another day of global protest is being advertised on Web sites and posters for Sunday, April 6. 
If there was a common image summoned up by the protests and angry commentaries, it was of the United States as an imperial power intoxicated by its military supremacy but receiving a lesson in the price of arrogance by unexpected Iraqi resistance.
An editorial in People's Daily in China accuses the United States of seeking international domination. 
"Armed force and coercion are the antonyms of democracy," the editorial said, "so isn't using tanks and cannons to spit out 'liberty' and 'democracy' a mite ironic?"
China, of course, has for years accused the United States of seeking what it calls hegemonism, so the commentary on the Iraq war is hardly surprising. What may be of greater note is how media commentary and public sentiment is running against the United States among some of its closest allies. 
In Germany, where public sentiment has long been against the war, most newspapers and the main television news programs have played up civilian casualties on one side and American military setbacks on the other.
One newspaper this morning showed a large photograph of an Iraqi girl with a heavily bandaged face. Others have run large headlines like "Baghdad Burns" or "Bush Playing with Fire."
Radio stations have been broadcasting commentaries criticizing the refusal of American television stations to broadcast pictures of the American prisoners of war paraded on Al Jazeera television network, contending that the stations are following orders from the government to shield the American public from the realities of the war.
To be sure, there are also voices expressing support for the United States and criticizing the demonstrators and negative commentators for failing to offer an alternative to the disarming of Saddam Hussein. 
The conservative German daily Die Welt criticized the sensationalist headlines appearing elsewhere in the German press and argued, "Of course it is justified to be suspicious of the announcement of a 'surgically clean' war with 'intelligent' weapons, but it is our only hope that this war is being waged by the allied forces not as 'terror' and not as a game."
In Italy, the newspaper Il Foglio called for a "U.S.A. Day" demonstration, complete with American flags, to counter what have become almost incessant peace protests.
"I'm fed up with these Saddam days that so-called pacifists keep presenting us," a commentator, Carlo Rossella, wrote in the newspaper La Stampa today. 
In France, the philosopher and writer Pascal Bruckner, who is one of a small group of what are called pro-war intellectuals, denounced the sentiment in France that the real danger to peace is not Mr. Hussein but Mr. Bush as a return of the "old Frenchy passion for third-world ideologies."
"France is a concentrate of all the European contradictions," Mr. Bruckner wrote. "On the one side, there is a will to appear as a great and influential world power, and on the other there is a will not to dirty one's hands. Europe cannot offer itself the luxury of living in the middle of storms, as if she was in a sanatorium, only because it is protected by America's nuclear umbrella."
But condemnation and withering criticism have been more prevalent. In South Africa, Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and chairman of the nation's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, denounced American military action as "an immoral war" that sent an especially chilling message to majority-black countries.
"It is kind of a deja vu, where white people told us what was good for us," he said. "The United States is deciding what is good for the people of Iraq."
The Russian newspaper Vremya MN, in a sharp condemnation of American policy, echoed the theme of imperial power operating without constraint or legality.
"In a world which has moved beyond the postwar half century of U.S.-Soviet confrontation, what is becoming more and more clearly entrenched is not the principle of international law, but the law of the overwhelming power of the world's only superpower," the newspaper said.
Cartoons were very visible in newspapers in Turkey, where polls show as much as 94 percent of the public opposed to the war.
One, published on the front page of the newspaper Sabah, reflects the perception of the United States as a powerful country that throws money around but still cannot get what it wants. It shows a huge patch of quicksand labeled "Iraq" and a person, the United States, sinking in it, the person's arm holding a wad of cash over the sand.
On the same page, Sabah's lead headline is, "We Can Resist Six Months." The phrase comes from Iraqi statements and shows a clear sympathy with Iraq as the embattled underdog.
In Germany, Der Spiegel wondered on its Web site whether the difficulties American troops have encountered in Iraq might spell the end of the American empire.
"The world's only remaining superpower is beginning to suffer from the disease with which every imperial power throughout history has been afflicted: the overestimation and overtaxing of its own capabilities," the magazine said. "Could the Iraq war herald its decline?"
Demonstrations have been called for this weekend at the American Rhein-Main air base near Frankfurt, Germany. In Italy, antiwar groups have been striving to organize boycotts against American oil companies, as well as against McDonald's, Microsoft and Coca-Cola.
One group, called the International Group for Direct Economic Actions against the War said the boycotts would be aimed at "putting pressure on Bush" to change his "warmongering policies.'
Le Monde, France's most prestigious newspaper, published a front-page cartoon by its caricaturist, Plantu, that showed an American soldier with an American flag marching over a heap of Iraqi corpses. The soldier says, "This sandstorm is terrible!"
In Japan, one popular magazine lumped Mr. Bush together with Mr. Hussein and Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, as the "axis of idiots."
"What Bush is doing is conquering with military force anybody who opposes him," said Shinichi Iida, a 25-year-old university student. "I think it's the most barbaric act in the world." 
Across the Arab world, editorials denounced the war, calling it an aggression carried out in the service of Israeli interests.
"The image of the war to the public now is occupation, not liberation," Nabil Osman, the chief spokesman for the Egyptian government, said in an interview. 
Some newspapers, echoing comments in the European press, accused the American government of intimidating television stations into refusing to show images of American soldiers taken captive by Iraq.
"The human sentiments embodied in the Geneva Conventions that American officials have referred to are not meant to be apportioned on racist grounds," Suleiman al-Aqili, wrote in the Saudi daily Al Watan.
"Had the Americans and their allies not circulated pictures of Iraqi prisoners of war on the first day of the invasion, and had they not denied truthful Iraqi accounts of coalition losses, the Iraqis would not have had to show the prisoners of war on television," the editorial said. 
The war in Iraq has given Israelis and Palestinians one more issue on which to disagree.
The Israelis are supporters of the American-led war, believing that the fall of Mr. Hussein would remove a major threat and chasten radical Arab governments and groups throughout the region.
The Palestinians are overwhelmingly against the war, and some cheer Mr. Hussein for his willingness to confront the Americans.
At the P.L.O. Flag Shop in Gaza City, Tareq Abu Dayyeh, the owner, has been selling large numbers of Iraqi flags.
"Palestinian people are exactly like the Iraqi people," he said this week. "The Apache is hitting us, and it's hitting them too. The F-16 is hitting us, and it's hitting them too. It's the same fate."
In an interview this week, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, called on the Arab world to fight what he called an "American Zionist war."
"The Americans want to destroy the Islamic faith, and to change the map of the Middle East, and to control not only the oil but also the society," he said. "Today is Iraq, tomorrow is Egypt, then Sudan, thenSaudi Arabia."
Israeli commentators have been closely scrutinizing the American military campaign, often making analogies to Israel's fight with the Palestinians.
"Washington realized in many situations, accurate long-range fire is insufficient and that in order to win, it is not enough to use special forces, even in the large quantities employed in Afghanistan," Yaakov Amidror, a major general in the reserves, wrote in a front-page commentary in the daily Maariv. "Reality proves that in many situations there is a need to employ armored forces in order to win."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: TURKEY; 
Troops Won't Be Sent to Kurdish Areas, Turkish Military Chief Says

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF with DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, March 26 

 BODY:
The head of Turkey's military said today that his country would not send new troops into northern Iraq, barring a refugee catastrophe or open warfare between rival Kurdish factions.
 "This is not our war," said Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, chief of staff of the armed forces, reading from a prepared text at a local military base here. "This is not our mission." 
 His announcement eases fears of a war-within-a-war on the northern front, though General Ozkok did say that he reserved the right to send forces into Iraq if the situation there spun out of control. 
"As it is known, there is a Turkish military presence in northern Iraq," the general said, without specifying the number of soldiers or the type of equipment Turkey has in Iraq. 
"Our biggest concern is an attack on our position or a large refugee crisis from an unexpected development in the war or an attack on our stability from the armed elements in the region," the general said. He added that if Turkey did send new troops, it would do so only in coordination with the United States.
American and the European officials have pressed Turkey not to send forces into northern Iraq, fearing that their presence would inflame the passions of Kurdish militias that are helping small numbers of American troops secure the area. 
Iraqi Kurds fear that Turkey's chief aim is to curb their autonomy, while Turkey is concerned that any Iraqi Kurdish moves toward independence could encourage secessionist aspirations among Turkey's own Kurdish minority.
On Monday, Turkey told its Western allies that it planned to create a buffer zone up to 13 miles deep to contain refugees in northern Iraq if there was a mass exodus.
But today General Ozkok backed away from those plans. "We have no desire to establish a permanent buffer zone," he said.
It is unclear why the military had a change of heart, but perhaps it had to do with White House plans to offer $1 billion in grants to Turkey that could be leveraged into $8.5 billion in loans or loan guarantees, subject to Congressional approval, to cushion the economic effects of war. 
The White House initially offered $6 billion in direct aid that could be used to get $24 billion in loans -- before the Turkish Parliament voted on March 1 not to permit the deployment of 62,000 American troops here. Late last week, the Parliament did authorize overflight rights for American warplanes attacking targets in northern Iraq.
The beleaguered Turkish markets rose for the second consecutive day on reports of the American aid.
It was a humbling day for General Ozkok, widely considered the most powerful man in Turkey, the supreme commander of a semi-autonomous military and a man who is not used to having to explain himself.
Though he did not take questions from reporters, he could not resist taking a shot at American diplomats, who have pressured Turkey not to intervene militarily in northern Iraq.
"I have difficulty understanding those who claim there is a threat to them across the ocean," the general said. "And when Turkey says the same threat exists on the other side of its border, this is found to be unbelievable." 
He added: "If things get out of control, I hope our friends will not ask us take action that they oppose now." 
Though he said the purpose of an existing Turkish military force along the Iraqi border was to keep the peace and provide relief aid, General Ozkok did not say when the border would be open to international aid agencies trying to reach Iraqi refugees.
Kurdish officials say there is no refugee crisis in northern Iraq and no need for Turkish intervention. Relief groups are split over the issue. Human Rights Watch warned on Friday that the Kurdish government and international aid groups did not have enough food, tents and other supplies to handle a refugee crisis. But some aid groups said the situation was not so dire.
"There are not many tents," said Dr. Giorgio Francia, a manager for Relief International, a Los Angeles-based health aid organization. "But there are also not that many refugees."
The exact number of displaced people in northern Iraq is unclear, but hundreds of thousands of Kurds fearing chemical attack by Saddam Hussein are believed to have fled major cities in Iraq. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of those people are living in the open in caves, tents, trucks and buses.
Kurdish opposition to a Turkish incursion remains adamant. A young policeman in Kani Masi, an Iraqi town that sits a few miles from a crossing point where Turkish soldiers and tanks are massed, said on Tuesday that he had blunt orders from his superiors -- "to resist and the fight the Turks."
Asked if he was ready to die in what would likely be a fruitless effort to stop tanks with assault rifles, he said, "I am ready to sacrifice."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: SOUTHERN IRAQ; 
Food Arrives, but Water Supplies Cause Worry

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, March 26 

 BODY:
The first food convoy arrived at the Iraqi border town of Safwan today and, according to reports, was greeted by a panicked crowd that swarmed around the trucks, fighting for scraps.
 There were reports that residents of Basra were drinking from putrid rivers, raising the specter of an outbreak of disease. 
 Hospitals in Baghdad were given plastic bags filled with water in case the power was knocked out.
After a week of war, efforts to bring aid to the people of Iraq remain stalled, and relief workers, as well as world leaders, are becoming increasingly worried about a crisis that could spiral out of control. 
The United Nations will formally ask for more than $2 billion for assistance later this week, according to United Nations officials.
"I must say, I am getting increasingly concerned by humanitarian casualties in this conflict," Secretary General Kofi Annan said today.
The Bush administration is also moving to address concerns. In his budget proposal to Congress, President Bush has asked for $2.4 billion for aid and reconstruction.
"We have never spent this much money in one year in one country in the 40-year history of A.I.D.," said Andrew Natsios, the head of the Agency for International Development.
But money is not the main problem right now.
The most immediate concern remains the water shortage in Basra, Iraq's second largest city and home to 1.5 million people.
The city's main water treatment plant stopped working last Friday when power was knocked out. It remains unclear what caused the damage. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been working to repair the facility, but it remains severely damaged, working at about 50 percent capacity.
"As of this afternoon, we have managed only to establish a partial functioning treatment center," said Fouad Bawaba, a Red Cross spokesman. Engineers have still not been able to assess the damage to the high voltage power lines that feed the center, Mr. Bawaba said.
There are reports that the people in Basra are so desperate that they have begun drinking out of the rivers. Around 500,000 tons of raw sewage is dumped into Iraqi waterways every day, according to the United Nations. When allied bombing during the first Gulf war knocked out power in large sections of the country for months, the lack of clean water led to an outbreak of cholera.
While the situation in Basra seems dire, aid workers warned that there are other large cities where there is no information about the current conditions. Particularly, the heavy fighting reported in Najaf and Nasiriya has relief workers worried about what they might find there.
They say that much of the Bush administration's preparations were based on the assumption that the allied armies would be more warmly received than has been the case. 
The severity of the crisis will be determined largely by how quickly workers can resume the elaborate system set up to distribute food under the United Nations- administered oil-for-food program. There are more than 40,000 distribution points in the country that are currently not working.
"The actual mechanism that is in place is one of the best mechanisms in the world for distributing food," said Regina Davis, the chief food officer for the disaster relief team designated by the Bush administration to speed the flow of aid.
Her team is in place in Kuwait but is still unable to go into southern Iraq to assess the situation.
Today, the Kuwaiti Red Crescent drove five trucks with 20 tons of food and water into the small town of Safwan just across the Iraqi border. Although only 5,000 people live in Safwan, the Kuwaitis were met with swarming masses of people grabbing at boxes and tearing them apart, fighting each other for anything they could grab. While accepting the food, they expressed the disdain for those who brought it, chanting that they would bleed for Saddam Hussein.
The United States military also brought a convoy of seven trucks filled with aid across the Iraqi border today to Umm Qasr, but it is being kept in storage. A ship carrying relief supplies from Britain, the Sir Galahad, is scheduled to dock at Umm Qasr on Thursday. Military officials would not speculate when the aid would begin moving.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Some Question Timingof Sears Credit Card Unit Sale

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck could be selling its giant credit card business at the bottom of the market.
 The overall industry has weakened as overextended consumers have fallen behind on their payments, but the losses may be peaking, according to consultants and analysts who follow the business. Selling at the trough would seem to be a management misstep, since Sears might fetch a higher price for its unit if it waited for the business to recover. 
 But the Sears portfolio may not be bottoming out as quickly as those of its competitors. 
"I was surprised they would sell now, given the state of the economy," said Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, which publishes research and data on the industry. "But maybe they want to unload it before it gets less desirable."
Sears has been adding new customers at a much faster rate than other card issuers over the last two years, and it appears to have been less discriminating in terms of measuring those customers' abilities to pay their bills. If so, Sears will suffer higher losses over the next few months than the credit card industry over all.
The company has replaced many of its Sears store cards over the last three years with Sears MasterCards, which allow users to buy goods not only at Sears but anywhere MasterCard is accepted.
Balances on the company's MasterCard accounts, which amount to 40 percent of Sears' total outstanding card balances, more than doubled in each of the last two years. The industry over all has experienced growth in the single digits.
Credit card companies usually wait several months before they write off customer debts, as they give customers some time to pay what they owe. 
Because a large portion of the Sears MasterCard accounts were opened relatively recently, any buyer of the portfolio will probably pay just a modest price above the value of the outstanding balances, Mr. McKinley said. He predicted Sears would get 10 percent, or possibly less, in excess of its $30.8 billion in total outstanding balances. After subtracting the debt attached to the portfolio, that would result in net proceeds to Sears of around $7 billion.
"The Sears MasterCard business is a young portfolio, and its quality is unpredictable," said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, which tracks the industry. "Typically a portfolio of that size would command a double-digit premium.
Still, the size of the Sears portfolio may make it attractive to some buyers eager to expand their card business, particularly at a time when the growth of consumer credit card spending has slowed. 
Last year, credit card balances increased just 8 percent, Mr. Robertson said. During the mid-1990's, those balances grew more than 10 percent a year on average, he said.
Sears is the third-largest MasterCard issuer and the second-largest issuer of so-called proprietary cards, trailing General Electric, according to Nilson.
Prospective bidders include Citigroup, the largest credit card issuer; Bank One; and General Electric, said Bruce Harting, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. The companies' representatives declined to comment yesterday on whether they were interested in buying the portfolio.
Sears officials said yesterday that they might sell only the MasterCard business and retain the private-label cards. The Sears card business would be less attractive to most buyers, Wall Street analysts said, because those cards can be used only in Sears stores and therefore tend to have lower balances.
Sears surprised investors last October by announcing that it would have to set aside an additional $222 million to cover losses on its credit cards in the third quarter, in large part because of its MasterCard business.
Sears introduced its Gold MasterCard because it grew frustrated as its better customers abandoned the Sears credit card in favor of bank-sponsored Visa or MasterCard accounts. Sears quickly converted 23 million of its 60 million Sears cardholders to the new MasterCard, which offered check-writing privileges.
The company expanded into the MasterCard business just at the peak of the economic boom, Mr. Robertson said, and like other credit card issuers, suffered as unemployment and personal bankruptcy filings rose.
"The credit quality deterioration at Sears has been similar to that experienced by other issuers during the soft economy of the past two years," said Richard B. Shane Jr., an analyst at Jefferies & Companies, in a research report published yesterday.
But Mr. Shane said in an interview that there were signs that the worst was over at some credit card companies that have experienced rising losses over the last year.
MBNA reported that it had written off 5.48 percent of the balances in its card portfolios in February, down from 5.55 percent in January.
That was the first sign of improvement after four consecutive months of deterioration. The company also said that its losses would decline for this month and for much of the year.
Capital One Financial and Providian Financial also reported lower losses for the month, he said.
"If the economy starts to improve, buying a large portfolio now would prove to be a very attractive investment," he said.
Operating profit at the Sears credit division declined nearly 2 percent last year, but the company was still the fifth-most-profitable credit card issuer last year, Mr. Robertson said.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: MILITARY FAMILIES; 
Relatives of Missing Soldiers Dread Hearing Worse News

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

DATELINE: PALESTINE, W.Va., March 26 

 BODY:
Gregory Lynch Sr. choked up as he stood on his porch here overlooking the tobacco fields and cattle pastures, and declared that he remained optimistic -- even though a military official had just come by to warn him to brace himself, that even worse news could be coming any day now.
 It is hard to imagine, he says, any worse news than what he learned on Sunday night: his 19-year-old daughter, Pfc. Jessica Lynch, had been in the Army convoy that was ambushed in southern Iraq. 
 Fifteen soldiers were missing, captured or killed and Private Lynch's fate was unknown, officials said at that time. But Mr. Lynch said today that the official told him five of the soldiers in the unit, not including his daughter, could be seen alive on a videotape broadcast on an Arab television network. Two other soldiers could be identified and were dead in one room, Mr. Lynch said the official told him, but there were also several other bodies -- six or more -- that could be seen in another room. 
If all the additional bodies of those soldiers are from the 507th Maintenance Company and there were only six of them, in the brutal equation running through Mr. Lynch's mind, there is still a chance his eldest daughter is alive.
"She is listed as missing; we still believe she is missing," he said. 
Since that ambush on Sunday, much of the nation's attention has focused on the five members of the 507th, whose frightened images appeared on Iraqi television and later in news broadcasts here. 
And in recent days the families of the prisoners of war have expressed hope that their loved ones would be returned safely once the fighting ends. But for the families of the eight members of the 507th whom the Pentagon lists as "whereabouts unknown," there is an extra degree of dread in their wait.
"We don't know anything. Not knowing anything is so hard," said Ruben Estrella, whose 18-year-old son, Pvt. Ruben Estrella-Soto of El Paso, is among the members of the 507th listed as missing. "I can't take this waiting."
Mr. Lynch seemed distracted as he stood on the porch of his hilltop home here looking into the tobacco fields and pastures. He talked about the satellite television service that brought CNN and other cable news networks into his home, his family's long history of military service and the poor condition of the local economy.
It was almost as if he wanted to talk about anything -- anything other than his elder daughter. He took a deep breath and stared nervously at his wife, Deadre -- her eyes red and watery -- and then looked at their 17-year-old daughter, Brandi, as he recounted the events of Sunday night.
That was when he found out that his elder daughter was missing, along with the 14 other soldiers from the 507th Maintenance Company who had been ambushed in southern Iraq. The family was watching television that afternoon when they were jolted by the news that an Army maintenance unit had been ambushed early that morning. Then they heard that an Arab television network was broadcasting images of soldiers who had been captured. Then they heard that one of the prisoners of war was a woman. They found some relief, though, when they heard that the woman was black.
"I told my wife that we should not worry because no news is good news and we hadn't heard anything," Mr. Lynch said, explaining his relief.
But then the knock came.
An Army officer in a green full-dress uniform was at the door to deliver the message that his daughter's company had been ambushed and no one knew where she was. Several soldiers had been captured, the officer said, and others had been killed. But, Mr. Lynch recalled, the officer said she was not among them and was nowhere to be found. 
"He told us that the Army had no idea where she was and that she was being listed as missing in action," Mr. Lynch said.
The waiting and wondering have taken their toll, creating an emotional upheaval in each family member's life. 
Jessica's older brother, Gregory Jr., who is in the West Virginia National Guard, was flown home from Fort Bragg, N.C. Brandi, a senior at Wirt County High School, where Jessica graduated less than two years ago, has hardly left her mother's side.
For a while, they watched television, flipping from channel to channel, for a tidbit about Private Lynch. But it was turned off after a reporter asked the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, "Does the president think that the Iraqi Army has somehow changed to avoid raping of female prisoners?"
Since finding out her daughter was missing, Deadre Lynch says, she has not been able to sleep much. When she has been able to catch a few minutes of sleep, she says, she has dreamed that her daughter ran away from her unit before the attack to help some Iraqi child. The last time the family heard from their daughter was in an e-mail message from Kuwait two weeks ago. She wrote about her dreams of becoming an elementary school teacher and her discomfort with any order not to stop to help any children because it could be a decoy or a trap.
At the Pentagon today, Defense Department officials announced for the first time the names of the confirmed dead from the 507th, as well as those who are still classified as missing. The prisoners of war had already been identified by military officials and relatives who had seen their television images. 
The dead were listed as Specialist Jamaal R. Addison, 22, of Roswell, Ga., and Pfc. Howard Johnson II, 21, of Mobile, Ala. 
The missing were listed as Private Lynch; Private Estrella-Soto; Master Sgt. Robert J. Dowdy, 38, of Cleveland; and Specialist James M. Kiehl, 22, of Des Moines, as well as Chief Warrant Officer Johnny Villareal Mata, 35, of El Paso, and Pfc. Lori Ann Piestewa, 23, of Tuba City, Ariz. Pvt. Brandon Ulysses Sloan, 19, of Bedford, Ohio, and Sgt. Donald Ralph Walters, 33, of Salem, Ore., were also listed as missing.
Part of what has made the circumstances of the 507th so striking is that most of its members were young and in noncombat roles. The unit had been sent to supply soldiers on the front lines on Sunday when the lead vehicle made a wrong turn, taking them off a highway and across a bridge. The unit -- made up of mechanics, supply clerks, a cook -- was trapped by two buses, Iraqi irregular forces and tanks. The unit keeps trucks rolling, fixes generators and maintains other equipment, said Jean Offutt, a spokeswoman at Fort Bliss, the base in western Texas.
A firefight ensued where several members of the 507th, including its chief officer, were wounded and escaped. Marines who were sent in to look for the other members found only the remains of some of their vehicles.
Officials at Fort Bliss asked relatives of the members of the 507th not to speak to the news media today, citing concerns that Iraqi forces would use the interviews to coerce information against those who are prisoners. 
Stacie Walters, 27, who learned that her husband, Sgt. Donald Walters, was among the missing, said that part of his job during the first Persian Gulf war had been to guard captured Iraqi soldiers. His sister, Kimberly Cieslak, who lives in Salem, Ore., said that her brother "came back pretty traumatized from that experience," adding that during that war he had seen "too many dead people."
Pentagon officials also said Specialist Gregory P. Sanders, 19, of Indiana, an Army infantryman, was killed in combat in Iraq on Monday. Mr. Sanders, the son of a Navy sailor, began wearing combat fatigues when he was 2 years old, relatives said. "He wanted to be a soldier," said Rick Knight, his uncle, who said Army officials told him that his nephew had been killed in a sniper shooting. "He was born to be a soldier."
Pentagon officials also said a second serviceman was killed in a grenade attack believed to have been carried out by another soldier at Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait. The officials said Maj. Gregory Stone, 40, of Boise, Idaho, a member of the Air National Guard, died on Tuesday of injuries suffered in that attack. 
The officials also said that two marines in an engineering unit, Cpl. Evan T. James, 20, of Hancock, Ill., and Sgt. Bradley S. Korthaus, 29, of Scott, Iowa, who disappeared near the Saddam Canal in southeastern Iraq on Monday, were being listed as missing in action.
In Iowa, Sergeant Korthaus's brother Steve said he had joined the Marines just after graduating from high school in 1992 and "would have been mad if he didn't get to go" to Iraq, even though he had just become engaged. "He wanted to be a marine since he was 10 years old," Mr. Korthaus said.

 CORRECTION:
CORRECTING THE RECORD; The Articles; Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work

On Sunday, May 11, 2003, The Times published a two-full-page accounting of misrepresentations and plagiarism by Jayson Blair, who resigned on May 1 as a reporter. This article was among those described. The description:

Relatives of Missing Soldiers Dread Hearing Worse News
MARCH 27, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Although this article about the relatives of soldiers missing in combat in Iraq carried a March 26 dateline from Palestine, W.Va., Mr. Blair's cellphone records, described to reporters by William E. Schmidt, an associate managing editor of The Times, indicate that he was in New York. In addition, several people at the Lynch home -- including photographers and other reporters -- said they had not met or seen Mr. Blair there. And the hotels nearest to Palestine have no record of Mr. Blair's staying there.

PLAGIARISM -- In the article, Mr. Blair described the anguish of the Estrella family whose son was one of the eight members of the 507th Maintenance Company listed by the Pentagon as whereabouts unknown. " 'We don't know anything. Not knowing anything is so hard,' said Ruben Estrella, whose 18-year-old son, Pvt. Ruben Estrella-Soto of El Paso, is among the members of the 507th listed as missing. 'I can't take this waiting.' " An Associated Press article, written from El Paso on March 26, quoted Ruben Estrella as saying, "We don't know anything, not knowing anything. It's been three days of waiting."

DENIED REPORTS -- Mr. Blair quoted Kimberly Cieslak, whose brother, Sgt. Donald Walters, was missing. Ms. Cieslak said she did not recall speaking to Mr. Blair, although she did remember speaking to a different reporter for The Times for a later story.

FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair wrote that tobacco fields and cattle pastures were visible from the porch of the Lynch home. Brandi Lynch said there is no such view. Mr. Blair wrote that Private Lynch's brother was in the National Guard in West Virginia. He is actually in the Army. Mr. Blair described a dream of Private Lynch's mother, Deadra Lynch; Brandi Lynch said her mother had not described any such dream. Mr. Blair also misspelled Deadra Lynch's first name.

HEADLINE: Sears Reinvents Itself, but What Exactly Is It? 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
At a time when economic hard times have eroded sales for retailers large and small, Sears, Roebuck is reinventing itself as a retail company -- without the cushion of its credit card business. 
 Sears announced yesterday that it would put its credit card business, begun during the Depression, up for sale. The company says that its plan is well timed to reduce its $28.5 billion debt and to increase value for shareholders at Sears, which posted a 28 percent increase in retail income last year. Others say the approach is risky because it pits Sears, still in search of a strong public image, directly against retail behemoths like Wal-Mart, Target and Home Depot, not to mention fast-growing chains like Kohl's and the industry veteran J. C. Penney. 
 The decision to part with the credit business, which the chairman and chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, lauded in October for the "tremendous financial flexibility" it gave Sears, represents a marked shift in strategy. The credit division produces 60 percent of the company's earnings, and has long been a buffer against the unpredictability of retail. With its Sears cards and Gold MasterCards, it not only generates income from borrowers, but also promotes spending with generous terms like zero percent financing and accounts that are not considered uncollectible until 240 days have gone by -- a third longer than the typical bank credit card. 
Some industry experts now wonder what the Sears of the future -- with its credit card cushion stripped away -- will resemble, both in appearance and performance against competitors.
For some time, the company has been trying to develop what its ads call its "softer side," meaning clothing, housewares and goods other than tools and appliances. The purchase of the catalog giant Lands' End 10 months ago, for $1.9 billion in cash, was one step in that direction, and was also seen as a way of getting another kind of shopper into Sears. 
Still, such a strategy means competing with Target, Wal-Mart and other retailers thathave a head start on similar efforts. 
"Sears faces a lot of pressure from a lot of quarters, and it doesn't clearly stand for any one of those areas," said Lois Huff, a senior vice president for Retail Forward, a Columbus, Ohio, consulting firm. "Lands' End is great, but it's not enough." 
Along with Lands' End, the other clothing brands highlighted at Sears include Dockers and Covington, a private label. Lands' End is supposed to represent the high end of consumer choices, and to draw in baby boomers and others formerly conditioned to buying it through the Lands' End catalog. The line began appearing in Sears stores in November, and was widened to more than 200 stores this month. 
But while Lands' End may bring a different clientele, some experts fret that it will alienate the traditional Sears shopper. Others say the introduction of better clothing highlights the dreariness of the other Sears offerings. 
"It is straddling a lot of fences," Ms. Huff said. "It's not a Kohl's. It's not a Wal-Mart."
The attempts to attract new customers are often hampered by location: many Sears stores are in malls, which have fallen out of favor with younger shoppers. "What used to be great anchor locations for grandma and grandpa have become the worst possible locations for young adults," said Burt Flickinger III, managing partner of the Strategic Resource Group, a consulting company. 
Sears has also been plagued by the downdraft in sales encountered by many retailers who built stores at shopping malls a generation ago. While Sears has remodeled many stores, analysts say that a new prototype may be necessary to improve sales. 
At a store in San Bruno, Calif., yesterday, evidence of Sears as a work-in-progress was everywhere. Sales at the store, one of the nation's busiest under normal circumstances, have slowed as a result of a renovation under way, sales clerks said. The shoppers who braved the conditions gave the merchandise mixed reviews. 
"They do not have the clothing brands I like," complained Sylvia Flores, a 50-ish antique dealer from San Bruno, saying that what Sears sells is aimed at "an older set." 
The sales staff seemed friendly and eager to please. One shopper, in search of a garbage can, was directed to the Target next door. The Lands' End department, occupying its own section, was empty except for one shopper, while the appliance departments, tools and housewares were busy. 
Where Sears has earned praise from analysts is its successful integration of its Internet presences with actual stores. With the purchase of Lands' End, it re-entered the catalog world to a degree; the Lands' End catalog was said to be a possible way of promoting Sears products. Each company advertises the other on its Web site, although Lands' End merchandise is more readily accessible through the Sears site than Sears is through Lands' End. 
To be sure, Sears has reinvented itself in the past. It began life as a catalog company, only to abandon the catalog in 1993. It prided itself on its specialties in tools and appliances, then began to build a business in clothing and other soft goods in the 1990's. It opened hundreds of retail stores, then began a foray into financial services that ended with the sale of those businesses, also in 1993 and also to pay down debt. 
Though an important earnings generator in recent years, Sears' formidable credit operation has hit some rough spots. The Gold MasterCard was introduced in 2000 and Sears has become the second-largest issuer of the cards, after Citibank, which is a possible buyer of the Sears portfolio.
But in October, the new card's prospects dimmed after Sears' chairman and chief executive revealed that the company would need an additional $222 million to cover uncollectible charges for the third quarter. Most of that was traced to the MasterCard. At the same time, Mr. Lacy, said the company's head of credit had been dismissed for "credibility" problems. That executive, Kevin T. Keleghan, has sued Sears, contending breach of contract, and Mr. Lacy, contending defamation. 
A spokesman, Ted McDougal, said the company had considered selling the credit division three other times since 1994. This time, interest seemed high, and with the Sears share price having fallen to around $24, shareholders seemed likely to appreciate it, too. While no decision has been made, proceeds from a sale would probably be used to reduce debt and buy back stock as well as pay a dividend to shareholders, Mr. McDougal said.

HEADLINE: Judge Questions Legal Fees In New York Tobacco Case 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
A New York judge is challenging the lawyers' fees in the five-year-old settlement by tobacco companies with the states, casting some doubt on the settlement even as states make plans to use the billions of dollars that they have been pledged.
 The dispute may become intensely political in New York where legislative leaders are hoping to sell some bonds backed by New York's share of the settlement -- $25.5 billion -- to help narrow the state's budget deficit. Questioning any aspect of the settlement, which resolved claims by the states for costs of health care for those suffering from smoking-related illnesses, could make the bonds less attractive to investors. 
 The New York justice, Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, called the fees "potentially excessive and therefore unethical" in court documents this fall and in January. 
The tobacco companies agreed to pay $625 million to lawyers representing New York, a bill that has been tabulated as $13,000 an hour by a member of the arbitration panel that approved the fee. Justice Ramos questioned whether some of the $625 million should have gone to New York. 
Justice Ramos did not explicitly raise the concern that the lawyers for the states were paid to settle easily. He also did not directly challenge the $205 billion nationwide settlement, which is more than three-quarters of the $246 billion over all that tobacco companies have agreed to pay the states. But he implied that the tobacco did not appear to have fought the lawyers' fee requests very hard -- something that the tobacco companies disputed. 
The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, has declined to pursue the fees and has formed an unlikely alliance with New York's outside lawyers and the tobacco companies to argue that Justice Ramos, who inherited the tobacco litigation after the settlement was agreed upon, does not have the authority to review the matter. Finding that no one involved in the settlement would pursue the question of the fees, the judge in January appointed two independent lawyers to represent New York. Mr. Spitzer, the tobacco companies and the outside lawyers are all appealing the judge's action.
"It is a very bizarre proceeding," said Samuel Issacharoff, a Columbia University law professor who is representing the out-of-state law firms that represented New York. "The appellants are everybody. The lawyers are appealing; the state is appealing; the tobacco companies are appealing."
For Justice Ramos, the problem has been that $625 million is a lot of money to pay lawyers, even when the settlement totals some $25 billion (the lawyers initially requested $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion, according to court documents).
"A legal feemust pass the test of reasonableness," Justice Ramos wrote in October. "A fee of this magnitude probes the limits of propriety and requires the courts to rule whether the practice of law, which bars attorneys from accepting unreasonable or illegal fees, will permit counsel to enjoy such a windfall."
Under the terms of the global settlement, legal fees would be paid by the tobacco companies and would be treated separately from the money for the settling states. When the tobacco companies and the outside lawyers could not agree on a dollar amount, a three-member arbitration panel was appointed to determine the fee; the panel set the compensation for the groups of law firms that represented different states. New York was represented by six law firms, three from other states.
The members of the arbitration panel were Harry Huge, a Washington lawyer picked by the lawyers representing plaintiffs; Charles Renfrew, a former federal judge selected by the tobacco companies; and John Calhoun Wells, picked as the independent panelist. Mr. Wells and Mr. Huge supported the $625 million fee (and indeed supported similar fees to lawyers who represented other states), while Mr. Renfrew criticized it as excessive.
The $625 million fee, Mr. Renfrew wrote in his dissent "represents over $13,000 per hour for every hour spent on the New York case by each lawyer, regardless of experience or skill."
"This is well over one half of the annual per capita income in the United States for the year 1999," he wrote. "To suggest that a fee of this size is necessary to motivate the bar is flatly wrong and, I believe an insult to the profession."
The other members of the arbitration panel said the $625 million fee was appropriate given the difficulty of the New York case and the speed at which the lawyers had prepared for trial.
In response to Mr. Renfrew's criticism, the other panel members compared the fees to other professional salaries -- ranging from the baseball player Derek Jeter's $170 million, multiyear contract (which translates into about $26,000 an hour, they wrote) to the $5.1 million (about $12,700 an hour when stock options are included) paid to Geoffrey C. Bible, a former chief executive of Philip Morris.
But given how much work the outside lawyers did, the large fees seem excessive, said Lester Brickman, a law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York. (Mr. Brickman said he has testified on behalf of opponents of large fees paid for other states' settlements, but not in the New York case.) 
The outside lawyers were not involved in the difficult, early stages of the lawsuit, Mr. Brickman said, and should not have been paid so much. "They came into the process very late," he said. "They copied work done by other people."
The possibility that tobacco companies did not resist the outside lawyers' proposed fees was rejected by Jeffrey E. Stone, a lawyer in the Chicago office of McDermott Will & Emery, which helped represent the tobacco companies. 
"We opposed the fee request made by outside counsel as vigorously and as forcefully as we could," Mr. Stone said, adding that the agreement governing the arbitration barred an appeal of the results. "We thought that the award that was granted was completely disproportionate to the work and the results achieved by the outside counsel in New York."
Generally, a fee is not unreasonable on its face, said Roger C. Cramton, a law professor at Cornell University. "All courts say that a fee has to be reasonable, and not excessive or unconscionable," he said. "But theyalso say where sophisticated parties made elaborate agreements after very great consideration," courts should be reluctant to interfere. Fees may be higher if the lawyer took a more risky position, for example, he said. "A lot depends."
It is the opposition of the attorney general's office to review of the fees that has drawn the most criticism. A spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, Darren Dopp, said that even if the outside lawyers were overpaid, the excess would be refunded to the tobacco companies and would not go to the states.
More important, Mr. Dopp said, any tinkering with the fee arrangement could result in tinkering with the overall settlement. That might undermine tobacco industry pledges to refrain from certain kinds of advertising, he said, and could hamper any efforts by New York to turn the settlement to its advantage.
"We argue against reopening it in part because disrupting it right now could have serious financial consequences," he said. "It would compound a fiscal problem facing local governments and the state."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A Slow Burn Over Fees"The tobacco industry is supposed to pay $246 billion to state and local governments under a 1998 settlement.

HEADLINE: New York State Adopts Strict Ban on Workplace Smoking 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26 

 BODY:
After two years of legislative gridlock, New York today became only the third state to pass a tough antismoking law that would ban smoking in nearly every restaurant, bar and workplace.
 The Legislature moved exceptionally quickly to pass the measure, overcoming fierce opposition from some Republican members and a heavy lobbying campaign by the tobacco, liquor and restaurant industries, which derailed a similar effort less than a year ago. 
 Hours later, Gov. George E. Pataki signed the bill into law, clearing the way for the smoking ban to take effect in 120 days. But Lisa Dewald Stoll, the governor's press secretary, said that Mr. Pataki remained concerned about what he saw as inconsistencies in the new ban, including how it would affect local antismoking measures. He urged legislators to address those concerns. 
"While he has reservations about the bill, he has signed the bill because he believes a statewide ban on smoking in the workplace will lead to a healthier New York and reduce the cost of health care," Ms. Stoll said. 
In the last year, New York City and at least five counties -- Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Orange and Dutchess -- have passed similar legislation. The state ban would apply to localities that either do not have any antismoking laws, or that have less restrictive ones. In cases in which the localities have stronger laws, like Westchester and Nassau, those laws would not be pre-empted.
The state smoking ban comes just four days before New York City begins enforcing its own smoking ban, and will pre-empt sections of it. For instance, the state ban limits special tobacco-promotion events at restaurants and bars to two nights a year, instead of the five allowed under the city ban. In addition, the state law will close several exemptions that were added at the last minute by the City Council.
Smoking will no longer be allowed at establishments personally operated by their owners, and bars and nightclubs will no longer have the option of building specially ventilated rooms that can be used for up to three years.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who initially proposed the city ban without those exemptions, has told state legislators that he supports the state ban. Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor, said that Mr. Bloomberg "is very pleased that the state is ensuring that all New Yorkers work in a safe environment."
News of the state smoking ban was greeted mostly with a shrug by some advocates for restaurant and bar owners, who saw it as only slightly more onerous than the city ban.
E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the Greater New York City Chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said that as a practical matter, the city exemptions had applied to few places because of the restrictions attached to them. 
But Steven Salvesen, an architect with RIP Construction Consultants, said that six of his clients had started adding smoking rooms to their businesses, including some that had invested $15,000 to $20,000. Mr. Salvesen said he did not think they could recoup their money.
The Legislature took up the antismoking legislation again after coming close to passing a weaker version last year that would have banned smoking in restaurants, but not in bars. The Democratic-led Assembly passed the measure, but under heavy pressure from Governor Pataki and tobacco, liquor and restaurant interests, Senate Republican leaders never allowed it to come to a vote.
But this year, it was the Senate Republican leaders who took the lead on the issue. After nearly a week of intense closed-door negotiations, the Senate passed the sweeping smoking bill by a vote of 57 to 4, with not a single Republican voting against it. 
The Assembly also overwhelmingly passed the bill, 97 to 44, after more than three hours of heated debate.
But this show of bipartisan unity came only after Senate and Assembly leaders spent the last few days pressing reluctant members to support the ban, saying that the public health benefits outweighed the economic blow to small businesses in their individual districts. 
"This is probably the most important piece of legislation that the Legislature has passed in years," the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said immediately after today's vote. "When you're talking about the quality of life here, and people's health and welfare and safety, I don't think there's anything more important."
Until the final count, however, lobbyists on both sides of the issue were furiously trying to make their case. Dozens of them staked out the hallways outside the two chambers, waiting for the chance to corner a legislator or two. Others tirelessly made the rounds of Albany's fund-raisers the night before, refusing to declare victory or concede defeat.
"It's been the most intensely lobbied issue so far this year because the stakes have been so high for both sides," said Steve Weingarten, a lobbyist for several medical groups, including the American Cancer Society.
Under the state ban, smoking will be restricted to a handful of indoor sites like private hotel rooms, cigar bars and membership clubs with no paid employees. California and Delaware have enacted similar legislation, and four other states -- Florida, Maine, Utah and Vermont -- have banned smoking in restaurants, but not in bars. 
But for years, cities and local governments across the country have adopted increasingly strict smoking bans. Timothy Filler, associate director for Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group in Berkeley, Calif., said that 93 municipalities had banned smoking in restaurants and bars -- including Boston; Helena, Mont.; El Paso; and Tempe, Ariz.; in the last two years.
In addition, he said, more than 1,600 municipalities have adopted some variation of an antismoking law, ranging from ones that allow restaurants to have separate smoking areas to others that ban smoking only in government buildings. 
"This is not a novel idea, but it is a very important step toward protecting all workers," he said. "And it is an idea whose time has come."

HEADLINE: Bruno Takes Own Road to a Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 26 

 BODY:
No one in state government has ever accused Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the Senate, of not having a mind of his own. More often than not, however, his political beliefs and needs have meshed well with those of the Republican governor, George E. Pataki. This week they have not.
 On two fronts, Senator Bruno broke publicly with Mr. Pataki. First he announced that he had forged a compromise with the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, on a new way to borrow billions to help the state weather its financial crisis. Mr. Pataki had proposed another borrowing plan and still prefers it. 
 Then, Mr. Bruno ignored the objections of the governor and muscled a bill through his chamber that would ban smoking in workplaces, persuading many reluctant upstate Republican senators to vote with him.
Later in the day, the governor signed the bill, despite his reservations, saying he would ask for some amendments.
Mr. Bruno says it would be a mistake to read too much into the apparent rift that has opened between himself and Mr. Pataki. He has split with the governor on a host of policy issues over the last eight years, from health care to rent control. He even beat back the governor's attempt to oust him three years ago.
"The governor is my partner," Senator Bruno said in an interview today. "You have differences of opinion with partners."
Partners or not, the senator's recent willingness to have his path diverge from the governor's suggests he will play a maverick and pivotal role in the battle over how to close an $11.5 billion shortfall in the state's budget.
One reason is that Mr. Bruno's political needs this year are very different from those of the governor, who just won a third four-year term.
With an election four years off, Mr. Pataki has taken the lofty Reaganesque stand that holding down taxes is the best way to revive the economy and, in the long run, to bolster tax collections. Instead of raising taxes, he intends to drastically cut aid to local schools and reduce benefits from government health programs.
But failing to bring home school aid can be politically fatal for local senators and assemblymen, since it tends to drive up local property taxes or lead to layoffs. Cuts to hospitals and nursing homes are also difficult to sell to voters.
So while Mr. Pataki may be able to survive the fallout from his budget and repair damage to his image before the next election, many Republican senators say privately that they will have a hard time persuading their constituents to accept such service cuts. And they must stand for re-election next year.
Mr. Bruno acknowledges his political exigencies "are somewhat different" than the governor's. "I am looking, more parochially, at the needs of my conference and my members," he said. "That builds in a difference."
As a practical matter, Senator Bruno has said that some of the governor's cuts to schools and health care must be restored before his chamber will pass a budget. The question is how much to restore and where the money will come from. He has proposed a number of ways to raise more revenue, like collecting sales tax owed on Internet sales.
Almost daily, Mr. Bruno plays the role of mediator between the governor, who has vowed to stop "job-killing taxes," and Speaker Silver, who insists that most of the cuts to education and health care must be reversed. Mr. Silver's restorations would be almost impossible to accomplish without a tax increase, though the Democratic leader has been careful not to say so.
The role of middleman is one Mr. Bruno has played many times in the last eight years. He is often the one trying to forge a compromise, as he did this week when he came up with a new borrowing proposal that tried to bridge the gap between the governor's plan to leverage tobacco-settlement payments and the speaker's counterproposal to float bonds backed by income taxes.
Yet he has also been known to unite with Mr. Silver against the governor. Two years ago, for instance, the two leaders passed an austere, stripped-down budget in an attempt to force the governor to add some spending. This year, Senator Bruno has called again and again for an early budget and has cast desperately about for a way to break the impasse on borrowing.
"We are trying to compromise, we are trying to move the process, we are trying to get something done," Mr. Bruno said. "I was able to go forward with Shelly."
Lisa Dewald Stoll, a spokeswoman for the governor, said there was no bad blood between the governor and Senator Bruno. Before the antismoking bill passed, she said, the governor raised concerns that it would hurt small businesses, but he signed it anyway. "Overriding those concerns is the fact that he supports a statewide ban on smoking," she said.
The governor also sees problems in the new borrowing proposal Senator Bruno and Mr. Silver have cooked up, Ms. Stoll said, adding that he was trying to negotiate some changes to the plan before it comes to a vote next Monday. "There is not a problem with Joe," she said.
Still, Senator Bruno demonstrated again today not only that Mr. Pataki cannot take him for granted, but that he can be a hardheaded opponent. People close to the senator say that the governor called Mr. Bruno several times during the day in an effort to derail the antismoking legislation. The governor's aides did so successfully last year with a similar campaign.
This time, however, Mr. Bruno stood firm. He has long been a strong crusader for antismoking legislation. He argued that a uniform statewide ban in workplaces, including restaurants and bars, was better than a patchwork of local laws.
"He feels more strongly on this issue personally than on any issue I've ever seen," said one former aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ALLIES; 
British Forces Meld With Those of the U.S., and Relish Sharing the Burden

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 26 

 BODY:
The question was how compatible the fighting forces of Britain and the United States are, and a senior British Army officer recalled that he once nearly slipped up and took an American officer along on a highly sensitive deployment to Northern Ireland.
 "There is no ally with whom we train more than the Americans, and we are so comfortable with each other that we sometimes forget they are there," he explained. 
 Up to 45,000 British troops are involved in the war in Iraq, alongside more than 250,000 Americans. Military officials say it is impossible to imagine any other European country capable of such close collaboration with the United States military. 
The British also stress that, even if with far fewer troops, they mean to be equal partners.
"We are not interested, if you like, in a supporting cast role," said a senior Ministry of Defense planning official. Certainly, the British role in securing the port of Umm Qasr and in encircling the southern city of Basra has appeared critical.
So far, Britain has accepted with customary stoicism the casualties it has suffered in a week of war -- at least 20 men, including 14 who died in helicopter crashes and 4 in incidents involving fire from other allied forces. 
Britain devotes an average of 2.5 percent of its gross national product to defense, significantly higher than any other major European country except France.
In addition, military analysts credit the British with spending the money more wisely, focusing on technology, communications and "lift" -- the air and sea transportation of troops around the world.
Britain ended national service and became an all-volunteer, so-called "professional" army more than 30 years ago while some European countries have still to take that step and France did so only last year. In this year's National Day speech July 14 in Paris, President Jacques Chirac singled out Britain as the only country in Europe that had taken defense seriously enough.
"For some time now, we have slipped behind the U.K.," he said. "That has serious consequences for our political power."
As for Britain's political power, defense officials here argue that the current campaign underscores Britain's ability to put its military superiority in Europe at the service of its national interest in being America's principal ally, even if the strength of this alliance has a price in terms of Britain's relations with its major European allies.
"There is a native enthusiasm with the British for being at the front end, sharing the risk and saying to the rest of the world that Britain is prepared to put its armed forces where its political convictions are," the military planner said.
Lawrence Freedman, professor of war studies at King's College, London, said this eagerness to take part side by side in combat was Britain's way of banishing the common fear of once-powerful European nations of being taken for granted or ignored.
"Europeans, and this includes the British as well, are scared that the Americans will think they do the big stuff, and we just come along and pick up the pieces," he said. "It is the British view that unless you're in for the big stuff, you won't be taken seriously."
Mr. Freedman said the British military and its actions abroad in places ranging from the Falkland Islands two decades ago to Sierra Leone last year gained the British military more support at home than most European forces enjoy.
Britain, as a traditional colonial power, has long been used to flexing its military muscle abroad, noted Col. Christopher Langton, head of defense analysis at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
"We have marines at sea the whole time, we have submarines under the water the whole time, we have our military training with other militaries -- indeed training other militaries -- the whole time," he said. "This is how the British public likes its military -- not sitting behind in barracks in the United Kingdom. It's also why people join it."
Since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Britain has specifically aimed to improve its ability to deploy troops and equipment rapidly abroad, and to enhance communications and technology for setting targets, to make them as compatible as possible with those of the American military. That effort was further galvanized by the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on America.
"Since 9/11, we have taken a closer look at the nature of the forces we have created, and they are structured to go somewhere and do something rather than just waiting to be called," said a senior army officer.
There are daily reminders of the deepening involvement with the United States. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Defense disclosed that some 2,000 American troops in the gulf would be under British command, an arrangement last applied in World War II.
Britain's main ground fighting force for the war with Iraq is the Seventh Armored Brigade, with 3,400 combat troops, 120 upgraded Challenger tanks and 150 Warrior armored fighting vehicles. The brigade's nickname, the Desert Rats, is derived from that of a unit that distinguished itself fighting Rommel in North Africa in World War II. There is also the Special Air Service (S.A.S.) and an air assault brigade of 2,100 helicopter-borne paratroopers.
In the sky, Britain has Hercules transport aircraft, and Tornado and Harrier jets supported by 7,000 personnel. At sea, the British fleet is manned by 5,000 sailors and Royal Marine commandos, and contains the aircraft carrier Ark Royal and the helicopter assault ship Ocean.
The conflict over Iraq in the British public and on the streets of London, where a million antiwar protesters recently marched, does not appear to intrude on the gung-ho spirit of officers and defense workers scurrying about the gaudy old Metropole hotel building that serves as an annex to the stately Thames-side Ministry of Defense in downtown London.
The senior policy official said he had heard no complaints from the military about being undermined by the limited public support for action in Iraq. "They feel the cause is good, and they also are sophisticated enough to know there will be an active debate about that," he asserted.
"What the armed forces most like is clear direction from the political leadership," he added, "and they certainly get that from Tony Blair."
The British believe they have had some influence in persuading the United States of the importance of rebuilding a country once warfare ends. "We grew closer together on this point over Afghanistan," said the planner. "It is fair to say that the Americans were initially cagey about the reconstruction, but as time went by, it got better."
Colonel Langton said he wasn't convinced of that. "My own view is that it's a great shame that the U.S. regards itself as a war fighting machine, full stop, and does not see it has any other part to play in postwar restoration," he said.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves $2.2 Trillion Budget 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
The Senate today approved a $2.2 trillion budget for the next fiscal year, leaving intact the vote on Tuesday to slice President Bush's proposed tax cut in half.
 Republican leaders considered offering amendments today to restore some or all of the tax cut, but they dropped the idea when it was clear they lacked the votes to succeed. 
 The vote on Tuesday was one of Mr. Bush's most serious political setbacks. Three Republicans joined the Democrats in voting against the president. 
Those who voted against the full tax cut said it was irresponsible, given the large budget deficits and the unknown costs of the war in Iraq.
The budget measure, a nonbinding resolution that sets limits on the spending and tax legislation Congress will consider for the rest of the year, now goes to a Senate-House conference committee that will be dominated by allies of the president.
The House voted this month to allow the full $726 billion in tax cuts the president proposed in what he called his economic growth package. The Senate measure would lower the limit to $350 billion.
That resolution was approved today, 56 to 44, on a vote that mostly followed party lines. Only six Democrats voted for it -- John B. Breaux and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Max Baucus of Montana, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Zell Miller of Georgia and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. One Republican, John McCain of Arizona, and the independent, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, voted against it.
Neither side was completely happy with the measure. Democrats maintained that even half of the president's proposed tax cut was too much given the large budget deficit, the approaching retirement of the baby boom generation and the uncertain costs of the war. 
"At the same time we are asking our young people to fight a war for our security," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,"Republicans are passing a budget that will force those same young people to pay the bill for their recklessness."
Many Republicans said they were voting for it reluctantly. The Budget Committee chairman, Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said: "This growth package is not what I want. I think it's about half a loaf. That's better than none." 
Tonight, the White House issued this statement from Mr. Bush: "It is unfortunate that the full Senate has failed to pass a budget that provides for my entire economic growth and job creation plan. The House budget took the bold steps necessary to boost our economy, and we will work to ensure that the final House-Senate budget provides the growth measures American workers deserve."
Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who will lead the House conferees on the budget resolution, said negotiations would probably begin in earnest next week. "Certainly our opening bid is the House version," Mr. Nussle said.
The final tax figure will be the most important element of the budget resolution because it will set the limit on how much the Senate can approve in tax cuts, which under the rules will not be subject to filibuster. 
The president actually proposed a total of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, and the plan approved today would allow $852 billion. But much of that is outside the limit protected from a filibuster. Cuts beyond the specified limit are problematic because they would probably require 60 votes in the Senate to break a filibuster.
Generally, the resolution sets guidelines for the tax and spending legislation Congress will consider for the year. The details are left to the actual tax and spending bills. 
The resolution adopted today would allow $791 billion to be spent in fiscal year 2004, which begins Oct. 1, on everything for which Congress provides annual appropriations -- from fighter jets to paper clips.
That figure is 2.5 percent higher than the amount allocated this fiscal year. But it includes no money for the war in Iraq and the occupation and redevelopment afterward.
President Bush has declined to say how much will be needed in the next fiscal year for the war and subsequent expenses in Iraq. The $75 billion he requested from Congress this week covers costs for six months.
The Senate vote to reduce the president's tax cut complicated Republican plans to begin work on the actual tax legislation. The House Ways and Means Committee had planned to write a tax bill this week and put it to the full House for a vote next week, but this schedule was abandoned because the lawmakers are no longer certain how large a tax cut will be permitted.
"I have to have a solid number I can write to," said Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
The debate on the budget measure began March 17, and the Senate took 51 roll call votes. On one last week, the Senate essentially blocked drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, another political defeat for the president, who made new exploration in Alaska a central element of his energy policy.
In theory, the measure holds in reserve $400 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug plan under Medicare and $100 billion to pay expenses in Iraq, but those set-asides do not carry the force of law.
Also in theory, the resolution would lead to a balanced budget in 2012. But the spending limits set for the fiscal years 2009 through 2012 are so low that many budget experts consider them unrealistic.

HEADLINE: Canadians of Two Minds Over Neighbor to the South 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, March 26 

 BODY:
No institution is more typically Canadian than the CBC Saturday night prime time television program "Hockey Night in Canada," which for 50 years has produced defining moments in almost every Canadian childhood and filled every bar in the country with cheers and moans. 
 So when Don Cherry, one of the show's principal broadcasters and himself a cultural icon, wore an extravagant, wide American flag tie on the air last weekend, Canadians had to take notice. Mr. Cherry said he wanted to apologize for the thousands of fans who booed and jeered when the American national anthem was played last week before two Canadiens games, one with the New York Islanders and the other with the New Jersey Devils. "Fifty years of pride down the drain as far as I am concerned," he intoned. "I feel so bad for what has happened." 
 But Ron MacLean, another broadcaster, shot back, "Why attack Iraq if they haven't attacked you?"
If ice hockey is Canada's national sport, relations with the United States is the country's national psychic quandary, one that produces great ambivalence and sometimes even hostility. Canadians love American movies and Disney World vacations, and their economy relies heavily on exports south of their border. Canada is also a NATO ally. But the alliance has repeatedly been strained over the last 40 years, beginning with doubts about President Kennedy's approach during the Cuban missile crisis and President Johnson's escalation in Vietnam. 
Canadians, polls consistently indicate, find American foreign policy overly aggressive and think American leaders take them for granted. But Canadians also think of themselves as friends of the United States, so at times when anti-Americanism appears to be growing, there is always a snap-back reaction. More often than not, Canadian emotions and policies toward the United States are characterized by ambiguity. The current crisis is no exception.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien wavered for months on the issue of whether Canada would join the United States and Britain in invading Iraq without explicit approval from the United Nations Security Council. The policy vacuum was filled by several backbench Liberal members of the House of Commons who sharply criticized American policy. One went so far as to say she hated "damn Americans" and used an expletive to stiffen her comment.
Two days before the first day of allied bombing in Iraq, Mr. Chretien finally defined Canadian policy by saying no Canadian troops would fight in the war. Still, more than 50 Canadian air and ship technicians and liaison officers are stationed at the allied headquarters in Qatar and at sea with American Navy ships. A Canadian destroyer and two frigates are also patrolling in the Persian Gulf, available, Canadian military officials say, in an emergency. 
It is a quiet effort, but more significant than those of most of the nations explicitly backing the war. Meanwhile, the Canadian Army will send 2,000 troops back to Afghanistan later this year, freeing American forces for operations in the Persian Gulf. 
The discreet help is not nearly enough for many Canadian businessmen, who have publicly warned that Canada's public policy on the war could jeopardize trade negotiations over United States tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber and wheat. Those concerns were exacerbated this week after the American Ambassador, Paul Celluci, told the Economic Club of Toronto Tuesday that "there is a lot of disappointment in Washington" over Canada's lackluster support of the allied war effort. 
"It's just going to create an enormous gulf between two very similar people," Robert McEwen, chairman and chief executive officer of Goldcorp Inc., a mining company, warned in an open letter to the government. "The largest undefended border in the world will become a wall."
The management of the Montreal Canadiens was also concerned about the impression its fans were leaving. They had the legendary Canadiens center Jean Beliveau appear on the scoreboard screen before the Saturday night game with the Carolina Hurricanes requesting courtesy "during these difficult times." 
The fans cheered the American national anthem in response.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Rules Against U.S. On Steel Tariff 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization ruled today that the steel tariffs imposed by President Bush last year were illegal.
 The administration said it would appeal the decision. 
 While the trade decision was called interim, with the final report expected next month, it is rare for an interim decision to be reversed. If the United States loses next month, European and other nations could impose trade sanctions of comparable value against the United States. 
Last spring, Mr. Bush imposed tariffs of nearly 30 percent on most types of steel imported from Europe, Asia and South America, the biggest government action to protect an industry in several decades. While it was praised by the steel industry and trade unionists, the move was criticized by free trade advocates and companies that use steel in manufacturing.
The case against the tariffs was brought by the European Union, which accused the United States of illegally protecting the steel industry. Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, called the tariffs "unjustified, highly protectionist U.S. measures." 
"I am in no doubt that the U.S. will lose this case, as it has lost all six previous safeguard cases," Mr.Lamy said when the initial case was brought against the United States.
But there was no celebratory statement or any comment from the Europeans today. All spokesmen said they would not discuss an interim decision, but foreign officials also said Europe wanted to avoid creating a further division with the United States in a time of war.
Today's ruling, which was not a surprise, was the second major loss for the United States at the W.T.O. in the last year. The trade panel awarded Europe the right to impose $4 billion worth of trade sanctions against the United States for giving tax breaks to American exporters through foreign sales corporations.
When administration officials imposed the steel tariffs they said they were legal under provisions in the world trading rules allowing a response to a surge of steel imports. 
The tariffs were meant to help the American steel industry find its footing in the global market. American trade officials said today that the strategy worked.
"The domestic steel industry has undergone an unprecedented level of consolidation and restructuring over the last year that have made it more competitive," said one American trade official, who insisted on not being identified.
Democratic lawmakers criticized the trade decision, citing a United States International Trade Commission study done before the tariffs were imposed that showed imports were seriously injuring important parts of the American steel industry. They said the W.T.O. had exceeded its authority.
"I support the goal of an international trading system," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. "But we have a growing problem with dispute settlement decisions that are inventing obligations and requirements to which the United States and other countries never agreed. Ultimately, these types of decisions will only undermine confidence in the W.T.O."
Some Democrats said the administration was partly to blame for failing to adopt an aggressive strategy to end a series of rulings against the United States.
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, accused the administration of overseeing the loss of 13 of 15 cases brought against the United States since 2001.
"This decision furthers a trend that jeopardizes the credibility of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement system and must serve as a wake-up call for the administration," Mr. Levin said.
In Congressional hearings today, steel officials and union representatives praised the tariffs. Leo W. Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers of America, told lawmakers that they should not forget the history that led to the president's decision to impose the steel tariffs. For several years, he said, the domestic steel industry was "under attack from foreign producers, aided and abetted by foreign governments through subsidies and other market manipulations."
"The consequences of this assault have been disastrous for our steelworkers and for the American steel industry," Mr. Gerard said. 
The result, he said, was that 37 companies were forced into bankruptcy, 54,000 steel workers lost their jobs, and pension plans and health care programs were being scaled back for retirees, widows and other dependents.
But some manufacturers have complained that the tariffs have led to higher prices for steel and hurt their companies.
Wes Smith, the president of the E&E Manufacturing Company, with 250 employees in Plymouth, Mich., testified that the tariffs and rising cost of steel amounted to a new tax for him.
"We are willing to meet the challenge of competing with the Asians," Mr. Smith said. "However, we cannot do that with our hands tied behind our backs by having our government tax our largest input by 30 percent."

HEADLINE: Insurer Considers Major Move to Downtown's Empty Office Spaces 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Health Insurance Plan of New York is negotiating to move its headquarters and 1,600 employees to Lower Manhattan from Midtown in one of the biggest office deals in the past two years. 
 HIP's potential move to an office building on the East River, at 55 Water Street, would be a boost for the downtown economy, where thousands of layoffs in the financial industry and corporate relocations have left a lot of office space vacant. HIP's offices are now at 7 West 34th Street and 132 West 31st Street. 
 HIP's move would be a rare bit of good news for Lower Manhattan. Pillsbury Winthrop, a law firm whose roots downtown date to the mid-1800's, announced yesterday that it was moving to the Bertelsmann Building in Times Square from its home on State Street. 
Another downtown law firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, is considering selling the building it owns on Maiden Lane and moving to Midtown, or elsewhere in Lower Manhattan, according to real estate brokers. There are already many other large blocks of vacant office space left behind by departing banks and other companies, from the World Financial Center on the Hudson River to Water Street on the East River.
"The market is weak," said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark & Company, a real estate firm. "The financial services industry has taken the great hit on jobs, and downtown has been impacted more than Midtown. As long as there are no new jobs created, demand will be slow."
If HIP completes its deal, it would have a considerable effect downtown. It is negotiating to lease about 500,000 square feet at 55 Water Street, one of the largest office buildings in the world. 
The last new commercial deal of that size was two years ago, when Bloomberg L.P., the financial information company founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, signed a lease to move to a tower now being built at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.
According to state and city officials and real estate executives, HIP would move 1,600 employees downtown and expects to add another 400 in the coming years. The company has also negotiated with the state and the city for a cash grant worth about $10 million, part of the federal money used to attract or retain companies in Lower Manhattan in the wake of the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Brian Given, a real estate broker at GVA Williams, the company that represents HIP, did not return calls requesting comment.
Ronald Maiorana, a spokesman for HIP, said a final decision had not been made. "For over a year," he said "we've been exploring a lot of options about relocation. We haven't signed anything."
The vacancy rate downtown has climbed to 16.8 percent, with about 15.4 million square feet of space available, according to Newmark, and a few companies have sought to take advantage of the resulting lower rents. Some real estate executives say the situation is even bleaker when you consider "shadow space" that investment banks like Goldman Sachs want to shed but have not officially put on the market. Another real estate company, Tenantwise, issued a report this week putting the vacancy rate including that "shadow space" at 23.9 percent, or nearly one out of every four floors.
Mr. Gosin of Newmark said one bright spot in Lower Manhattan was the continuing development of residential buildings, which many planners say is the key to the area's revival.
The Albanese Development Corporation is completing a 27-story tower at the north end of Battery Park City with 293 apartments, Glenwood Management is building a 287-unit building at 10 Liberty Street, and Rockrose Development has started work on a 50-story tower with 600 apartments at the corner of Gold and Platt Streets.
The Midtown office market has also been affected by the economic slowdown. Indeed, tenants have tens of millions of square feet to choose from, and rents are falling.
Pillsbury Winthrop was negotiating in July to move from its longtime home on State Street in the financial district to Times Square Tower, a 47-story building under construction on 42nd Street, between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The building, which is owned by Boston Properties, had recently lost its anchor tenant, Arthur Andersen, after the accounting firm collapsed.
But just as Pillsbury was about to sign a deal, Bertelsmann, the German media company, decided to put nearly half the space in its nearby building on the market for an even lower rent. Yesterday, Mitchell Steir, chairman of Julien J. Studley, Pillsbury's broker, announced that the law firm had leased six floors in the Bertelsmann Building.

HEADLINE: Casualties at Home

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On Tuesday, as President Bush was asking Congress for the first installment of the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to finance the war in Iraq and its aftermath, the students and teachers at a high school within walking distance of the White House were struggling through their daily routine in a building that has no cafeteria, no gymnasium, no student lockers, not even a fully reliable source of electricity.
 A few weeks ago bricks were falling from the facade of the building, which is more than 100 years old. 
 As we continue the relentless bombing of Baghdad, which the military tells us is the necessary prelude to saving it, it's fair to ask when the rebuilding of essential institutions like the public schools will begin here at home. (Don't hold your breath. The money for that sort of thing has completely evaporated.) 
"We actually have rooms where the water comes in when it rains," said Sheila Mills Harris, the principal of the School Without Walls, an academically rigorous high school that routinely finishes first or second in the District of Columbia's rankings.
Laura Bush has visited the school, which has won a series of national honors. But academic honors and a visit by the first lady are, frankly, irrelevant in an era in which social concerns -- such as support for public schools and health care, and the need to assist the poor, the hungry and the unemployed -- have been forced to the perimeter of public consciousness. Those issues, crucial to our conception of ourselves as a just and humane people, have been devalued and shunted aside by an administration that is committed to an ill-advised, budget-busting war and a devastating parade of tax cuts for the very wealthy.
With our attention riveted on the death and destruction in Iraq, and the continued threat to Americans in the war zone, the other very serious problems facing the U.S. get short shrift. We knew last fall that the proportion of Americans living in poverty had risen, and that income for middle-class households had fallen.
We know that unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is a big problem. And we've known that the states are facing their worst budget crisis since the Great Depression, a development that has led, among other things, to drastic cuts in education aid that are crushing the budgets of local public school districts.
These issues aren't even being properly discussed. The Bush administration sounds the alarm for war and blows the trumpet for tax cuts, and Congress plunges ahead with the cuts in domestic programs that must inevitably follow. The voices of those who object are effectively silenced by the war propaganda and the fear of seeming unpatriotic.
With attention thus deflected, the administration and its allies in Congress have come up with one proposal after another to weaken programs that were designed to help struggling Americans.
In his budget last month the president offered a plan to make it more difficult for low-income families to obtain government benefits, including tax credits and school lunch assistance. This month, as The Times's Robert Pear reported, the administration proposed changes in the Medicare program that would make it more difficult for elderly people, many of them frail, to appeal the denial of benefits like home health care and skilled nursing care.
The extent to which the most vulnerable Americans are being targeted is appalling. Billions of dollars in cuts have been proposed for food stamp and child nutrition programs, and for health care for the poor.
Collectively, these are the largest proposed cuts in history. Even cuts for veterans' programs are on the table -- in the midst of a war!
The administration is actually fighting two wars -- one against Iraq and another against the very idea of a humane and responsive government here at home.
At some point, hopefully sooner rather than later, the war against Iraq will end. Americans will then have the opportunity to look around and be stunned by the fix we'll be in. We'll look at the enormous costs of the postwar occupation in Iraq, and at the social and economic dislocation that's occurring here. And we'll look at the disaster that the federal budget has become. We'll be broke, and we'll ask ourselves, again and again, "What have we done?"

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: DIPLOMACY; 
Against France and Russia, Washington Tries to Curb U.N. Role in a Postwar Iraq

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN with FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
The United States is battling France, Russia and others in Europe over American efforts to try to curb the role of the United Nations in governing and rebuilding a postwar Iraq, and once again Britain, Washington's staunchest ally in the drive toward Baghdad and the diplomatic war that preceded it, is trying to play the role of mediator.
 The British prime minister, Tony Blair, who arrived here this evening for meetings with President Bush, has said he wants to use this trip to press Washington to accept some kind of United Nations blessing for the occupation, even though the Security Council failed to approve a resolution on the war this month. 
 Mr. Blair seemed to acknowledge a struggle ahead, telling reporters on his flight from London, "I have no doubt at all that there will be a whole process of consultation and discussion about these things, but the important thing is that we end up with something that is U.N.-endorsed."
As in the past, there is also discord behind the scenes on this issue within the Bush administration, American officials said today. The Defense Department was described as wanting the United Nations limited to coordinating certain aid programs and not involved in governing or peacekeeping. But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell advocates a significant role for the United Nations, in part to mute the expected adverse world reaction to a British-American occupation in Baghdad, the officials said. 
"The United Nations will have a role to play," Mr. Powell said today in an interview with an Indian television network. He said that the role remained to be defined, but that there was no "major difference" between Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush in this regard.
Much of the dispute centers on the long-term future governance of Iraq. Early skirmishing over the issue erupted in the past week at the Security Council, where members were still recovering from the acrimonious split on Iraq.
The focus has been on a resolution to reactivate a six-year-old program supervised by the United Nations and Iraq that uses Iraqi oil profits to pay for food and medicine for millions of Iraqis who have no other source for either. The program was suspended when the war began.
A draft resolution from Secretary General Kofi Annan, largely supported by the United States and Britain, gives the United Nations broad authority to remake the program to fit the aid crisis on the ground, and coordinate with the "relevant authorities."
The Russian and Syrian representatives have argued against the mention of "relevant authorities," which they fear might effectively legitimize an American-installed government, and pushed to have language included specifying the aid obligations of the "occupying power." 
Council diplomats said today that the current draft, including disputed portions of the text, would be sent to the home governments on Thursday. It was unclear late today whether a consensus could be forged and a draft presented for a vote before the end of the week. One diplomat who attended the expert committee meeting last night said that five issues remained in significant dispute.
American and other officials said ruefully that the dispute reflects the continuing bitterness of the clashes over the resolutions at the Security Council authorizing the war in the first place. "The French and Russians are going to make it difficult for the Americans to do anything on Iraq," said a diplomat involved in the negotiations on the oil-for-food measure. "That's becoming increasingly obvious."
President Bush has not yet decided what sort of arrangement to seek in a postwar Iraq, administration officials said. They added that his meeting with Mr. Blair on Thursday would be a significant exploration of the options.
But diplomats said that a sign of American intentions lay in its demands on the oil-for-food program, which an administration official said should be run by the United Nations only temporarily as "a limited, defined, short-term kind of program." The current draft resolution would reauthorize the program for 45 days.
Eventually, administration officials say, they want the oil-for-food program to be turned over to a new Iraqi governing authority, although it is not clear how much independence that authority would have from American and British occupation forces, which many expect to stay in Iraq for a year or longer.
Many diplomats involved in reconstruction of war-ravaged countries -- from Afghanistan to the Balkans to East Timor -- say the American plans to quickly install a new government are unrealistic. That is especially the view among relief agencies based in Europe, which are expected to raise much of the money for Iraq.
"What they're really thinking of is a puppet government in Baghdad, where they pull the strings," said a development official involved in talks about the future of Iraq, referring to Washington's intentions. "That's not politically possible."
The debate over this issue has been sharpened by the active involvement of Presidents Jacques Chirac of France and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who have said they will not accept an American or British occupation force governing Iraq without participation by the United Nations.
Their comments were echoed by leaders of the European Union, which endorsed the idea of a broader United Nations authority a week ago.
"It's imperative for Tony Blair to use his influence on Bush," a senior European official said. "Europeans are frankly not anxious to see their assistance delivered under a military flag in a war whose validity is disputed by so many of us."
Asked today about the continuing reluctance of France to join in any undertaking that implied legitimization of the war, Mr. Blair said, "I have no doubt at all that France will be involved in the reconstruction."
But Mr. Blair's hard-line stance on Iraq and close partnership with Mr. Bush have cost him support in many Continental capitals and have undermined his capacity to be a leader trusted by Europeans to convey their concerns to Washington.
Some legal experts say United Nations involvement is virtually inevitable, whether the Americans want it or not. That is because Iraq is subject to stiff economic and political sanctions imposed by the Security Council, where France and Russia have a veto along with China, Britain and the United States. Only the Council can lift them, giving the veto-bearing members of the Council considerable leverage.
But by all accounts, Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush both oppose having the United Nations run the occupation directly. Rather they are said to prefer that the United Nations give its blessing or serve as a coordinator for international relief efforts, and perhaps a measure of the reconstruction efforts.
The secretary general emphasized today that his role would be determined by the Security Council.
But in an open session this afternoon he said two "guiding principles" should govern "all decisions on the future of Iraq." They are, he said, "respect for Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence," and "respect for the right of the Iraqi people to determine their own political future and control their own natural resources."
He added: "In the last few months the peoples of the world have shown how much they expect of the United Nations, and of the Security Council in particular. Many of them are now bitterly disappointed." To restore the lost faith, he said, Council members must "make a concerted effort to overcome their differences."
American officials said they are adamant that an indigenous Iraqi civil authority get up and running as quickly as possible, perhaps even within a month after armed forces secure the country. Their approach, officials said, is to divide that authority between Iraqis now in the country and Iraqis abroad, many of whom are active opponents of Saddam Hussein.
"There's a useful role for the U.N., not only in humanitarian things but also other things," said an administration official. "But I would say we're talking about a U.N. role, not U.N. rule."

PERSON: Daniel Patrick Moynihan 

HEADLINE: Daniel Patrick Moynihan Is Dead; Senator From Academia Was 76 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

 BODY:
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Harvard professor and four-term United States senator from New York who brought a scholar's eye for data to politics and a politician's sense of the real world to academia, died yesterday at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. He was 76. 
 The cause, a spokesman for the family said, was complications of a ruptured appendix, which was removed on March 11 at the hospital, where he remained. 
 Mr. Moynihan was always more a man of ideas than of legislation or partisan combat. Yet he was enough of a politician to win re-election easily -- and enough of a maverick with close Republican friends to be an occasional irritant to his Democratic party leaders. Before the Senate, his political home from 1977 to 2001, he served two Democratic presidents and two Republicans, finishing his career in the executive branch as President Richard M. Nixon's ambassador to India and President Gerald R. Ford's ambassador to the United Nations. 
For more than 40 years, in and out of government, he became known for being among the first to identify new problems and propose novel, if not easy, solutions, most famously in auto safety and mass transportation; urban decay and the corrosive effects of racism; and the preservation and development of architecturally distinctive federal buildings.
He was a man known for the grand gesture as well as the bon mot, and his style sometimes got more attention than his prescience, displayed notably in 1980 when he labeled the Soviet Union "in decline." Among his last great causes were strengthening Social Security and attacking government secrecy.
In the halls of academe and the corridors of power, he was known for seizing ideas and connections before others noticed. In 1963, for example, he was the co-author of "Beyond the Melting Pot," which shattered the idea that ethnic identities inevitably wear off in the United States. Then, on the day that November when President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, he told every official he could find that the federal government must take custody of Lee Harvey Oswald to keep him alive to learn about the killing. No one listened.
Friends also observed the intense sense of history he connected to immediate events. Bob Packwood, the former Republican senator from Oregon, recalled his Democratic friend's response in 1993 when a reporter on the White House lawn asked what he thought of the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement to share the West Bank. "Well, I think it's the end of World War I," he said, alluding to the mandates that proposed Middle Eastern boundaries in 1920.
Erudite, opinionated and favoring, in season, tweed or seersucker, Mr. Moynihan conveyed an academic personality through a chirpy manner of speech, with occasional pauses between syllables. More than most senators, he could get colleagues to listen to his speeches, though not necessarily to follow his recommendations. He had a knack for the striking phrase, but unease at the controversy it often caused. When other senators used August recesses to travel or raise money for re-election, he spent most of them in an 1854 schoolhouse on his farm in Pindars Corners in Delaware County, about 65 miles west of Albany. He was writing books, 9 as a senator, 18 in all.
Mr. Moynihan was less an original researcher than a bold, often brilliant synthesizer whose works compelled furious debate and further research. In 1965, his foremost work, "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action," identified the breakup of black families as a major impediment to black advancement. Though savaged by many liberal academics at the time, it is now generally regarded as "an important and prophetic document," in the words of Prof. William Julius Wilson of Harvard.
Five years later, his memo to President Nixon on race relations caused another uproar. Citing the raw feelings provoked by the battles of the civil rights era, Mr. Moynihan suggested a period of rhetorical calm -- "benign neglect" he called it -- a proposal widely misinterpreted as a call to abandon federal programs to improve the lives of black families. 
Nonetheless, he could also be an effective legislator. In his first term he teamed with Jacob K. Javits, his Republican colleague, to pass legislation guaranteeing $2 billion worth of New York City obligations at a time when the city faced bankruptcy. In a brief turn leading the Environment and Public Works Committee in 1991 and 1992 he successfully pushed to shift highway financing toward mass transit -- and get New York $5 billion in retroactive reimbursement for building the New York State Thruway before the federal government began the Interstate Highway System.
Although Mr. Moynihan's junior colleague for 18 years, Alfonse M. D'Amato, became known as Senator Pothole for his pork-barrel efforts for New York, Mr. Moynihan held his own in that department.

Monument of Bricks and Marble
Long before he came to the Senate, and until he left, he was building a monument of bricks and marble by making Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, a dingy street where he came to work for President John F. Kennedy in 1961, into the grand avenue that George Washington foresaw for the boulevard that connects the Capitol and the White House. Nearly 40 years of his effort filled the avenue with new buildings on its north side, including the apartment houses where he lived, restored buildings on the south, and cafes and a sense of life all along.
Wherever he went, Mr. Moynihan explored interesting buildings and worked to preserve architectural distinction, from converting the main post office in Manhattan into the new Pennsylvania Station, to the Customs House at Battery Park and all around Washington. Last year, over lunch and a martini at Washington's Hotel Monaco, an 1842 Robert Mills building that was once the city's main post office, he recalled how he had helped rescue it from decline into a shooting gallery for drugs.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan was born in Tulsa, Okla., on March 16, 1927, the son of an itinerant, hard-drinking newspaperman who moved the family to New York later that year to take a job writing advertising copy. They lived comfortably in the city and suburbs until 1937 when his father, John Moynihan, left the family and left it in poverty. 
Mr. Moynihan's childhood has been pseudo-glamorized by references to an upbringing in Hell's Kitchen, which in fact he encountered after his mother bought a bar there when he was 20. But there was enough hardship and instability in his early life so that when he later wrote of "social pathology," he knew what he was talking about.
Mr. Moynihan's mother, Margaret Moynihan, moved the family, including a brother, Michael, and a sister, Ellen, into a succession of Manhattan apartments, and Pat shined shoes in Times Square. In 1943 he graduated first in his class at Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. He also graduated to work as a stevedore at Piers 48 and 49 on West 11th Street.
He went to City College for a year, enlisted in the Navy, and was trained as an officer at Middlebury College and at Tufts University. Discharged the next spring, he went to work that summer tending bar for his mother, then got his B.A. at Tufts in 1948 and an M.A. at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts in 1949. 
In 1950 he went to the London School of Economics on a Fulbright Scholarship, and he lived well on it, the G.I. bill and later a job at an Air Force base. He started wearing a bowler hat. He had a tailor and a bootmaker and traveled widely, including a visit to Moynihan cousins in County Kerry, Ireland.
Work on his dissertation did not consume him. In "Pat," his 1979 biography, Doug Schoen described a 1952 visit by two former Middlebury colleagues: "Impressed at first with his elaborate file cabinet full of index cards, they found that most of the cards were recipes for drinks rather than notes on the International Labor Organization."
Mr. Moynihan came home in 1953 and went to work in the mayoral campaign of Robert F. Wagner. He went on to write speeches for W. Averell Harriman's successful campaign for governor in 1954, joined his administration in Albany and rose to become his chief aide. It was there he learned about traffic safety, which he described in a 1959 article in The Reporter as a public health problem requiring federal action to make automobile design safer.

A Semi-Modest Proposal
Another former campaign worker who came to Albany was Elizabeth Brennan. Her desk and his were in the same room, and they grew friendly. Rather suddenly in early 1955, when they had never dated, Mr. Moynihan did not formally propose but simply told her he was going to marry her. 
They married in May 1955, and she often said she married him because he was the funniest man she ever met.
His wife survives him, as do their three children: Timothy, Maura and John, and two grandchildren. 
While he was an enthusiastic supporter of John F. Kennedy, work at Syracuse University on a book about the Harriman administration and his Ph.D. kept his role in the campaign sporadic. But Liz Brennan Moynihan organized the campaign efforts in the Syracuse area.
His Ph.D. in international relations finally complete, he left Syracuse in 1961 for Washington and the Labor Department, rising to assistant secretary. One early research assignment on office space for the scattered department gave him an opportunity to assert guiding architectural principles that have endured and produced striking courthouses: that federal buildings "must provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American government." That same report enabled him to raise the Pennsylvania Avenue issue, and he was at work on development plans on Nov. 22, 1963, when the word came that the president had been shot in Dallas.
Beyond his failed efforts to protect Mr. Oswald, Mr. Moynihan marked that grim assassination weekend with a widely remembered remark about the death of the president he barely knew but idolized and eagerly followed.
On Sunday Nov. 24, he said in a television interview: "I don't think there's any point in being Irish if you don't know that the world is going to break your heart eventually. I guess we thought we had a little more time." He added softly, "So did he."
His first book, written jointly with Nathan Glazer, had come out earlier that year. "Beyond the Melting Pot" looked at the different ethnic groups of New York City and scoffed at "the notion that the intense and unprecedented mixture of ethnic and religious groups in American life was soon to blend into a homogeneous end product." Ethnicity persisted, they argued. 
That concept won praise from the era's leading historian of immigration, Harvard's Oscar Handlin, who called it a "point of departure" in studies of immigrants. But ina foretaste of academic criticism in years to come, he said their methodology was sometimes "flimsy."
"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action," a paper he wrote at the Labor Department early in 1965, argued that despite the Johnson administration's success in passing civil rights laws, statutes could not ensure equality after three centuries of deprivation. He said the disintegration of black families had reached a point of "social pathology." He wrote: "The principal challenge of the next phase of the Negro revolution is to make certain that equality of results will now follow. If we do not, there will be no social peace in the United States for generations."
He cited black unemployment, welfare and illegitimacy rates. His emphasis on families headed by women led him to be accused of blaming the victims for their predicament, but in fact he wrote clearly, "It was by destroying the Negro family under slavery that white America broke the will of the Negro people." Now, he wrote, the federal government must adopt policies, especially in education and employment, "designed to have the effect, directly or indirectly, of enhancing the stability and resources of the Negro American family."
He left the administration in 1965 as liberals denounced his paper, and then ran for president of the New York City Council. He lost badly in the Democratic primary, but went on to Wesleyan University and, in 1966, to Harvard as director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies and a tenured professor in the Graduate School of Education. 
He spoke out against disorder, in urban slums and on select campuses. Speaking to Americans for Democratic Action in 1967, he made it clear he thought liberal pieties would not solve black problems.
And in a passage that came to the eye of the Republican presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon, he said liberals must "see more clearly that their essential interest is in the stability of the social order" and "make alliances with conservatives who share that concern." When Nixon was elected, Mr. Moynihan made his alliance. He joined the White House staff as assistant to the president for urban affairs. 
That startled his friends, and his wife refused to move to Washington. Mr. Moynihan, who never developed, even after Watergate, the searing contempt for Mr. Nixon that animated so many contemporary Democrats, explained that when the president of the United States asks, a good citizen agrees to help. Another biographer, Godfrey Hodgson, says that while Mr. Moynihan never stopped thinking of himself as a liberal Democrat, he shared the president's resentment of orthodox liberalism.
While his advice to the president to end the war in Vietnam stayed private, there were two ideas for which his time in the Nixon White House was known. 
In 1970 he wrote to the president on race relations, arguing that the issue had been rubbed raw by "hysterics, paranoids and boodlers" on all sides. Now, he wrote, race relations could profit from a period of "benign neglect" in which rhetoric, at least, was toned down. In a rerun of the reaction to his paper on the Negro family, when this paper was leaked it was treated as if Mr. Moynihan wanted to neglect blacks.
He may have invited that interpretation by his quaintly glib language, but in fact Mr. Moynihan was pushing an idea that might have been of vast help to poor blacks, and whites. That other idea for which he was known, the Family Assistance Plan, sought to provide guaranteed income to the unemployed and supplements to the working poor, and together to stop fathers from leaving home so their families could qualify for welfare. The president made a speech for the program, sent it to Capitol Hill and let it die.
Afterward, though he remained on good terms with Mr. Nixon, Mr. Moynihan went back to Harvard in 1970. Resentment over his White House service chilled his welcome back in Cambridge. His interests shifted to foreign affairs -- perhaps because the charges of racism left him no audience for domestic policy, and made him welcome an appointment as ambassador to India, where he negotiated a deal to end India's huge food aid debt to the United States. He returned to Harvard to protect his tenure in 1975, but moved that year to the United Nations as United States ambassador.
There he answered the United States' third world critics bluntly, often contemptuously.
In his brief tenure he called Idi Amin, the president of Uganda, a "racist murderer," and denounced the General Assembly for passing a resolution equating Zionism with racism: "the abomination of anti-Semitism has been given the appearance of international sanction." After eight months of struggles with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who wanted a less confrontational approach, he resigned in February 1976.
That made him available for a run for the Democratic nomination for the Senate, and he edged out the very liberal Representative Bella Abzug in the primary before winning the general election easily over the incumbent, James L. Buckley, the Republican-Conservative candidate. With his wife in charge of each campaign, he won three landslide re-elections.
He set one high goal -- a seat on the Finance Committee as a freshman -- and reached it, along with a seat on the Intelligence Committee. Early in office he joined Gov. Hugh L. Carey, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in a St. Patrick's Day appeal to Irish-Americans to stop sending money to arm the Irish Republican Army, whom he privately described as "a bunch of murderous thugs."
Every year he produced an analysis of federal taxes and federal aid, known as "the fisc," which showed that New York was getting regularly shortchanged by Washington. He worked to reduce that imbalance, both through Medicaid funding on the Finance Committee and public works on the Environment and Public Works Committee.
And his colleagues always knew he was around. Every day of the 2,454-day captivity of Terry Anderson, the Associated Press reporter captured by 1985 by the Hezbollah in Lebanon, he would go to the Senate floor to remind his colleagues, in a sentence, just how many days it had been.

Quarreled With White House
After loyally serving four presidents, he quarreled with those in the White House while he was in the Senate. When he arrived in 1977, he found President Carter too soft in dealing with the Soviet Union and indifferent to its evil nature. 
But he quickly came to believe that the Soviet Union was crumbling. In Newsweek in 1979 he focused on its ethnic tensions. In January 1980, he told the Senate: "The Soviet Union is a seriously troubled, even sick society. The indices of economic stagnation and even decline are extraordinary. The indices of social disorder -- social pathology is not too strong a term -- are even more so." He added, "The defining event of the decade might well be the breakup of the Soviet empire."
It was against that changed perception that he was sharply critical of vast increases in military spending, which, combined with the Reagan tax cuts, produced deficits that he charged were intended to starve domestic spending.He called a 1983 Reagan proposal for cutting Social Security benefits a "breach of faith" with the elderly, and worked out a rescue package that kept the program solvent for at least a decade into the 21st century.
He also scorned the 1983 invasion of Grenada, the 1984 mining of harbors in Nicaragua and the 1989 invasion of Panama as violations of international law, and voted against authorizing President George H. W. Bush to make war against Iraq. It was not enough, he wrote in his book "On the Law of Nations" in 1990, for the United States to be strong enough to get away with such actions. The American legacy of international legal norms of state behavior, he wrote, is "a legacy not to be frittered away."
But probably his worst relations with a president came when Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton sought passage of national health insurance.
Certainly, the failure of health care legislation was not primarily Mr. Moynihan's responsibility, but he had become chairman of the Finance Committee in 1993, and health care fell within its jurisdiction. He said the administration should take on welfare reform legislation first, and carped on television about their health plan, quickly fixing on the role of teaching hospitals as the biggest issue in health care. But otherwise he waited for Mr. Packwood and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, to propose a compromise. Mr. Dole had decided all-out opposition was the better course for his party, and they never did.
Mr. Moynihan's career in the Senate was marked not by legislative milestones but by ideas. Even so, Senator Kennedy, the legislative lion, once described him in 1993 as an exemplar "of what the Founding Fathers thought the Senate would be about," because of the New Yorker's breadth of interests, "having read history, and thought about it, and being opinionated."

 BODY:
 Chancellor Gerhard Schroder wants to increase the German military so that the country can "count on our own forces" in the future, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported. 
Divisions in Europe and at the United Nations "mean that we also have to draw our own conclusions," Mr. Schroeder said. NATO, the European Union and the United States have long called on Berlin to commit more to defense spending. Germany currently spends about 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense.

HEADLINE: A TV Fair Overtaken By Events 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: CANNES, France, March 26 

 BODY:
Images from Iraq flooded the airwaves this week, and damped the market for images that opened here Monday.
 Some booths capitalized on Iraq. 
 "Come to Stand 04.28 for Osama Bin Laden, George Bush, and Tony Blair," read an ad taped to a column at Mip TV, the huge annual television programming fair.
The ad promoted the wares of ITN Archive, which markets the film libraries of several British television stations. 
Asked if the war had increased demand for its images, Paul McAllister, a sales researcher at ITN, said, "In the current situation, obviously." On Iraq, he said, "we have collections that go back 100 years." 
Others have been hurt. The booth that the Nippon Television Network had reserved stood empty, except for a sign taped to the rear wall saying that "in the light of recent international events," the company had decided to stay home. 
Some who came anyway made light of the risks. 
"I told my friends, if terrorists bring the plane down, it's only the last yard down that's dangerous," said Ivan Solvason, chief executive of Sync2.tv, a software company, who flew in from the company's headquarters in Peninsula, Calif. 
Over all, the war definitely kept many people home. About 9,000 buyers and sellers of television programming, from movies to serials to animated cartoons, came to the fair this year, 1,000 fewer than last year and 2,000 fewer than hoped for.
"Those who actually attended were really very motivated," said Rene Peres, the director of the television division at Reed Midem, the company that organizes the fair. 
The fair was emblematic of an industry struggling to reinvent itself amid a stubborn economic slump. 
"It's a hanging-in-year," said Jeff Pryor, a public relations executive who represents several large television production companies. "Batten down the hatches." 
Industry executives, Mr. Pryor said, are now looking to 2004, with the Summer Olympic Games in Greece and the United States presidential election as the next magnets for some growth in ad spending. But others said that without overall economic improvement, advertisers will simply be rearranging their budgets, not increasing them. 
"Advertising was just beginning to come back, though still not anywhere near where it had been," said Richard Lorber, the president of Koch Lorber Films, a New York distributor, who called the war in Iraq "another kick in the teeth."
Some saw harbingers of improvement. In Germany, for instance, a move by Haim Saban, the Israeli-American media entrepreneur, to buy media assets from the financially struggling empire of Leo Kirch was seen as a good sign.
"I wouldn't call it business as usual," said Walther Kahl, the managing director of KC Communications in Cologne, Germany. "But it is almost business as usual." 
Charlotte Parton, the owner of 3DD Entertainment of London, said she had found buyers from Israel and Romania for the rights to several entertainment documentaries and had sold broadcast rights in Italy for Cher's planned April farewell concert.
"Obviously, the market as a whole is struggling," she said, "and the war is not helping."
As the wide-open ad spending of the 1990's has contracted, the imaginative powers of an industry built on imagination have been tested. TV stations around the world have deserted costly production of traditional programs in favor of what the industry calls formats -- broad outlines for programs that can be adapted to local languages and cultures, like quiz shows or reality shows. Companies like Fremantle Productions and the Endemol Group of the Netherlands became market leaders in distributing formats.
Fremantle offered several new reality formats at the trade fair here, including one with a master chef training would-be cooks and another with a studio audience trying to pick the truth-teller from a field of fibbers.
The rise of formats has also helped transform the American television industry from sellers to buyers. "Big Brother," for example, originated with Endemol.
A hitch to formatted programming can be uncertainty over what can and cannot be copyrighted. Major lawsuits are pending in several countries over claims that one producer plagiarized another's format.
At the same time, producers are finding some new income from DVD's, which are booming as the technology spreads and prices fall. Moreover, DVD's can be manufactured with alternate audio tracks in several languages, a popular feature in multilingual Europe and Asia. 
"The marketing of DVD rights is probably the strongest growth segment of the entertainment industry worldwide," said Randy Naft, the president of Liberty International Entertainment, a Los Angeles distributor. "I had a buyer from Iran today who told me they are importing DVD players from China that retail for $70." 
While the West's economies languish, some other countries are enjoying buoyant growth, and their TV industries are flexing their muscles. South Korean distributors have been coming to the fair in growing numbers, specializing mainly in animation, which they first mastered as suppliers to American and Japanese studios. 
"We Koreans used to work for companies like Walt Disney, but we had no ideas of our own," said Kenny S. Kwak, the managing director of Kenny & Company Entertainment, based in Seoul. "Now we are developing new ideas and trying to understand Europe better."
The Korean cartoon style is Pokemon knockoff, and the English soundtracks can often be quirky. One show for preschool children that Mr. Kwak offers is called "Ducky the Perky."
The Russian contingent, too, is growing and becoming more professional. Not long ago, one buyer said, "several Russian companies might be offering the same film, and you never really knew whether the company you bought it from owned it." 
Now, though, Russian production is booming, and 32 Russian companies came to Cannes to offer their wares, with clear title to them. 
"We have 500 one-hour episodes, and more than 300 in production," said Olga Mironova, the director of sales and acquisitions at the Family Screen Company, a unit of the giant Russian conglomerate MediaMost. The company was offering feature films like "The Sniper," an action movie featuring the Russian star Mikhail Ulyanov, as well as several television series. The rights to "Petersburg Underworld," a kind of Russian police drama, were sold to stations in Poland, China, the Baltic states, Romania and Bulgaria, Ms. Mironova said. 
Will any of these series be showing up in the United States soon? 
"America is a terribly difficult market," she said. "I can't understand it. There are so many Russian speakers in New York."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: VOICES; 
Divided Over Another War, But Still on Speaking Terms

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Across Fifth Avenue from an antiwar demonstration yesterday in Manhattan, Steve Durgee, 33, brandished an American flag and a sign that read "Move to France (please!)." Speeding by on Rollerblades, Roger Manning, 46, said, "You people are fools!"
 The two men started to yell at each other, then to argue, then to talk. No minds were changed, but in a few minutes the long-haired Mr. Manning and the short-haired Mr. Durgee were saying things like, "I have no problem with discussion," and "Good point." 
 Americans may not agree on the wisdom of going to war with Iraq, but polls and interviews around New York suggest that the two sides remain on speaking terms. While each side views the other as misguided, so far relatively few are voicing the vitriol about each other that characterized the last period of division over an American war. 
Thirty years ago, after a decade of escalating war in Vietnam, slogans like "America, Love It or Leave It" carried an angry punch. This time, the mantra of many New Yorkers seems to be, "Everyone is entitled to his own opinion."
Take Michael Pearson, a 35-year-old carpenter who lives in Long Island City, Queens. He supports President Bush, he said, and thinks the antiwar protests have been counterproductive. But asked if these demonstrations should be permitted, he sounded almost incredulous.
"Oh, of course they should be able to protest, without a doubt," he said. "That's what we're fighting for."
Thirty-three years ago, construction workers beat up antiwar demonstrators on Wall Street and stormed City Hall. Four students were killed by the National Guard during a period of antiwar protests at Kent State. Families feuded over the dinner table. One 1970 Harris poll found that 37 percent of Americans thought that protests against the Vietnam War should be illegal.
Today, 61 percent say Americans who oppose the war should be allowed to hold protest marches and rallies, while 29 percent think that such activity is detrimental to the war effort, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. The poll, based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday and Monday with 1,032 adults nationwide, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Of course, just because you believe people can protest does not mean you believe that they should. "Once the war started, you should not protest anymore," said Salvatore Scarlato, 70, of Hauppauge, in Suffolk County, who is a veteran of the Korean War. "You should now say, 'Let's support our troops and hope it's over soon.' "
And it is not hard to find war-related nastiness and name-calling (and not just on talk radio).
At the Fifth Avenue antiwar demonstration yesterday morning, outside Rockefeller Center, hecklers called protesters "traitors" and "freaks" and yelled "Get a job!" at young people in the crowd. The protesters in turn called those who disagreed with them "idiots" and tried to drown out dissent by chanting "Peace is patriotic."
The size of the crowd was hard to gauge because there were so many reporters, camera crews, uniformed police officers, plainclothes officers, tourists, kibitzers and people just trying to get to work. Several dozen protesters knocked over police barricades and lay down on Fifth Avenue, closing the road for about 16 minutes. Scattered protests continued during the day; the police said 215 people were arrested.
Those who have studied the Vietnam protests and those who participated in them have several explanations for why discourse may be more civil now. One is simply that these are still the early days of the war.
Disruptive demonstrations can wear out even the most tolerant. And more American casualties could easily harden the positions of both antiwar protesters and those who believe that the most important thing is to support the troops and their commander in chief.
But unlike the Vietnam-era protesters, demonstrators these days have been careful to express their admiration for those serving in the armed forces, and to avoid, for the most part, desecrating American flags. "Everyone is trying to grab the patriotic banner," said Christian G. Appy, whose "Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered From All Sides," will be published by Viking in May.
Not having a draft may also help defuse some of the class-based resentments that made the Vietnam protests so unpopular with many Americans, especially blue-collar families whose sons were serving overseas. "Working-class people were as divided by the war as anyone else," Mr. Appy said, "but they were deeply offended by upper-middle-class protesters who had all of the advantages."
Antiwar protests have also become an accepted part of American history and culture, said Seymour Melman, emeritus professor of industrial engineering at Columbia University and a speaker at an antiwar protest on Wall Street in 1970.
"Present populations are drawing upon a common heritage of ideas that has been around for some time," he said.
And the antiwar movement today appears more diverse than it was during the early protests of the Vietnam War, when it often seemed hostile to "anyone over 30."
Joy Seldin, 55, of Montclair, N.J., said that when she and her friends were protesting the Vietnam War, "our parents all thought that we were traitors." Now, she said, she and her daughter oppose the war -- and so does her 76-year-old mother in Florida.
Mrs. Seldin has not been to any of the recent protests (except in spirit), but William Nunziata has. And they are different from those he attended during the Vietnam era, said Mr. Nunziata, 51, a transit worker who works in Queens. 
"Because this protest is not just hippies -- I am a hippie by the way," he said. "The construction workers were with us on the line."
Many people, in New York and elsewhere, find themselves in ambiguous positions, opposing the war, supporting the troops, hating Saddam Hussein, wishing the United Nations had backed the United States, worrying about terrorism, fretting about the amount of money the war will cost and what it will do to the economy.
Jeff Wilkins, a businessman from Los Gatos, Calif., who was visiting ground zero, ran through many of these thoughts, and more, when asked what he thought of the war. As for the protesters, he said: "People have opinions and they need to express them, especially extreme opinions, and there's nothing more extreme than life and death. But I'm ashamed our soldiers don't have support."
When he listens to both sides, he said, "it's difficult to agree with everything, and it's difficult to disagree with everything."
But even those who know most definitely where they stand can often be understanding, at least in public, about those who disagree.
Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb of the Orthodox Union, who attended a Tuesday evening prayer service on the Upper West Side in support of the troops, firmly backs the American effort in Iraq.
Still, he said of the demonstrators, "that's what we are fighting for, the right to dissent." While he thinks they are misguided about how peace can be achieved, he said, "I don't think they are misguided in terms of being off the wall."
At the other end of the political spectrum is Maya Sen, an organizer with the antiwar group Not in Our Name, one of the groups involved in yesterday's protest. But she, too, kept her rhetoric cool in discussing the war's supporters. "I think they are misinformed, notgetting the whole picture, not being provided with the complete truth," she said.
But, she added, "there are a lot of people with very good intentions on both sides."

Oscar Gold For New York
 Sunday night's Oscar ceremonies were another triumph for New York-based distributors, but it wasn't just the studio-owned specialty divisions, like Miramax ("Chicago"), Focus Features ("The Pianist") and Sony Pictures Classics ("Talk to Her") that brought home little gold men. 
 Zeitgeist Films, a tiny, truly independent art film distributor based in a walk-up suite of offices in a SoHo loft building, found itself the beneficiary of a best foreign-language film award for "Nowhere in Africa." Directed by Caroline Link, this German production, about a Jewish family that flees Nazi persecution by immigrating to Kenya, was acquired by Zeitgeist in November 2001 for the American market.
"We had heard from a lot of people that 'Nowhere in Africa' had a good chance for the Oscar," said Nancy Gerstman, who founded Zeitgeist with Emily Russo in 1988. "We felt as confident as you can feel, but you never know." 
Ms. Russo said: "We borrowed a loft for the occasion, and we just did it up for our staff and our families. We didn't know what the outcome was going to be, but we were ready for anything."
Ms. Gerstman added: "We've been in business for 15 years, and we've really worked just unbelievably hard. It's so nice to have this happen now." Zeitgeist's earlier successes were Todd Haynes's "Poison" and Abbas Kiarostami's "Taste of Cherry."
The Zeitgeist staff could not attend the ceremonies in Los Angeles because the small number of tickets allotted to the foreign language nominees went to the film's German producers. As it turned out, even Ms. Link, the film's writer and director, wasn't able to go because of a family emergency. "Her baby had been sick in the hospital," Ms. Gerstman said, "and she didn't feel that she should leave Germany." Salma Hayek, who presented the foreign language award, accepted on Ms. Link's behalf.
What's the immediate effect of an Oscar? "It's opening much wider this week," Ms. Russo said. "We'll be on 33 screens on Friday, in all of the major markets." (In New York City, the film will continue at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and the BAM Rose Cinemas in Brooklyn while adding the Quad Cinema in Greenwich Village.)
It's the widest opening in Zeitgeist's history, and the company's founders are thrilled. "We're ready, we're up for it, we've been waiting for it," Ms. Gerstman and Ms. Russo exclaimed, speaking over each other in a simultaneous burst of enthusiasm.

A Range of Roles
Ever since Neil LaBute cast his old college friend Aaron Eckhart as the breathtakingly cruel junior executive in Mr. LaBute's debut film, "In the Company of Men," Mr. Eckhart has become a familiar figure in independent films. With his matinee-idol good looks -- he has one of the few cleft chins to appear in the movies since Cary Grant and Kirk Douglas -- and his willingness to take chances with unsympathetic roles, Mr. Eckhart has proved himself an actor of unusual range and unusual courage.
But in Jon Amiel's fantasy adventure "The Core," which opens nationally today (review, Page 1 of Weekend), Mr. Eckhart has struck out in a surprising new direction: the mainstream. "I just wanted to play a character the whole family could go see, you know?" Mr. Eckhart said by phone from Arizona, where he has just completed filming Ron Howard's western "The Missing." "Something that was not so controversial. I like this movie because it's PG-13 and just a fun ride."
"I've always said about Neil that he could flourish in any genre," Mr. Eckhart said, referring to Mr. LaBute's more recent forays into romantic comedy ("Nurse Betty") and period romance ("Possession"). "I believe that about him and I also believe that about myself. I have my many sides, and I like running around and taking it easy and having some fun, and exploring the dark side as well. I'm not committing to one genre for my future at all."
In "The Core," Mr. Eckhart plays Josh Keyes, a geophysicistdrafted into leading an expedition to the center of the earth. The planet's central core has stopped spinning, and it is up to Mr. Eckhart's character, ably assisted by Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo and Stanley Tucci, to get it moving again.
Mr. Eckhart said there was no difference between the way he prepares for a Neil LaBute movie and what he did on "The Core." "This may be a popcorn movie, but for me, I try to give it my all," he said. "Sometimes I do a good job and sometimes I don't, but I put a lot of work into everything I do, or else it's meaningless to me and I have no business doing it."

Political Idealists
"Stevie," a troubling first-person documentary about the filmmaker Steve James's relationship with a deeply troubled young man whom Mr. James worked with in a Big Brother program, opens today in New York (review, Page 28). It's a challenging, unconventional film that poses more questions -- about the documentarian's relationship to his subject, about the limitations of the cinema as an instrument of truth -- than it presumes to answer.
That's the quality that makes it a Kartemquin film, the latest in a long line of politically engaged documentaries ("Hoop Dreams" is the most famous) produced by the Chicago-based Kartemquin company, founded in 1966 by a group of University of Chicago students.
Though its organizational basis has evolved, Kartemquin has never wavered from its political ideals, said Gordon Quinn, one of the three founders. What began as a collective in the 1960's, creating fiercely political work, turned into a full-scale production company in the 70's, when the political work was subsidized by industrial films and sports shows made for television.
"We kept it going, and it evolved over the years into its new form," Mr. Quinn said by phone from the company's Chicago offices, "where we had a group of producers with us making films largely for television broadcast -- films that we thought could get people emotionally connected, by getting people involved with a story and human lives, to draw them in so that they would see things from another perspective. Then, the underlying social and political and economic issues would be something that the audience would care about. As we became older, we returned to something that we were very interested in at our beginnings."
Kartemquin now receives much of its financing from organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and the Public Broadcasting System. For PBS, Kartemquin is producing a seven-part series called "New Americans," scheduled for this fall. It will follow several immigrant families over a period of several years as they leave their home countries and try to adapt to life in the United States.
"It's very important for us to stick with the story and stay with it for as long as it takes," Mr. Quinn said. "And sometimes that's a difficult thing to explain to a funder, when you're seven years down the line. We really feel that one of the things that's needed in America's debate about social issues is a sense of human complexity."

HEADLINE: South Korea's New Leader Offers Plan to Spur Investment 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 27 

 BODY:
The new administration of President Roh Moo Hyun announced sweeping economic proposals today meant to attract investment into fields ranging from golf courses to factories to car dealerships, as concerns grow that South Korea's economy may be sliding toward another crisis like the one that flattened it in 1997. 
 With economic growth slowing, President Roh's team of financial advisers concluded that waiting any longer to act would endanger the economy, and they won approval from the cabinet for broad deregulation. 
 "We have pursued this program for a long time," said Bahk Byong Won, director general for economic policy at the Finance Ministry. "The present economic difficulty has persuaded the ministers of the need to put it into action." 
Mr. Roh's administration took up the program after first pursuing and then quickly backing away from another initiative that Mr. Roh and his supporters had advocated through the election campaign, a crackdown on the excesses of the chaebol, the giant family-run conglomerates that have dominated the South Korean economy for decades. 
Mr. Roh and his advisers, some of them viewed as liberal reformers who would like to reduce the power of the chaebol over the economy, were persuaded to reverse course because of concerns about the economic effect of a scandal at one of the largest chaebol, the SK Group.
Ten executives of the group were indicted this month after SK Global, the group's trading arm, was found to have understated its debt and overstated its earnings for 2001; two of the executives are being held by police. The prosecutions at SK and the new government's anti-chaebol talk touched off a wave of withdrawals from investment funds and sent stock and bond markets reeling.
One aim of the new proposals is to remove obstacles to investment in new factories. Economic planners believe the economy needs this kind of investment to sustain growth at a time when oil prices are high. 
The new rules would, among other things, clear the way for construction of the world's largest liquid-crystal display factory by Royal Philips Electronics and a semiconductor plant by Dongbu Electronics. The proposed rules would also almost double the amount of land available for building golf courses.
"We have a lot of regulations" standing in the way of development, Mr. Bahk said. "This time we are going to deregulate to make such investments possible."
Among the government's major proposals for the financial sector is a plan to set up a public corporation that would buy home mortgages from lenders, modeled on Fannie Mae in the United States. And a single holding company would be established to control Korea's three securities exchanges.
Pyeon Yang Ho, director general for financial policy at the finance ministry, said the general aim was to streamline financial transactions for everyone from homeowners to institutional investors.
Though the new proposals do not refer specifically to foreign investment, Mr. Pyeon said he believed that they would encourage potential investors to look at South Korean assets. Finance officials hope for more deals like the one struck today for the sale of two of the Hyundai Group's asset management businesses to Prudential Financial of the United States for $400 million.
The deal took more than a year to negotiate. The government, which brokered the deal, appeared determined to bring it to a happy ending after the shock two years ago of having the American International Group back out of a deal for control of two businesses and a third sibling.
Many of the regulations the government wants to drop are environmental rules that it says have stymied development. The government also said it would allow diesel-powered cars in the country beginning in 2005, provided that they met European emission standards, which are less strict than South Korea's.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Millenniums of Asia, Packed Into a Week

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
One Tuesday earlier this month, some of the Metropolitan Museum's Asian art galleries had an unusual number of visitors. That day more than 300 people went to the Ancient Near Eastern galleries, and most of them did the same thing when they got there. They took out a sketchbook and pencil and silently began to make drawings of the objects around them.
 An art class field trip? No, this was a draw-in organized by a New York-based group called Artists Against the War. The galleries they chose were those with work from ancient Mesopotamia, the land that is now Iraq. 
 Their purpose, they said, was to call attention to the civilizations that had flourished there under various names -- Sumer, Babylonia, Assyria, the Arab-Muslim Abbasid empire -- during 5,000 years, and into the present. 
The objects the visitors drew included exquisite luxury items and fierce religious emblems, the latter often designed not to embody evil but to frighten it away. In certain pieces, influences from Arabia, Persia, China, India and the Mediterranean world mingled.
Whatever the specific political message of the event, by copying these Asian images over and over again, the artists seemed intent on emblazoning them on the collective consciousness of another culture, our own.
This week thousands of Asian objects have landed in Manhattan as part of the annual spring Asia Week. The International Asian Art Fair opens today; exhibitions are on at museums; dozens of galleries have cooked up special shows. (Shows of classical Chinese furniture, Antiques column, Page 44.) And the war that was threatening in early March is in progress. Inevitably, this political reality inflects the mood of the week itself, which is, after all, a market-dependent affair.
At the same time, as the collections at the Met suggest, it is a prism through which art itself can be viewed with fresh eyes, as a powerful but fragile carrier of social and spiritual information, aspirations and fears.

Art Fairs
The International Asian Art Fair is back at the Seventh Regiment Armory after last year's post-9/11 adventure in a tent in a West Side park. The show's 2003 edition -- its seventh -- looks very much at home again, but also different, at once denser and thinner.
The number of galleries participating has grown, to 55 from last year's 49. But the spectacular, big-ticket objects that used to give this fair a distinctive grandeur are few and far between. Although there is plenty of everything, most of that plenty seems smaller. This may be a reflection of political and economic jitters, or the diminishing availability of material, or the fact that certain charismatic galleries that have dropped out of the fair over time have been replaced by less distinguished newcomers. Whatever, that's where we are.
That said, where we are is still at the top of the art fair heap in New York. I judge this by applying two criteria: one, does a fair offer objects the likes of which you have never seen before, and, two, does it have art of a kind you passionately love but almost never see available elsewhere? The answer has always been yes and yes for the Asian Art Fair and still is.
One item that I would place in the first category is an 11th-century stone finial from a stupa, or Buddhist reliquary monument, at John Eskenazi's booth, with carved figures ranged in tiers from top to bottom on all four sides. That it survived intact, considering the height from which it presumably descended, is miraclous.
Another is the sandstone base for what must have been an immense carved Dharmachakra, or Wheel of the Buddhist Law, seen at the booth shared by Doris and Nancy Wiener. This majestic sculpture with its sinuous patterns symbolizing the core ingredients of the religion itself -- the Buddha, the Dharma and the monastic community, or Sangha -- probably dates from the first century B.C. or A.D. Although such objects are often depicted in relief carvings, I have never seen one of this size "live."
And as for passionately loved things too seldom encountered, the London dealer Sam Fogg has this year again brought a significant cache of non-Indian Islamic art. It includes examples of calligraphy in the form of Koran pages from ninth- and 10th-century Iraq. No text in the world is more hypnotic when spoken aloud than the Koran, and none more beautiful when written out by hand. In addition, Mr. Fogg has a display of early bowls with calligraphic inscriptions: "he is he" (meaning "God is God"), says one; "greed is a sign of poverty," says another; "good food," says a third.
Finally, among this year's newcomers, M. Sutherland Fine Arts from New York is showing contemporary Asian painting, treading a path forged at the fair by Michael Goedhuis, who has up-to-date material at his booth and at his gallery on East 76th Street, and by China 2000, which has both 20th-century traditional painting by Shao Yixuan(1886-1954) and fascinating political work from the revolutionary era, with upbeat depictions of what was for many a period of catastrophic human folly. The social historians and the art historians alike will find much to ponder here.
At the 69th Regiment Armory, the Arts of Pacific Asia Show is a natural destination for anyone who is in the market for something "Asian," but reluctant to spend huge sums. More than 80 dealers, from cities as far flung as Amsterdam and Ann Arbor, have been shoehorned into the armory.
Certain galleries -- Cynthia Shaver with Japanese textiles, for example, and Marc Richards with Chinese sculpture -- make an elegant thing of their closet-size space. Most booths have the chockablock visual busyness that looks like home-away-from-home to the obsessive, which is not to say undiscriminating, collector.

Museums
In contrast to international politics, Asian art fairs are, in their modest way, triumphs of diplomacy. They bring diverse people from around the globe together through shared self-interest, in this case to buy and sell art. And the art itself is often -- almost always, in fact -- a product of a complex process of cultural give and take.
This kind of exchange is boldly proposed and entertainingly examined in "Great Waves: Chinese Themes in the Arts of Korea and Japan" at the Met. Basically the show is a collection reinstallation done with a novel mix-and-match approach. Spread over both the Chinese painting galleries and the Japanese galleries, it traces the flow of influence from one culture to the other. Most of the action takes place in the Chinese galleries, where the art is arranged by pictorial motifs -- seascapes, landscapes, floral images -- that emerged early in China and later circulated to Korea and Japan. In modern times the direction of the flow reversed itself when 19th- and early 20th-century Chinese painters in Shanghai began taking their stylistic cues from Japanese art.
The show's thesis is sure to provide grist for many scholarly mills, which is what exhibitions should do. Organized by Maxwell K. Hearn and Miyeko Murase, both of the museum's Asian art department, it is tremendous fun to look at: What? This beside this? Who would have thought?
If it has a major fault it is that Korea, underrepresented in the Met collection, is also underrepresented in the show's historical scheme. The imbalance will be at least partly rectified in another show, "Transmitting the Forms of Divinity: Early Buddhist Art From Korea and Japan," to open at the Japan Society on April 9. The small Korean gilt Buddha that sold for more than $1.5 million earlier this week at Christie's New York further whets the appetite for what we will see there.
Indeed, if any force can be said to unite East Asian cultures, it would be Buddhism. And as if in direct response to uneasy times, the pacific images associated with this religion are to be found everywhere during Asia Week. Nowhere are they more concentrated than in "The World of Buddhism: Selections From the Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3rd Collection" at the Asia Society and Museum. Anyone familiar with the collection is already feeling blissed out by its return to public view. Everyone else will have the delight of a first-time encounter with its embodiment of the Buddha in many forms, from an earthly figure carved from stone in fifth-century India, to the celestial eighth-century bronze Buddha of the Future, probably made in northern Thailand and now one of the great art sights of New York.
The Asia Society has set aside a gallery as a "meditation room" for the occasion. With low lighting, scrolls on the walls and a carpeted floor, it's a nice place to power down from what seems these day like an all-news-all-the-time city. The show itself is a component of the "Buddhism Project," a series of exhibitions being mounted by several New York institutions over the next year. The next segment is a contemporary art show, "The Commodification of Buddhism," to open at the Bronx Museum of the Arts on Thursday.

Tibetan Art
When the International Asian Art Fair began in 1996, it was accompanied by a few short-run exhibitions by local galleries or out-of-town dealers in rented spaces. Seven years later there are dozens of such shows, large and small, turning what was once a fairly leisurely round of visits into an aesthetic marathon.
Among the most rewarding special exhibitions this year are two showcases of Buddhist art from the Himalayas. "Images of Devotion From the Himalayas and South Asia," by the London gallery Rossi & Rossi is not large, but it is stunning, and if I had to choose just one place to hang out for a while, it would be the front gallery of this show.
At its center are a pair of sweet-faced copper deer that might once have surmounted a monastery gateway. Flanking them are two ravishing paintings from central Tibet, one of the Buddha preaching to a throng of lamas and saints, the other of a spiritual being named the Goddess of the Glorious White Parasol, who has a danger-repelling face and multicolored heads stacked up in a beehive. Most interesting of all is a diagrammatic drawing of the cosmos, showing heaven, earth and the mysterious land of Shambala, an Eden accessible only to the pure of heart. Oddly enough, in this version it seems to coincide with earth.
These objects, like much Tibetan art that has arrived in the West since the Chinese occupation, are political refugees. So are many of the amazing sculptures in "Faces of Tibet: The Wesley and Carolyn Halpert Collection" at Carlton Rochell. Mr. Rochell, formerly head of the department of South Asian art at Sotheby's, opened his own gallery last fall, and his first Asia Week show is a beauty. Most of the sculptures are from a well-known American private collection -- collection shows abound this year -- and take the form of what might be called spiritual portraits.
They include a rogue's gallery of wild-and-crazy holy men known as mahasiddhas, as well as a group of characterful lamas. Scrawny or paunchy, smiling or dour, no two looking remotely alike. By contrast, a painted portrait of the monastic abbot Sangye Yarjon (1203-1272) is a model of formal decorum, serene and superb.

Japanese Art
"Shinto" at Koichi Yanagi, minute and ineffably lovely, was my favorite Asia Week exhibition last year. The Yanagi show this spring, "Buddha," is not quite in that rarefied class but is still a must-see if only for a single object: a small eighth-century bronze sculpture of Yakushi Buddha, or Healing Buddha, based on prototypes developed in Korea. Originally gilded, this figure seems to have at some point been scorched in a fire, and its survival from destruction lends it an extra measure of sanctity.
A far more modest Japanese Buddha can be found at Suzanne Mitchell Asian Fine Arts, which has opened its by-appointment-only doors for an Asia Week show. In this case the figure is a bodhisattva drawn on a slip of paper, colored with soft rainbow hues and mounted on a scroll. The image dates from the Late Heian period (circa 900 to 1185), but the stylistic leap to 21st-century manga work is not so great.
If you look closely, you can even turn up a Buddhist reference -- a nun with a shaved head, for example -- in the determinedly secular contents of "Masterpieces of Ukiyo-e: Paintings from the Manno Art Museum," an exhibition put together by Sebastian Izzard in association with the London Gallery of Tokyo. The pictures are, almost without exception, of the fleshly paradise known as the Yoshiwara, the classy red-light district of Edo, now Toyko. This pleasure quarter is most familiar as the subject of woodblock prints, but it also inspired paintings of enormous wit and considerable beauty.
A handscroll by Hishikawa Moronobu (circa 1618-1694) serves as an illustrated guide to the district. Although only a section of it is is on view, it is packed with picaresque details, from cooks preparing meals in the brothel kitchen, to women and their clients napping and playing games in an adjoining room, surrounded by such upscale accouterments as landscape screens painted in the fashionable Chinese style.

Chinese Art
Luxury items for the living and for for the dead account for the entries in "Chinese Works of Art From the Stoclet Collection," a characteristically dazzling Asia Week contribution from the London dealer Giuseppe Eskenazi. The 18 pieces come from the vast pan-cultural array of art amassed by the Belgian financier Adolphe Stoclet (1871-1949). Mr. Eskenazi has shown Chinese pieces from the collection since the 1970's, but obviously the source has yet to run dry. This year's selection ranges from a bronze and silver inlaid bracket in the form of mythical beasts, from the Late Eastern Zhou (fourth to third century B.C.), to a fantastic beaked chimera, or bixie, from the Han dynasty (202 B.C. to A.D. 220), to a seventh-century limestone bodhisattva's head with an elaborate carved crown and a sublime smile.
Exhibitions at J. J. Lally & Company Oriental Art, across 57th Street in the Fuller Building, are something to look forward to throughout the year and "Bronze and Gold in Ancient China" this spring is no exception. It opens with a group of gilt bronze plaques, one in the form of a vivacious phoenix. And this image, like almost everything on view -- including a bronze lamp in the form of a gold-robed sentry and a set of extraordinary carved narrative titles -- was created to amuse, instruct or protect the dead, in a culture as fixated on the afterlife as our own is entangled in the minutiae of the here and now.
Funerary goods also dominate the extravagant display of Chinese work brought by Gisele Croes from Belgium. Ms. Croes exhibited at the Asian Fair until last year and her booth, always at the very center of the armory and filled with ancient bronzes, was legendary. Her material this year is as entrancing as always, but piece by piece smaller in size and more varied, leavening monumental Shang vessels with, for example, an exquisite silver and gold Buddhist reliquary, its interior incised with lotuses and dragons, from the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618 to 907) and Tang tomb frescoes of court figures, including a woman with jet-black hair, bee-stung lips and and a daringly low-cut gown.
Finally, for a sense of the kinds of luxury fabrics from which such dresses were probably made, you can do no better than visit "Weaving China's Past: The Amy S. Clague Collection of Chinese Textiles" at China Institute Gallery. The gallery has a sterling record for presenting fine-tuned scholarly shows; this one, imported from the Phoenix Art Museum, exactly fits this description, with examples of silk brocades, tapestries and embroideries, including Buddhist ritual pieces dating from the Jin to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).
It is ideally, if serendipitously, complemented by a second show, "Luxurious Essentials" at Kaikodo, composed primarily of painted fans, representing a minor but flourishing medium in Chinese art. Such respected Ming and Qing period artists as Qiu Ying, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, Yun Shouping and Wang Yuanqi are all represented in a show presenting relatively affordable and highly portable art.

Contemporary Art
Alongside this week's wealth of traditional Asian art, there is an entire parallel universe of contemporary work, either from Asia or by Asian or Asian-American artists. Suffice it to say that such exhibitions and the numbers of galleries regularly presenting them have grown exponentially in the last decade or so, though not always smoothly.
The wave of new art from China, which seemed so strong after the Asia Society's "Inside Out" exhibition, has lost some of its initial momentum in New York, in part because the work was so plentiful and diffuse that no one has been able to shape a coherent presentation of it. Of galleries specializing in new Chinese work, Ethan Cohen Fine Arts in TriBeCa has, with hits and misses, presented it most persuasively, often in group shows like the current "Peace and Line," which includes an installation of calligraphy by the venerable painter C. C. Wang, now 97, on the pages of New York City telephone books; calligraphic paintings from 1986 by Gu Wenda; and experimental work by three young Chinese artists, Pan Xinglei, Xing Fei and Zhou Hongxiang.
New art from South Asia, meanwhile, has been consistently well represented by two galleries, both with strong shows at the moment. The artist who uses the single name Navjot is at Talwar with an installation of figures of nude women and men carved from teakwood and painted a deep, rich blue. Inspired by both religious icons and tribal art, her tableau suggests the social and sexual tensions at work in a country where women are still subject to indiscriminate abuse
At Bose Pacia Modern in Chelsea, Talha Rathore, a Pakistan-born artist living in New York, has a series of paintings done soon after 9/11 and in an atmosphere of incipient anti-Muslim sentiment. Using images from traditional Rajput painting but executed on New York City subway maps, Ms. Rathore explores what it is likely to be a Muslim visitor navigating an American culture in which she is suddenly, and irrationally, the enemy.
In the process, she raises issues about the interaction of art, life and politics that are similar to those brought out by the artists drawing together in the Met's Near Eastern galleries this month, which are also found embedded in the history of much of the work that makes up Asia Week in New York.

HEADLINE: Fourth-Quarter Output Declined to a 1.4% Pace 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27 

 BODY:
The economy slowed toward the end of last year, the Commerce Department said today.
 The gross domestic product rose in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 1.4 percent after increasing 4 percent in the third quarter, the department said in its final snapshot of fourth-quarter growth. 
For the year, the economy grew 2.4 percent. 
The modest fourth-quarter reading on the gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in the United States -- was unchanged from a preliminary report released a month ago.
"We sort of stand on the edge of recession," Jan Hatzius, a Goldman, Sachs economist, said, adding that some sort of shock could send the economy into a slump.
Consumer spending rose at a 1.7 percent pace in the final three months of 2002, down from the 4.2 percent gain in the third quarter, reflecting a big drop in auto sales.
In addition, exports plunged and imports rose. The widening trade gap shaved 1.59 percentage points from G.D.P. growth.
Still, there were bright spots.Business investment spending increased 2.3 percent, its first gain since the third quarter of 2000, with spending on equipment and software up for a third consecutive quarter.
A solid revival in capital expenditures is considered crucial for any broad-based recovery.
The Commerce Department said after-tax corporate profits rose 4.1 percent in the quarter, the largest gain since the final quarter of 1999.
A separate report from the Labor Department said first-time claims for jobless benefits fell to 402,000 last week from a revised 427,000 the week before. Wall Street economists had expected claims at a higher level, but they said that a figure over 400,000 was not much to celebrate.
The number of workers remaining on the benefit rolls inched lower.

HEADLINE: HealthSouth Inquiry Expands to Medicare 

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 27 

 BODY:
Federal officials are investigating whether executives at HealthSouth used the illegal accounting scheme that has rocked the company as a means of cheating Medicare out of tens of millions of dollars or more, people involved in the case said today.
 The investigation of possible manipulation of Medicare reimbursements is a new front in the inquiry into the accounting scandal at HealthSouth, which was set in motion last week when a company executive admitted to participating for years in the scheme with HealthSouth's top officers. Ultimately, it has the potential of transforming the case from a fairly routine accounting scandal into an unparalleled fraud, with bogus revenue leading to the creation of fake assets that were then transformed into additional revenue. 
 The inquiry, which is preliminary, could raise doubts about the true financial performance of HealthSouth's hospitals and health care facilities, which would have filed the documents seeking reimbursement from Medicare. The value of those facilities is certain to play a significant role in the resolution of the financial crisis at HealthSouth, the nation's largest operator of rehabilitation hospitals. 
The possible interplay between the accounting scheme and a Medicare fraud is a result of rules that govern reimbursements from federal health care programs. Indeed, people involved in the case said, the accounting fraud was structured in a way that would have potentially allowed HealthSouth to obtain a significant reimbursement benefit from the scheme.
According to court documents, HealthSouth falsified revenue items involving payments it receives from insurers. Afterward, it created a corresponding entry on its balance sheets, mostly by adding to its accounts for property, plants and equipment. Some of those additions were then allocated to company hospitals and other health care facilities, according to court records and people involved in the case.
Investigators are looking into whether the hospitals and health care facilities then filed for reimbursement from Medicare for expenses associated with the suspect plant and equipment assets and other questionable accounting entries. In effect, the hospitals and health care facilities may have converted suspect assets into increased Medicare reimbursements -- unless they specifically removed the expenses associated with the assets from their filings with the government.
Peter Ashkenaz, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred questions about HealthSouth to the Justice Department, which did not comment. Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for HealthSouth, declined to comment.
People involved in the case said the investigation of the potential Medicare reimbursement scheme remained secondary to the larger accounting fraud case, which is being handled by the United States attorney's office in Birmingham with assistance from the Justice Department's fraud division. The Atlanta office of the Securities and Exchange Commission is also participating in that inquiry.
Prosecutors in the accounting case have already obtained guilty pleas from two former senior officers of HealthSouth, who admitted to participating in the accounting conspiracy. They are Weston L. Smith, a former chief financial officer, and William T. Owens, who served in the same job until today. In their pleas, both men said that they participated in the accounting conspiracy with the company's chief executive, Richard M. Scrushy, as well as other executives, including members of the company's accounting staff. Mr. Scrushy has not been charged in the case, but he has been placed on administrative leave by the company.
As a result of his guilty plea Wednesday, Mr. Owens, who had been on administrative leave, was dismissed. However, today he continued to serve as a director; under the rules governing corporate boards, Mr. Owens can only be removed from the board if he resigns or is voted out by shareholders.
The inquiry into HealthSouth's reimbursements from Medicare is not the first time the company has been investigated for potential abuses of the federal health care program. Last May, the Justice Department joined in a suit brought by a corporate whistle-blower contending that HealthSouth improperly billed the government for providing one-on-one treatment to patients by licensed physical therapists. The suit said the patients were instead often treated in large groups, often by unlicensed individuals. 
The area under examination in the new inquiry is part of what was once an obscure part of the federal health care system known as the cost-reporting system. At the foundation of the systemis the concept that health care facilities face costs for treating Medicare patients, like building hospital rooms, that otherwise might not have been incurred and that are not paid for through reimbursement for treatment. As a result, the government reimburses health care concerns for part of the costs of those facilities, based on the proportion of use by Medicare patients.
This cost-reporting system became the centerpiece of an investigation in the late 1990's, when federal officials discovered what they said was sweeping fraud at the company then known as the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the largest hospital operator in the country. The government accused Columbia/HCA of fraudulently misrepresenting hospital-based expenses to transform nonreimbursable costs into reimbursable ones, or to identify expenses that were paid at a low rate as costs that were reimbursed at higher rates under Medicare.
Some local Columbia/HCA hospital operators were ultimately convicted of fraud, although their case was thrown out on appeal.
Last year, the company, now known as HCA, settled the civil case related to the cost-reporting allegations, agreeing to pay $880 million in fines and penalties.
The circumstances surrounding the HealthSouth inquiry differ substantially from those at Columbia. Columbia involved expenses that were actually incurred but improperly identified. At HealthSouth, the government is trying to determine whether artificial expenses were created and run through the system.
Moreover, the Columbia case often involved actions by local hospital administrators; in the case of HealthSouth, because the accounting fraud was directed from some of the highest reaches of the company, local hospitals would have little way of knowing whether they were submitting claims for false expenses.
According to documents filed in the accounting case, the HealthSouth accounting fraud largely involved manipulation of what is known as contractual adjustment -- the difference between gross charges to patients and the amount that a company expects to be reimbursed by insurers. Accounting principles generally require any increase in revenue or reduction in expenses to be matched with an increase in assets or a reduction in liabilities. As a result, the manipulation of the contractual adjustments resulted in huge -- and artificial -- increases in the company's assets, according to court documents.
Those adjustments most frequently found their way into what is known as the property, plant and equipment account -- an asset account that is known among cost-reporting experts as something of a financial honey pot. As of the second quarter of 2002, of the $1.5 billion in artificial assets listed on the company's balance sheet as a result of the accounting fraud, at least $1 billion of them found their way into the property, plant and equipment account, according to court documents.
Participants in the scheme allocated certain portions of the bogus assets to hospitals and health care facilities, often in a manner intended to avoid raising suspicions among the company's accountants, the court filings said. Such assets in turn could generate related noncash expenses, like depreciation.
Ultimately, unless hospital administrators specifically removed the costs from their filings with the government, those expenses would filter through to Medicare, which in turn would pay its proportional share of such costs at a predetermined rate. Medicare accounted for just under a third of the company's revenue, according to company filings.

HEADLINE: An Uprising in Albany, Almost 

 BODY:
Albany's Bermuda Triangle -- those three-man huddles where the democratic process disappears behind closed doors -- briefly lost a leg this week as Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, came up with a way to fix the state's cash crisis without first getting the governor on board. It was a welcome display of action that contrasted sharply with Gov. George Pataki's determined disengagement from reality in addressing the state's $11.5 billion budget shortfall. 
 The governor has been at odds with legislators of both parties since he made his budget proposal, which slashed $1.2 billion from education, foisting on localities the burden of keeping schools running, and cut $1 billion in the growth of Medicaid, threatening the financial health of hospitals in the state. Governor Pataki ruled out any "job-killing taxes," but he appeared to be daring the legislators to reinstate some of the spending and take the heat for tax increases needed to pay the bill. The only thing all parties agree on is that, as in past years, the April 1 budget deadline will not be met. 
 But legislators have a more immediate dilemma: a gap in the current year's budget and the very real possibility that the state could run out of cash next week without an infusion of money. Mr. Bruno, a Republican, and Mr. Silver, a Democrat, are as much natural allies as a cobra and a mongoose. But with Mr. Pataki focused elsewhere, they produced a compromise that would have the state borrow $4.2 billion, $700 million immediately, against money expected from New York's share of the tobacco suit settlement. Mr. Silver initially opposed tapping the tobacco funds, which have been targeted to help finance health care, but relented after it was agreed that the borrowing would be guaranteed by personal income tax revenues. That compromise would protect funds for health care while offering cheaper debt servicing for the state. Further, none of the tobacco money will be available until a final budget is passed, something that would seem to ensure some attention from the governor.
Mr. Pataki has made it clear that at the top of his agenda these days -- apparently to the detriment of other matters, including budgetary -- is supporting the war effort and helping to prevent terrorism in the state. While guarding New Yorkers' safety is urgently important, so is solving a financial crisis with crushing, long-term implications. The governor needs to be part of the solution.

 Mr. Myantakyi looked across Church Street at the World Trade Center, and there was the jet. "It was blue and white," he recalled, "and I stared with disbelief as it moved right into that building. I saw the smoke. I thought, 'Just like 1993.' And then came the sirens. And that, too, was just like 1993." 
 It seemed to be Mr. Myantakyi's fate to be on duty whenever terrorists attacked the twin towers. 
The hotel has been closed for 18 months. In that time, Mr. Myantakyi, 42, and many other Millenium veterans have not been able to find work. 
But at last, he and most of the 360 former employees are coming back to the nearly reconstructed hotel, which is on track for a May 5 ribbon cutting. 
"I'm not sure how I'll feel, to be outside in the same place," Mr. Myantakyi said on a recent afternoon at the hotel, "to be rehashing everything again and again. I get very emotional about it. There is no way I can tell how I'll feel till I'm out there in uniform again."
About 150 of the employees were on duty on Sept. 11, 2001, and the hotel had about 650 guests. Thanks to a quick evacuation, not a single guest or hotel worker was lost inside the Millenium. But 12 guests who went across the street to the twin towers never returned. 
Most of the hotel employees have been out of work ever since the attack, because of the economic downturn. About 90 percent of them have agreed to come back.
"I just can't wait until everyone is here," said Leonard Williams, 55, who did cleaning and maintenance work. "We old-timers are calling it our second opening," he said, because -- like Mr. Myantakyi -- he was on hand when the hotel opened on June 10, 1992. "But this will be more emotional than the first one." 
The Millenium -- at 58 stories, one of New York's tallest hotels -- is owned by City Developments Limited and managed by the Hilton Hotels Corporation. It stretches along Church Street from Fulton Street south to Dey Street.
Unlike the Marriott World Trade Center Hotel, to the west of the south tower, the Millenium survived the terrorist attacks. Although the hotel did not suffer major structural damage, two-thirds of its glass front was broken or damaged beyond repair. 
Roger Swadish, a Boston-based Hilton operations vice president who acted as the managing director of the Millenium after that day, went back inside it two days after the towers fell. "I was in shock at first," he said, "to see the fire, the smoke, the damage to the hotel." 
Because of the toxic contaminants from the disaster, "we had to take the entire hotel down to the drywall," Mr. Swadish said. 
The reconstruction cost $31 million, according to Mr. Swadish. Returning guests will be comforted by the same -- now sanitized -- Brazilian lacquered rosewood in the lobby, and 565 rooms that have been rebuilt and redecorated. 
For the reunited employees, it has been a time of reconnection and recollection. "So many of us bonded in 1992, when we opened the hotel," said Beverly Tomlinson, 54, a cleaning attendant. "Then we all shared the attack in 1993. So many people came out of the smoke into our lobby -- they were frightened and crying. I'll never forget the sooty faces. After that experience, the staff was one big family." 
So, for many of the workers, the 2001 attack seemed at first to be a replay.
"The lights flickered in 2001 just like they did when the bomb went off in 1993," Mr. Williams said. "I had a flashback."
Eric Brown, 32, a house runner who brought guests towels and toiletries, said that when he saw the trade center on fire, "my first reaction was to run over to the buildings and help somebody." But, he said, "the police kept people away." 
Upstairs, in the third-floor restaurant, the morning manager, Ly Tien, 25, "saw the debris coming down like confetti."
"I realized that it was time for an evacuation," she said. She guided the guests out, helped by the chef and the room service manager.
Meanwhile, Ms. Tomlinson said, 50 room attendants were up on the hotel floors.
"Some guests thought they wanted to stay, so the ladies and security had to coax them to come down," she said. That probably saved lives when the towers collapsed and the hotel's glass facade imploded. 
One of the guests was a pilot who left his hand-held aviation radio in his hotel room. Initially, another guest, an Egyptian student, was suspected of owning the radio and using it to communicate with the terrorists, but all charges against him were dropped. He subsequently sued the hotel in a case that is pending.
Down in the lobby, Ray Burgos, 37, now the human resources manager at the hotel, tried "to persuade people not to go outside, where they might be injured," he said. Early on, he commandeered a cart of clean laundry and began handing out towels to the dazed, dirty and sometimes bloody trade center survivors. 
Many of them needed water. "But we didn't have enough water pitchers," Mr. Burgos said, "so we dumped liquor out of the bottles in the lobby bar, filled them with water and gave them to people in need. One guy said: 'What kind of water is this? It tastes like Scotch!' " He drank it anyway. 
The hotel staff was spared none of the horrors of the day.
"When I saw the people jumping, I was praying to God," Mr. Williams said. "And then they began hitting the wooden concert platform in the plaza, where I used to see the concerts they had. It was horrible. I cried like a baby." 
After the towers collapsed, the uniformed hotel employees made their way home as best they could. "All our credit cards, ID's and house keys were in our lockers," Mr. Brown said. "I had my I.R.S. refund check for $300 in my locker. I was going to cash it that day. Instead, it was stuck in my locker for months." 
Only 60 of the employees were able to find jobs in other Hilton hotels, because tourism had dropped off and the chain was cutting back. 
Ms. Tien found work as the manager of a vegetarian restaurant. When that job ended, she realized that she felt "out of it," she recalled. "I was freaking out because of the memories -- the bleeding and helpless people that I could not help."
Spontaneously, she took a trip to Hawaii, "and when I got back I was O.K." 
Mr. Williams looked for work unsuccessfully for five months, and then he ran out of unemployment benefits in July. "I thank God for my wife and my son for getting me through this," he said. 
All the employees kept their health benefits because labor and management agreed to alternate in paying the cost, month by month. So far this has cost the company more than $1 million. But Mr. Swadish, the Hilton operations vice president, said, "We wanted our core team back." 
The gesture has also tapped the resources of the New York Hotel Trades Council, the umbrella organization of unions that represents about 25,000 workers. According to Peter Ward, the council's president, since the trade center attack it has spent $2 million, because it also helped cover the medical benefit expenses of 400 surviving workers from the Marriott World Trade Center and 100 from the nearby Embassy Suites Hotel, which has reopened. 
On its last day of operation, the Millenium's average room rate was $325 a night. When it reopens, its rooms will average about $200 a night for the first months, "since we know that a lot of our old customers have gone to our competition, and we'd like to get them back," Mr. Swadish said. 
Although many of the rooms will offer a spectacular view of ground-zero reconstruction, Mr. Swadish said the hotel's new advertising would not mention this. 
"We have a great sensitivity about looking as if we're exploiting the situation," he said. "But obviously, we are very proud of having been here, and of having survived. And we are very proud to be coming back."

HEADLINE: Japan Puts Deregulation to Big Test 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 27 

 BODY:
It is the biggest test yet of the Japanese way of deregulation: "market-opening," "money-saving" measures that actually introduce only a limited amount of competition while leaving almost everything important just the way it was. So it will probably be with Japan Post, a new public corporation, that will replace the government-run Postal Services Agency on April 1.
 The post office is a much bigger actor in the economy than the U.S. Postal Service is in the United States, and it is not broken. Mail delivery is highly reliable, and the savings and insurance programs it runs -- the world's largest piggy bank -- provide a safe and popular shelter for consumers who are worried about leaving money in Japan's shaky commercial banks. 
 But with Japan's national budget deficit yawning ever wider, lawmakers are trying to turn as many bureaucracies as they can into freestanding companies with a more limited and indirect claim on the public purse, and few look riper than Japan Post.
Supporters of the new deregulated corporate structure say it will open the post office's books to more public scrutiny and to management by professional executives recruited from private industry instead of career bureaucrats. They say it will have a freer hand to cut costs and introduce new services. 
"We want to create a self-supporting system that allows us autonomy and flexibility," said Masaharu Ikuta, the president of Japan Post and former chairman of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, a shipping company in Japan. "Of course, our workers are public servants, but we will be managed like a private company."
Other countries have cut their postal services loose from the state, with mixed results. Germany took Deutsche Post public in 2000, and while the stock has performed poorly, the company has been profitable and is expanding overseas; its Netherlands-based private courier subsidiary, DHL Worldwide Express, made an offer this week to buy Airborne. New Zealand, with a much smaller population, made its post office an autonomous but still state-owned business in the 1990's and opened mail delivery to competition, but service has deteriorated. In Britain, the loss-plagued Royal Mail Group is being reorganized.
The Postal Service in the United States also runs chronic deficits -- more than $1 billion in each of the last two fiscal years -- and the Bush administration set up a commission in December to seek ways to streamline its operations, battle rising costs and reverse the decline in letter volume.
Having seen deregulation falter overseas, Japan Post is cautious about leaving the state's nest. Like most postal agencies, it clings to its mission of providing universal service, with mailboxes nationwide and uniform domestic postal rates regardless of distance -- a policy that is popular in politically powerful districts in the countryside and that effectively excludes new entrants from the most lucrative part of the market, delivering ordinary business mail. 
Private delivery companies are instead focusing on next-day express mail and other special services, much as they do in the United States. 
Competition aside, Japan Post is looking to wring savings from a business that is notorious for inefficiencies. Experts have been called in from Toyota Motor (Toyota's chairman, Hiroshi Okuda, sits on the Japan Post board) to introduce just-in-time techniques to mail-carrying. Mr. Ikuta's team may also lengthen business hours at post offices and automated teller machines, and has already struck deals with convenience stores to sell stamps. 
Mr. Ikuta, who won praise for reviving Mitsui O.S.K., has so far sidestepped questions about how he planned to tackle the biggest cost of all, the payroll. As in the United States, Germany and elsewhere, full-time postal workers in Japan have the same civil-service protections as government employees and are extremely difficult to lay off. Japan Post, with 290,000 employees, has been trying to gain flexibility through attrition, replacing full-time workers who quit or retire with cheaper and less protected part-time employees. 
Japan Post has set goals of trimming 32 billion yen ($267 million) from labor costs over the next four years and introducing merit-based pay, moves that analysts called mild for an organization its size. Yet even these plans have rattled labor unions into opposition. 
"We feel threatened by the formation of the public corporation," said Kazuhiro Sudo, an organizer at Zenrokyo, a network of postal labor unions. "Japan Post officials are starting to use the word reform. We are worried that bosses will use the evaluation system to push workers out." 
Deregulating the post office is a more sensitive proposition than the country's two previous giant privatizations -- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and the subdivided national railway -- because of the huge role the post office plays in the nation's finances. The system's savings and insurance programs manage 335 trillion yen ($2.8 trillion) in customers' assets, one-quarter of the country's total savings.
For decades, the post office has invested most of this money in special government bonds that financed public-works projects and a web of organizations that critics say are little more than patronage mills and sinecures for retired bureaucrats. Lawmakers from Mr. Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party, which depends on support from rural districts, also note that the post office is the only financial institution in many small towns.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi floated a far-reaching proposal last summer that would have split the post office into three businesses, but he backed away from the idea after a public showdown with conservative lawmakers. Instead, the government plans to relax the restrictions on how Japan Post invests, permitting the company to put some money in the hands of outside asset managers to help increase returns, a big concern with interest rates near zero. Later, Japan Post will be allowed to start including more stocks in its portfolio. 
But it will still have to keep at least three-quarters of its assets in government bonds, meaning that lawmakers will still have captive financing for the national deficit and for their pet projects, and the nation's banks and insurers will still have the post office as a competitor.
"If the government were serious about changing the post office and deregulating the savings and insurance programs, the bond market would collapse," said Akio Mikuni, who runs an independent credit agency. "So nothing will change."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE IRAQI CAPITAL; 
Iraqi Defense Chief Vows Fight, Predicting Baghdad Clash in Days

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 27 

 BODY:
Iraq's defense minister said today that American forces could encircle "great parts of Baghdad" in as little as 5 to 10 days, but that the ensuing battle could last as long as two months, perhaps longer, with paramilitary groups loyal to Saddam Hussein joining regular troops to mount a street-by-street defense of this city of five million people. 
 "For us, Baghdad will become the cemetery where the enemy will be buried," the defense minister, Gen. Sultan Hashim, said at a news conference. "God willing, we will teach the United States and the British and their allies a lesson they will never forget." 
 The warning came as American aircraft resumed their attacks on Baghdad with some of the heaviest strikes of the eight-day-old war. Sorties throughout the day were followed, around midnight, with explosions of such momentous power that the entire city shook. Car alarms were set off as far as 10 miles from the blasts, and mosques, on Saddam Hussein's orders, began their nightly ritual of amplified calls to God. 
"Allah u Akbar! Allah u Akbar!" -- "God is Great -- the muezzins cried plaintively deep into the night, in the words of the most sacred of Muslim prayers. 
After the trembling of the ground, and reverberations that ran like shivers through the concrete frame of the Palestine Hotel about a mile from the blasts across the Tigris river, the city fell silent again for 5, sometimes 10 or 15 minutes. 
Then there were more roars from the engines of cruise missiles as they streaked low across the city for 30 or 40 seconds, more blasts, and more satanic bursts of flame, followed by huge clouds of dust and smoke drifting down the river on the night wind. 
The impacts appeared to be concentrated on the west bank of the river in the city center, site of many of the buildings considered central to Mr. Hussein's power. Pentagon officials said the targets included command-and-control centers as well as telecommunications hubs.
Bombs and missiles last Friday night struck mostly totemic targets, including two of Mr. Hussein's favorite palaces, the massive blocklike building housing his presidential office, and Republican Guard quarters. 
Any certainty about which buildings were struck tonightawaited dawn, when Western reporters moving about the city under government guide would have their first opportunity to look for newly blasted structures in the heavily guarded compounds where the most secret agencies work. 
On Wednesday night, the Pentagon demonstrated a new focus when it scored a direct hit on a telecommunications building, depriving Mr. Hussein's government of landline telephone service.
The site lay immediately adjacent to the tallest building in Iraq, the 700-foot high Saddam Tower, which appeared to suffer only shattered windows at its base. The tower, with a bulblike structure at mid-level that houses a popular restaurant, became a symbol of Mr. Hussein's defiance when it was destroyed by an American missile strike in the Persian Gulf war of 1991, then rebuilt with a statue of Mr. Hussein at its base. 
The platform supporting the statue features a scattering of American missile fragments. Bronze medallions of the first President Bush and Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, are embedded at the statue's feet. Wedding parties routinely stop at the statue, seemingly for the purpose of reaffirming the loyalty of newlyweds and their families to Mr. Hussein. 
Only days before the new war began, a Sudanese elevator operator in the tower inquired nervously of visiting Westerners whether the needlelike structure was likely to be destroyed again. But this time, Pentagon targeters succeeded in sparing the tower even as they struck the blocklike building of about 10 stories that sits perhaps 100 to 150 feet awayto the tower's side, housing a key telephone exchanges. 
At daybreak, telephones across much of the western side of the city had gone dead, and the shattered telecommunications structure was a hollowed-out shell, with great steel panels and other interior fittings petalled outward by the blast from about the sixth floor down to the ground.
One building that reported having lost its phones was Al Rashid, the most favored of the city's five-star hotels in normal times, but largely abandoned in the past week after warnings from the Pentagon that a potential target, a telecommunications node, was buried deep beneath the hotel. 
For the people of Baghdad, the intensified bombing added to mounting anxieties about what lies ahead. Only a little more than a week after the first missile strike, failed to kill Mr. Hussein and other top leaders, American troops and armor have traveled more than 200 miles across the desert from Kuwait, to forward positions between the Euphrates and the Tigris that lie as little as 50 miles from Baghdad.
On Thursday night, 1,000 more American troops parachuted onto a Kurdish-controlled airfield about 200 miles north of Baghdad, opening a northern front to draw pressure off American troops in the south.
For Mr. Hussein's government, the vise is tightening, on the ground and from the air. But the closer the might of the American ground troops approaches to Baghdad, and the more intense the city's bombing, the more Mr. Hussein and top officials profess to be ready -- eager, even -- for a climactic showdown with America. On its face, any matchup between two nations with such vastly different military and economic resources might seem, at least to all but the most zealous of Mr. Hussein's associates, like a chronicle foretold.
But the defense minister's remarks tonight, and similar pronouncements in recent days, convey a sense that Mr. Hussein and his inner circle believe that the United States has made a catastrophic mistake in underestimating Iraq's ability to strike back. 
The message from the Mr. Hashim, the defense minister, was that Iraq has been content from the start to wait for American troops to march north -- harassing American columns as they flank cities like Basra, Nasariya, Samawa, Najaf and Karbala, ambushing, capturing and killing American soldiers as opportunities arise -- until the moment when they arrive at the gates of Baghdad. 
At his news conference, General Hashim adopted the tone of a military professional as he ran through a detailed briefing on the war so far, as viewed by Iraq. As a veteran of Iraq's eight-year war with Iran in the 1980's, he is regarded by many Iraqis as a more reliable voice on the progress of the current fighting than the political elite around Mr. Hussein, who have a habit of falling quickly into the vengeful polemics about "villains" and "criminals" favored by the Iraqi leader.
For the second time in five days, General Hashim appeared in a hotel conference room, with a staff officer directing a pointer at red stickers on a large military map. By the general's account, American officers have shaded the truth, understating the severity of the challenge they have met from the Iraqis at every encounter since the first American troops moved into Iraq before dawn last Thursday. 
General Hashim went town by town, at some points even junction by junction, bridge by bridge, telling of Iraq's success in harassing the American battalions. He mocked American and British assertions that coalition troops have been in control of the port of Umm Qasr, on the Kuwait border, saying they have never advanced beyond the docks, and hold no part of the town. 
His account of the battles at Fao, Basra, Nasiriya, Samawa and Najaf were a litany of the "enemy" pushing forward, then being driven back, losing vehicles and men in virtually every major encounter.
"The enemy seems to lose trust in himself, and the whole world can see how Western leaders have deceived themselves," he said. "If you go back five or six days to look at their pronouncements before the aggression began, they were giving various predictions of a war lasting five, six, seven or perhaps eight days. Now, they are talking of a much longer war. After Umm Qasr and Fao and Nasiriya and Samawa and Najaf, you can see for yourself how those pronouncements have changed." 
The minister acknowledged Iraqi losses in the battles, and implied without giving figures that they have been heavy, especially under heavy American bombing. But he said Iraq had ample reserves of fighters, and that, in any case, American officers exaggerated the losses sustained when heavy bombers are sent to pound front-line troops.
But mainly, his argument was that Iraq has successfully exploited several advantages in the fighting, by using irregular troops who have been able to ambush the Americans and surprise them in other ways, and by its fighters' knowledge of their home terrain, and their reliance on simpler weaponry. 
He drew an analogy to an uprising among Iraqi tribesmen against British troops occupying Iraq after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. "In the 1920 uprising, Iraqis threw out the British with very primitive weapons," he said. "And now, the level of our weapons compared with the enemy's are well known. But God willing, we, too, will throw our enemies out of Iraq." 
The crux of the war, though, he said, would be the battle for Baghdad. He conceded, in effect, that the American columns pushing north would eventually push past Iraqi units and reach Baghdad. "Our defenses are set to defend Baghdad, so we won't be surprised if in 5 or 10 days the enemy will be encircling great parts of Baghdad," he said. "Up to now, he has been able to bypass the towns along the way and go on into the desert, but in the end he will have to attack Baghdad. The important thing is, whether he reaches Baghdad today or tomorrow, he will have paid a very high price already. And our policy will remain what it has been from the start -- to minimize our own losses and inflict maximum casualties."
Once the battle lines are set outside the capital, the minister said, the American forces would be confronted by a large defensive force of Republican Guard divisions, augmented by irregular units. The struggle for the capital could continue, he said, "for 10 days, or two months, or even more," with intensive street fighting, but eventual victory would lie with the Iraqis. "As you know, Baghdad is the capital of an ancient civilization," he said. "We Iraqis inherited this history from our forefathers. Anybody who seeks to usurp this inheritance will be inviting God's wrath. So I can assure you that Baghdad will be impenetrable for the Americans and the British, for as long as any sons of the city remain alive."

HEADLINE: Coffin Maker In Syracuse Is Shut Down; 315 Jobs Lost 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, March 27 

 BODY:
After 131 years of making coffins, the Marsellus Casket Company will close over the next month, leaving 315 workers without jobs. 
 The closing, announced today by Service Corporation International, the coffin maker's troubled parent company, left workers stunned and local union and government officials angry. 
 "We feel like we've been stabbed in the back," said Bob Tompkins, representative for Service Employees International Union Local 200, which represents about 270 workers at Marsellus plants in Syracuse and nearby DeWitt. 
Though the company is guarded about the names of those buried in its coffins, those it does acknowledge include Harry S. Truman, Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, Hubert H. Humphrey and Nelson A. Rockefeller, Vince Lombardi and Cardinal Terrence Cooke.
Workers learned of the closing on Wednesday when managers handed out paychecks a day early, canceled the second shift and told workers to attend a meeting this morning, Mr. Tompkins said. A construction crew then arrived and began boarding up the Syracuse factory. 
Syracuse's mayor, Matthew J. Driscoll, and the Onondaga County executive, Nicholas J. Pirro, met this morning with senior Service Corporation officials.
"This is completely outrageous," Mayor Driscoll said. "They never approached the state, the county or the city about how we could help." 
Stephen M. Mack, senior vice president for eastern operations of Service Corporation, which is based in Houston, said the company had conducted an analysis that showed Marsellus Casket Company could not remain competitive without its parent spending significantly to modernize the plant and develop a distribution network to replace the third-party system now being used.
"We could not justify that investment," said Mr. Mack, who declined to give cost figures but acknowledged that the parent company "did not actively pursue" help from the state or local governments. 
Mr. Mack said that Service Corporation did contact other parties about buying Marsellus Casket but found no interest. He said, however, that Service Corporation was selling Marsellus's patents, copyrights and name to Batesville Casket Company of Indiana, which is one of Marsellus's chief rivals and describes itself as the leading builder of metal and hardwood caskets. 
Mr. Mack declined to disclose the purchase price. Batesville officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment about their plans for the Marsellus name. 
The company was founded in Syracuse in 1872 by John Marsellus and became known for its handcrafted hardwood coffins. 
On the strength of second- and third-generation workers, Marsellus operated as a family-owned business until 1997, when it was acquired by Service Corporation International. Service Corporation owns more than 3,000 funeral homes, cemeteries and crematories and says it is the largest provider of funeral, cremation and cemetery services in North America. 
"We know about Marsellus's long history and tradition," Mr. Mack said. "This was an extremely difficult decision. It's just unfortunate that the business landscape in our industry has changed." 
While the number of deaths in North America has been flat, more people are choosing cremation rather than more costly burial services, Service Corporation officials say.
Service Corporation has also had fiscal and legal problems of its own. Two of its cemeteries in Florida have been accused of having bodies removed from plots and more recently deceased ones replace them. Lawsuits by family members are pending in those cases. 
Service Corporation has also reported losing $232 million in 2002 and nearly $600 million in 2001.

HEADLINE: United and Pilots' Union Reach Tentative Agreement 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
United Airlines reached a tentative agreement with its pilots' union yesterday, its most critical labor union. The six-year deal would allow United to proceed with plans for a separate low-fare airline, officials involved in the negotiations said.
 The agreement, which United said is worth $1.1 billion a year, is the first deal it has reached with a major union. Industry analysts said the deal was a breakthrough in the often tempestuous talks between labor and management at United, which is based in Chicago. 
 United, a unit of UAL, filed for Chapter 11 protection in December. It has been seeking a total of $2.56 billion in concessions from labor so that it can emerge from bankruptcy and keep flying.
Analysts said the agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents United's 8,800 pilots, was an initial victory for United's chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton. Mr. Tilton, who joined the airline last September, has insisted that United needs to start a carrier, apart from its main operations, to compete with more efficient airlines like Southwest and JetBlue.
The deal "gives us the guidance we need" to set the plan in motion, a United executive said yesterday. A spokesman for the pilots' union would not comment.
United wants to shift 30 percent of its operations to the new airline with a working name of Starfish. Employees of the new airline would be paid lower wages, receive a smaller benefit package and work under less restrictive work rules. The airline would assume many of United's domestic routes from outlying cities to its hubs in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles, flying Airbus jets. The venture would require approval from all of United's five big labor groups.
Until yesterday, United's pilots' union had bitterly opposed the idea, saying it was more important for United to concentrate on streamlining its traditional operations. But United held the upper hand in the discussions, said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
"It's a very dramatic change," Professor Chaison said. "You could call it a momentous change, because airline unions have fought this tremendously. To give in on an economic issue and a symbolic issue shows the desperation of the unions to try to save their jobs." 
Word of the contract lifted some of the gloom surrounding the airline that had been worsened by the outbreak of the war. "If this is ratified, there is no way United liquidates," a United banker said yesterday.
Last week, United filed a motion in United States Bankruptcy Court in Chicago seeking to void its labor agreements and impose its own pay scales and rules, if it could not reach deals with its unions. A hearing on its motion is set for April 14. United has said it must put the concessions in place by May 1 to comply with covenants of $1.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing.
Neither United nor the union would give specific details of the agreement; voting on it is set to be concluded by April 11. But both referred to the low-fare carrier in statements issued after the tentative deal was struck. Mr. Tilton, in comments released by United, called the agreement "a huge step" in helping the airline emerge from Chapter 11.
"This breakthrough agreement is a significant step forward in making the hard changes necessary to reposition United to compete more effectively both immediately and over the long term," Mr. Tilton said.
He continued, "This agreement helps provide the flexibility United needs to strengthen our business, compete where we choose, and become a resilient, profitable company that can offer stable jobs on a sustainable basis."
Paul Whiteford, a captain who is chairman of the master executive council for the pilots' union at United, said the agreement would make United a "more effective competitor" against both traditional and low-fare carriers.
Mr. Whiteford said the company and the union "will continue to work together to ensure that United's operations remain competitive in every market United serves, including markets served by the company's no-frills, low-fare competition." 
United is continuing talks with other unions, including flight attendants and mechanics. A spokeswoman for the flight attendants' union, Sara Dela Cruz, said yesterday that the union was committed to helping United successfully restructure.
Joseph Tiberi, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents the mechanics, said his union would like to conclude talks quickly. "There's no advantage to anyone in dragging this process out any further," Mr. Tiberi said. 
The machinists' union, however, filed suit against United on Wednesday, seeking to block its plans to lay off 1,148 mechanics at its Indianapolis maintenance base. It contended United had used the war in Iraq as a pretext to shut the site, which is considered to be a technological showplace. But United said the layoffs were allowed under its contract, which provides for furloughs without pay in the event of an emergency, like war. The laid-off workers would keep benefits and seniority.
United's creditors' committee, meanwhile, sent letters to Congressional leaders and the White House yesterday, supporting efforts for a federal bailout package to help the airlines. "Failure to offer immediate war-related relief to United and this industry as it restructures for a new era of global competition will jeopardize the future of commercial air travel," the committee's letter said. The 15-member committee includes 3 union representatives, as well as representatives from Airbus and United's lenders.
Professor Chaison said the efforts to win federal help put more pressure on United's unions to reach deals. "They have to impress a bankruptcy court and the federal government that they're taking dramatic action for a turnaround," he said.

HEADLINE: Mayor Wants Unions to Merge Benefit Funds to Economize 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration is proposing that city unions merge their 104 separate benefit funds, which finance prescriptions and dental and optical services, to save the city more than $100 million a year.
 As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg threatens layoffs and urges the unions to agree to $600 million in labor savings, some mayoral aides see consolidating the benefit funds as perhaps the most painless way to achieve substantial savings. 
 These aides say a merger of the funds, which get $769 million each year from the city, could result in large savings every year by reducing redundant administrative costs and by creating a giant benefit fund that could bargain for better deals with drug and optical companies. In addition, several officials said, merging the funds would go far to reduce corruption involving some of the funds. 
"If you could provide the same services at less cost to the beneficiaries, then that money, if returned to the city, could save the city $50 million to $150 million a year," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director. "Any part of the $600 million that we can get from negotiating with the unions will mitigate other actions that we may be forced to take."
The municipal unions, which represent 300,000 city workers, have mixed reactions to the consolidation proposal. Some union leaders say they fear that a one-size-fits-all benefit fund would take away some benefits their members now receive. But other union leaders praise the idea, confident that it would give their members a better deal on prescription drugs through greater purchasing power.
"If consolidating the funds creates economies of scale and can increase or at least not diminish benefits, then I'm certainly open to the idea," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates bargaining for all municipal unions.
The benefit funds were created in the 1960's as the product of labor negotiations between the city and its unions. The city's labor contracts require it to contribute $1,475 on average per year for each of the more than 500,000 active and retired municipal workers.
Some unions use the funds not only for prescription drugs and dental services but also for life insurance, legal services and scholarships. Some even use the funds to provide bail for arrested union members. The benefit funds are financed and administered independently of pension and health insurance funds.
"The potential appears to be there for savings," said James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner. "It's something that should be looked at, but you have to be very cautious before you step into this area."
Ms. Weingarten said her union would like to protect one use of its benefits fund: providing 250 college scholarships to poor New York City schoolchildren. She also said District Council 37, which represents 125,000 city workers, would undoubtedly want to preserve the free legal services its members now get.
"A consolidation would not be that simple," Ms. Weingarten said. "There would have to be a meeting of the minds about what you do with all the benefits."
Lillian Roberts, District Council 37's executive director, agreed, saying: "It would be very difficult to merge them. The funds are very different and the various services they provide are different."
Some union leaders are balking at the consolidation proposal because City Hall has sent conflicting signals about what would be done with the benefit funds. One City Hall official talked about savings through economies of scale, while another talked of larger savings that could be achieved by eliminating some popular programs that he described as luxuries at a time of ballooning deficits.
Commissioner Hanley said some union presidents, with re-election in mind, were eager to have the city run a consolidated benefits fund. "They're saying, 'We're getting killed on the rising costs of drugs and our members and retirees are blaming us,' " he said. 
At the same time, city officials say they fear that if they begin running a single fund while prescription drug prices continue to skyrocket, the city will be saddled with a rapidly inflating drug bill that largely erases any savings.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: IN THE FIELD -- KIRKUK; 
Iraqis Abandon Post And Kurds Advance

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: BANI MAQAN, Iraq, March 27 

 BODY:
The first crack in Saddam Hussein's once formidable northern defense line appeared here today at this Iraqi checkpoint on the main highway into Kirkuk, a city rich in oil and strained by ethnic tensions.
 This post, formerly bristling with soldiers and Iraqi border guards who exacted bribes from travelers passing through the militarized zone, was unexpectedly abandoned this afternoon by Iraqi soldiers. 
 The soldiers had defended it since the first gulf war in 1991, when the Kurds set up an independent enclave to the north. The Iraqis left quietly, loading onto trucks and slipping quickly away.
The action came just hours after more than 1,000 American paratroopers jumped into friendly Kurdish territory in advance of the opening of a northern front. But those soldiers played no role in the Iraqi move, which occurred without a shot being fired. 
The Iraqis' departure opened the road from the Kurdish-controlled zone into Kirkuk, and Kurdish civilians and fighters streamed in behind them, beginning what appeared to be an advance on a city of roughly 600,000 that is one of the war's ultimate political and economic prizes. 
The withdrawal appeared to stop a few miles short of Kirkuk's outskirts, and for Kurds the day became both festive and ominous.
The departure provided the first tangible signs of weakness along a front where Mr. Hussein's troops have outnumbered Kurdish fighters to a degree that had almost seemed absurd. It sparked a joyous celebration outside the nearby Kurdish town of Chamchamal.
As Kurds sensed their enemy had begun to buckle under the pressure of American bombs, some men fired rifles into the sky. Others whooped. Civilians on bicycles pedaled past silent guard shacks, heading into territory claimed from an enemy they readily admit they hate. 
"Saddam Hussein is a son of a dog," declared Rakout Hamed Karim Shafi, a young smuggler. Mr. Shafi was walking along the road with a newly acquired possession, a rocket-propelled grenade he had lifted from a vacated Iraqi bunker.
But by nightfall, as Mr. Shafi displayed his weapon, there were worrisome signs that the jubilation might give way to mob rule on a front where significant numbers of American soldiers have yet to appear and civil order may be difficult to establish and maintain.
"Kirkuk is a disaster waiting to happen," said Hania Mufti, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, an independent group, which has warned that a coordinated plan is needed for Kirkuk to avoid interethnic violence and reprisal killings against Iraqi officials.
There were flashes today of disarray. As Kurdish commanders and officials said they had advanced more than seven miles into Iraqi-controlled territory, and had taken positions about four miles from withdrawing Iraqi soldiers, there were signs of looting.
Rostam Homed Rahim, the local Kurdish commander, was warning his fighters, known as pesh merga, to restrict journalists from reaching this point in the lines, saying the looting that was beginning might embarrass the Kurdish government.
It was of little use. Journalists slipped through, encountering soldiers and civilians returning to Chamchamal laden with war booty, even as others were heading in, driving empty cars or pushing empty carts. 
It seemed as if anything and everything had been deemed worth stealing, even from the meager assortment of junk the Iraqis left behind. 
Some items had military utility, including a heavy machine gun, binoculars, a kerosene lantern, and crates of ammunition or sacks of plastic water jugs. 
But other items spoke of almost gleeful grabbing of whatever could be lugged or rolled away, including furniture, ratty clothing and a newly claimed motorcycle with two flat tires. Two civilian men rolled an empty water barrel down the road, amiably chatting, businesslike, as they headed toward their village.
Many spoke quickly, almost babbling, men who seemed to be riding an adrenaline surge. 
These men are Kurds, a people who have been gassed, tortured, relocated, expelled, and executed by Mr. Hussein's military and security forces. They have long showed an almost unanimous support for war, any war, that promised to remove a president they regard as their executioner-in-chief.
They cheered the nation that had spurred the withdrawal. "U.S.A. good," said Aziz Karim, a local resident. "Very, very good."
They wandered a ghostly front. For 12 years the northern lines separating Iraq proper from the autonomous Kurdish zone have passed through this plateau, forming an advance line of trenches, bunkers and concertina wire, all reinforced by tanks and artillery the Iraqi Army has kept a few miles back.
What had lasted 12 years collapsed after just a few days of bombing. An American airstrike leveled the command bunker on this ridge yesterday morning. The bunker, ringed with antennas, was destroyed in a thunderous explosion.
Even before the narrow collapse here today, Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which controls the eastern Kurdish zone, suggested that under such attacks, the conscript Iraqi soldiers along the northern lines were in a pitiable state, wearied by a combination of recent drenching rains and American bombs.
"They suffered too much, the Iraqi Army," Mr. Talabani said. "Now they are very afraid. They are afraid to live in their trenches, and now it is raining, and they don't know where to go."
His words seemed prescient later. Within hours, as Mr. Talabani was about to enter a meeting with Zalmay Khalilzad, President Bush's special envoy to the Iraqi opposition, and Lt. Gen. Colby M. Broadwater III, a Central Command commander, he received word that Bani Maqan was changing hands.
He clutched the general's arm. "Bani Maqan has been captured," he said. "It was taken by simple people, not pesh merga." 
A guerrilla leader turned politician, Mr. Talabani beamed. 
Two moments he has worked for during much of his life -- the capture of a city he regards as Kurdish and the fall of Mr. Hussein -- seemed another step closer, and he was delivering the news to an American general.
Still, the military significance of the withdrawal was not immediately apparent. It could not be determined tonight if the withdrawal was a coordinated consolidation of Iraq's northern lines or if it was the first sign of headlong retreat.
It was also not clear if the departure reflected in any way the condition of Republican Guard units further west and south, which Kurdish officials insist have suffered heavy casualties under American bombardment, based on information they say is collected from their underground networks.
On Wednesday, American paratroopers jumped into Kurdish territory and set up a perimeter at an airfield in Harir. 
The airfield was already in the hands of Kurds, and Kurdish officials said the Army's jump was essentially a public relations exercise, and an effort to inject fear among Iraqi troops, signaling to them that American soldiers can appear any time.
American fighters were, however, believed to have played a role in the events here by directing air attacks against Iraqipositions. Kurds suggested that the air support was continuing on the road to Kirkuk, and at one point tonight the local commander warned his troops to limit their advance. 
"We have asked the American jets to bomb everything," Mr. Rahim said. "If we go there, maybe we will be bombed ourselves."

HEADLINE: French's Has an Unmentioned British Flavor 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IT'S not that easy to be a jingoist in the era of globalization.
 One suspects that the French, for example, would not care to adopt Jerry Springer -- whose TV talk show today features "Two-Timing Tales" of cheating boyfriends -- as emblematic of their culture. But Mr. Springer's show is on one boycott list these days, thanks to the fact it is within the universe controlled by Vivendi Universal, the French company that tried to imitate American capitalism and is now desperately trying to raise cash. 
 Then there is French's Mustard. A news release this week proclaimed, "The only thing French about French's Mustard is the name! Robert T. French's All-American Dream Lives On." The release waved the United States flag as vigorously as it could, proclaiming that since 1915 French's pennant emblem has symbolized "French's affiliation with baseball and American celebration."
The news release said French's was produced by "New Jersey-based Reckitt Benckiser Inc."
Nowhere in that news release was it mentioned that Reckitt Benckiser Inc. is a subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser P.L.C., which is based in Slough, England. Britain is the chief ally of the United States in the current war, but perhaps the people at Reckitt fear some Americans don't appreciate the difference between France and Britain. Or maybe they think we're still mad about 1812.
You have to feel sorry for Tony Blair. He has tried to occupy the middle ground between Europe and the United States, with hopes of bridging the differences. But the French are furious at him, and Washington keeps contradicting his claims about President Bush's postwar plans, something he tried to smooth over yesterday. Now a major British company would just as soon obscure its heritage. The middle ground between Paris and Washington happens to be under a very deep ocean.
For multinational companies, particularly those that are not sharply identified with one country, these are difficult times. Reckitt Benckiser P.L.C., which does more business in Western Europe than in the United States, chose not to post its French's "All-American" news release on its Web site, where it might be seen by the French.
"We issued the press release in response to some confusion that was going on," said Ellyn Small, the spokeswoman who put out the release. "We are not anti-French. We're not anti-anybody."
The news release also praised French's "Napa Valley style Dijon" mustard. On French's Web site, that mustard is just called Dijon. The name was changed last year, Ms. Small said, but the company has not gotten around to updating the Web site.
The war will end, and presumably it will end with an American (and British) victory. But there is a risk that simmering economic disputes will be uglier after the war than they need to be, in part because of the enmities being built up now. That could hurt the economies of Western Europe and the United States, neither of which is looking especially strong.
Washington appears likely to pour another few billion dollars into the airline industry, providing enough to keep sick carriers aloft but doing nothing to solve the industry's real problems. Europe, which is trying to cut losses at its own airlines, is furious about that and may retaliate with higher taxes or reduced landing rights for American carriers. The European carriers are lining up for handouts from their governments.
That issue cries out for quiet diplomacy, as does the steel dispute between the United States and Europe that led to Washington's losing a round in the World Trade Organization this week. But the major Western governments are angry at each other and doing nothing to discourage their citizens from economic jingoism.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Steep Losses Are Narrowed After Bush and Blair Speak

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded from early declines yesterday, erasing most of the losses, after President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain defended the pace of the war against Iraq.
 Wall Street opened with European stocks in decline and a report in The Washington Post that said senior Pentagon officials were convinced that the war was going to last for months. 
 But at a news conference later, Mr. Blair said progress had been made. "Our forces are now within 50 miles of Baghdad," he said. "They've surrounded Basra. They've secured the key port of Umm Qasr. They've paved the way for humanitarian aid to flow into the country. And they've brought real damage on Iraq's command and control. So we can be confident that the goals that we have set ourselves will be met." 
When asked whether the war could take months, President Bush replied: "However long it takes. That's the answer to your question. And that's what you've got to know. This isn't a matter of timetables; it's a matter of victory."
Joseph Liro, an economist and market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said it was difficult to identify the impetus for the market's reversal, but he called the rebound "a very gutsy performance."
He added, "Unfortunately we have a lot of bad news to get through besides this war stuff." This includes the beginning, in the next few weeks, of first-quarter earnings reports, many of which are expected to be disappointing. At the end of next week, the government will release the unemployment data for March, with many economists predicting a fourth monthly decline in jobs out of the last five.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, which was down almost 126 points early in the day, was off just 28.43 points, or 0.4 percent, to 8,201.45. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 1.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 868.52, after falling almost 12 points earlier. And the Nasdaq composite index declined 3.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,384.25. It had been down 18 points in early trading.
Trading volume was light, with just 1.23 billion shares changing hands. That is below the 1.43 billion average for the last 12 months and the 1.38 billion average this year. Light volume can exaggerate market swings and might help explain both the morning decline and the rebound.
With the war on everyone's television screens and traders and investors paying as much attention to its progress as to their portfolios, the stock market is likely to bounce around as the headlines from the war, both positive and negative, come in. And if the Bush administration succeeds in damping expectations of a quick victory, reports of progress toward capturing Baghdad could send stocks higher.
While the stock market seemed to calm down a little, the price of oil climbed sharply, showing that investors are still worried about supply disruptions related to the war. The price of crude oil for May delivery rose $1.74, or 6.1 percent, to $30.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the first time in a week that oil had risen above $30 a barrel.
Another barometer of investor concern, the price of gold, slipped in the afternoon. Gold for April delivery was down $1.70, or 0.5 percent, to $328.40 an ounce after rising to $333.10 an ounce earlier in the day.
If investors were looking for some positive news, they may have found it in the day's economic reports. Initial jobless claims dropped 25,000 in the last week, to 402,000, the lowest level since the beginning of February.
But this is still the sixth consecutive week of claims above 400,000, and economists say the economy did not pick up significantly in the first three months of this year. The government, in its second revision of fourth-quarter results, said yesterday that the economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual pace in the last three months of 2002. Economists are forecasting growth at an annual rate of just about 2 percent this quarter.
In the bond market, prices and yields were little changed. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 99 20/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 3.92 percent from 3.93 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond fell 1/32, to 106 24/32, while its yield rose to 4.93 percent from 4.92 percent.

HEADLINE: Delusions of Power 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
They considered themselves tough-minded realists, and regarded doubters as fuzzy-minded whiners. They silenced those who questioned their premises, even though the skeptics included many of the government's own analysts. They were supremely confident -- and yet with shocking speed everything they had said was proved awesomely wrong.
 No, I'm not talking about the war; I'm talking about the energy task force that Dick Cheney led back in 2001. Yet there are some disturbing parallels. Right now, pundits are wondering how Mr. Cheney -- who confidently predicted that our soldiers would be "greeted as liberators" -- could have been so mistaken. But a devastating new report on the California energy crisis reminds us that Mr. Cheney has been equally confident, and equally wrong, about other issues. 
 In spring 2001 the lights were going out all over California. There were blackouts and brownouts, and the price of electricity was soaring. The Cheney task force was convened in the midst of that crisis. It concluded, in brief, that the energy crisis was a long-term problem caused by meddling bureaucrats and pesky environmentalists, who weren't letting big companies do what needed to be done. The solution? Scrap environmental rules, and give the energy industry multibillion-dollar subsidies.
Along the way, Mr. Cheney sneeringly dismissed energy conservation as a mere "sign of personal virtue" and scorned California officials who called for price controls and said the crisis was being exacerbated by market manipulation. To be fair, Mr. Cheney's mocking attitude on that last point was shared by almost everyone in politics and the media -- and yes, I am patting myself on the back for getting it right.
For we now know that everything Mr. Cheney said was wrong.
In fact, the California energy crisis had nothing to do with environmental restrictions, and a lot to do with market manipulation. In 2001 the evidence for manipulation was basically circumstantial. But now we have a new report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which until now has discounted claims of market manipulation. No more: the new report concludes that market manipulation was pervasive, and offers a mountain of direct evidence, including phone conversations, e-mail and memos. There's no longer any doubt: California's power shortages were largely artificial, created by energy companies to drive up prices and profits.
Oh, and what ended the crisis? Key factors included energy conservation and price controls. Meanwhile, what happened to that long-term shortage of capacity, which required scrapping environmental rules and providing lots of corporate welfare? Within months after the Cheney report's release, stock analysts were downgrading energy companies because of a looming long-term-capacity glut.
In short, Mr. Cheney and his tough-minded realists were blowing smoke: their report described a fantasy world that bore no relation to reality. How did they get it so wrong?
One answer is that Mr. Cheney made sure that his task force included only like-minded men: as far as we can tell, he didn't consult with anyone except energy executives. So the task force was subject to what military types call "incestuous amplification," defined by Jane's Defense Weekly as "a condition in warfare where one only listens to those who are already in lock-step agreement, reinforcing set beliefs and creating a situation ripe for miscalculation."
Another answer is that Mr. Cheney basically drew his advice about how to end the energy crisis from the very companies creating the crisis, for fun and profit. But was he in on the joke?
We may never know what really went on in the energy task force since the Bush administration has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep us from finding out. At first the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, which is supposed to act as an internal watchdog, seemed determined to pursue the matter. But after the midterm election, according to the newsletter The Hill, Congressional Republicans approached the agency's head and threatened to slash his budget unless he backed off.
And therein lies the broader moral. In the last two years Mr. Cheney and other top officials have gotten it wrong again and again -- on energy, on the economy, on the budget. But political muscle has insulated them from any adverse consequences. So they, and the country, don't learn from their mistakes -- and the mistakes keep getting bigger.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action -- and Reaction; 
Race Is Never Neutral

BYLINE:  By Lawrence H. Summers and Laurence H. Tribe; Lawrence H. Summers is president of Harvard University. Laurence H. Tribe is professor of constitutional law at Harvard and author of the Supreme Court brief filed by Harvard and other private universities.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases challenging the University of Michigan's admissions policies, which award minority applicants extra points. The court's decision could change admissions policies nationwide and has prompted a debate about diversity on campus and affirmative action in higher education.
 On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases challenging race-sensitive admissions policies at the University of Michigan. Harvard, together with many other private and public educational institutions, has filed a brief urging the court to adhere to a quarter-century-old rule: while universities may not adopt racial quotas, they may consider a qualified student's race as a factor in an admissions process that treats each applicant as an individual and weighs the capacity of each to contribute to the education and experience of the class as a whole. 
 There is a broad consensus supporting the value of racial diversity at our nation's universities. Even the Bush administration, while opposing Michigan's specificprograms, explicitly endorses the "laudable goals of educational openness and diversity." The administration argues that "race neutral" approaches -- like guaranteed admission for the top 10 percent of high school graduates -- could approximate the racial and ethnic mix that consideration of race now achieves. But calling such methods "race neutral" when their aim is to keep minority enrollments up is disingenuous and obscures the consensus in favor of racial diversity as an important goal in higher education.
That consensus reflects the reality that today's students must be prepared to live and work in a global economy and a multiracial world. And it helps explain why Michigan's admissions policies have been supported by a record-setting 66 friend-of-the-court briefs from hundreds of leading businesses, members of Congress, states, labor unions, professional associations, two former defense secretaries, three former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the former superintendents of all three service academies.
The rule that universities may take race into account as one of many factors in shaping a diverse student body stems from the landmark Bakke case, decided 25 years ago, and is by now deeply woven into the fabric of our society. In the intervening quarter-century, universities have learned that racial diversity helps students confront perspectives other than their own, forcing them to think more rigorously and imaginatively. Diversity also helps break down prejudices and stereotypes by showing students that every ethnic community includes a broad range of viewpoints and experiences and that imagined differences often turn out to be only skin deep.
This debate, then, is over means, not ends. And if the Supreme Court -- which has elsewhere honored the values of competition, experimentation and heterogeneity -- respects the institutional competence and academic freedom of colleges and universities, it will give them leeway in choosing how best to obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body.
The supposedly race neutral alternatives the court is being urged to embrace as the only permissible means of doing so have many striking defects. The most widely touted among those proposals -- automatically admitting the top 10 percent of each high school graduating class -- would conflict with the imperative of treating each applicant as an individual. It would also be useless above the college level and for colleges too small to admit even the top 1 percent of high school graduates nationally.
Race is just one of many factors other than grades and test scores that universities consider. They also weigh geographic origin, socioeconomic status, personal or family hardships, alumni history, and special talents and experiences. Indeed, recruited athletes at many selective colleges are far more likely to be admitted at any given SAT level than are minority candidates. And any "race neutral" formula yielding as racially diverse a class would leave unchanged the odds of admission for the typical nonminority student.
Setting aside a fixed number of "slots" for which only racial minorities are eligible would be a forbidden racial "quota." But that epithet does not fairly describe Michigan's policies -- or those of the many other educational institutions that take care not to stigmatize or separate students of any racial group but do not shut their eyes to the realities of race.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Decline on Weak Consumer Confidence Report

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after a weak consumer confidence report underlined the bleak outlook for corporate earnings and added to concerns about a war with Iraq that will last longer than initially expected.
 Volume was light as investors refrained from taking positions over the weekend and retreated to the safety of bonds, which firmed for a fifth consecutive session. 
 The University of Michigan's gauge of consumer sentiment fell in March to its lowest level in almost a decade. Weak sentiment bodes poorly for corporate profits, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of activity in the economy. 
"There's not much to move this market if people are expecting to have disappointing earnings in the first quarter," said James Volk, managing director of equity trading at D. A. Davidson & Company in Portland, Ore.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 55.68 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 8,145.77. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.02 points, or 0.6 percent, to 863.50, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 14.65 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,369.60.
About 1.21 billion shares traded on the Big Board, one of the year's lightest sessions, and about 1.32 billion on the Nasdaq. 
All three major stock gauges ended lower for the week, after two weeks of gains that had pushed all of them into the black for the year. With this week's declines, the Dow and the S.& P. are off about 2 percent for the year while the Nasdaq is up 2.5 percent. For the week, the Dow fell 4.4 percent, the Nasdaq dropped 3.6 percent and the S.& P. was down 3.6 percent.
"Outside the geopolitical environment, what the market is bracing for is the next corporate earnings season," said Joe Kalinowski, chief investment officer at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc.
"I track the rate of change of corporate earnings preannouncements, and what's disturbing is that for every positive change, there's been three negative ones," he said, referring to announcements companies make just before they release quarterly results.
Shares of ConAgra Foods and Sara Lee fell yesterday after a newspaper report said they were involved in the accounting scandal that has engulfed the grocer Royal Ahold of the Netherlands and its U.S. Foodservice unit.
Citing a person close to the situation, The Wall Street Journal said the food companies colluded with executives of U.S. Foodservice to inflate supplier rebates.
Sara Lee denied it had acted inappropriately, and ConAgra said it had followed ordinary and appropriate business practices in its relationship with U.S. Foodservice.
Shares of Sara Lee fell $1.17, or 5.9 percent, to $18.69.
ConAgra fell as much as 16.9 percent, to a two-year low of $17.86, before paring losses to close at $19.65, off 8.5 percent, or $1.83.
Shares of ImClone Systems rose 98 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $18.36, after Merck of Germany said an independent panel had confirmed positive assessment of a trial of ImClone's experimental cancer drug, Erbitux.
Newmont Mining reported a fourfold rise in fourth-quarter earnings on higher gold sales and prices, bolstering its shares 8.2 percent. They rose $2.03, to $26.59.
Lifecore Biomedical fell $2.54, or almost 42 percent, to $3.55. The company, a maker of medical products, said it voluntarily suspended global sales of Intergel, its product for reducing internal scarring from gynecological surgery, which is marketed by the Gynecare unit of Johnson & Johnson.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32 , to a price of 99 26/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.9 percent from 3.92 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed 7/32 , to 106 31/32 . The bond's yield declined to 4.92 percent from 4.93 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Spending by Consumers Stalls For a Second Consecutive Month 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
Consumer spending stalled in February for a second consecutive month as war uncertainties, job worries and higher energy prices made people more cautious, the government said today. 
 Spending on cars and other costly items was down sharply for a second month. 
 Today's Commerce Department report showed that consumer spending was flat in February, holding at an annual rate of $7.49 trillion. 
"Consumers are growing increasingly cautious in their spending, and the income to support future spending is weakening," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. "Consumers are pulling back." 
The incomes of Americans, including wages, interest and government benefits, rose a modest 0.3 percent in February, down from an increase of 0.4 percent in January. 
Although bad winter weather was a big factor in damping retail sales in February, economists said consumers were also becoming more cautious in the current muddled climate. 
A worsening labor market has made it more difficult for those out of work to find jobs and has made those who have jobs worry about keeping them, economists said. 
In a second report, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for March fell to 77.6 from 79.9 in February, economists said. This is the third consecutive month that confidence has sunk. 
In February, consumers cut spending on big-ticket durable goods -- products expected to last at least three years, like cars and appliances -- by 2.2 percent, on top of a 4.9 percent cut in January. Spending on nondurable goods, like food and clothes, was flat, compared with a 1.3 percent rise in January. 
Spending on services, including gas and electric utilities, rose 0.5 percent in February, up from a 0.3 percent gain, reflecting higher energy prices. 
The disposable income of Americans, or what is left after taxes, rose 0.2 percent in February, compared with an advance of 0.4 percent in January. 
With income growth outpacing spending, the personal savings rate, or savings as a percentage of after-tax income, rose to 4 percent in February, from 3.8 percent in January. 
The spending and income figures are not adjusted for inflation. When they are, the picture looks worse. 
Adjusted for price changes, consumer spending fell 0.4 percent in February, after a 0.2 percent decline in January. And inflation-adjusted disposal income dropped 0.2 percent in February, erasing a 0.2 percent advance the month before.

Weak Economy Beneath the Steeple

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
In a struggling economy that has governments cutting services and employers laying off workers, the local church, its collection plate light and its capital fund filled with depreciated stocks, does not stand apart. "Ask and you shall receive" does not always hold when times are tough.
 At Holy Redeemer Roman Catholic Church in Detroit, for instance, the Rev. Donald Hanchon says the weekend collection is down 8 percent. 
 The church's congregation is made up largely of autoworkers and day laborers who work at drywall, roofing and snow removal. "It's a dicey time for the auto industry, and people aren't getting their homes fixed," Father Hanchon said. "We're on a June fiscal year, and right now we're $5,800 behind where we should be."
The shortfall has put the church in a bind between money and mission precisely at a time when people need more of its help.
"We can't give what we don't have," said Father Hanchon, who, in response, has redoubled requests for money, required not only for good works but also for day-to-day necessities like heat and meeting the payroll. 
"We're not trying to squeeze blood from a turnip," Father Hanchon said, "but we do have fixed costs." 
To help compensate, the church has been seeking donations of time. "Time and talent can be as good as treasure," he said.
Not that getting volunteers is a sure thing, especially in a society where both husband and wife often have to work full time, said Gerald Skolnik, rabbi at the Forest Hills Jewish Center in Queens, which has a $2 million operating budget. And even with volunteerism, running a synagogue in such an economy is a struggle requiring difficult choices: in the recession of the early 1990's, an assistant rabbi had to be laid off. 
"It's not unlike a corporation in the nonspiritual world: you need to consolidate and cut back," Rabbi Skolnik said. "But you can't downsize on the ministering to the ill and needy. You have to streamline expenditures, but you have to look and see where carefully. Are we spending too much on maintenance? Should we charge for certain programs that are free to members now? Are we making money on certain programs? Should we even be worried about making money on certain programs?" 
"We are a nonprofit," he added, "but that doesn't mean we are not supposed to be solvent. We need to be there, and we need to be there tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, too."
Peter C. Brinckerhoff, author of "Faith-Based Management: Running Organizations That Are Based on More Than Just Mission," says a mistake that some clerics make in budgeting is to rely more heavily on prayer than on a sharpened pencil. 
"Many hope for intervention from above and say that God works on a different fiscal year than they do," Mr. Brinckerhoff said. "But they have to pay their bills this year, and they are not going to get a pass at bankruptcy court." 
Nonetheless, many clerics have more expertise in sacred text than in number crunching, as well as a belief that it is wrong to go into the new year with any cash left over. Carrying forward, the thinking goes, means that good works were left undone. 
"Their goal is to be cash-poor," Mr. Brinckerhoff said, "or to have 10 cents in the bank at the end of the year." 
The lack of cash in the bank can unsettle the flock, particularly older churchgoers, said Tim Craig, senior pastor at Dranesville United Methodist Church in Herndon, Va. 
"The Generation X congregants like to see money going out for charity and missions," Mr. Craig said, "but the older ones want that cushion for a rainy day." 
Particularly in a weak economy, the pastor said, it is important to let all congregants see where the money they give is going. "When people are worried about money in general," he said, "they want to see just where it is." So efforts to make financial reports readily available have been stepped up, he said.
Mr. Craig's church has benefited markedly from one favorable economic development: low interest rates. Several years ago, it took out a $1.6 million loan to build 12 new classrooms. This year, the low rates led the church to refinance, a step that brought a significant saving.
But low interest rates have not been an across-the-board boon to houses of worship.
"You want to raise an endowment that will throw off enough interest to sustain a credible program with interest rates this low?" Rabbi Skolnik said with a laugh. "Well, you might as well lie down and take a nap."

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action -- and Reaction; 
Admissions (and Denials) of Responsibility

BYLINE:  By Glenn C. Loury; Glenn C. Loury is professor of economics and director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at Boston University. He is lead author of a brief supporting the University of Michigan's policies.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases challenging the University of Michigan's admissions policies, which award minority applicants extra points. The court's decision could change admissions policies nationwide and has prompted a debate about diversity on campus and affirmative action in higher education.
 Opponents of affirmative action hold that justice in matters of race requires strict adherence to a policy of "colorblindness." Many Americans share this view: I know because I used to be one of them. 
 Despite its superficial appeal, colorblindness is a false ideal. No understanding of the American social order that ignores racial categories is possible, because these socially constructed categories are embedded in the consciousness of all of us. Because we use race to articulate our self-understandings, we must sometimes be mindful of race as we conduct our public affairs.
This fact lies at the heart of the University of Michigan's defense of its admissions policies. In our racially stratified society, diversity is a necessary part of an effective college education. To attain such diversity, in turn, the explicit use of race in the admissions process is necessary.
The case the Supreme Court will hear next Tuesday is the most important affirmative action litigation of the last quarter-century. The stakes for American higher education could hardly be greater. College and university administrators, both public and private, are nearly unanimous in their conviction that blacks and Hispanics should be present in meaningful numbers among those inducted into the upper ranks of American society.
But the significance of these cases reaches far beyond the ivory tower. Elite higher education is the primary place in America where access to influence and power is rationed. If blacks and Hispanics are to achieve genuine equality in this society, they must be able to participate in these institutions.
The designation each spring of the fortunate young people who will enter prestigious colleges and universities is a publicly visible, high-stakes civic exercise. These "selection rituals" are political acts, and their perceived fairness is crucial to the legitimacy of our social order. Supporters of affirmative action recognize that the presence -- in more than token numbers -- of blacks and Hispanics at selective colleges and universities is necessary to assure this perception, and the reality, of fairness. That is, racial diversity at the most selective institutions is required to demonstrate the genuinely democratic character of the process through which we, in effect, choose our elites.
The argument about affirmative action in college admissions is really a dispute about the meaning of racial justice. A powerful civics lesson is provided by these disputed policies: by using race as a factor to determine who will have access to their ranks, exclusive colleges and universities publicly confirm that a racially integrated elite is an essential element of a just society.
Taking race into account, in university admissions or in other aspects of life, does not require abandoning a commitment to individualism. One can hold that race is irrelevant to a person's moral worth -- that people, not groups, are the bearers of rights -- and still affirm that to deal effectively with individuals, we must consider the categories of thought in which they understand themselves.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action -- and Reaction; 
Is Diversity Overrated?

BYLINE:  By Stanley Rothman; Stanley Rothman, professor emeritus of government at Smith College, is director of the Center for the Study of Social and Political Change.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases challenging the University of Michigan's admissions policies, which award minority applicants extra points. The court's decision could change admissions policies nationwide and has prompted a debate about diversity on campus and affirmative action in higher education.
 The Supreme Court hears arguments next week in the cases that may determine whether racial and ethnic preferences in higher education admissions and hiring are preserved or discarded. Whatever it decides, the court should be skeptical of one of the most popular justifications for preferential treatment of minority applicants: that a diverse student body necessarily improves the quality of education for everyone. 
 One of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken of diversity in higher education indicates that this contention is at least questionable. The study's findings show that college diversity programs fail to raise standards, and that a majority of faculty members and administrators recognize this when speaking anonymously.
With my colleagues, Seymour Martin Lipset and Neil Nevitte, I measured views of the educational benefit of diversity as it is now incorporated in higher education policy. We wanted to know this: Is diversity truly seen, as the former president of the University of Michigan has said, "as essential as the study of the Middle Ages, of international politics and of Shakespeare" to a well-rounded education?
To find out, in 1999 we surveyed a random sample of more than 1,600 students and 2,400 faculty members and administrators at 140 American colleges and universities, asking them to evaluate the quality of education at their institution, the academic preparation and work habits of the student body, the state of race relations on campus and their own experiences of discrimination. Then we correlated their responses with the proportion of black students attending each institution, based on government statistics.
If diversity works as advertised, we surmised, then those at institutions with higher proportions of black enrollment should rate their educational and racial milieus more favorably than their peers at institutions with lower proportions.
The results contradict almost every benefit claimed for campus diversity. Students, faculty members and administrators all responded to increasing racial diversity by registering increased dissatisfaction with the quality of education and the work ethic of their peers. Students also increasingly complained about discrimination.
Moreover, diversity fails to deliver even when all else is equal. When we controlled for other demographic and institutional factors like the respondent's race, gender, economic background and religion, or an institution's public or private status, selectivity and whether it offers an ethnic or racial studies program, the results were surprising. A higher level of diversity is associated with somewhat less educational satisfaction and worse race relations among students.
We also tested for the effects of higher Hispanic and Asian enrollment. Hispanic enrollment has little effect on any group's ratings of the educational or racial climate. As the proportion of Asian students increased, however, faculty members and administrators perceived an improvement in the academic quality of their students. Thus support for the diversity argument comes with respect to a minority often excluded from preferential admissions programs.
We also asked students about policies used to increase diversity. Three out of four oppose "relaxing academic standards" to increase minority representation, as do a majority of faculty members. And an overwhelming 85 percent of students specifically reject the use of racial or ethnic "preferences"-- along with a majority of faculty members. More telling, 62 percent of minority students oppose relaxing standards, and 71 percent oppose preferences.
Among the most striking findings is the silent opposition of so many who administer these programs -- yet must publicly support them. Although a small majority of administrators support admissions preferences, 47.7 percent oppose them. In addition, when asked to estimate the impact of preferential admissions on university academic standards, about two-thirds say there is none. Most dismaying, of those who think that preferences have some impact on academic standards, those believing it negative exceed those believing it positive by 15 to 1.
One cannot help but wonder why the public and private views of higher education's leadership differ so greatly. It would be useful to have some good studies of that question.

HEADLINE: Scandals in Connecticut 

 BODY:
Connecticut, which used to bill itself as "the land of steady habits," has taken quite a few blows to its image of solid reliability. This week the former mayor of Waterbury was convicted of forcing two underage girls to have sex while he was in office. Last week, the five-term mayor of Bridgeport, one of the nation's most financially troubled cities, was found guilty of taking bribes in excess of $500,000. 
 The case of Philip Giordano of Waterbury is so shocking it defies comment. During his trial, a prostitute testified that she had delivered her daughter and her niece, 8 and 10 years old, to have sex with the mayor in various locations, including his City Hall office. Authorities discovered Mr. Giordano's sexual crimes during an investigation of financial misdeeds in his administration. 
 Mr. Giordano's conviction followed that of Joseph Ganim, the mayor of Bridgeport, who was found guilty of 16 crimes relating to a corruption plot. Mr. Ganim had been regarded for a while as the man who might bring Bridgeport out of its seemingly endless economic and civic problems, and it must be heartbreaking for his former constituents to realize how thoroughly he betrayed them.
Meanwhile, Gov. John Rowland is operating under a shadow because of the high number of close aides and associates who have become entangled in scandals and investigations. Mr. Rowland's former deputy chief of staff, Lawrence Alibozek, pleaded guilty to helping to steer state contracts in return for bribes of cash and gold coins, which investigators found buried in his backyard. His former co-chief of staff, Peter Ellef, was forced out as chairman of the state trash authority following the loss of $220 million in state funds in a deal with Enron just before it collapsed. More recently his state treasurer, Paul Silvester, pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and racketeering.
The governor's consistent defense has been that he was out of the loop when any misdeeds occurred. But the company he keeps will continue to dog him. Connecticut is in the middle of a financial crisis that requires a steady and focused leadership. This is no time for a governor who is simply interested in trying to run out the clock.

HEADLINE: Struggling to Regain Technological BuzzAfter Bubble's Burst 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Call it buzz, cool, magic or whatever the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology cannot thrive without it.
 But like many of the businesses that flourished during the 1990's technology boom, the lab -- where researchers talked about cyberspace, multimedia and virtual reality long before those words became household terms -- has struggled to generate excitement and reposition itself now that the bubble has burst. 
 In the rambunctiously creative years after its founding in 1985, the Media Lab was celebrated for its insights into how technology might change traditional forms of communication and everyday life.
These days, other research institutions are competing with the lab to create prototypes of the communication technologies of the future. Newer subjects of interest like atomic and molecular studies, as well as overseas expansion and new links to other parts of M.I.T., threaten to blur the lab's image. And raising money from corporate sponsors, who have in the past provided almost all the lab's financing, has become tougher. 
"There's lots of competition now," said Robert Buderi, an editor at Technology Review, a magazine published by M.I.T., and an expert on corporate research. "I can see many of the same concepts demonstrated at places like Carnegie Mellon, Microsoft, Xerox PARC, I.B.M. and U.C. Berkeley."
Organizationally, at least, the Media Lab is still in a league of its own. In the last few years, it has given birth to sister labs in India and Ireland, as well as the Center for Bits and Atoms, a federally financed research center that concentrates on physics and chemistry projects and is housed in the lab's building, which was designed by I. M. Pei. All of them now operate under the umbrella of a new organization called Media Labs, headed by Nicholas Negroponte, the famously outspoken founding director of the Media Lab.
"Fundamentally, we bet on people and then continually experiment with how to organize it," said Walter Bender, who succeeded Dr. Negroponte as director of the original lab in September 2000. "I don't think that anyone has as diverse a collection of activities, and the real magic of the place is the interaction."
Unlike other major university research institutions, the Media Lab has always relied on its ability to attract corporate sponsors. Until the recession, the success of that approach was the envy of other institutions.
"There was a culture there of spending money like water," said Aaron Bobick, who left the Media Lab in 1999 to become the director of the Graphics, Visualization and Usability Center at Georgia Tech. "It used to be that money wasn't a reason that things couldn't get done."
The Media Lab still has plenty of corporate fans. More than 75 percent of this year's $40 million budget comes from 120 companies, which share access to the technology developed at the lab.
But attracting cash has been a struggle in recent years, leading the lab to turn increasingly to governments and foundations -- sources that it once ignored. Foreign governments account for most of the budgets of the sister labs overseas, and the $13.75 million grant from the National Science Foundation in late 2001 to set up the Center for Bits and Atoms far exceeded any previous contribution from Washington.
The new sources have not been enough to avoid sobering cutbacks. In 2001, the lab imposed sharp reductions in travel, restrictions on free meals and, eventually, the layoffs of 40 support employees, the first such cuts in its history. 
Dr. Bender said the corporate share of the Media Lab's budget was likely to fall to about 60 percent in the coming years. Still, many of the lab's sponsors are strongly committed to its mission. Companies like BT, the former British Telecom, and Motorola, which have each donated more than $1 million annually to the lab, view it as both a window into new business opportunities and an insurance policy against being blindsided by technology developments they did not anticipate.
Motorola, for example, has been closely following the research of Andrew Lippman and others on so-called viral networks, which spread information without the central coordination typical of the kinds of networks built by Motorola and other phone equipment companies.
Dr. Lippman says he believes that cellphones may become such a decentralized network. In his view, it may soon be feasible for cellphones to locate nearby phones that are on and bounce a message from phone to phone until it reaches its destination -- and sets a phone ringing or vibrating -- without ever passing through a huge base station.
He has concluded that the phone industry is headed down an expensive technological dead end by investing heavily in new high-capacity networks of antennas and transmission stations.
Motorola does not necessarily agree with this theory, according to Matthew I. Growney, managing director of a Motorola unit that invests in new ventures. "But to go around and ignore someone like Andy would be foolish," he said.
Critics have long said that so much of the lab's research is fanciful and impractical that investing in it is foolish. Basic membership costs $100,000 annually for a minimum of three years. And there is no question that the lab has provided grist for the critics since it opened. 
Dr. Negroponte, a charismatic professor from the department of architecture, recruited a diverse collection of free-thinkers in setting up the lab, including notables like Marvin Minsky, a specialist in machine intelligence, and Seymour Pappert, a well-known learning theorist. The graduate students they brought came from design, computer programming and sociology backgrounds to receive degrees in a new discipline called media arts and science.
Faculty members and students alike concentrated on creating physical models or demonstrations of their concepts of how electronics could change human expression and everyday life. "Demo or die" was the motto.
The results were diverse, including models for the children's computer clubs that Intel now sponsors around the world. Lab researchers also created computer systems that gave rise to LEGO Mindstorms, and programming now embedded in standards for sharing music over computers. But for every clearly useful result, there were 10 odd kitchen implements, strange musical instruments or computerized pieces of clothing that left most people scratching their heads.
The critiques were humorously summed up in a 1995 parody of Dr. Negroponte in VooDoo, an M.I.T. humor magazine. In an actual demonstration, the lab showed off a prototype of a "holographic television" that created a faint three-dimensional motion picture using rapidly revolving lasers and mirrors. The effect was so indistinct that Life magazine had to photograph the image against a backdrop of smoke. The magazine parody had Dr. Negroponte gloating, "We have created a demo literally from smoke and mirrors, and the corporate world bought it."
But the Media Lab culture has proved surprisingly hardy. Indeed, the Center for Bits and Atoms, led by Neil Gershenfeld, represents an attempt to extend the lab's culture into what might seem unpromising ground. The new center is so math, physics and chemistry intensive that it attracts a very different kind of student and requires much more defined experimental goals. And, as a nationally financed research center, it has many links to researchers outside the Media Lab. 
But Dr. Gershenfeld said that he believed deeply in the Media Lab's approach to educating researchers and students through project work and the building of prototypes that embody concepts.
Staying within the Media Lab family, he said, encourages the center's researchers to consider applying their research to real-world needs like building desktop manufacturing systems for remote areas. 
And Dr. Negroponte certainly does not see any need to take fewer risks to avoid ridicule. "The fairest criticism is that we are spread too thin," he said. If he were to rename the expanded lab today, he said, he would call it simply "Other" in the hope that it would be known for doing things "that are not bandwagons, fashions or fields, but work at the edges and in the intersections of disciplines."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE REBUILDING; 
Bechtel Top Contender In Bidding Over Iraq

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
Bechtel has emerged as one of the top two contenders for the major contract to reconstruct Iraq, people involved in the bidding said.
 Officials with the Agency for International Development said today that a final decision had been delayed until next week, because "outstanding issues are holding this up," a spokeswoman for the agency, Ellen Yount, said. 
 These people say the chief issue is whether the government will insure the winning company against claims for property damage, injuries or death while working in Iraq, a provision that could save the company millions of dollars.
If that request is granted, the approval would be another significant improvement in a contract that would give the company a toehold in one of the most lucrative building programs in decades, a task that will cost $25 billion to $100 billion. 
The method of awarding the contracts has angered allies. Just American companies were asked to submit bids, a move that British officials have protested. They say the United States has cut out them out of the contracts even as their armed forces fight beside the Americans. 
Charges of bias have plagued the administration since the competitors were announced. They were among the largest and best politically connected companies. There was disagreement about the identity of the second competitor. Halliburton, where Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive from 1995 until mid-2000, is no longer in the running, a fact first reported today by Newsweek and acknowledged by an aid official. A spokeswoman said she could not say whether Halliburton removed itself or was uncompetitive.
Bechtel is regarded among the world's largest contractors, and former Secretary of State George P. Shultz is on its board. It was a company that raised the indemnification problem. Some people said that problem could be a deal breaker.
Given the scope of the project, experts said, the request is understandable but will require a White House decision.
John P. Janecek, former deputy general counsel of the Air Force, said that such indemnification clauses were unusual and that they were typically granted for contractors involved in obviously hazardous enterprises like satellite-launching rockets.
"A lot of companies provide the government weapons, supplies, services that don't get indemnification even in wartime," Mr. Janecek said.
The director of the aid agency, Andrew S. Natsios, said time constraints and the need to work with classified information forced the administration to restrict the candidates to American companies. Mr. Natsios has also said there was no possibility of influence peddling. His spokeswoman repeated today that the administration was following standard procedures in an emergency.
Experts questioned whether rules were being bent. They point out that the procurement agreement of the World Trade Organization requires all countries to have an open and transparent bidding process. Usually, United States government contracts are posted on a Web site and are open to all bidders, foreign or American.
As a result, among the top 50 companies that obtained federal contracts in the 2001 fiscal year were British Nuclear Fuels, No. 15; British Aerospace, No. 16; and Philipp Holzmann, the big German contractor, No. 34.
The government lets more than $200 billion a year in contracts.
Steven L. Schooner, co-director of the government procurement law program at George Washington University, said he was not convinced by the argument that companies needed to be cleared to handle classified material to build bridges or lay new roads.
"That defense of a need for speed and security clearances will be a classic loser" at the World Trade Organization, Mr. Schooner said. "We are sending the message that we are insular, we are closed." 
Mr. Natsios has said, on the contrary, that he won a waiver in January to let all companies, foreign and domestic, to bid for subcontracts that could amount to half the reconstruction money. 
Britain and other European nations remain unhappy with the arrangements. When the Agency for International Development announced this week that Stevedoring Services of America, headquartered in Seattle, had the $4.8 million contract to run the port of Umm Qasr in Iraq, British officials and labor leaders complained. The company, they said, has an antiunion history.

HEADLINE: Some Question Bankruptcy Role In Airlines' Cure 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG with MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Even as US Airways prepares to roll off the operating table on Monday, American Airlines is steeling itself to go under the scalpel of bankruptcy court restructuring.
 But industry analysts and economists are questioning whether the kinds of cuts that carriers make in Chapter 11 are deep enough to cure the industry's fundamental ills. After all, they note, the airlines went through a wave of bankruptcies in the early 1990's, only to end up in their worst shape ever today. 
 So while US Airways will undoubtedly look leaner on Monday -- when it is scheduled to end its bankruptcy -- than when it filed for protection last August, it does not expect to turn a profit this year or next, and even its chief executive acknowledges it could still fail.
United Airlines is using the leverage of bankruptcy laws to press its unions to let it start a low-cost carrier. But such experiments have failed in the past, because they could never fully copy the successful model of Southwest Airlines. 
It is unclear, in the meantime, what American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, will do if it enters bankruptcy court, as bankers have said it might next week. There are no indications that American -- or any major rival -- is seriously rethinking how it does business.
Skeptics say that the problem with sticking to the old-school focus on cutting labor costs is that it has not worked in the long run. When the airlines eventually eke out a profit, unions demand significant wage and benefit increases, because executives bludgeoned them so hard during the downturns.
To break out of the cycle, the carriers need to take stronger medicine, experts say. Their prescription includes permanent and far-reaching changes in complicated fare structures that have driven away business travelers, in route networks and schedules that guarantee an oversupply of seats and in an archaic mind-set that counts on the government to bail the carriers out, like a prodigal son who keeps asking his parents for rent money.
"Bankruptcy can do a lot of things for you on the cost side and the capital structure side," said Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at UBS Warburg. "Bankruptcy can't build you a good airline network."
Mr. Buttrick pointed out that when US Airways emerges from bankruptcy, it will simply have gone from being an airline with the highest costs in the industry to an airline with high costs. And that is after wringing out annual savings of $1.9 billion -- 63 percent coming from labor -- and cutting capacity by 28 percent since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. US Airways said on Thursday that it would cut capacity by another 5 percent next month.
Few doubt that David N. Siegel, the airline's chief executive, has used bankruptcy protection about as efficiently as possible. But the US Airways business model, which relies on charging high walk-up fares for profit, is unchanged. And Mr. Siegel recently acknowledged the obvious -- that market conditions are far from ideal.
"Our short-term survival and long-term success after we emerge from Chapter 11 are conditioned on our taking decisive, proactive steps to limit the airline's financial exposure from the war," he said.
Since the industry's deregulation in 1978, the traditional airlines have been consigned to a cycle of boom and bust, with some carriers fizzling out during down times -- Pan Am, Braniff and many more -- and others starting up to take their place. 
That could happen again now. The consequences might not be so bad for consumers, except for those travelers with tickets or frequent-flier accounts on the airlines that fail. Generally, though, air fares have fallen in lock step with the financial woes of the industry.
In part, those falling prices reflect the chronic excess capacity on routes served by the six largest airlines. In the last week and a half, all those carriers have announced cutbacks in flight schedules because of a steep drop in passengers after the United States-led invasion of Iraq. The capacity reductions range from 5 to 12 percent.
But well before the war began, analysts say, there was a 15 to 20 percent oversupply of seats in the market. Executives knew that, yet stubbornly kept their planes in the air.
Terry Trippler, an air fare expert at Cheapseats.com, said that some major routes still looked overstocked, even after the recent cuts. There are 94 scheduled nonstop flights on April 15 between New York and Chicago, and 29 scheduled nonstops (along with 11 direct flights) between New York and Los Angeles. 
"You don't want to cut too much unless the other guy cuts," said Raymond L. Neidl, an analyst at Blaylock & Partners. "That's always been a problem with the airlines. They always want to guard market share."
Gordon M. Bethune, chief executive of Continental Airlines, said it was not so easy for carriers to park their planes. The airlines still have to pay lease rates on parked aircraft, as well as the salaries of workers they do not lay off. So carriers prefer to keep the planes flying to squeeze out whatever little revenue they can, he said, even if that means oversupplying various markets.
Some experts say the most efficient way to bring down capacity is to allow the industry to consolidate. If there were only two or three giant airlines competing to fly just about everywhere, each might be able to make consistent profits, they say. Now, the only profitable carriers are low-fare operators like Southwest Airlines that have avoided building comprehensive nation-spanning route systems.
Washington, though, has been hesitant about allowing consolidation. Federal officials blocked a proposed United-US Airways merger and put stiff conditions on a code-share partnership among Continental, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.
The most immediate prospect for consolidation lies in the shutdown of United Airlines -- a possibility that United has raised as it negotiates concessions from its workers. United's seats add up to about 17 percent of domestic capacity.
But even United's liquidation would only partly solve the oversupply problem. If United disappeared, its rivals would put planes on some of its routes, and other entrepreneurs could buy United's planes to start new airlines. Mr. Buttrick, the UBS Warburg analyst, predicted that if United failed, 60 to 70 percent of its capacity would return within two years. In the meantime, 72,000 United workers would have lost their jobs, and 40 million travelers could lose their frequent-flier miles.
Many experts say that besides grounding some planes, the airlines need to simplify their fare structures. Most still charge astronomical fares for walk-up tickets -- a holdover from the dot-com boom, when businesspeople would pay almost anything for a last-minute flight. Ticket-booking Web sites and the simplified fare structures of low-cost airlines -- with about five fare types rather than dozens -- have made travelers resentful of the opaque pricing of the major carriers.
So far, America West Airlines is the only network carrier to overhaul its fares. The other large carriers have experimented, lowering walk-up fares in markets that account for about a third of total domestic revenue, according to Jamie Baker, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase. United has said its limited tests have added $20 million to $25 million to its monthly revenue, but the airline has yet to overhaul fares systemwide.
"We don't have the formula down and comfortable," said Douglas A. Hacker, executive vice president for corporate strategy at United.
During down cycles like today's, airline executives traditionally go to Washington, tin cups in hand. They argue that airlines provide an essential service, like a public utility, and so cannot be allowed to fail. If this made sense during the era of regulation, critics say it rings false in a free market environment -- especially when those same executives ask the government to lift limitations on mergers and foreign investment.
Citing potential losses totaling $10.7 billion this year because of the war, the airline industry is asking lawmakers to suspend several taxes, pick up the costs of heightened security, permanently underwrite war-risk insurance and tap oil reserves to help bring down the price of jet fuel.
"Airlines, like all the other firms in the U.S., are notorious for being crybabies, always looking for government handouts," said E. Han Kim, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan School of Business Administration. "They look for their big mother, for mother's milk. And that's Uncle Sam."
But the milk supply may be running low. In December, the government refused to give United a $1.8 billion loan guarantee, forcing the airline into bankruptcy protection. On Wednesday, Senate Republican leaders said they would support financial relief, though the proposed package would probably be under $3 billion, far less than what the airlines want.
Some leading lawmakers are expressing their disgust at the industry's performance. On Thursday, Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, criticized Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chief executive, after learning that his pay last year jumped 120 percent to about $13.5 million, while Delta was losing $1.27 billion.
John Kennedy, a company spokesman, said Delta executives were paid less than executives at similar-size companies.
But that does little to take the bite out of Senator McCain's choice words for Mr. Mullin. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," he said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Higher Taxes Seem Likely, But Albany Isn't Blinking

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 28 

 BODY:
The unspoken but widely accepted reality in the Capitol these days is that new state taxes are on New York's horizon.
 The two legislative leaders will not say it publicly. And Gov. George E. Pataki, having proposed a budget without any large-scale tax increases, has not budged, still saying that taxes smother the economy and kill jobs. 
 But many members of the Legislature, in both houses and both parties, are saying that the $11.5 billion budget gap cannot be bridged unless there is some increase in the income tax, corporate tax or other broad-based sources of revenue.
The question is: who will blink first?
Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, has said he would like to see a variety of other revenue-raising ideas tried before the discussion gets to taxes.
Among the $3 billion to $4 billion worth of "creative revenues" he has floated is a tort reform plan, sale of the land under the two New York City airports, the privatization of other state assets and the collection of taxes from American Indian reservations and on Internet sales. The latter proposal alone, he said, would net $4 billion by 2005.
But the full value of the proposals, assuming they are all put in place, would take two to three years to kick in fully, Mr. Bruno concedes. There are also questions about whether they would fill the rest of the gap left in the proposed $90.8 billion budget after the state borrows $4.2 billion against revenue from a tobacco settlement -- especially after cuts are restored.
"We are going to be dragged kicking and screaming to this discussion on taxes," said State Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Republican from Nassau County. "In other words, we are not going to get there until every, every, other option is exhausted."
But lawmakers in both parties feel time, if not options, are running out, and the last resort may soon be the only option. While the April 1 budget deadline will again come and go, lawmakers are saying it is important not to let their budget decision linger because the state is facing a cash shortage.
"I think higher taxes, in some form, are inevitable, but they have not been spoken about," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan.
"I hear that with almost everybody I talk to -- Senate, Assembly, Democrats, Republicans," he said. "Like it or don't like it, I haven't talked to anybody who truly believes, off the record, that we will get out of this budget crisis, or do what we need to do, without raising taxes."
Who will be first to put a tax package on the table? 
So far, Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, has been coy on the subject, even as he proposes restoring billions of dollars in cuts to schools and health care that the governor has proposed. When asked how he would pay for such restorations, Mr. Silver said that he wanted to finish "shopping" first, and would later get to the task of paying for his purchases.
Lawmakers close to Mr. Silver said he resented being put in the position of raising the "T" word, because he believed it allowed Mr. Pataki to wrap himself in the mantle of fiscal conservative, a role that helps the governor with the national Republican Party. Others are frustrated they must keep reminding people that Mr. Pataki already has proposed $1.4 billion in new taxes and fees.
But very few people think they can stick with the governor's budget and its tough package of cuts and not suffer politically at home.
Some lawmakers have pointed out that Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver could break from their three-men-in-a-room tradition and, without the governor's approval, independently strike a deal to craft their own budget, after agreeing to spending restorations and tax increases. John McArdle, Mr. Bruno's chief spokesman, said, "It is wrong to speculate about that because that is not something we are looking to do. We are negotiating three ways."
But should the Legislature adopt new taxes, Mr. Pataki would likely have to veto them, something he has not publicly said he would do. And the Legislature could then probably muster enough votes to override his veto, those on both sides say.
Each house needs a vote of two-thirds of its members to override a governor's veto. In the Assembly, it will be easy. Mr. Silver has 103 Democrats of the 150 total members, and needs only 101 votes for an override vote.
The Senate has 62 members, 38 of them Republican. Even if some of those refused to back their leader, Mr. Bruno, in a tax increase -- a refusal that is rare -- many in the chamber said it would not be difficult to get three or more Democrats to join with them and reach the necessary 41 votes to override a veto.
"They have not been successful in overriding in the past," said E. J. McMahon, an analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute. "An override requires two-thirds of each house voting for a tax increase, twice. I can't remember if that was ever done."
But certainly some lawmakers, lobbyists and some budget analysts are acting as if they think such a situation is possible. And even Mr. McMahon has said that it seems everyone expects new taxes to be part of the state budget -- whenever it is passed. "The conventional wisdom in Albany," he wrote in a recent memo, "is that a big, broad-based state tax increase is inevitable next year -- despite Governor George E. Pataki's opposition to 'job-killing' tax hikes."
Said Frank Mauro, executive director of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute: "Maybe there is not an unspoken understanding. There could be. But it might just be more of a suspension of disbelief until they have to stop suspending disbelief."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
Playing at a Higher Level

BYLINE:  By JULIE DUNN

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, March 25 

 BODY:
The football field on this tiny, tree-lined campus 6,035 feet above sea level and in the shadows of Pikes Peak seats about 3,000 spectators. The bleachers at the soccer field hold 1,000. 
 But when the Colorado College men's hockey team takes the ice to sold-out crowds at the 7,300-seat Colorado Springs World Arena, this private liberal arts college of 1,900 students suddenly does not seem small at all. 
 In fact, Colorado College is one of the favorites in the N.C.A.A. Division I men's tournament. The Tigers open tournament play against Wayne State on Saturday afternoon in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
"This is a quirky, quaint Division III college, not really a place you'd expect a Division I hockey team -- but it works," said Coach Scott Owens, a Tigers goaltender in the late 1970's who returned as coach in 1999. "A big part of it is the type of students that we draw here -- they are very active, they're outdoorsy, they get out and do things. It's an overall campus mentality." 
Hockey is very much a tradition at Colorado College. The sport had its start here in 1938 when the swanky Broadmoor Hotel converted its seldom-used indoor riding academy into a rink. The team played there for 55 seasons. Along the way, Colorado College became a founding member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. From 1948 to 1957, it played host to the first 10 N.C.A.A. championships, winning titles in 1950 and 1957. 
"It's not how many students you have over all; you only need 25 good ones," said Minnesota Coach Don Lucia, who ran the Tigers' hockey program for six seasons before taking the Gophers' job in 1999. "There is a very big commitment by the school to the program, and that commitment has been there for over 50 years."
This year, two Tigers have stood out nationally.
Peter Sejna, a junior left wing from Slovakia, led the nation in scoring (79 points) and points per game (1.98) and was the W.C.H.A.'s player of the year; he has 34 goals in 40 games. Tom Preissing, a senior defenseman from Rosemont, Minn., and the team's captain, finished second in the country in scoring among defensemen (22 goals and 48 points) and was the W.C.H.A.'s student-athlete of the year. The two are candidates for the Hobey Baker award as the top college player in the United States.
"Colorado College is one of the best combinations of top-notch hockey and a great education," said Owens, adding that the team's grade point average hovered around 3.0. 
Colorado College (29-6-5) is seeded No. 1 in the Midwest Regional. If the Tigers win Saturday, they will face either Michigan or Maine on Sunday in the regional final. Regional winners advance to the Frozen Four in Buffalo on April 10 and 12. 
"They've had a great year and they are certainly one of the favorites going into the N.C.A.A. tournament," Lucia said of the Tigers, who were the W.C.H.A.'s regular-season champions.
Located on a 90-acre campus in the city's historic downtown, Colorado College did away with semesters in 1970, offering instead a system in which students take eight sessions -- each three and a half weeks -- focused on one subject. 
"Our student-athletes come to Colorado College to be students first and foremost," said Richard F. Celeste, the university president. "What we take seriously is teaching and learning." Celeste came to the university last fall after serving as ambassador to India and as governor of Ohio. 
To illustrate his point, Celeste noted that Preissing sat beside Vernon Smith, a Nobel laureate in economics, during Smith's recent campus appearance. 
"How many Division I teams can say that their captain goes to a nonrequired, very nerdy lecture by a Nobel laureate?" Celeste asked. "The answer is Colorado College. Our players have their heads screwed on straight." 
Owens concedes that Colorado College's annual tuition of $33,000 complicates recruiting, but 57 percent of students receive need-based scholarships. 
"It does hurt us a little, but only in developing depth," he said. "You just have to work a little harder."
Sejna, who was not drafted by an N.H.L. team, is widely expected to sign with a team as a free agent after the season. But that discussion will have to wait for now.
"I'm trying to not even think about next year until the season is over," he said. "But no matter what, I'm going to finish my education." 
The Tigers are trying to win their first N.C.A.A. title in 46 years. After a stinging 4-2 loss to Minnesota in the final of last weekend's W.C.H.A. tournament, the Tigers are aware of the challenges ahead. 
"For the past month and a half, we haven't really had to battle to the extremes that we're going to have to this weekend," said forward Noah Clarke (20 goals, 66 points), a senior from La Verne, Calif. "I think everyone is excited and a little bit nervous." 
Owens said: "We've been a top-four team in the country all season and I think that we deserve to be there. We're just going to go out and play our usual up-tempo style and skate hard."

HEADLINE: War Stokes Fire Between City's Tabloids 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
With a novelty bottle of "Saddam Insane" hot sauce displayed prominently on his cherry desk, Col Allan, the editor of The New York Post, was ruminating about "the enemy."
 "The battle has been joined," he said, a bank of nearby television screens ablaze with artillery fire. "And it is to the death." 
 However much he may wish the Iraqi government ill, Mr. Allan was talking about The Daily News, and his desire to put it out of business. 
The Post and The News have been sparring for decades, of course, in what is now one of the few "newspaper wars" still raging in this country. But with a level of bombast that is unusual even for an editor of The Post, Mr. Allan, a 49-year-old Australian, has seized on the conflict in Iraq as an opportune moment to wrest readers and attention away from The News, most notably by using, at times, what he acknowledges as opinionated language. 
Not only have the French been depicted as "weasels" on The Post's news pages, but by yesterday the Iraqis were being described as "ferrets," "thugs" and "madmen."
By coupling that strategy with acidic insults at his only real competition -- Mr. Allan describes The News as "lacking modernity" -- he appears to have taken a page from Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of Fox News. Like The Post, Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which has sought to position its news network as the more compelling alternative to its rival CNN.
Told of Mr. Allan's taunts, Edward Kosner, the editor of The Daily News, who was raised in Washington Heights and educated at City College, could not resist responding in kind.
"An American editor," said Mr. Kosner, the collar of his dress shirt as tight as Mr. Allan's is loose, "would not approach reporting a war in which Americans are getting killed with pleasure in getting to cover that war."
"He's not going to put us out of business," Mr. Kosner, 65, added. "The Daily News will be here long after Col Allan has gone back to Australia."
In its most recent incarnation, the competition between The Post and The Daily News is being fought with limited resources. Neither, for example, has dispatched more than three staff journalists to the war zone.
Instead, each has often sought to boost circulation through more modest gestures, such as adding a standing flourish of patriotism to its front page -- an American flag in the upper left corner for The Post, big blue stars on the nameplate of The News.
Like every other major newspaper, the two tabloids have been providing readers with enormous maps, which, in The Post's case, have been presented in color and are largely reproduced from a sister paper, The Times of London.
But in capturing the readers' attention by provocation, there has been no contest.
While The News responded to reports of the execution of American prisoners of war with the banner headline "Outrage" on Monday, The Post had the far more loaded "Savages." Yesterday, when The News led with "Friendly Fire" and "30 Marines wounded in attack near Nassiriya," The Post said, "Saddam's evil order to kids: Fight or your parents die," followed by "How low can Iraq sink."
Each is hoping these wartime editions -- with as many as a dozen more pages a day than usual, and tens of thousands more copies on newsstands -- can change the reading habits of New Yorkers.
According to the most recently audited circulation figures, which were for the six months ending Sept. 30, The News had a daily circulation of 715,000, which was 125,000 more than the Post. But while The Post has been gaining ground, (an increase of 10 percent over a year earlier), The News has been losing it (a decline of 2.5 percent).
The papers' economic health is difficult to evaluate because The News is privately -held and The Post's figures are not broken out in News Corporation's financial filings.
Both Mr. Murdoch and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the owner of The News, appear to enjoy having a gaudy megaphone in the New York media market. But in their news pages, each paper has reflected the personality of its top editor.
Mr. Allan, who has been editor in chief of the Post since April 2001 and who previously edited The Daily Telegraph in Sydney, claims credit for The Post's campaign to discredit the French. When a reporter with a French-sounding name called for an appointment, Mr. Allan first asked, "You French?" before expressing relief that the reporter's mother was Canadian-born.)
"Our view is that the conduct of the French has been disgraceful," said Mr. Allan, who began his newspaper career after dropping out of Australian National University. "To be subtle might be confusing."
Not only has Mr. Allan sanctioned articles like how to avoid buying French cheese, he has also changed his own lifestyle. "I like the Bordeaux," he said. "But right now I'm working my way through the California Cabs."
Mr. Kosner, a former top editor at Newsweek, Esquire and New York magazine, bristles at being asked if he, too, has given up French wine.
"The whole thing is hyperbolic and ridiculous," he says.
"It's the content, the stories, the play, the headlines that we consider most essential," he added.
In preparation for an interview, Mr. Kosner had filled a legal pad with examples in which The Post seemed to be reporting a war that was going far better for the American coalition than appeared to be the case in The Daily News. 
He questioned the lead headline in last Saturday's Post -- "Surrender," followed by "Saddam's regime crumbling" -- in light of recent events.
"It's the quality of the candy that counts," Mr. Kosner said, "not the wrapper."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Argentina WillEnd Freeze On Bank Savings Accounts

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

 BODY:
Buoyed by signs of economic recovery and with an eye on next month's elections, the Argentine government said yesterday that it would end an unpopular freeze on bank savings accounts imposed in late 2001 as the country slid into financial chaos.
 The move, which will free an estimated $5.5 billion still trapped in banks, was another sign that the economy, crippled by a four-year recession, is gradually mending. 
 This week, the peso rose to its highest level against the dollar for a year and the country posted an impressive 2002 current account surplus of $9 billion. 
On Thursday, the economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said curbs on most term deposits would be lifted over the next 120 days.
Despite the peso's devaluation last year and the conversion of all dollar accounts into the local currency, Mr. Lavagna said savers would get back about 80 percent of their money in cash and government bonds.
Thousands of Argentines have gone to court to try to get their savings back in dollars, but the cost of lawyers' fees and court time could persuade many that the government offer is worth taking, analysts said.
In La Nacion yesterday, a columnist, Daniel Artana, wrote that the offer was "quite reasonable."
"Basically, in 120 days, the financial system will be completely back to normal," he wrote.
Normalcy is probably still a long way away for a financial system that was near collapse just months ago. Even now, a sudden drop in confidence could ignite another run on banks, analysts say. 
But the lifting of the restrictions was hailed by financial analysts.
"It's going to take years for the financial system to get back to normal, but it is definitely a step in the right direction," said John Welch, chief Latin American economist with WestLB in New York.
Ben Laidler, regional analyst for UBS Warburg in Santiago, Chile, said: "The banks can handle it. Liquidity has increased. Things are a lot better than we could have imagined just six months ago."
Analysts agreed that the measure, in a decree signed by President Eduardo Duhalde yesteday, was intended to help Mr. Duhalde's candidate, Nestor Kirchner, in next month's presidential elections.
The decree, however, does not include compensation for banks, which also suffered when the peso was cut free from its decadelong peg to the dollar last year. Mr. Duhalde has insisted that any such compensation, estimated at about $30 billion, must be approved by Congress, effectively committing the next government to what will certainly be difficult negotiations with the banks.
"It buys time to work everything out," Mr. Laidler said. "The banks should be able to muddle through and actually recover. Maybe these bonds will actually be worth something in five years."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE IRAQI CAPTIAL; 
Iraq Blames U.S. for Market Blast That Killed Civilians in Baghdad

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Saturday, March 29 

 BODY:
Iraqi officials said Friday tonight that at least 35 people, possibly as many as 55, many of them women and small children, were killed when a missile or bomb struck a crowded marketplace in an impoverished district of Shiite Muslims in the northwest suburbs of Baghdad. Dozens of others were wounded, many critically.
 Some survivors said they had seen the vapor trail of a high-flying aircraft heading south immediately before the blast at about 5:30 p.m. Reporters taken to the scene, in the Shula district 15 miles from central Baghdad, were told by others that seconds before the impact, they heard the roar of an engine they likened to cruise missiles. 
 Amid scenes of carnage at the marketplace, and among grieving relatives clinging to open caskets at a nearby mosque, many people placed blame for the attack on the United States or Britain, partners in the war against President Saddam Hussein. As they washed the bodies of the dead and carried them away for a night's mourning before dawn burials today, the victims' relatives appealed for America to end the war at once. 
But as with a similar incident on Wednesday, when two explosions in Baghdad killed at least 17 people and wounded 45, it was impossible to determine the cause. After the Wednesday incident, attributed by the Iraqis to an American air attack, United States military spokesmen said they had no planes in the area at the time and suggested that the explosion might have been caused by an errant Iraqi missile or even bombs that were planted. Map, Page B16. 
A Central Command spokesman in Qatar said Friday night that the United States could not tell what caused the bombing on Friday. One issue likely to be examined in both bombings is the relatively small size of the craters, in the case of Friday's attack they were closer to the kind associated with mortars, artillery shells or small bombs, than to the kind of craters commonly caused by American bombs or missiles in Baghdad.
Still, incidents like the one on Friday, the worst so far in a bombing campaign that has subjected key government installations here to a relentless pounding, threaten to become yet another major problem for the Bush administration.
With an invading force of already hung up in southern Iraq by unexpectedly fierce resistance, Mr. Hussein and his associates in the Baghdad leadership are certain to use any incident involving large numbers of civilian deaths to mobilize opinion against the war at home and abroad.
Ultimately, the Iraqi ruler appears to hope that growing opposition to the war abroad, especially in the United States and Britain, will force a turnaround in allied war aims, saving him from being ousted the same way he was spared by the American decision to seek a cease-fire after Iraqi forces were pushed out of Kuwait in 1991.
This alone, Iraqi opposition leaders say, would give Mr. Hussein an incentive to organize incidents like the two bombing attacks this week. 
Iraqi officials react to those suggestions with fury, to the point that the dwindling number of Western reporters still working in Baghdad have been cautioned that any suggestion of Iraqi complicity in civilian deaths could be a cause for expulsion. These officials also say that a bombing campaign that involves hitting Baghdad with dozens, and on some days, hundreds, of bombs and missiles is inherently "criminal" -- a word used in nearly every Iraqi bulletin since the beginning of the war -- because even with America's high technology, the smallest of errors can have disastrous results.
The risks inherent in the American air attacks have became even clearer in the last few days, as the Pentagon has turned to a new category of targets.
For the second time in 24 hours, bombs that fell shortly after dawn on Friday struck two of Baghdad's principal telephone exchanges, after an initial strike the previous night. 
Friday night, there was a huge explosion near the Information Ministry. But at daylight today, the building was still standing with damage limited to windows being blown out and large satellite dishes on its roof destroyed, apparently by a bomb or missile designed to cripple the communications without killing anyone.
The attacks on the telephone exchanges left much of the capital without telephones. Many Iraqis, especially those who favor a change in government here, had hoped that there would be no return to the pattern of 1991, when American targets included the telephone exchanges, power plants, water-pumping stations, and bridges across the Tigris. This time, the bridges have been left standing, as have the power stations and water stations.
After the marketplace explosion Friday night, there was no ambiguity in the response of Iraqis struggling to deal with the carnage. Dr. Hassan Razouki, 50, director of Al Noor Hospital half a mile from the explosion, broke away from directing surgery to talk to reporters.
"At 5:30 p.m. this evening, an enemy plane deliberately hit the local market," he said. "It was crowded with lots of people, including many children and many elderly, who went there to buy food. The number of martyrs from this criminal act is 35, most of them under 15 years of age, elderly or female, and we have treated 47 others who were injured."
He added: "The bodies were shattered by the missile, which was intended to kill as many people as possible. It was daylight. It was clear to anybody that the market was crowded, and there are no military or strategic facilities in this area."
Other officials at the hospital said that there were 55 names on an updated list of the dead. Officials at Al Noor Hospital were not able to provide the list or say which other hospitals might have received fatalities. 
An unofficial tally by one group of reporters indicated that they had seen, between them, at least 20 bodies, at a time hours after the strike when it was clear that many others had been taken away to their homes. At the Musa al Khadem Mosque, about 200 yards from the marketplace, about 15 bodies in coffins were brought in for washing and prayers in the late evening, then taken away. Five other bodies were stored in large, shelved refrigerators outside the Noor hospital. The bodies there, mostly of young men, had much of their clothing ripped away, and were caked with dirt. At least two were missing heads.
The explosion hit the Nassar market, an area of bare concrete stalls, row on row, that serve as the main shopping center for the sprawling Shula district. A small crater, about 18 inches to 2 feet deep and about 4 to 5 feet across, was visible in the dark, about 10 feet from the first row of stalls, where they face onto open ground looking to the south. The crater was far smaller than those made by many of the American bombs and missiles in the last week. Some of these, hitting homes and buildings in Baghdad, have left craters as much as 30 to 40 feet deep.
At the marketplace, fragments from the blast killed people up to 80 yards away, including three brothers from a single family in a home beside the market and two traders putting up their shutters for the night at shops just down the road.
For Iraqis, the fact that the disaster struck at Shula was filled with ironies. Dating from the 1960's, the district began as a shantytown for migrants coming north to Baghdad from cities like Kut and Nasiriya, in the poverty-stricken area of southern Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as Mesopotamia in the ancient world, where American troops have been hung up in the fighting of the past week.
Almost all of Shula's resident are Shiites, the majority group in Iraq, but mostly poor and mostly deeply alienated from Mr. Hussein's government, which is dominated by the Sunni Muslim minority. American planning for the war assumed strong support from Iraqi Shiites, who have been particular victims of the repression of the last 30 years of Baath Party rule.
A poll of the men grieving in the mosque on Friday night showed that they included construction workers, truck drivers, low-ranking policemen, barbers, plumbing workers, farm workers, bank clerks and men who operate street stalls. Many said they were in "free work," a euphemism for unemployment.
Their salaries averaged about $10 a month. One man said the poverty in the neighborhood could be judged from the fact that there were no butchers in the Nassar market. Meat, he said, was a luxury most residents of Shula could not afford.
Anger among the survivors, and relatives of the dead, seemed suppressed, as if in their grief they could hardly summon any emotion but despair. American and British reporters were welcomed, allowed into the innermost sanctums of the mosque to witness the washing of the bodies and the sewing of the winding sheets, and assured that there was no animosity toward them personally. But, man after man, boy after boy -- women being excluded from the mosque on such occasions -- they made clear that they had no doubt that the blast was caused by a bomb or a missile, and that the perpetrators were the American or British. 
One victim was a 6-year-old girl, Iman Fadil, who died along with her mother and small brother, neighbors said. As her tiny, limp body was carried away to be washed in a casket big enough for a man, the crowd in the mosque broke into rhythmicchants, "La, illah, illah, lah, Muhammad rassoul Allah", they said, in the passage that opens every Muslim's prayers: "There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his messenger." Washed, her body was taken outside into the chill darkness for prayers led by the mosque's imam, Said Abbas.
In the black shouldered cape and turban of a Shiite cleric, the imam spoke sonorously into the night. "We pray for the Muslims who have died, and for those who still cling to life," he said. "We say that we depend on God, and only God, to save us. And we pray that he will lead the Americans and the British to go away, and leave us in our land of Iraq. Lastly, we pray for the spirits of the departed to go to Paradise."
In the prayer on that muddy ground, in the mosque, at the marketplace amid the pools of blood, at the hospital, nobody, at least nobody directly affected by the bombing, made any mention of Saddam Hussein. In the darkness, it seemed suddenly, to an outsider, that these were people who had made their own quittance with the Iraqi leader, at least in their souls, and that what mattered to them now were ancient truths, and ancient sufferings, that would far outlast the Iraqi ruler, whatever the outcome of the war.
The men shouldered the casket and headed down a dirt alleyway to the girl's home. Some carried candles, others kerosene lamps. For the moments it took them to disappear from view, it was a scene from Middle Ages. All was quiet, save for the chants that receded with the procession. "There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his messenger," they said, over and over and over again, until the night's silence returned.

HEADLINE: Liberty Media Sues Over Vivendi Stake 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Liberty Media Corporation, which is controlled by John C. Malone, filed a suit yesterday contending that Vivendi Universal hid its financial crisis while negotiating a 2001 deal to exchange its own shares for most of Liberty Media's stake in USA Networks Inc.
 The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages and a court order voiding the deal, which gave Vivendi the entertainment assets of USA Networks in exchange for Vivendi stock and cash. 
In the $10.3 billion deal, Liberty received a 3.6 percent stake in Vivendi, which is now seeking to sell its entertainment assets. 
 A Vivendi spokeswoman declined comment on the suit.
In a separate matter, Vivendi said yesterday that securities regulators had requested more information in their investigation of its accounting practices.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Vivendi said that the commission had requested "additional information from Vivendi Universal on a variety of accounting issues."

To Offset Stocks, a Look to Futures

BYLINE:  By DONNA ROSATO

 BODY:
WORRIES about war and the economy have made global financial markets extremely volatile, but David Keating says he believes he has found a way to weather the market's wild swings. 
 Mr. Keating decided 15 months ago to move a portion of his portfolio into managed futures funds, an alternative investment that often does well when stocks fall. 
 "The equity markets were very frustrating, and none of the traditional models seem to work anymore," said Mr. Keating, 39, a senior product manager at Bank One and a corporate team-building consultant from Hunt Valley, Md. "There had to be something out there that could manage all this volatility." 
Managed futures funds invest in currency, financial, energy, metals and agriculture markets by using borrowed money to buy futures contracts and options on futures contracts. (Futures contracts cover the sale of financial instruments or physical commodities for future delivery.) 
Managers of futures funds, using futures contracts to make leveraged bets on various pieces of the global economy, can profit from price swings in either direction. Managers of mutual funds, by contrast, traditionally buy stocks in the hope they will rise and typically cannot sell short or use borrowed money to enhance returns. 
"For an investor willing to take on more risk, managed futures provide exposure to some assets which traditional fund managers cannot offer," said Vikas Agarwal of Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business. 
Managed futures tend to do better when markets are volatile, as in the last several years. For the three years through February, the CSFB/Tremont Managed Futures Index had an average annual return of 14.1 percent, versus a 14.7 percent average annual decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The CSFB/Tremont index rose 12.9 percent this year through February, versus a drop of 4.39 percent for the S.& P.
Assets in the funds were $36 billion at the end of 2002, up from $29 billion in 1998, says the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets, a nonprofit research group. Despite the funds' recent strong results, asset growth typically lags behind performance because investors are cautious about such alternative investments and typically allocate only a small part of their portfolio to managed futures, said Michael Ocrant, editor in chief of Managed Account Reports, which publishes the center's database. 
Though managed futures can be quite volatile on their own, they can reduce the overall volatility of a portfolio when combined with stocks and bonds, said Justin Dew, S.& P.'s director of portfolio services.
Some financial advisers say managed futures funds can provide diversification for portfolios that have only held stocks and bonds. "This is one way to give my clients positive returns when the market isn't doing well," said Jane Levine, a certified financial planner in Danville, Calif. 
While some futures funds concentrate in one type of futures instrument, like oil contracts, many are widely diversified in contracts worldwide. Managed futures funds have generally outperformed stocks in down markets because factors that push hurt stocks, like a weak economy, often make assets like gold or bonds seem more attractive. In the Russian currency crisis in the summer of 1998, for example, the S.& P. 500 fell 9 percent, but the CSFB/Tremont rose 16.5 percent. Futures funds also performed well in the 1987 stock market crash and the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
Managed futures funds bear some similarities to hedge funds, those lightly regulated pools of money run by managers who may use a variety of strategies like short-selling and leverage to bolster returns. 
But, unlike hedge funds, which require investors to put up large minimum investments and to meet certain net-worth standards, investors in managed futures do not have to be megawealthy. Brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney, offer managed futures accounts for as little as $5,000, or $2,000 for an individual retirement account. These investment houses give investors access to a variety of funds run by firms that specialize in managed futures. By contrast, investing directly in a managed futures fund, without recourse to a broker, may require a minimum investment of $100,000 to $1 million.
Fees for managed funds are high compared with those of more traditional investments. They include a management fee of 2 percent, plus 10 to 20 percent of any profits. Investors also pay trading commissions, which can be considerable if the portfolio has frequent turnover. Fees can erase profits if the fund has mediocre returns. 
Losses have been common when equity markets are doing well. In 1999, for example, when the stock market was booming, oil prices were steady and there was little inflation, the CSFB/Tremont index dropped 5 percent.
James M. Little, executive vice president of Campbell & Company in Towson, Md., which specializes in alternative investments like managed futures, warned that despite "more interest in our funds in the last year than I can ever recall in my 25-year career," investors need to understand that the funds won't always perform well.
The volatility of the funds makes them unsuitable for investors who cannot afford to lock up their money for at least three to five years, some financial advisers say.
"When you're dealing with futures contracts, it's like going to Vegas," said Robert Matheson, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant who heads Matheson Financial Services in Naples, Fla. "You're betting on price swings. This is not something you invest in with your bread-and-butter money."
Managed futures funds, like most other alternative investments, are difficult to liquidate. Investors are typically permitted to get out only at the end of a month, and some funds charge an exit fee to cash out before two years.
MANAGED futures funds are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Fund managers, known as commodity trading advisers, must register with the National Futures Association, which is made up of members of futures exchanges who work with the C.F.T.C. to oversee fund managers and firms. There are about 1,750 registered commodity futures funds managers today, up from 1,250 a decade ago, according to the National Futures Association.
"Make sure whomever you're talking to is licensed and reputable," said Daniel J. Roth, president of the association. Investors can call the association at (800) 366-6321 or go to its Web site at www.nfa.futures.org to check on the licensing and disciplinary history of any firm or broker. Mr. Roth said investors should also receive and carefully read a disclosure document, similar to a prospectus, before committing any money. 
Though figures on specific funds can be found in the disclosure document, comparing the results of managed futures funds is not as easy as it is among mutual funds, which are priced daily and whose results can be found in newspapers. Typically, investors must go through a financial adviser for information on a variety of funds.
"There are a lot of different types of managed funds out there," said Michael Simoff, director of alternative investments for Merrill's private wealth unit. "Some are very broadly diversified; others are very concentrated. The way they are put together will determine how risky they are."

HEADLINE: Personal Business; 
Tax Law Is Leading to Some Serial Home-Buying

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT and DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
BARTON AND CAROLYN HUGHES have changed residences twice in the last five years, and they have some sizable, tax-free profits to show for it.
 They sold their first home, a four-bedroom house in the Northern California town of Pleasanton, in 1998, moved into a smaller, three-bedroom house across town that they had previously rented out, then sold that property in 2000. The couple moved to their current home, a large, two-story house in Gold Canyon, Ariz., near Phoenix, last summer. In another year or so, they could move yet again, they say. 
 The Hugheses would not disclose all the details of the transactions but said they netted around $800,000, or enough to pay for the third house in cash, plus rebuild a retirement nest egg that had been hurt by the bear market in stocks. They also didn't have to pay taxes on their capital gains. 
"Finally, there's a tax law that's beneficial instead of detrimental," said Mr. Hughes, 59, a certified public accountant who now works as a real estate agent. He was referring to the changes in the tax law in 1997 that allow certain taxpayers to sell their primary residences without paying capital gains on the profits. 
The maximum profit now exempt from taxes is $250,000 for sellers who are single or $500,000 for those who are married and filing joint tax returns. To qualify, you must own and use a property as your principal residence for two years of the five years preceding the sale. To avoid capital gains taxes under the previous law, homeowners had to plow any profits from a sale of a home into another residence of equal or greater value. Those who traded down or became renters received a one-time-only $125,000 exemption at age 55, but otherwise had to pay tax on all their profits.
For more and more people, a house isn't just a place where they can kick off their shoes at the end of the day. It has become a lucrative, and increasingly more liquid, investment. The favorable tax laws, combined with historically low mortgage rates and a real estate market that remains relatively strong in the face of war and economic uncertainty, have encouraged people to buy and sell houses more often.
In areas where housing prices have soared -- in many parts of the Northeast and in California, for example -- the gains can be substantial. In Sacramento and San Diego, median home prices rose 27 percent between the fourth quarter of 2001 and the fourth quarter of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
"You almost have serial buyers starting to show up," said David Cobo, the chief executive of Prudential California Realty, which handles properties in the Bay Area, where price gains have also been strong.
Real estate experts say many people continue to be disillusioned by the financial markets and are just looking for alternative investments.
"Where else are they going to put their money?" said Barbara Simmons, the owner of Realty World Equity Center in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Jeffrey Hyland, the president of Hilton & Hyland Real Estate in Beverly Hills, agreed. "It's the best 401(k) plan you can have," he said.
Mr. Hyland said many of his clients were young professionals who enjoyed fixing up houses, living in them for two years and then selling, or "flipping," them. Some people make a living this way, he said.
Diane Patterson, 60, a former professional golfer who lives in Naples, Fla., said she hoped her real estate investments would help provide income for her retirement. She has no pension, she said, and her investment portfolio has been greatly reduced by the bear market in recent years.
Over the last several years, however, Ms. Patterson has bought two homes, and she said she is close to buying a third. She has lived in one of the houses for around two years, she said, and plans to put it on the market later this year. She said she hopes to eventually live in all the homes for at least two years to qualify for the capital gains exclusion, and to make a healthy profit on each. 
"I could even use a one-year law instead of two years," Ms. Patterson said. "I feel that real estate has to be my retirement."
Mr. Hughes, the C.P.A. who became a real estate agent, said he felt that way, too. "Real estate over the last few years has seen a tremendous gain," he said. The net capital gains derived from his recent transactions, he said, "more than offset the losses in the stock market."
Because of the steady increase in housing prices, some wealthy people may exceed the maximum for capital gains exclusions. Median prices for used single-family houses have climbed a total of 30 percent since 1997, according to the National Association of Realtors, but the tax-free limits on profits have remained the same.
"One thing we've told people, but they laugh at, is, 'Once you get your $500,000 in gain, you should sell your house' " and avoid taxes on additional profit, said David M. Lehn, who leads the tax group at Kleban & Samor, a law firm in Southport, Conn.
Yet for married couples whose homes have gained more than $500,000 in value, Mr. Lehn said, the tax -- usually at a federal rate of 20 percent and state rates that can reach as high as 10 percent -- is not enough to deter selling.
"If they're trying to get into another home that's even more expensive, they generally have the wherewithal to do it," he said. In Connecticut, "even with a million gain, you're only paying $125,000 in tax, so most people are going to bite the bullet and do it."
Indeed, in most cases, having to pay tax signifies the success of the investment. "The good thing is, if you have to pay taxes, then you've made a lot of money," said Russell Pruner, a partner in Shore and Country Properties at Russell Pruner & Associates in Greenwich, Conn. "People don't think of it that way, but it's true."
Timing can be the hardest issue. Mr. Lehn, the lawyer, said his clients included a couple with houses in Connecticut and Florida. After retiring, they wanted to sell the Connecticut house and move into a different, bigger house in Florida. Mr. Lehn recommended selling the Connecticut home first, then living in the original Florida house for two years -- making it their primary residence -- while the new one was being built. That way, the couple could take the maximum tax-free profits from both sales.
HOUSING economists say that they have noticed these trends anecdotally, but that effects on the overall real estate market have been difficult to track.
"Certainly a change in tax provision like that does tend to get capitalized to some degree into the prices," said David F. Seiders, the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. "That's just the way the markets work." But Mr. Seiders said it would be hard to discern how much, in a booming market, the potential to use houses as cash cows had contributed to higher prices.
The changes in the tax law six years ago did reduce taxes collected by the Internal Revenue Service. In 1997, Americans reported 174,000 profitable sales of residences with taxable capital gains averaging about $30,000. In 1998, after the law took effect, the number of profitable sales reported fell to 111,000, but the average gain did not change, according to the I.R.S.
Many middle-class homeowners are in no immediate danger of breaking the profit ceiling. People who bump up against the tax-free limits will be "up at the upper end of the market, and that's a much thinner market," said Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
For the wealthy, Mr. Lehn said, the law just "requires us to do a little bit of planning, to make sure they get out of this house and into the next one with the least tax cost possible."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Larry J. Puglia; 
T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
BLUE-CHIP stocks, particularly those of companies whose earnings have held up well during the recent economic downturn, are available at bargain prices that Larry J. Puglia says he hasn't seen in several years.
 "You don't have to pay any premium" for companies like Citigroup and Home Depot, said Mr. Puglia, who runs the $5 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth fund. While these favorites "have low price-earnings multiples," he said, "we consider them growth companies because they have shown durable, sustainable earnings growth." 
 The fund has held up better than many of its peers in the large-growth group but has still lost money recently. It declined 16.3 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with losses of 24.8 percent, on average, for all funds that buy large growth stocks and 15.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc.
The fund lost 22.4 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 24.4 percent for its group and 22.8 percent for the index.
Mr. Puglia, 42, who is based in Baltimore as a vice president of T. Rowe Price Associates, the fund's adviser, also manages about $2.5 billion for institutions.
He picks the fund's 125 or so stocks mostly among United States growth companies with market capitalizations of at least $5 billion. The projected earnings growth rate of the portfolio companies averages 14.8 percent for the next 12 months, compared with 13.2 percent for the index.
In choosing stocks, Mr. Puglia screens for accelerated growth in per-share revenue, earnings and cash flow over the last one, three and five years and projected growth during the next three and five years.
More possible purchases are found through visits with companies' management. He said the meetings give him a "high degree of confidence that management has conservative operating plans that they achieve using conservative accounting."
He also looks for what he calls "franchise businesses" with leading competitive positions, seasoned management and strong return on invested capital.
Citigroup, the financial services giant, is the fund's biggest holding, at 4.1 percent of assets. The company has an excellent balance sheet and shareholder-oriented management, Mr. Puglia said. 
Last Sunday, Sanford I. Weill, the company's chairman and chief executive, withdrew his name from consideration to be a director of the New York Stock Exchange. Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, opposed the nomination, saying it was inappropriate after Citigroup had agreed to pay $400 million in fines and other payments as part of a settlement to end an investigation into conflicts of interests among stock analysts.
Mr. Puglia said these problems "will have no influence on the company's long-term success." Its profitability held up well during the recent economic downturn, he said, because management had assembled a group of companies with strong product and geographic diversity. 
Citigroup's shares trade at less than nine times projected 2004 earnings, he added, inexpensive for a global brand. He said the company should "benefit from the global economic rebound which we believe will slowly emerge in late 2003 and 2004." The fund has owned shares since its inception. Mr. Puglia began buying more last year, paying $31.20, on average, for those additions; the stock now trades at $35.42.
Mr. Puglia has also been accumulating shares of Home Depot, the home improvement retailer. He has owned shares since the fund's inception, paying $47.80, on average, for purchases in the last 12 months. The stock, now at $24.63, has been down because investors are concerned about slowing growth, he said. But he said Robert L. Nardelli, the company's chief executive since December 2000, was repositioning the company to open fewer stores and increase returns on existing ones. Despite its problems, Mr. Puglia added, Home Depot is still the dominant company in its industry and generates high amounts of free cash flow.
HE expects another of the fund's holdings, Johnson & Johnson, the health care giant, to have strong growth in 2003 and 2004, especially if its drug-coated stents, used in angioplasty, perform as well as expected.
"However, investors are concerned that growth will slow at Johnson & Johnson subsequently because they have no large products in their pharmaceutical pipeline," he added. "We think these fears are probably misplaced, as the company will continue to innovate and also has been a savvy acquirer over time." Like Citigroup, Johnson & Johnson has excellent geographic and product breadth, he said.
The fund began buying more shares in the last year, paying $31.40, on average; they now trade at $57.38.

HEADLINE: In Times of War, Detroit Enlists; 
On Horizon, Military Sees High-Technology Trucks

BYLINE:  By SUE MEAD 

 BODY:
WHEN today's military warhorses roll into the sunset, what will take their place? Military officials, government agencies and the Detroit-based automakers are working to develop trucks and technologies for future missions.
 Under a $14 billion initiative called Combatt -- for commercially based tactical truck -- the Big Three have worked with the Army's National Automotive Center and other service branches to develop military vehicles from the architecture of existing trucks. DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor and General Motors have all built prototype Combatt trucks based on heavy-duty versions of their full-size pickups, although Ford recently dropped out of the program. 
 Hybrid diesel-electric versions of military trucks have also been developed by Dodge and Chevrolet.
The goal is a truck with the latest technology, more off-road versatility, improved fuel economy and easier maintenance. Most significant, adapting an existing truck should hold down costs. The National Automotive Center, which works to adapt commercial technologies for military applications, estimates that the government could buy trucks based on the prototypes for $30,000 less than a Humvee.
The National Automotive Center says Humvees currently cost about $62,000 each, an amount that it projects to rise to $75,000. The center estimates that pickups with Combatt modifications would range from $40,000 to $50,000.
Requirements are for a light tactical truck remanufactured to Army specifications to carry troops and cargo. Such a truck could replace, in some applications, the Humvee.
"Our mission directly affects the fighting men and women in today's Army," said Maj. Gen. N. Ross Thompson III, commander of the Army's Tank, Automotive and Armaments Command. "But we look at a support horizon that spans 70 years -- from equipment built in the mid-1960's to equipment that will still be in soldiers' hands in 2035."
The Combatt trucks receive heavy-duty modifications to meet military standards, including air springs that adjust the ride height, advanced differentials, antiroll bars of varying stiffness, bigger wheels and tires, a system that inflates or deflates the tires while moving and a "black box" data recorder. 
As the Combatt program nears completion, it remains unclear whether officials will pick a single winner, but it is clear that the modifications make the trucks appealing to government agencies and even commercial customers who need extreme off-road vehicles for logging, mining and rural firefighting. The Combatt trucks are being evaluated by 26 government agencies.
The third, current phase of the Combatt program includes hybrid electric prototypes. These hold great promise, because the trucks could useelectric power to operate silently in stealth mode. They could also generate power at remote sites.
G.M.'s Combatt hybrid also has a 5-kilowatt fuel cell that renders the vehicle largely undetectable when parked. (The fuel cell generates relatively little heat.) The fuel cell could provide up to five hours of power for the truck's surveillance hardware. 
Another program, called SmarTruck, seeks to integrate high-tech gadgetry into the Army's medium tactical vehicles, or five-ton trucks. 
The first SmarTruck concept, shown last year, was built on a Ford F-350 pickup as a platform to test antiterrorist and homeland defense systems. Like a James Bond prop, it had hidden body armor, high-voltage door handles, roof-launched grenades and devices to create oil slicks and spread tire-damaging tacks.
A new prototype, SmarTruck II, is based on a modified Chevy Silverado. The six-wheel all-wheel-drive truck has a global communications system linked to an interactive Web site, 360-degree video cameras, a laser-guided missile and an "unmanned air vehicle" -- a drone that can detect chemical weapons.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Affirmative Reaction; 
Can the Justices Buck What the Establishment Backs?

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
BY the time the Supreme Court justices take their seats on Tuesday for arguments on the future of affirmative action, they will have absorbed, or at least perused, a record number of briefs: 102 filings in the two University of Michigan cases, signed by hundreds of organizations and individuals.
 The piles of briefs are notable not so much for their size or even their imbalance (78 in support of affirmative action, 19 opposed and 5 taking neither side). A simple numbers game is easy enough to play, and to discount. 
 What is most striking is the range and sheer weight of the establishment voices on the affirmative action side. Not only the alma maters of every member of the court, but dozens of Fortune 500 companies and, most unexpectedly, 21 retired generals and admirals, including three former military academy superintendents, have signed briefs urging the justices to leave the door open to race-conscious policies in university admissions. 
The justices will be asking the questions on Tuesday, but in the meantime, here is another, more sweeping question to keep in mind: 
When the establishment speaks, does the Supreme Court listen?
Apparently the answer is often "yes," as a decision just last week illustrated. The court voted to uphold a program that channels millions of dollars a year to legal services for the poor through pooling the tiny amounts of interest earned on money that lawyers park temporarily in trust accounts for their clients. Five years ago, a 5-to-4 decision had declared the interest to be the property of the clients, under an analysis that put the court on the road to declaring that it was unconstitutional for the government to "take" this private property for a public use.
When that question reached the court this term, the most powerful voices on the legal landscape, from the American Bar Association to the chief justices of all 50 states, filed briefs deploring the consequences of taking the next step and urging the court to refrain. So it did, thanks to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who changed sides and joined what was now a 5-to-4 majority to preserve an important financing source for legal services.
Time after time, said Walter E. Dellinger, an acting solicitor general during the Clinton administration, "the court, for all its boldness, tempers the application of principle to avoid unduly upsetting the status quo." 
Mr. Dellinger should know. He made the successful argument in last week's legal services case as well as in a voting rights case two years ago that upheld the latest version of a North Carolina Congressional district that the court had earlier invalidated as a racial gerrymander. The district was now legitimate, the court found, because while race was still a factor, it was not "dominant and controlling" but rather was commingled with old-fashioned politics. The effect was to offer legislatures the promise of safe passage through the redistricting minefield that the court itself had created in a series of rulings in the mid-1990's. 
The apparent message of the initial rulings -- "don't use race" -- was deeply unsettling to the vested interests of both political parties, but the new message, "don't use race too much," was much more palatable. Here, too, Justice O'Connor changed sides and provided the fifth vote to uphold the district and extricate the court from a position that was uncomfortably to the right of the political establishment's center of gravity.
The crucial question is whether this pattern offers a template for the outcome of the Michigan cases, which challenge the preferential consideration the university gives minority applicants to its undergraduate program and its law school. Most attention has focused on Justice O'Connor because her record on race-conscious government policies, one of deep skepticism but not unequivocal opposition, has tended to make her seem the most open to persuasion by each side. 
While Justice O'Connor may or may not tip her hand during Tuesday's arguments, there has been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the atmosphere surrounding the cases in the weeks since the briefing was completed. In December, when the court agreed to hear the white plaintiffs' appeals, the sense was fairly widespread that "the death-knell of affirmative action was at hand," as David J. Garrow, a civil rights historian, phrased it. 
That sense has gradually dissipated. In January came the Bush administration's brief, filed in an atmosphere of high melodrama minutes before the court's deadline for briefs on the plaintiffs' side. While the brief did oppose the Michigan plans, which for undergraduates automatically awards admissions points to minority candidates, it did so on narrow grounds. And there was no masking what the document was: the product of a ragged, even frantic effort at compromise between those in the administration who argued for colorblindness as an immutable principle and those who wanted to bow to political reality and insisted, successfully, on leaving the door open.
The brief had the effect of undercutting the pure anti-affirmative-action view offered by other briefs on the plaintiffs' side. Would the court, or at least Justice O'Connor, feel comfortable being on the right of the Bush administration on affirmative action?
Then last month came the friends of the court on Michigan's side. Many of these briefs were written by the titans of the Supreme Court bar, the elite lawyers who are the court's repeat players. Kenneth S. Geller, an author of the authoritative treatise on Supreme Court practice, filed a brief for General Motors, one of Michigan's biggest employers. "Elimination of affirmative action in educational institutions would deprive businesses of well-trained minority candidates who are essential to our nation's economic success," the brief said.
Carter G. Phillips, a Washington lawyer who manages one of the most active Supreme Court practices, filed the brief for the retired generals and admirals that described the military's use of race-conscious measures to ensure diversity in the service academies and R.O.T.C. programs. "At present, the military cannot achieve an officer corps that is both highly qualified and racially diverse" without affirmative action, the brief said in describing an integrated officer corps as essential to national security.
Many in the anti-affirmative-action camp now say privately that they think their chance for decisive victory has slipped away. That may not be the right image. If the prediction proves correct, it may be that the chance was swept away in an establishment tidal wave that rose up to claim the Supreme Court as its own.

HEADLINE: Low Profiles and No-Shows at Golf's Showcase 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
IN a normal year, the row of small, private bungalows tucked inconspicuously along the first fairway of the Augusta National Golf Club would let a select group of corporate executives and guests attend the Masters golf tournament in the unruffled style to which many of them are accustomed.
 But this will be no normal year at the Masters. 
 The tournament's organizers, under criticism for never having invited a woman to join their club, dismissed their corporate sponsors to shield them from the controversy. So Citigroup will not fly in hundreds of its top insurance agents, and the golfers will ride in rented cars instead of new Cadillacs provided by General Motors. Neither company, meanwhile, will have use of a treasured perquisite it enjoyed in the past -- a hideaway of its own on the Augusta National grounds. 
Beyond the erstwhile sponsors, companies that have decided not to entertain clients at the tournament this year include the Southern Company, the big Atlanta utility owner, and J. P. Morgan Chase, whose chief executive, William B. Harrison Jr., is a member of Augusta National. People who know Mr. Harrison, an avid golfer, said that he is not even planning to attend; a J. P. Morgan spokesman declined to comment. 
Executives of American Express are not likely to attend either, a spokeswoman said. Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of the company, is one of the few members of Augusta National to have called publicly for women to be admitted to the club.
Other companies that have no official links to the tournament but have used Masters tickets to reward employees or clients are reluctant to discuss their plans. But sports marketing consultants say some of them are staying away, too, and many others are reducing their numbers because of the controversy, the weaker economy or both.
In their absence,what already was the most limited corporate presence at any of the most prestigious professional sports events will be even more limited when the world's best golfers tee off on April 10.
"The companies are pulling away for valid reasons," said Jeff Bliss, president of the Javelin Group, a sports marketing firm in Alexandria, Va. "Without resolution on the women's membership issue and the fact that there's been increasing media attention, more and more companies are realizing that there's a risk."
Not all companies have cut their ties to the Masters. CBS and ESPN will televise the Masters to golf fans worldwide. At Augusta National's insistence, the CBS broadcast will be free of commercials. But some businesses -- including Coca-Cola, one of the sponsors that Augusta National released from its Masters contract -- intend to advertise on the foreign telecasts. Still others, like Lucent Technologies, Sprint and Georgia-Pacific, have no official ties to the Masters or the club but plan to entertain customers at the tournament.
I.B.M. -- another of the companies that had planned to be a major sponsor -- is providing the tournament's Web site again this year. I.B.M. would not say whether it would be entertaining clients in Augusta.
A SPOKESMAN for Augusta National declined to answer questions about the corporate presence, or lack of it, at this year's Masters. People in the sports business said the club seemed intent on not providing any more targets for Martha Burk, who has challenged Augusta National's membership policies since last year. 
Dr. Burk, the chairwoman of the National Council of Women's Organizations, plans to lead a protest outside the main gate of Augusta National on April 12. Earlier, she said, she warned a General Motors executive that if the company supplied cars again this year, protesters would be carrying signs saying: "Cadillac. The official car of discrimination." 
Dr. Burk said she had considered challenging companies to "match dollar for dollar the money they spend on the Masters" to a fund for women's athletics, but she said this week that her group had decided instead to put more pressure on companies whose top executives are members of Augusta National, if the club does not admit a woman soon after the tournament. That would include publicizing the companies' records on buying from vendors owned by women and on employee diversity.
On Wednesday, Dr. Burk appeared at New York City Hall to endorse a city council resolution condemning CBS for sticking with the tournament. Other broadcasters have had to grapple with the Masters controversy, as well. The USA Network, a cable channel owned by Vivendi Universal, said it would carry the first two rounds of the Masters without commercials. But the companies that broadcast the Masters in most other countries said they planned to run advertising as usual. 
Indeed, ESPN International -- the Walt Disney Company unit that will broadcast the tournament in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and much of Asia -- has been selling commercial time to other companies to make up for the absence of Citigroup, Coca-Cola and I.B.M., said Chris Bellitti, a spokesman for ESPN International. He declined to identify any advertisers or to say whether any were American companies.
Reading from an ESPN statement, Mr. Bellitti said: "Our primary involvement with the Masters is our news coverage, and we have covered both perspectives thoroughly and fairly. We will continue to do so."
In Japan, Coca-Cola will be one of the sponsors of the Masters telecast on the Tokyo Broadcasting System, running ads for its Georgia coffee brand, said Kelly Brooks, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta. He said it was fulfilling a multiyear contract.
At Augusta National, Coke's only presence will be inside cups sold at the concession stands along the course. Even then, its role as a vendor will be veiled, because the club abhors crass commercialism. As always, the cups will not be red, and they will not display Coke's trademarks.
"The two primary benefits of our sponsorship were being able to advertise on the broadcast and having an extensive corporate hospitality program at the Masters," Mr. Brooks said. "As a nonsponsor, we will not be advertising, and we will not have any corporate hospitality."
The absence of the sponsors could largely go unnoticed by the golf fans who attend the four-day tournament. The Masters has always prohibited the corporate tents festooned with logos that have become part of the landscape at other professional golf tournaments. 
For Citigroup, whose Travelers insurance brand was a longtime sponsor of the tournament, the retreat from Augusta means there will be no junkets for hundreds of executives and sales agents. 
Travelers had efficiently circulated busloads of its best producers through one-day visits to the Masters each year. It would fly in a group of those employees, check them into a Sheraton hotel in Columbia, S.C., and ferry them over to the course. After a day following Tiger Woods and the other pros around the narrow fairways and manicured greens, they would move on to a tent in the yard of a house the company would rent in an affluent neighborhood nearby.
They would mingle over drinks and a catered buffet, hear pep talks from Citigroup executives and maybe some war stories from a pro golfer, then head back to the hotel to rest up for the trip home. The next day, another group of honored sales representatives would replace them.
At past tournaments, Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup and an Augusta National member, has presided over at least one dinner under the tent. Mr. Weill, like Mr. Chenault of American Express, has called on Augusta National to open its membership to women.
Leah C. Johnson, a Citigroup spokeswoman, declined to comment on Mr. Weill's plans for this year's Masters or the company's withdrawal on tournament sponsorship.
WITHOUT the Travelers agents and some other regular visitors, hotels and caterers in the Augusta area are feeling the pinch. Even those companies that have not abandoned the Masters have cut back.
Lucent, the telephone equipment maker, plans to send about 15 of its executives and customers to the tournament, paying for tickets, lodging and meals, said Bill Price, a spokesman.
That is a smaller contingent than Lucent has sent in the past. Mr. Price said Lucent did not feel pressure to stay away from the Masters but would spend less money there this year for financial reasons. He said the company has a strong record as a supporter of women's rights and is a good place for women to work. It has a female chief executive, Patricia F. Russo.
Sprint, the telecommunications company, is also sending about 15 executives and customers to the Masters this year, said Melinda Tiemeyer, a spokeswoman at Sprint's headquarters in Overland Park, Kan. She, too, cited economic weakness as the reason for sending fewer people to the Masters this year than last.
At least one company is benefiting from the turmoil. Without the Cadillacs that G.M. once provided, Augusta National is renting the cars it needs from Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
Robert Tuchman, presidentof TSE Sports and Entertainment, a New York firm that packages trips to sporting events, estimated that corporate attendance at the Masters would be down 30 to 40 percent over all. "The Masters is usually our big event," Mr. Tuchman said. This year, he added, more business people have made plans to attend the Final Four of the college basketball tournament in New Orleans the weekend before the Masters.
Charles Besser, president of Intersport in Chicago, said the double whammy of a soft economy and the hardening battle over Augusta National's membership has been felt at the Double Eagle, a members-only dining hall near the club.
"The number of companies that will be participating with us is off slightly, and I would point more toward the economy," said Mr. Besser, who would not name names.
PLENTY of businesspeople still want to bond with clients by squiring them around the most exclusive golf club in the country, while trying to ignore questions about who can or cannot join. At the Double Eagle, they can watch the golf on big-screen TV's while eating, checking e-mail or getting lessons from a pro on an indoor driving range, Mr. Besser said.
"Our membership is not made up of people who are vociferous in their position," he said. "These are serious businesspeople actively working on building their business relationships."
Others gave Ms. Burk more credit -- or blame -- for causing corporate executives to reconsider whether to spend part of their shrinking marketing budgets at the Masters this year.
"She's having a serious impact," said Scott Becher, president of Sports and Sponsorships, a sports marketing firm in Miami Beach. "The issue, I think, is social responsibility: is it acceptable for a company to be inviting its best customers to the Masters, given the issue that surrounds it?"

Fighting Oil Fires, and Creditors

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
THE war in Iraq might just determine the fate of a little-known Houston company, Boots & Coots International Well Control, which put out about a third of the oil-well fires set in Kuwait in 1991 and earned perhaps as much as $100 million in the process.
 Barring some drastic shift in the pattern of the war so far, the company could well go under. 
 As recently as mid-February, the company acknowledged that creditors were pressuring it to file for bankruptcy, but its fortunes seemed to take a positive swing on March 6, when the Pentagon announced that it had a plan for fighting oil-well fires. Its plan was drafted by a unit of Halliburton, Vice President Dick Cheney's former employer, which has an agreement to subcontract oil-well firefighting to Boots & Coots. 
But its fortunes looked bleak again when, contrary to many expectations, the first days of the war produced only a relative handful of fires, compared with more than 700 in 1991. Danny Clayton, the operations manager of Boots & Coots, said on Monday that he was surprised that relatively few oil-well fires had started in Iraq so far. 
"It's as easy to destroy 90 wells as it is to destroy 9," said Mr. Clayton, who ran the company's oil-well firefighting operations in Kuwait after the 1991 war. "But there's still a good chance. They have several more oil fields, and I'm sure that they are not all secured yet."
Odd as it may sound, then, the company's fortunes -- indeed, its very existence -- seem to depend on a good many Iraqi oil wells being put to the torch.
Boots & Coots was founded by Boots Hansen and Coots Matthews in 1978, when they left the employ of Red Adair, the legendary oil-well firefighter who inspired the late 1960's John Wayne film "Hellfighters." The company, which began trading in 1997, was once a thriving concern. But accidental oil-well fires have become much less common as engineering has improved.
If there are more fires, Boots & Coots might have a larger share of the work this time, said Jerry L. Winchester, the chief executive and chief operating officer, who worked for Halliburton 12 years ago coordinating the firefighting teams in Kuwait. In 1991, firefighters were sent in from China, Russia, Iran, Romania, Hungary and elsewhere. This time, the Pentagon has said it will favor American companies.
There are two other oil-well firefighters in the United States: Wild Well Control, a subsidiary of Superior Energy Services of Harvey, La., which also has a Halliburton contract in Iraq, and Cudd Pressure Control, a unit of RPC Inc. in Atlanta.
Shares of Boots & Coots have been swinging wildly. They vacillated from 47 cents to 70 cents until the start of war sent them as high as $2.55. On Friday, they closed at 83 cents. A filing in November with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the quarter ended Sept. 30 said, "The company does not have sufficient funds to meet its immediate obligations," and there is "substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern."
At the end of September, current assets totaled $4.1 million and current liabilities were $19.9 million.
On Dec. 4, Checkpoint Business, a creditor incorporated in Panama, committed $1 million in short-term working capital, Barry Gross, a spokesman for Boots & Coots, said. On Jan. 31, Boots & Coots announced that it had received a default notice from Checkpoint. By Feb. 18, Checkpoint had proposed a restructuring plan that included a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to a Boots & Coots statement. 
The board of Boots & Coots is considering the Checkpoint proposal, and the company will not provide further details until the board makes a decision, Mr. Winchester said.
Michael E. Shonstrom, the president of Shonstrom Research Associates, an institutional security analysis firm in Denver, estimated that about $20 million is needed to get Boots & Coots back on solid financial footing. But it is possible, said Mr. Shonstrom -- who owns warrants in Boots & Coots -- that the company can generate that much revenue in the current war.
The company would not say what it received for its work in Kuwait. The $100 million estimate comes from Mr. Shonstrom.
MR. CLAYTON, the operations manager, estimates that it will take four to five days to extinguish each well fire, possibly less. Boots & Coots might bill roughly $40,000 to $50,000 a day for its services, he said. That yields a very rough estimate of $160,000 to $250,000 a well. As of Friday morning, nine wells had been set on fire, with six of those extinguished, a Pentagon spokesman said. Kuwaiti firefighters and crews from Boots & Coots responded to those fires, according to a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, Lt. Col. Gene Pawlik.
Mr. Shonstrom said the shares could rise as high as $5, but that would require revenue of $200 million from the Iraq war, which would be possible only if hundreds of Iraqi oil wells burn.
The precarious financial position of Boots & Coots doesn't surprise Mr. Shonstrom. "The guys at Boots and Coots are a little more gun-slingy than the other guys," he said. "They are risk takers, from a financial perspective as well as a firefighting perspective."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 31, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Money & Business yesterday included an outdated reference to a debt owed by Boots & Coots International Well Control, which fights oil-well fires. Late Friday, after the article had gone to press, the company announced that it had fully paid its debt to Checkpoint Business Inc., a creditor incorporated in Panama. Boots & Coots is no longer considering Checkpoint's proposal that it reorganize under federal bankruptcy law.

HEADLINE: Options Calculus: Who Gets ItRight? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
LURKING in the small type of corporate financial statements is a new problem that threatens the ability of investors to divine the true health of a company's earnings.
 Companies are taking widely varying approaches to estimating the cost of the stock options they award to their executives and employees, and the differences are sometimes large enough to make comparisons between companies difficult. 
 Much of the debate over stock options during the last year has focused on whether companies should be required to subtract the cost of options from earnings. Companies now must only estimate that cost in a footnote on their financial statements.
But with investors paying more attention to those footnotes and more than 200 companies voluntarily including the options expense in their earnings, the discussion is beginning to shift to the confusion over the ways that companies calculate the cost. 
"Option expenses are easily the most misunderstood item in financial statements," said Craig Columbus, a market strategist at Thomson Financial, an investment research company. "They're riddled with inconsistencies and very subjective."
If General Motors had used Ford Motor's method, for example, G.M.'s earnings per share would have been 18 cents, or 6 percent lower than they were last year, after adjusting for stock options, according to Thomson. If Cisco Systems had made financial assumptions like the ones used by similar companies, it would have lost money last year after accounting for options, rather than appearing to earn 5 cents a share.
Those inconsistencies are starting to matter much more than they once did. Had companies counted options as a cost, the earnings per share of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have been 20 percent lower in 2001 than they actually were, according to Bear, Stearns, which based its analysis on the estimates companies made in footnotes. Two years earlier, the gap had been only 6 percent. 
More than 20 percent of large companies, meanwhile, including Ford and G.M., have said during the last year that they will begin deducting the estimated cost of options from their earnings, largely to persuade investors that their accounting is accurate. Regulators in the United States and Europe are also considering whether to require companies to count options as expenses, and, after a decade of bitter, on-and-off political debate, most analysts say a requirement is now likely.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the arbiter of corporate America's bookkeeping practices, announced this month that it would devise new rules for options accounting over the next year. Part of that effort will include studying how to estimate the cost of options. 
The International Accounting Standards Board, based in London, is also analyzing the issue, and the two bodies hope to establish consistent rules that can be used around the world, said G. Michael Crooch, a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Sir David Tweedie, the international board's chairman, has been a vocal proponent of counting options against earnings. "All around the world, people are moving in the same direction," Sir David has said.
Investors, for their part, have begun paying more attention to the options costs, even when they appear only in footnotes. Last year, S.& P. started publishing a statistic called core earnings, which subtracts large companies' own estimates of their options costs from their profits. Starting with the first-quarter earnings reports to be issued in the next few weeks, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has required companies themselves to list the cost every three months, rather than once a year.
Accounting experts emphasize that individual companies are not necessarily at fault when their estimates are out of line with a peer's. The company with the less popular method may end up being more accurate.
Companies themselves make a similar point. Executives at General Motors, for instance, say they understand that the company's estimates are different from Ford's but consider them to be accurate, said Jerry Dubrowski, a G.M. spokesman.
BUT the different estimates across corporate America are too big for all companies to be correct. This is the main reason that experts, who overwhelmingly favor required expensing of options, say a new rule by itself would only begin to solve the problem.
Regulators "should put together some series of guidelines" for how to estimate options costs, said David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at S.& P. "If they produce at least some guidelines, if not some rules, it will make life simpler for everyone. And it will cut down on some of the game playing."
The inconsistencies range from the complex to the mundane. To calculate the cost of a stock option -- which gives its holder the right to buy a share at a fixed price -- companies must estimate the future volatility of their stock. An option is more valuable when the underlying share gyrates, giving its holder many chances to cash it in. 
For example, a 10-year option with an exercise price of $20 on a stock that remains stuck at $20 for that decade is worthless. But if the stock first rises to $40, then falls to $10, then shoots up to $50, before ending the decade back at $20, the holder could have made money by redeeming the option any time the shares were trading above $20.
These volatility estimates are not easy to make, but evidence suggests that companies could do a better job simply by paying more attention to history. Since 1995, only about one-quarter of companies have more accurately predicted their volatility than they would have simply by using their past volatility as a forecast, according to Camelback Equity Consulting in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
"There is no standard method for arriving at these estimates," Patricia McConnell and Janet Pegg, accounting analysts at Bear, Stearns, wrote in a recent report. "Even the volatility assumption itself appears to be volatile." 
SBC Communications estimates its future volatility as 23 percent, based on a complex measurement. Verizon Communications, another Baby Bell, predicts its volatility as almost 29 percent, even though Verizon's volatility over the past three years has been noticeably lower than SBC's, according to Thomson.
Verizon and SBC also offer different estimates of another important part of the options formula: the length of time that people will hold on to their options. Verizon says its employees will keep their options for an average of six years, while SBC predicts an average life of 4.4 years, further increasing the gap between the two companies' estimates. 
The assumptions make Verizon's option charge look much bigger than it would if the two companies had used the same method. If Verizon had used SBC's method in 2001, Verizon's loss of 4 cents a share would have swung to a 2-cent-a-share profit.
Russell Johnson, an SBC spokesman, said that its assumptions were consistent with accounting standards. It forecasts a short average life for its options because its executives and employees have exercised their options quickly in the past, he said. Another inconsistency, however, is harder to explain. In their calculations, companies must estimate the return that investors could receive, without risk, over the same period that they are likely to hold the option. The higher this risk-free rate, the more valuable the option -- and the higher its estimated cost.
Arriving at an estimate of this risk-free rate should be the easiest part of the options calculation, accounting experts say. It should simply be equal to the annual return on a government bond issued at the same time as the option. 
"We recognize all the difficulties in this process," said Takis Makridis, an analyst at Camelback, "but this is the walk in the park."
Yet companies still arrive at different answers. Mr. Makridis points to Dillard's, the retailer based in Little Rock, Ark., and Foot Locker, based in Manhattan. In early 2001, both distributed options that they estimated would be redeemed after an average of two years. 
At the time, two-year government bonds were yielding about 4.2 percent -- roughly the risk-free rate that Foot Locker assumed. Dillard's, on the other hand, assumed a risk-free rate of 2.27 percent, lowering the size of its estimated option expense.
Julie J. Bull, a Dillard's spokeswoman, did not comment.
Mr. Makridis said: "There really is no grounding for Dillard's estimate."
CAMELBACK and Thomson Financial have decided that they can make money from the confusion, and on Tuesday the companies will begin selling to investors and companies two methods, either of which they say will make it easier to compare companies. One will average the assumptions made by similar companies and then use that average to calculate each company's charge. Another will use objective data about a company, like its historical volatility, to estimate the charge.
Corporate executives have cited the difficulties in estimating charges for options as a reason why accounting regulators should not require the charges. "There is not a reliable or accurate formula for expensing stock options," said Terry Anderson, a Cisco spokeswoman.
Executives and their lobbyists have also said that a new rule would make option awards less common and, by extension, damage the American economy by giving many people less incentive to work hard.
In the 1990's, options became many executives' favorite form of compensation, allowing many to become wealthy as the market rose. The unique accounting treatment of options, as the only form of compensation that appears to have no cost, added to their popularity.
But accounting experts argue that options do have a cost and -- like salaries, bonuses, direct stock grants and health care benefits -- should affect the bottom line. Instead of giving options to executives, companies could instead issue new shares of stock to raise capital and expand their businesses.
"Boards of directors and management think options are free to grant," said Kevin J. Murphy, a finance professor at the University of Southern California. "As a result, options are granted too freely to too many people."
Despite the current inconsistencies, accountants say a uniform system for calculating options costs is possible, noting that earnings statements already contain many economic estimates, like the rate at which machines and buildings lose their value, known as depreciation. A clear options standard might also eliminate some of the simple errors in option accounting.
"There has been some anecdotal evidence that companies have not been as careful with this number as they would have been if they had to put it in their income statement," said Mr. Crooch of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. "I am a great believer that there is greater care when a number goes into the income statement."

HEADLINE: War Comes to Guernsey Street 

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
WANDERERS in Greenpoint often stop short when they come upon the stretch of Guernsey Street between Meserole and Norman Avenues. In a landscape of warehouses and factories, this block of Brooklyn seems to appear out of nowhere, like a magical wood in a fairy tale. Graceful 19th-century apartment buildings, some with bay windows, are guarded by towering honey locust trees that in a few weeks will form a lush green canopy.
 This archetypal American block, where children once played stickball and Johnny-on-the-pony, is also a microcosm of modern gentrifying New York. Factory workers live next to Ivy League graduates, the rent for a railroad apartment can range from $100 to $1,800 a month, and Puerto Ricans, Irish-Americans and Polish-Americans -- the longtime residents of the area -- mix with artists and writers who have moved in from Manhattan or elsewhere. 
On this block, the war in Iraq plays out in neighborhood-size ways. A woman sits on her stoop and dreams of tying yellow ribbons around all the honey locusts, to honor American soldiers. A teenager groans about an essay on the war she has to write for school. Neighbors giggle at a living-room skit about Mr. Bush and Mr. Hussein -- props include a kitchen knife, a meat cleaver and some talcum powder -- and family members wait for an e-mail from Felix, a marine who is in Kuwait and who is married to a resident's daughter. 
 Given New Yorkers' fabled love of debate, this short block also offers all shades of opinion on the war. A veteran favors it, a design student rails against it, a young liberal switches from dove to hawk, a pizzeria worker blocks it out with cartoons. When it comes to people's views on Iraq, Guernsey Street is the city writ small.
 Lucy Mercado has lived on Guernsey Street for 24 years, long enough to remember when the honey locusts were three-foot sap-lings. She isn't the most senior resident -- Lillie, next door, has lived in the building for 58 years -- but with her long, shiny black hair and her raspy voice, Ms. Mercado, 42, is the unofficial queen of her block. Her throne is her stoop, her court the coterie of neighbors who gather in the evenings to share soda and beer and stories. 
 That is where they were on March 17, the night President Bush delivered his televised ultimatum to Mr. Hussein, an evening whose mild breeze carried the first whiff of winter thaw. But as she spoke about Iraq and what she saw as the need for war, Ms. Mercado was in no mood to savor the air.
 "We're talking about if they throw any chemicals," she said, shuddering as if an ice cube had touched the back of her neck. As she and her neighbors spoke, a man stepped out of the building to report on the president's speech, and predicted that war would begin Wednesday.
 Born in Puerto Rico, Ms. Mercado talks with forceful hand gestures. She guides younger neighbors, explaining to one that Mr. Hussein and Osama bin Laden are not the same thing. She translates for her husband, Freddy, who speaks mostly Spanish and who, she explains, doesn't like war but supports the president. 
 Ms. Mercado recently bought $300 worth of canned food. ("Because after they do something, are you going to eat a cow? Are you going to eat pork chops? Are you going to eat chicken?") She and her husband have another worry. Their son-in-law, Felix, 26, is a square-jawed marine in Kuwait who left behind two children, ages 3 and 4, and a nervous young wife, Gaudy, who is Freddy's daughter. 
 A mother of four, Ms. Mercado is also still haunted by 9/11. On that day, she stepped out of the Chelsea photography studio where she worked to see thousands of dust-covered survivors streaming uptown, crying. She never returned to her job, and hasn't found another one. Instead, she and her husband plan to move soon to Puerto Rico, where life is easier. 
 For now, she sits on the stoop in a purple zip-up sweatshirt and gold hoop earrings, nursing a Coors Light and listening to her cockatoo, Skipper, squawk from the apartment's open door. A small, worn American flag juts from her windowsill.

A Galvanized Student
 As Ms. Mercado relaxed, a neighbor, Heather Grossmann, was at the Turkey's Nest, a smoke-filled bar two blocks away that is patronized by grizzled blue-collar workers, hipster artists and young Hasidic men. During Mr. Bush's speech, grumbles from some were met with war whoops from others, including the owner. 
 "The proprietor was so pro-war that we didn't feel comfortable," Ms. Grossmann said. "We thought maybe we should leave." 
 Ms. Grossmann, a 26-year-old student at Parsons School of Design, was raised in Oakland, Calif., by parents steeped in antiwar tradition. Her own activism was mostly of the "reading and talking" variety until last month, when she joined tens of thousands of antiwar demonstrators on the East Side. It was her first big protest, and she was infected by the crowd's energy and the faint hope that the gathering might help avert war.
 It did not, but as Ms. Grossmann stood on her stoop on Guernsey Street the day after the president's speech, dressed in jeans and a suede jacket, she remained unflinching in her views. 
 "This thing of freeing the Iraqi people is a smoke screen, disgusting," she said. "We didn't care when they were killing the Kurds." In Ms. Grossmann's eyes, the president's concern is oil. Referring to his warning to Iraq not to burn the oil wells, she rolled her eyes. "Could you be more blatant?" she asked. 
 As Ms. Grossmann spoke, Ms. Mercado's gravely voice rose across the way in an argument with a neighbor about whether Mr. Hussein was linked to 9/11. Another neighbor, Tom Bevan, an artist from Northern Ireland, paused on his nearby stoop long enough to profess antiwar views similar to Ms. Grossman's.
 Then Ms. Grossmann caught sight of a tall man with wire-rim glasses walking toward her, and laughed. 
 "Here's my best friend, Ian," she said. "He's on the opposite side of the fence from me."

A Change of Heart
 Ian Bassin, who lives in Ms. Grossmann's building, describes himself as a "knee-jerk liberal" who opposes Mr. Bush and whose first instinct was to rage against the war. After much research, he changed his mind. The administration's diplomacy efforts had been a dismal failure, he said, but the war was necessary to neutralize a dangerous dictator. "I came around partly because I went around saying, 'O.K., what's your alternative?"' he said. "I think a lot of people don't have one." 
 Mr. Bassin, 27, was the publisher of Shout, a five-year-old national magazine on arts and politics, until it closed last month because of the poor economy. As he sat in his living room with his Australian cattle dog, Goose, under a ceiling lamp made from his brother's CAT scan, he held forth on Mr. Hussein. It was clear that Mr. Bassin had had practice explaining his positions.
 Those explanations have gotten him into some trouble. "I had a friend storm out of here the other day," he said. "We were having a very calm, rational debate, and suddenly she got up, grabbed her coat, told me I was stupid, slammed the door and left." Since then, the two have mended relations, but they don't discuss the war.

The Sports Fan
 As Mr. Bassin and his friends gathered around his television set during a presidential news conference, Nelson Segarra hurried down the building's narrow wooden stairs and made for the front door. "Ah, every channel, it's the president, the president," he moaned.
 With his close-cropped hair, muscular build and camouflage pants, Mr. Segarra, 39, looks like a marine. But when he returns from his job as a prep cook at Russ Pizza a block away, the last thing he wants to hear about is the war. "Really, I don't pay attention," he said with an easy smile. "I just live my life and that's it."
 Mr. Segarra does read The Daily News, but he has a system. "I read back to front," he said. That means sports first. "When I get to the front, I don't bother, I just close it."
 Reaching across the kitchen table, he held up a copy of the paper, which showed a basketball player dribbling around an opponent. "You don't see people going to war over sports," he said. On the front page, he had drawn a mustache and goatee on the president's face.
 But even in the sanctuary of the apartment he shares with his mother, a pair of nesting finches and some goldfish, the war intrudes. "Sometimes I just get frustrated and I just put on a videotape and get away from it, just block it out," he said. "Sometimes I watch cartoons. Anything I got, I just watch." 

The Vet in the Deli
 The Juhas deli on the corner of Guernsey Street and Norman Avenue opened on Sept. 11, 2001. The owners, a Polish couple named Sukcik, spent that first day in the street, watching the flames and smoke across the river. Since then, Juhas has blended into the neighborhood, stocking Polish imports like Zywiec beer and Katarzynki chocolate gingerbread, and, like any corner store, serving as a hub for news and gossip. 
 On the second full day of war, in front of a case displaying 43 kinds of kielbasa and lunch meat, James Wolverton chatted with the owners' son. Mr. Wolverton, a lean man with a trim white mustache who wore an "Ireland" baseball cap and a "New York City Transit" windbreaker -- he retired from the agency last year -- figures that his years in the Army during the Vietnam War should be a good hint as to his views on this one.
 "He's stalling for time, spending all that money on the 50 palaces or whatever he has," he said of Mr. Hussein. "I also think that he's aiding the terrorist groups."
 Mr. Wolverton, who lives across the street from the deli, comes in every day for coffee "au lait" and chats with the Sukciks. In a gentle voice flecked with Brooklynese, he teases them about thetraditional Polish hats and figurines that decorate the store. But a few days ago he bought their entire supply of painted wooden eggs from Poland, as gifts for the children of his five sisters. 
 Mr. Wolverton, who was born in Greenpoint 57 years ago, delivered papers as a teenager. He also remembers that many of Greenpoint's working-class sons went to Vietnam; some did not return. 
 As the city geared up for another antiwar demonstration, Mr. Wolverton recalled how Vietnam veterans who did come home were called warmongers and baby-killers by antiwar protestors. "It gave me a very bad opinion of college students," he said.
 Ewa Sukcik, the daughter of the owners of the deli and a senior at Columbia University, walked by in her blue polka-dot apron and flashed a smile. Unlike the students Mr. Wolverton remembers, Ms. Sukcik, who moved here from Krakow in 1992, generally favors the war, although she has reservations about the president's attitude toward the United Nations.
 A biology major, Ms. Sukcik especially worries about biological and chemical attacks. "I'm writing my senior thesis on anthrax," she said. "Looking at it from a biological perspective, it's very, very, very dangerous." 
 Every day, Polish customers come in and want to hear the latest war news. But on the fifth day of the war, the three local Polish papers on the counter had split their front-page coverage between the war and the three Oscars awarded to "The Pianist," a film set in Warsaw and directed by a famous, if scandal-scarred, Pole. "I couldn't believe Roman Polanski got it," said a beaming Ms. Sukcik. "People are now saying they might let him back into America."

The Speakers' Corner
 Outside, as evening fell, the sound of singing floated among the trees of Guernsey Street. Ms. Mercado and her neighbors were gathered around the stoop, singing "En Mi Viejo San Juan," a nostalgic Puerto Rican song. They broke into giggles as a reporter approached.
 "Ah, you missed it," Ms. Mercado said. "We sang 'Oh, Say Can You See,' and we said the Pledge of Allegiance." Her neighbor and goddaughter, Daisy Pacheco, added, "We're celebrating the war."
 Ms. Mercado's window was freshly adorned with four new American flags, a poster of an eagle and a large, elaborate yellow bow made by a local florist. She had wanted to go door to door up and down the block, taking up a collection to buy yellow ribbons for every tree on the street. "But we know if we do it, people are going to just close the door in our faces," she said. "There's a lot of Polish people who don't like Spanish people, you know." 
 She sighed, imagining the effect a corridor of decorated trees would create. "Someone would go by and say, 'Damn, these people really care for our soldiers."'
 On this weekday evening, Ms. Mercado's younger children, Crystal and Nesito, ran up and down the sidewalk with neighbors, playing hide-and-seek and ghost in the graveyard. Crystal, 16, a junior at Queens Vocational High School, grimaced, remembering she was supposed to write a report on the war. She planned to ask her father for help. Nesito, 13, said watching the war on television makes him worry that a bomb will be dropped here.
 A few nights earlier, the family had staged their own war. Ms. Mercado's husband, wearing thick-framed glasses and a scarf wrapped around his head like a turban, played Mr. Hussein (he already had the mustache). Hamming for a video camera as merengue music played, he brandished a kitchen knife, threatening in mock Arabic laced with Spanish to "kill all the Americans." Nesito dusted hisblack hair with talcum powder to look like Mr. Bush and, drowning in his father's suit, held up a meat cleaver and replied in a Texan accent, "That knife don't mean nothing to me." Crystal, wearing knee-high boots, played a reporter named Cha Cha Chu who analyzed each side's weaponry. 
 The family was in hysterics then. But this night, sitting beside her new flags and her ribbon, Ms. Mercado was serious. Some marines, names still unkown, had been killed that day. Just before the war, Felix had sent an e-mail saying he was fine, but the family had heard nothing since. She went into to her apartment and gazed at a photograph of Felix, a broad-shouldered man, grinning at the camera with his arm draped around his wife. 
 On the seventh day of the war, Ms. Mercado left a phone message for a reporter. 
 "I'm just calling to let you know that I had word on Felix Rosa, my son-in-law, from his commanding officer, and everything is O.K.," she said. Then, with the folksy friendliness that has made her stoop the Speakers' Corner of Guernsey Street, she continued: "I also wanted to give you a conclusion of my little area and my story. You know, I feel that all this is going to go down in history and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to open their history books and read about the 2003 war. O.K.? You have any questions, just give me a call tomorrow."

FOR every cheap imitation in Chinatown, there is usually an upmarket equivalent. One end of Canal Street specializes in knockoff Rolexes, the other in vintage timepieces. Porcelain vases date back to last month's factory shipment, or to the imperial courts of the Tang Dynasty. The same goes for hobby fish, and these days the high end is a seller's market, propelled by competitive collectors willing to spend a lot on the latest status symbols. 
 For years, the Cadillacs of pet fish were silver arowanas and pigeon blood discuses, instantly recognized as a sign of good taste and fat wallets. 
 But in the past two years they have been eclipsed by a newcomer, a highly cultivated specimen called the flower horn. 
 "They're like prized orchids, except they swim," said a local fishmonger. "And they're selling like hot cakes." 
 The fish, related to the angelfish and oscar, has a crowning lump, or horn, on its head. The chest is richly colored, ranging from blood red to neon purple. Its black spots can blossom into flowerlike patterns. 
 "It's like looking at a cloud," said Al Vin Koy, who owns Flowerfish.com, a fishery in Malaysia, the country where most flower horns are bred. "Sometimes, the spots form a Chinese character or lucky number." 
 In such cases, the fish can fetch several thousand dollars. One such fish reportedly sold for $100,000 at auction in Singapore.
 Flower horns made their debut in New York two years ago at select fish boutiques, like Blue Ocean Aquarium and 38 Aquarium, both in Chinatown. Among the early buyers was Stephen Choi, 48, who runs a wholesale vegetable company at Allen and Division Streets. 
 On a Sunday afternoon in March, Mr. Choi was at his office, remodeling his fish tank. To get there, one has to cross a loading dock stacked high with bok choy, and squeeze past a thick wall of plexiglass, like those in liquor stores in the wrong part of town. 
 But this plexiglass guards Mr. Choi's pride and joy: a 14-inch flower horn. The fish has a black mark that bears a striking resemblance to a Chinese character that means "bountiful prosperity." It may be the most expensive fish in Chinatown. A nearby pet shop owner estimated its value at $5,000.
 This fish, however, is not for sale. "It brings good luck," Mr. Choi said. "It has a large head, which means long life. All my friends have flower horns, but I have the nicest one. It's the biggest. I play with him all the time. You see, he follows my fingers." 
 As Mr. Choi tapped on the glass, three fellow collectors were subdividing his 100-gallon tank to accept two more flower horns. The partitions, besides showing off the fish like trophies, are necessary because male flower horns are extremely territorial and will fight to the death if allowed to mingle. In fact, some owners stage contests, like cockfights, with their less attractive specimens. 
Mr. Choi likes fish far too much for that. His collection also includes an albino catfish, a pacu (a cousin of the piranha) and 138 blood parrot fish. "That's a very lucky number," he said. "If one dies, I buy another." Every self-respecting restaurant in Chinatown had blood parrots on display when the fish was introduced a decade ago, but, like the silver arowanas and pigeon blood discuses, they have also largely gone out of fashion with the arrival of flower horns. 
 "When the parrot fish first came out, they were going for $25 each," said Jim Cuppola, who owns Tri-County Tropical, a wholesale fish supplier in Richmond Hill, Queens. "Now it's less than a dollar." 
 The origin of the flower horn is murky, but it is believed by hobbyists to be a hybrid of the blood parrot, which is itself a hybrid, and of a three-spotted Central American fish known as Amphilophus trimaculatus. The modern version of the flower horn came into existence around 1996, with every season bringing new variations with names like Shanghai Night and Golden Buddha. 
 NO one is certain how long a flower horn lives -- estimates range from 6 to 10 years -- and some have grown as long as 18 inches. More important than length, of course, is the girth of the horn. "The bigger the head, the more beautiful," said Alex Soo, 40, an unemployed chef who recently paid $1,000 for a Golden Butterfly flower horn that is the envy of his friends. Mr. Soo lives in a crowded Mott Street apartment where he keeps several mirrors by his tank, on the theory that as the fish attacks its own reflection, its mounting aggression will enlarge the horn. With a similar goal in mind, some owners feed their flower horns sushi-grade salmon. 
 Mr. Soo makes do with fish flakes and dried krill, a tiny shrimplike creature, and compensates by teaching his fish to do somersaults, which also stimulates the horn. The fish is not quite Flipper, but it can swim sideways and upside down, and, with prodding, gracefully rotate 360 degrees. 
 "My family thinks I'm crazy," Mr. Soo said, still playing with the fish. "It's the most expensive thing I own." Friends have offered Mr. Soo $4,000 for the fish, but he has declined their requests. He would lose not only the fish, but also the bragging rights. 
 The price of flower horns has dipped recently, because of excessive breeding, and several non-Asian pet shops, including Fish Town USA in Flushing, Queens, have started carrying run-of-the-mill ones for $8. Whether it catches on remains to be seen. 
 "It's primarily an Asian hobby," said Paul Loiselle, the curator of freshwater fish for the New York Aquarium at Coney Island.
 For Mr. Choi and his friends, keeping ornamental fish is practically a religion. "It's like having a second wife," Mr. Choi said. After spending three hours subdividing the tank, he finally retrieved the new flower horns from his nearby apartment. One was olive green with electric-blue freckles; the other was mandarin orange with pearlescent white dots. Mr. Choi scooped them gently into their new homes, and pulled up a chair. "Sit, enjoy," Mr. Choi said, like a proud father. "This is my collection."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LONG ISLAND CITY; 
Something There Is That Does Not Love This Wall

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
It is a little like asking the Statue of Liberty to dye her hair.
 Members of Community Board 2 in western Queens are asking the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center to remove the signature concrete wall that surrounds its outside galleries as a condition for supporting the museum's request for a long-term lease with the city. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation, the agency negotiating the lease with the museum, says the board is supposed to weigh in on the agreement. 
 "The community board has to approve the business terms of a long-term lease, its rate and length of time," said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the agency. A resolution asking the museum to take down the wall in return for the board's support of the lease is to be taken up at a meeting on Thursday.
 P.S. 1 wants to sign a 20-year lease with the city to solidify its hold on its building, a former public school that it now operates on a month-to-month lease. But members of the community are unhappy about the 12-foot-high wall that was erected in 1997 around the museum's outside galleries, as part of a major renovation.
 "There used to be at P.S. 1 a garden, and it was surrounded by a see-through fence," said Joseph Conley, the board's chairman. "But the fence came down and was replaced by this cold, dank cement wall." The change, he said, signaled a turning away of the museum from the community. 
 Alanna Heiss, director of P.S. 1, defended both the wall and the outdoor art space it defines. 
 "The wall protects the area, and we hang art on it," she said. "These are outdoor galleries, not a garden." 
 The 50,000-square-foot outdoor galleries attract thousands of visitors, particularly to the "urban beach" exhibition that has been installed for the past three summers and to an annual community day that lets residents of western Queens take part in free activities like face-painting, mask-making and concerts. 
 When the wall was first installed, some residents complained that it would attract posters and graffiti. "No such thing has happened," Ms. Heiss said.
 Instead, the wall has drawn praise from critics and civic institutions. The Municipal Art Society gave its Brendan Gill award to Frederick Fisher, the architect responsible for the P.S. 1 renovation. 
 Would the museum trade a notable structure for the long-term lease it is so eager to have? "We're certainly not going to do it," Ms. Heiss said. JIM O'GRADY

Markets Falter, but It's Not Just the War

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Worries that the war in Iraq would not be a cakewalk for the United States pushed down all the major stock market averages last week.
 Investors also had to confront more evidence that the economy remains anemic. 
On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending on big-ticket items fell sharply again in February. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.4 percent, or 376.20 points, to 8,145.77. Only two of the 30 stocks in the average moved higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-index fell 3.6 percent, or 32.40 points, to 863.50. And the Nasdaq composite index, the only major market measure that is still in the black for the year, slipped by 3.7 percent, or 52.24 points, to 1,369.60.
 For the Dow and the S.& P. 500, it was the worst performance since the week ended Jan. 24. For the Nasdaq composite, it was the worst since the week ended Jan. 17.
 Broadcom, the biggest maker of cable modem chips, had a bad week. Its stock was downgraded by Morgan Stanley and fell nearly 20 percent for the week.
 In the fixed-income market, the yield on the Trea-sury's benchmark 10-year note fell to 3.90 percent, from 4.10 percent a week earlier. KENNETH N. GILPIN

Today's Lesson, Class, Is This: Ethics Really Matter in Business

BYLINE:  By Neil Genzlinger (COMPILED BY MARK A. STEIN)

 BODY:
Given the recent ethical mess involving Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, it might seem odd that Todd Thomson, Citigroup's chief financial officer, is headed for a rendezvous on Thursday with about 600 impressionable young people at the High School of Economics and Finance in Lower Manhattan.
 But not to Mr. Thomson. 
In fact, he said, "one of the things I'm curious about is how up to date they are on recent news." (Will they remember that Salomon Smith Barney agreed last year to pay $400 million to end an investigation into conflicts of interest among its stock analysts?) 
 Mr. Thomson will serve as principal for a day at the high school on Thursday. It's part of a citywide program known as Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning, or Pencil, and he is one of 1,300 people from business, entertainment, politics and other fields who will participate.
Mr. Thomson, 42, said that he would welcome students' questions, including those about business ethics, but that he would also be doing a lot of listening.
With his own three children not quite in high school yet (the oldest is 10), he said he doesn't have a good feel for what teenagers are interested in "and what they're interested in becoming."
These particular teenagers owe a lot to Citigroup: in 1993, its financial support helped create the school, which is next to the World Trade Center site.
Mr. Thomson also said his day at school should score him points with his family. His father was a principal (and, later, head of a national principals' association), and many other family members have been educators as well. "They'll recognize now that I've finally made it," he said. Neil Genzlinger

Fed Economist Predicts Faster Return to Stocks

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
Americans who have moved money out of the stock market are likely to resume their embrace of equities much faster than investors did after big losses in the 1970's, according to a new research paper by an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
 Last week in the FRBSF Newsletter, Milton H. Marquis, a senior economist of the bank, noted that the size of most American stock portfolios has fallen sharply since the peak of the bull market in 2000, while the value of their investments in cash, bonds and housing has risen. 
During the bear market of the 1970's, similar shifts in holdings occurred. But it took eight years for investors to increase their stock allocations significantly, he said. 
 This time around, he said, Americans can be expected to move money into the stock market much more quickly. He cited what he saw as the fundamental strength of the economy, the important role of technology in enhancing productivity as well as market innovations like the growth of mutual funds and 401(k) plans as factors propelling a renewed embrace of stocks. "Households should begin to weight stocks more heavily in their asset holdings," he said, "making it unlikely that we will see a replay of the protracted bear market of the 1970's."

Teenager's Paths Diverge, Slightly, in Cyberspace

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Young boys and girls have similar tastes in Web sites, but those similarities fade as they grow older.
 There are thousands of sites from which to choose, but a 2002 survey by the Zandl Group found that nick.com, Nickelodeon's site, and yahoo.com were popular among boys and girls 8 to 12. Neopets.com, a game site, was No. 3 with girls and No. 5 with boys. 
 Teenage boys and girls liked yahoo.com the best, but the boys also preferred online auction and sports sites. The girls favored fashion sites and chat rooms.
 Another recent survey by Teenage Research Unlimited helps explain the differences. About 80 percent of teenage girls who go online use e-mail, compared with 69 percent of boys. About 60 percent of the boys play games online, compared with 50 percent of the girls. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

A Hall of Bronzed Icons, Longing for Golden Days
Time and timing have not been kind to a once-renowned but now obscure shrine to some of America's greatest achievers.
 We are talking here of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, a pantheon of 98 larger-than-life bronze busts in an open-air colonnade in the Bronx that calls itself the nation's "original hall of fame." 
 Two years ago, on the centennial of the hall's dedication, its stewards began a campaign to raise $500,000 to finance creation of four more busts -- those of figures inducted into the hall in the 1970's but still not cast in bronze because of a perennial lack of money -- and to create interactive exhibits. These are considered essential for at least partly reversing a steep drop in attendance since the 1950's.
The hall, at West 181st Street and University Avenue in University Heights, was created as part of a Bronx campus that New York University established a century ago as a second location and occupied until 1973. Enshrined in the 630-foot-long neo-Classical colonnade are presidents and poets, inventors and scientists, authors and painters, educators and more, inducted from 1900 to the mid-1970's. 
There are giants like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the Wright Brothers and Thomas Edison. Many honorees, though, are far from household names, like Maria Mitchell (1818-89), the first American woman to be a professional astronomer. 
Nowadays, 25,000 to 50,000 people visit the hall each year, far fewer than during its "golden days" from the 1920's to the 50's, its director, Ralph Martin Rourke, said last week. He did not have figures for those times. Half the visitors are children on class trips; many of today's New Yorkers have never heard of the hall. But, Mr. Rourke said it remained a "rich cultural source."
In June 2001, Fernando Ferrer, then the Bronx borough president, earmarked $500,000 for the hall. But the grant was contingent on a like amount to be raised by Bronx Community College, now the campus's occupant and the hall's custodian.
Nearly two years later, the college reports a very disappointing response to its effort to meet the requirement. "A little over $2,000" has come in, said M. Starita Boyce, executive director of the Bronx Community College Foundation. That was from a small group of N.Y.U. alumni. The bulk of the effort has involved approaching seven foundations, she said, all of which said that tight economic times made them unable to help.
"I haven't given up," she said.

Out of Borough Hall, But Not Borough Life
 Fifteen months after ending 16 years as Queens borough president -- years of fighting for more money from City Hall for her borough and working to better life for its residents -- Claire Shulman is no longer dealing for dollars with mayors, but she still spends time on borough betterment.
She serves as a nonpaid member on the boards of several nonprofit groups, she said, including one that establishes clinics in medically underserved areas. "I have a particular interest in getting a new building for a health center in Far Rockaway," she said. She also has paid board memberships with a bank and a cemetery.
In 2001, term limits kept her from seeking another stint in Borough Hall. "There are times I miss it," said Ms. Shulman, 77. But she does not simply reminisce. She said she was giving several lectures at Queens College this semester to "older people interested in government." 
"I tell them how to fight City Hall," she said.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: DOMESTIC SECURITY; 
Missile Threat Is Bringing Stricter Rules for Airports

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28 

 BODY:
Federal authorities will order major security improvements at several of the nation's largest airports after inspections showed that passenger planes taking off or landing at those airports would be vulnerable to attack by terrorists using shoulder-fired missiles, senior Bush administration officials said. 
 The inspections, which began several weeks ago, are being conducted by a federal task force created by the White House late last year after terrorists linked to Al Qaeda tried to shoot down an Israeli passenger plane on takeoff from an airport in Kenya in November. The two small, shoulder-fired missiles barely missed the plane. 
 Administration officials would not identify the airports that would be required to make major safety improvements, citing security reasons. But they said the list included several of the nation's busiest, and that the improvements would include new, round-the-clock security patrols and tightened electronic surveillance of the flight paths used for takeoffs and landings. 
This week, dozens of National Guard troops were deployed to the Los Angeles International Airport to patrol the perimeter and road checkpoints, in part because of what officials acknowledged was concern about shoulder-fired missiles. 
A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International airports, said it was aware of the missile threat and was responding to it. The spokesman, Pasquale DiFulco, said the port authority had a policy of not discussing details of its security planning. "But we have certainly taken the necessary steps and precautions to address these issues," Mr. DiFulco said.
Bush administration officials said that nationwide inspections, which have been carried out at roughly 80 airports by officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies, demonstrated that a terrorist with a shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile weighing as little 30 pounds would find it relatively easy to evade security at many large airports and fire a missile that could bring down a passenger plane.
American intelligence and law enforcement agencies say that Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups are believed to have an arsenal overseas of dozens of shoulder-fired missiles, including the American-made Stinger and the Russian SA-7, and that others can be bought by terrorists on the black market for several thousand dollars each.
Many of the Stingers available on the black market are left over from the American-backed guerrilla effort in Afghanistan to force out Soviet troops in the 1980's. The Stinger and missiles like it are capable of shooting down planes several miles away at heights of more than 10,000 feet.
Administration officials stressed that they had no evidence to suggest that Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups had managed to smuggle any of the small missiles into the United States, or that they intended to try.
"We are not aware of any credible, specific intelligence information that Manpad attacks are being planned against commercial aircraft in the U.S. at this time," said James M. Loy, director of the Transportation Security Administration, using the acronym for Man Portable Air Defense Systems, the technical name for the missiles. "The administration does, however, recognize the potential threat."
Officials say the attempt to shoot down the Israeli plane in Kenya last November had created alarm in Washington that Al Qaeda would try a similar attack in the United States. The incident near the international airport at Mombasa came six months after a similar Russian-made missile was fired at an American military plane in Saudi Arabia. That missile also missed.
American intelligence officials say that in the attacks in both Kenya and Saudi Arabia, the planes may have been saved by antimissile technology that is routinely installed in Israeli passenger jets and United States militaryplanes.
There is no similar federal requirement that antimissile defense systems be built into American passenger planes. But since the Kenya attack, a growing bipartisan movement in Congress has called for the installation of antimissile systems on American-owned commercial planes in the United States.
After a Congressional briefing on the issue by representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon earlier this month, Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation, said that the missile threat was sobering and "we can't afford not to act." Mr. Mica said that he would seek immediate federal financing to protect commercial planes against terrorist missiles.
Federal aviation officials say that it costs about $1 million to $2 million to outfit a passenger plane with equipment to deflect a missile. 
There are a variety of different types of antimissile technologies available, including a system that releases decoy flares to draw a heat-seeking missile away from a plane; other systems use jamming equipment to interfere with a missile's guidance system.
In a speech last month to an air travel conference in Thailand, Steven J. McHale, the No. 2 official in the Transportation Security Administration, warned his Asian counterparts about the dangers of portable missiles and called on their governments to step up security around their airports and to make sure that their own military stocks of the missiles were secure. "There are thousands available on the gray and black markets, and many of these are finding their way into the hands of terrorist groups," Mr. McHale said.
Asa Hutchinson, the under secretary for border and transportation security in the Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview that the federal government had taken a variety of steps in recent months to deal with the missile threat at major airports, although he could not reveal details for security reasons. "We're much better off than we were some time ago," Mr. Hutchinson said. "But certainly this is a threat and a vulnerability that we're concerned with."
While the federal government has the authority to order airports to step up counterterrorism measures, Mr. Hutchinson said the Department of Homeland Security understood the budget constraints on many large airports. "There will be negotiation," he said. "Obviously we're not going to be telling them to do something they're totally incapable of doing."
The worldwide inventory of portable surface-to-air missiles is estimated at 700,000, according to government officials and private weapons specialists. The vast majority of those missiles are in government arsenals, but munitions specialists say that shoulder-fired missiles like the Stinger and the SA-7 are so small and portable that many are diverted from government stocks each year and sold on the black market. A Stinger is about 5 feet long, 6 inches wide and weighs about 35 pounds when fully armed.
John Iannarelli, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said that many airports were being asked to step up their training of security officers to be on the lookout for the missiles. "A lot of this is educational," Mr. Iannarelli said. Administration officials said some large airports had stepped up anti-missile security measures long before the federal inspectors arrived.
Logan Airport in Boston is flanked on three sides by water, and airport officials have provided local clam diggers with mobile phones to allow them to call in if they see suspicious activities. 
The chief spokesman at San Francisco International Airport, Mike McCarron, said that inspectors from the Transportation Security Administration completed their review of the airport's antimissile defense this month. Mr. McCarron said airport officials believed San Francisco International was better protected than others because it is surrounded by water, allowing the Coast Guard to keep a close eye on activities nearby. He said that the airport had also stepped up its road patrols on the perimeter of the airport.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE TROOPS; 
Military Mirrors a Working-Class America

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and STEVEN A. HOLMES 

 BODY:
They left small towns and inner cities, looking for a way out and up, or fled the anonymity of the suburbs, hoping to find themselves. They joined the all-volunteer military, gaining a free education or a marketable skill or just the discipline they knew they would need to get through life.
 As the United States engages in its first major land war in a decade, the soldiers, sailors, pilots and others who are risking, and now giving, their lives in Iraq represent a slice of a broad swath of American society -- but by no means all of it. 
 Of the 28 servicemen killed who have been identified so far, 20 were white, 5 black, 3 Hispanic -- proportions that neatly mirror those of the military as a whole. But just one was from a well-to-do family, and with the exception of a Naval Academy alumnus, just one had graduated from an elite college or university. 
A survey of the American military's endlessly compiled and analyzed demographics paints a picture of a fighting force that is anything but a cross section of America. With minorities overrepresented and the wealthy and the underclass essentially absent, with political conservatism ascendant in the officer corps and Northeasterners fading from the ranks, America's 1.4 million-strong military seems to resemble the makeup of a two-year commuter or trade school outside Birmingham or Biloxi far more than that of a ghetto or barrio or four-year university in Boston.
Today's servicemen and women may not be Ivy Leaguers, but in fact they are better educated than the population at large: reading scores are a full grade higher for enlisted personnel than for their civilian counterparts of the same age. While whites account for three of five soldiers, the military has become a powerful magnet for blacks, and black women in particular, who now outnumber white women in the Army.
But if the military has become the most successfully integrated institution in society, there is also a kind of voluntary segregation: while whites and blacks seek out careers in communications, intelligence, the medical corps and other specialties in roughly equal numbers, blacks are two and a half times as likely to fill support or administrative roles, while whites are 50 percent more likely to serve in the infantry, gun crews or their naval equivalent.
Sgt. Annette Acevedo, 22, a radio operator from Atlanta, could have gone to college but chose the Army because of all the benefits it offered: travel, health coverage, work experience and independence from her parents. The Army seemed a better opportunity to get started with her life and be a more independent person, she said.
Specialist Markita Scott, 27, a reservist from Columbus, Ga., called up as a personnel clerk in an Army deployment center, says she is now planning to make a career of the Army. "Oh, yes, I am learning a skill," said Specialist Scott, who is black. "I get a lot of papers that are not correct, and so I know I'm helping the person. It could be making sure the right person is notified in case of an emergency, or maybe I tell them, 'You know, if you do your insurance this way, the money will not go directly to the child, but the child's guardian,' and they say, 'Oh, I don't want it going to my ex.' "
Lt. James Baker, 27, of Shelbyville, Tenn., who is white, enlisted in the National Guard. The Tennessee Guard had no infantry units, so he chose artillery instead. "Artillery is exciting," he said. "I get to blow a lot of stuff up and play in the woods. The Army is the biggest team sport in the world."
Confronted by images of the hardships of overseas deployment and by the stark reality of casualties in Iraq, some have raised questions about the composition of the fighting force and about requiring what is, in essence, a working-class military to fight and die for an affluent America.
"It's just not fair that the people that we ask to fight our wars are people who join the military because of economic conditions, because they have fewer options," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat from Manhattan and a Korean War veteran who is calling for restoring the draft.
Some scholars have noted that since the draft was abolished in 1973, the country has begun developing what could be called a warrior class or caste, often perpetuating itself from father or uncle to son or niece, whose political and cultural attitudes do not reflect the diversity found in civilian society -- potentially foreshadowing a social schism between those who fight and those who ask them to.
It is an issue that today's soldiers grapple with increasingly as they watch their comrades, even their spouses, deploy to the combat zone. "As it stands right now, the country is riding on the soldiers who volunteer," said Sgt. Barry Perkins, 39, a career military policeman at Fort Benning, Ga. "Everybody else is taking a free ride."

The Way It Was
The Vietnam War And the Draft's End
 The Vietnam War looms large as the defining epoch in the creation of what has become today's professional, blue-collar military.
It led to the creation of an all-volunteer force, when the Nixon administration, in an attempt to reduce opposition to the war, abolished the draft in 1973. 
Because the draft provided deferment to college students, the burden of being sent to Vietnam fell heavily on the less well educated and less affluent. And because of the unpopularity of the war, military service was disdained by many members of the nation's elite, leading their children to lose the propensity to serve that had characterized earlier generations of America's privileged.
As a result, the Americans who fought in the Vietnam War looked very different from the professional corps now fighting in Iraq and stationed around the globe.
The 2,594,000 troops who served in Vietnam between 1965 and 1972 were younger, much less likely to be married and almost entirely male, according to a study of Defense Department data by Richard K. Kolb, the editor and publisher of VFW magazine.
The average soldier in a combat unit in Vietnam was 19 or 20 years old and unmarried, Mr. Kolb said. Of the 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam, 61 percent were 21 or younger; of the enlisted men killed, only about 25 percent were married.
"I can only recall one guy I served with who was married, and he was about 30 and a lifer," said Mr. Kolb, who was a 19-year-old radio operator in Vietnam in 1970.
By contrast, the average age of the 28 men killed in the war with Iraq so far is 26, and 8 of the 22 enlisted men who died, or 36 percent, were married.
In the Army, about 25 percent of enlisted men were married in 1973. Today that figure has almost doubled. 
Another major difference, of course, is that few women served in Vietnam, and women were not allowed in combat units. Only 7,494 women served in Vietnam, of whom 6,250 were nurses, according to the Defense Department. Of the 58,000 Americans who died in Vietnam, only eight were women, all of them nurses, and only one is officially listed as killed in action.
There were no female prisoners of war in Vietnam. By contrast, one female soldier has already been captured in Iraq and two others are listed as missing in action. Women are enlisting in far greater numbers today, especially since the Pentagon lifted many of the restrictions on women serving in combat. Fifteen percent of all officers and enlisted personnel are women.
The existence of the draft during the Vietnam War, and the war's growing unpopularity as the years passed without victory, also created fundamental differences in the makeup of the armed forces. Soldiers tended to enlist for single tours of duty and then go back quickly to civilian life, making for a higher turnover rate and less professionalism than the Pentagon boasts of now. Today, the average enlistee stays about seven years, up from less than two years in 1973.
But Mr. Kolb and other experts say the widespread idea that the Army in Vietnam was made up mostly of draftees is incorrect. In fact, only 25 percent of all American forces in Vietnam were draftees, compared with 66 percent in World War II.
"With me, it was not a question of whether I would enlist, but when," Mr. Kolb said. "I grew up in a small town, and my father and uncles had all served in World War II. Enlisting was what we did in my family."
Among the many myths of Vietnam that persist today, experts say, is that it was a war fought by poor and black Americans, who died in greater proportions than whites.
Although that was true in the early stages of the American ground war, in 1965 and 1966, when there were large numbers of blacks in front-line combat units, Army and Marine Corps commanders later took steps to reassign black servicemen to other jobs to equalize deaths, according to Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. in "Vietnam War Almanac."
By the end of the war, African-Americans had suffered 12.5 percent of the total deaths in Vietnam, 1 percentage point less than their proportion in the overall population, Colonel Summers wrote.
Servicemen from states in the South had the highest rate of battlefield deaths, 31 per 100,000 of the region's population, Mr. Kolb found. Soldiers from states in the Northeast had the lowest rates, 23.5 deaths per 100,000.
Since the end of the draft, that geographic skew on the battlefield has extended to the services as a whole. The percentages of people from the Northeast and Midwest have dropped, while the proportion from the West has climbed and from the South has skyrocketed -- even after accounting for southward and westward population shifts in society at large. For the year ending Sept. 30, 2000, 42 percent of all recruits came from the South.
Over all, Mr. Kolb said, 76 percent of the soldiers in Vietnam were from working-class or lower-income families, while only 23 percent had fathers in professional, managerial or technical occupations.
The disparity created by the Vietnam draft can be seen on the walls of Memorial Hall and Memorial Church at Harvard University, where the names of Harvard students and alumni who died for their country are inscribed. There were 200 Harvard students killed in the Civil War and 697 in World War II, but only 22 in Vietnam.
For Stanley Karnow, the journalist and author of "Vietnam: A History," who began reporting from Vietnam in 1959, the contrast with World War II was personal. When he turned 18 in 1943, he dropped out of Harvard and enlisted in the Army. In 1970, when his son turned 18 and became eligible for the draft, he was also a Harvard student. "We did everything we could to keep him out of the draft," Mr. Karnow said.

Signing Up
Recruiting Office As Melting Pot
If the nation's wealthy and more well-educated youth have shunned the military, others less privileged have gravitated toward it.
Compared to their contemporaries in civilian life, the armed forces have a greater percentage of minorities, a higher proportion of high school graduates and better reading levels. As a group, about 60 percent of enlisted men and women are white; they tend to be married and upwardly mobile, but to come from families without the resources to send them to college.
While blacks make up about 12.7 per cent of the same-age civilian population, they constitute about 22 per cent of enlisted personnel. Perhaps most striking is the number of enlisted women who are black: more than 35 percent, according to Pentagon figures, indicating not only that black women enlist at higher rates, but that they stay in the military longer. In the Army, in fact, half of all enlisted women are black, outnumbering whites, who account for 38 percent.
In Chicago Heights, Ill., the Marine Corps recruiting office was filled on Wednesday with the huffs and puffs of more than a dozen fresh young recruits, mostly wearing buzz cuts, doing crunches and chin-ups.
The afternoon workout is a ritual for these newest marines, a gregarious group made up mainly of 17- and 18-year-olds who still have to get fitted for prom tuxes and graduate from high school before shipping out in just a few months. They resemble the American melting pot: Hispanics, blacks, whites, young men and one young woman.
Patriotism and the prospect of getting a chance to go to Iraq, where the action is, played a role in their decisions to enlist, the recruits said. But Lori Luckey, 24, a single mother of three girls, said the main reasons she signed up for the Marines were to get a chance at a career and the opportunity for advancement, to see the world, and to obtain a dental plan and other benefits.
Others, like Myles Tweedy, 18, a high school senior whose baby face is adorned with a goatee, said joining the military was a family tradition. Mr. Tweedy's father was an infantryman in Vietnam, and his grandfather was in the Army as well. "Now it's my turn," Mr. Tweedy said. "It's something I knew I was always going to do."
Jonathan Lewis, 18, who said he enlisted for the benefits, and out of a sense of patriotism, said he figured he had less to fear as a marine in Baghdad than in the streets of Chicago, where he lived for 12 years until his family moved to the south suburbs.
"Being over in Baghdad, you've got a thousand people 100 percent behind you," he said. "Around here, who says you can't be going to McDonald's and that's it? Over there, you're part of everybody, you're with your friends and family, you're still safe."
Ms. Luckey has already made plans for her two oldest daughters, 6 and 4, to stay with their paternal grandmother when she leaves in May for 16 weeks of basic training. Her youngest daughter, not yet 2, will stay with Ms. Luckey's mother.
A corrections officer for six years, she says her job "was just so dead-end." She decided to resign in November and enlisted in the Marines, eyeing not just the benefits but also a fairer chance of advancement.

The Race Issue
Equal Opportunity On the Battlefield
 Though Hispanics are underrepresented in the military, their numbers are growing rapidly. Even as the total number of military personnel dropped 23 percent over the last decade, the number of Hispanics in uniform grew to 118,000 from 90,600, a jump of about 30 percent.
While blacks tend to be more heavily represented in administrative and support functions, a new study shows that Hispanics, like whites, are much more likely to serve in combat operations. But those Hispanics in combat jobs tend to be infantry grunts, particularly in the Marine Corps, rather than fighter or bomber pilots.
"The Air Force is substantially more white, and the officer corps is substantially more white than Latino," said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, which issued a report last week on Hispanics in the military. "So you won't see Latinos flying airplanes over Iraq."
There are as many explanations for why Hispanics are flocking to the armed forces as there are individuals -- but the explanations are not that different.
Specialist Joel Flores joined the Army five years ago on an impulse. Already in his late 20's, married and the father of two daughters, he was fed up with his sales clerk job at a crafts store in San Antonio, where he had worked for nine years. "They kept passing me up for management," Specialist Flores, 34, said. "I got tired of it."
So one Friday after work he walked into a recruitment office to ask about his options in the military. Two hours later he was signing papers to enlist. "When I saw that first paycheck, it was 'Oh my God,' " said Specialist Flores, now an Army cook. His take-home pay was half what he had made at the store.
But he says he does not regret his decision even now, when he is among more than 12,000 troops waiting to depart Fort Hood, Tex., for the war in the Persian Gulf.
Specialist Flores, who was born in Texas to Mexican-American parents and was the first person in his family to join the military, has since re-enlisted. He says he has found a more level playing field in the Army than in the outside world.
He has moved up a few notches, from private to a specialist supervising other cooks, and says he wants to retire after reaching sergeant major. In the Army, he said, "It doesn't matter who you are if you can do the job."
For many soldiers like Specialist Flores, the military has not disappointed. Some complain about the low pay compared to what they could be making in the private sector, as well as the long hours and the time they spend away from their families.
But they say they have found a more egalitarian and racially harmonious society, one in which prejudice is trumped by meritocracy, discipline and the need to get along to survive.
Sgt. Nathalie Williams, 29, said that in her hometown, Tuskegee, Ala., her closest friends would probably be black, like her. At Fort Hood, they are black, Puerto Rican and white. "You can't judge somebody by their skin color," she said. "That one person who you don't like could be the person who saves your life."
Sergeant Williams's father served in the military, and an older sister is also in the Army. She said she joined the Army in 1992, after graduating from high school, to seek exposure to different kinds of people and travel. A dream came true when she was posted in Hawaii for three years.
But Sergeant Williams, the wife of a nursing assistant and the mother of three children, now faces going to war. Her sister, a staff sergeant, is already in Kuwait.

What Lies Ahead
A New Draft Or a Warrior Caste?
For those who support a return to the military draft, the question is whether the wealthy and elite of America -- the sons and daughters of members of Congress, among others -- were meant to serve as well.
Charles C. Moskos, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University who has written extensively in support of a national draft for the armed services, domestic security and civilian service, argues that the military must represent every stratum of society.
"In World Wars I and II, the British nobility had a higher killed-in-action rate than the working class," he said. "Our enlisted ranks resemble the British: they're lower- to middle-class, working-class, intelligent people, who are joining for both the adventure and economic opportunity. But the officer corps today does not represent American nobility. These are not people who are going to be future congressmen or senators. The number of veterans in the Senate and the House is dropping every year. It shows you that our upper class no longer serves."
Dr. Moskos said the pitfalls of having leaders who do not share in the casualties of war were common knowledge in Homeric times: "Agamemnon was willing to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia," he said. Today's military recruiters, he said, grasp what the ancient Greeks understood -- "that nobody'll accept casualties unless the elite are willing to put their own children's lives on the line."
"I once addressed a group of recruiters and asked them, would you prefer to have your advertising budget tripled or see Chelsea Clinton joining the Army -- and they all said Chelsea Clinton joining the Army," he said. "That would be the signal that America was serious about joining the military. Imagine Jenna Bush joining the military -- that would be the signal thing saying, this is a cause worth dying for."
Dr. Moskos says support for the Vietnam War ended when it became possible for the elite to win draft deferments. Other experts on military demographics dispute this.
James Burk, a professor of sociology at Texas A&M University, acknowledged that few wealthy citizens today choose military service. "But if you say, is the all-volunteer force not representative of the country as a whole, I'd say it's more representative than the upper class," he said.
Dr. Moskos and others also suggest that the citizen soldier who serves out his term and then returns to civilian life is being replaced by a class, or caste, of career soldiers -- even in frontline combat positions that do not require the expertise and experience of years of service. On top of that, experts say, members of the military are far more likely to have parents who served in the armed forces, suggesting that such a caste is self-perpetuating.
"To carry the logic further, why don't you hire a foreign legion and be done with it?" Dr. Moskos said. "Go out, hire foreigners, say they can join the American military and get a decent salary. Oh, no -- maybe Americans should fight for America?"
Those who warn of a warrior class cite a study by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies in North Carolina showing that between 1976 and 1996 the percentage of military officers who saw themselves as nonpartisan or politically independent fell from more than 50 percent to less than 20 percent. The main beneficiary of this shift has been the Republican Party.
"The officer corps has always been more conservative," said Richard H. Kohn, a professor of military history at the University of North Carolina. "But even so, the change there is dramatic."
Dr. Kohn and other scholars worry that with fewer families having sons or daughters in the military, especially among the affluent, and with a high percentage of enlistees coming from military families, a potential cultural and political gap could open up between civilian and martial societies.
"One of my concerns is effective civilian control of the military," he said. "The decline in the number of members of Congress who are veterans is dramatic. Up until 1995 Congress had a larger percentage of veterans than there was in the general population. After 1995 it was less -- and that's after theRepublican takeover. That means there is potentially a less knowledgeable, less effective oversight from Congress."
Even among academics, to be sure, those concerns are narrowly felt. "When the troops come back, many of them will get out; they'll have some memories," said John Allen Williams, a retired Navy captain who is a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. "A military that self-identified as different from, and possibly superior to, the civilian society it served, with a distinct set of values, and that might be willing to act on them opposed to civilian leaders? The thought that we could have that in this country is just inconceivable."
Both Mr. Burk and Mr. Williams say they support the idea of a draft, though they suggest it could never be enacted in today's political environment. 
Ask a squad of today's volunteer soldiers whether they like the idea of a draft, and you'll get a platoon's worth of answers.
Pfc. Michael Philbert, 18, had just finished basic training on Thursday and was browsing at Ranger Joe's, a uniform and equipment store outside Fort Benning, with his father and 13-year-old brother. He said a draft was a bad idea.
"It sounds kind of fair," Private Philbert said. "It's not fair that some poor kids don't have much of a choice but to join if they want to be productive because they didn't go to a good school, or they had family problems that kept them from doing well, so they join up and they're the ones that die for our country while the rich kids can avoid it.
"From the other side, it's not someone's fault that they're born rich or poor. Just because someone is rich doesn't mean you have to yank them out of the comfort of their life just to get even. And most poor people are glad they had this kind of opportunity. They're glad they got in."
But Sgt. Barry Perkins, the military policeman at Fort Benning, who has been around the block a few more times than a buck private, said America's military -- and its youth -- would benefit from a draft that included both men and women. "If you look at today's society, teenagers are staying at home, not doing a thing," he said. "They need a productive life. It should be straight across the board. As long as you don't allow power, money and wealth to influence it, it will be straight across the board -- it will be fairer."
Specialist Markita Scott, the reservist from Columbus, Ga., said she thought a draft was unnecessary. "Already with callbacks you can see the morale is down lower," she said. "They're like, 'I had a job.' Just think if you had a whole draft of people who didn't want to be there. I think of that guy who threw the grenade -- you wonder if there would be a lot more like that."

HEADLINE: What's Next For Bridgeport After Ganim? 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
ALI ASIK, who owns a diner on Bridgeport's east side, knows the methods were wrong, but he can't argue with the results: in the 12 years Joseph P. Ganim served as Bridgeport's mayor, crime was down, development was up and there was a swelling of civic pride.
 "He did a lot of good for the city," said Mr. Asik as he stood behind the cash register at Frankie's Diner, a city institution for 50 years. "From my point of view, they are all on the take -- he just got caught. The question is what happens now?" 
 Mr. Asik is not the only business owner wondering about the future of Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city and its second poorest. On March 19, after an eight-week trial and 8,000 pages of testimony from 50 witnesses , Mr. Ganim was convicted in federal court. He was found guilty on 16 counts, including racketeering, extortion, and bribery for awarding multimillion city contracts in exchange for money, gifts and meals. He is expected to resign within days. He will be sentenced July 1. His lawyers have said they will appeal. 
Mickey Herbert, the owner of the Bridgeport Bluefish, the minor league franchise housed in Harbor Yard, said that for all Mr. Ganim's faults, he got things done for the city. 
"He just declared it would happen, and it did," Mr. Herbert said, whose team plays in a stadium that was built during Mr. Ganim's tenure under a contract awarded without competitive bidding. Mr. Herbert also said that while Mr. Ganim was in office, the City Council acted speedily to approve a lease for the stadium; when the lease was renewed, delays were considerable.
"I have a concern that people who are outsiders, who aren't currently doing business in the city of Bridgeport, won't be as patient with the red tape," Mr. Herbert said. "I also think they might be sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what comes of all of this."
"All this" is the federal municipal corruption investigation scandal that netted 12 people or companies in a six-year kickback scheme. And federal investigators said their work isn't over yet.
Under Bridgeport's charter, City Councilman John Fabrizi will become mayor until November elections, when he and two other men have formally announced they will run. City business leaders said Mr. Fabrizi planned to seek their counsel in the interim. In his own words, Mr. Fabrizi is "humbled," by the office of mayor, an adjective no one would apply to the 43-year-old Mr. Ganim.
Replacing Mr. Ganim will be challenging but not impossible, Mr. Fabrizi said. While he answered "absolutely not" to the question of whether the City Council bears some responsibility for the years of corruption, Mr. Fabrizi said city government needs to change.
"We need to do the public's business in front of the public," he said. "People need to know what the government is doing and how." 
Mr. Ganim was once his party's gubernatorial nominee and was elected five times as mayor. He was born in the city but raised in Easton, the son of a lawyer and real estate developer. Yet he broke bread as genially with factory workers as financiers. Indeed, it was the ordinary people, the kind wearing mechanic's coveralls and ordering scrambled eggs at Frankie's Diner, who remained loyal to him throughout his trial. As he left the courthouse on the afternoon of his conviction, he stopped to shake hands with a window washer, one of the many courthouse personnel he chatted with throughout the trial.
On the witness stand, Mr. Ganim listed the major development accomplished during his tenure: the $19 million baseball stadium, a $52 million hockey rink, and the demolition of some 70 blighted houses to provide open land for new construction. A $24 million state courthouse is anticipated. All represent progress in a city where check cashing and pawn shops are stand-ins for banks and boutiques. Yet each of these projects was once mired in corruption.
Several people interviewed said they were "waiting for the other shoe to drop," echoing the warning from the government that the investigation is unfinished. John Guman,a city councilman who is running for mayor, said the city cannot move forward until the old Democratic political machine is disassembled. 
"There doesn't need to be a cleaning here in Bridgeport, there needs to be a power-washing," said Mr. Guman, himself one of 19 Democrats on the 20-member City Council. "Business owners who have been bypassing Bridgeport are going to continue to bypass Bridgeport because it is business as usual in Bridgeport, including the mayor and John Fabrizi." More than half of the City Council members are on the city payroll; Mr. Guman wants to institute a prohibition against council members working for the city.
"I think they're going to have to clean the whole area," said Rich Bonatati, who has owned Spoke & Wheel, a bicycle shop, for 30 years. "They can't just take the head. You've got to clean up the rest of the body."
Robert Scinto, a developer from Shelton, said he will no longer work in Bridgeport because of its long-standing practice of "pay to play" that required developers to offer a bribe in exchange for a city contract.
"Bridgeport is going to have its day, but this bunch of convictions doesn't change the underlying problem," said Mr. Scinto, who began his career as a plumber and now builds and leases multimillion dollar office and manufacturing space. "It's difficult to work in that city."
In choosing to seek about $10 million in federal funds for Bridgeport or Stamford this year, Congressman Christopher Shays, a Republican whose district includes both cities, chose to give most of the money to Stamford.
"The city government is a den of thieves that needs to be cleaned up from its roots," Mr. Shays said, adding that the chairman of the Bridgeport Democrats, Mario Testa, should step down because he "runs a corrupt political machine." 
In response, Mr. Testa, 56, said: "What proof do they have that I run a corrupt organization? We've been able to win election after election." Mr. Testa, who has been chairman for 12 years, said he will finish his term, which ends in March 2004, but will not seek re-election because of "where the party is headed and what its plans are."
Paul Timpanelli, the president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, a private development agency, said that if the city had received the federal money, itthe federal money would been allocated to the $72 million Intermodal Transportation project to improve Bridgeport's train and bus depots.Asked about the future of development in Bridgeport, Mr. Timpanelli briskly touted forthcoming projects, such as the $600 million development of Steel Point, a mix of retail, housing and office buildings proposed for a 50-acre site between Long Island Sound and Interstate 95. The city has a signed a letter of agreement with the developer, but another $110 million of public money is needed.
The impact of the federal investigation "certainly hasn't been positive for the city," said Mr. Timpanelli, whose council boasts membership from almost every significant business in the five towns in and around Bridgeport.
"The malaise has been in place here for a while," he said. "It's tough to measure whether the current lack of sufficient progress is due to the trial and scandal or the economic downturn. I suspect it is a little of both."
Poor infrastructure, lack of land on which to build and insufficient office inventory are perhaps more significant impediments to business development than any taint of corruption, Mr. Timpanelli said. He said revitalization of the city would be a 25- to 30-year effort.
Edward Lavernoich, chief project manager for the city's office of planning and economic development, said that despite the scandal, projects are continuing. .
"Of course people want to get past the trial, but I don't think it's held up a lot of projects," Mr. Lavernoich said. "People have worked with us through it." 
One of them is Eric G. Anderson, whose East Harlem company, A & F Commercial Builders, is poised to begin a $70 million housing project in downtown Bridgeport. Just 4 percent of his project will be publicly funded. 
"I haven't had to keep the corruption scandal at arm's length because people have done it for me," Mr. Anderson said, adding that he worked almost entirely with people affiliated with Mr. Timpanelli.
"Of course the scandal has a certain negative effect on anything that goes on in Bridgeport," Mr. Anderson said. Loan officers, for instance, "are pretty savvy and everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop."
'Even his most grudging supporters, the ones who said it was more a good economy and federal and state dollars that sparked city development than the mayor's efforts, said Mr. Ganim had charisma. As Kevin Nunn, president of the Bridgeport Economic Resource Center, a private agency that connects developers to federal, state and city programs, put it in a statement ripe with double entendre: "Ganim knew how to shake the trees of government" to reap aid to Bridgeport.
Alma Slade, who has owned the Barn, a fabric store and decorating shop in the city's north end for 27 years, said she was isolated from the machinations of city hall. Her store draws legions of affluent customers from throughout Fairfield County. Ms. Slade, who acknowledged the negativity of the corruption scandal, said she pays it little attention.
"For one thing, I don't see Ganim being an isolated situation," she said.
Others expressed more pointed concern.
"Ganim did quite a bit for the city," said Constantinos Vlamis, whose family owns Tomlinson's, a restaurant known for its hot dogs. "I don't know if the momentum he created will go forward."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW/From Ansonia; 
After the Fire, Hope and Plans

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WHEN the Latex Foam International factory on West Main Street in Ansonia burned down nearly two years ago, city and regional leaders called it one of the most devastating events to ever hit the Naugatuck Valley.
 The loss of Ansonia's largest employer and biggest taxpayer was a big economic blow to both the small city of 19,000 and the entire six-town region, which includes 130,000 people, leaving Ansonia with both a real and symbolic hole that no one knew how to fill. 
 Now, with the help of more than a half-dozen students from Yale University's School of Management and School of Architecture, plans for a comprehensive multiuse redevelopment of the 10-acre site are about to be unveiled, probably in mid-April, according to Ansonia's mayor, James Della Volpe.
Mr. Della Volpe and William Purcell, president of the Greater Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the urban renewal plan recommended using the site far differently than it had been when occupied by the factory building. originally built as a brass factory in in the early 1900's. The Latex Foam International plant moved to Ansonia in 1984 and occupied the 284,0000 square-foot building, employing 250 people. After the factory burned down in May 2001, The company then opened a new plant in nearby Shelton. 
The new plan would create a lively downtown area by integrating the site to other parts of the city with a mixed-use residential and professional park. Multiple uses such as light industrial and commercial businesses, housing, a green and walkway, antique street lamps, an artist's colony in vacant old buildings and repair of the city's dilapidated hilltop riverfront staircase would combine to invigorate the downtown. 
Those are among the students' ideas, which are likely to be part of a comprehensive overhaul of not only the former Latex site, but also of a one- o two-mile area along the river that stretches out from the heart of the city to other parts of the community, the mayor and chamber president said.
They said there is hope for up to $1 million in state and federal funding that could spark further private investment. Much of that money is in the form of Federal Economic Administration grants. Plans for redevelopment of the 10-acre site recently gained approval from the 17-town Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy panel, which will apply for state and local economic development funds. The strategy panel is comprised of representatives of towns throughout the Naugatuck Valley, from Waterbury to Shelton.
Mr. Della Volpe said the former Latex site project was ranked first out of 27 plans submitted to the regional economic panel. 
"This will give us top priority to apply for the state and federal funds," he said. "We recognize this isn't the best time in terms of the economy to be seeking funding, but we intend to pursue it and hope it also sparks private investment. Few towns or cities have this kind of 10-acre site on and around which to build a new and vital economic base."
Yale graduate students and their advisers said the Ansonia project provided them with invaluable hands-on experience in the economic, urban renewal and architectural fields.
"When were asked to look at the Latex Foam site one of our main concerns was how that area could be integrated into the downtown area." said Alan Plattus, professor of architecture at Yale University who worked as an adviser with the students on the project. "As important as the factory was, it was always an industrial, fenced-in enclave with minimal contact to the community and we saw a wonderful opportunity to change that. he main idea is that streets near the site be intertwined with the downtown area. The downtown is relatively hemmed in. One of the more dynamic parts of a local economy is downtown housing, and this can be an area where a lot of both young and older people would love the idea of living in a small downtown center where they could walk to shops, restaurants and different forms of entertainment."
Mr. Plattus said "as a university-based design center, our goal is that our students get involved in community -ased projects and cities and towns. The Ansonia project presented a classic example of a small New England city that thrived on industrial production, but also developed a fantastic Main 
Street that was virtually swallowed up over the years and also eventually lost its economic base. In this instance with a fire that destroyed its economic core, it was a sudden an catastrophic example of what generally is a more insidious, gradual decline."
Students said that the heart of the plan is linking the core of the historic Main Street area that includes City Hall to the southern part of Main Street with a milelong greenway near the river.
The project has helped the city, and also presented a rare learning experience for the students, said city and Yale officials.
"No doubt about it -- it's been a real education for the students," said Tom Guiltinan who was a second-year adviser in the School of Management Outreach program last year and helped draw up a marketing plan for the Ansonia site that later became the basis for architectural plans as well. Mr. Guiltinan graduated last May, and now works in the Yale Office of New Haven Affairs. 
"Ansonia is a classic New England industrial mill town trying to find new viability in the post-industrial age," he said. "It's got a potentially charming downtown area, and a lot of competitive strengths -- proximity to major employment areas like Stamford and New York City and old buildings with good space that can be renovated."
"This is a perfect opportunity to create a Main Street with vitality: increased foot traffic on Main Street that will also bring more of an artistic climate, more entertainment with coffee shops and restaurants near a canal that runs right through the downtown area that now represents an under-utilized resource," Mr. Guiltinan said. 
The housing would include apartments and condominiums sold at fair-market value, according to Mr. Della Volpe. Mr. Purcell said the Ansonia project was also a good example of "turning lemon into lemonade.
"They say you sometimes have to look 1,000 miles away to solve a local problem," said Mr. Purcell. "In this case we only had to venture five miles to students at Yale University for some creative and innovative solutions that will be part of a dynamic new plan. It's really been an extraordinary partnership that will be the basis for a vibrant new downtown in Ansonia along its very beautiful waterfront.
"There's no denying that when the Latex Foam plant burned down, the tragedy joined a long history of disastrous events that have contributed to economic hardship in the Naugatuck Valley," Mr. Purcell added. "But now we have an opportunity for real and meaningful urban renewal."

HEADLINE: The Past and Present Of Island Farm Life 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA DELATINER 

 BODY:
ELIZABETH GROSSMANN RUNG and Lyle Wells would seem to have little in common. She is a suburbanite from Malverne, while he lives in rural Aquebogue.
 But both are farmers, working land that has been in their families for generations, and keeping one of the Long Island's nearly obsolete occupations alive. And both are featured in a new documentary about farmers on the island, "A Farm Picture," which has its first showing in Stony Brook on Saturday. 
 The film was made by Glenn Gebhard, a Los Angeles-based documentary filmmaker who was born and raised in Merrick and owns a second home in Sound Beach, and Mario Congreve. The two previously made a documentary about the Island's baymen, another endangered local occupation. "Doing one on an another job in jeopardy seemed natural," Mr. Gebhard said.
The script for the film, which is an hour long, was written by Frank Turano, who teaches Long Island environmental history and human ecology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. It traces the history of farming on the Island from the Native American period, when corn sustained the area's inhabitants, to the present when truck farming and grapes have replaced potatoes as the major focuses of agriculture, and continuing development threatens the industry's survival. 
The film paints its portrait of the early years with images of the grave site of a mid-18th century farm women, shown while a narrator reads from her diary. It also includes still photographs by Hal Fullerton, the passionate publicist for both the Island and its new railroad in the early 20th century, as well as works by William Sidney Mount, the 19th-century painter.
Photographs and home movies from participating farm families and archives provide a contemporary view, as do interviews with political figures, like Robert Gaffney, Suffolk's county executive; academics like Dr. Turano; and farmers like Ms. Rung and Mr. Wells. 
The ancestors of Mr. Wells, 47, settled around Riverhead in the 1640's; in an unbroken line, his family has been cultivating the original 100 acres since then. His is the oldest family farm in New York State.
Ms. Rung, 39, is only the third generation of Grossmanns to run the seven-acre farm her grandfather bought in 1895. It is one of two remaining in Nassau County; the other, Young's Farm, is in Old Brookville. 
The two say they diversify their crops to adapt to changing times, running farm stands to sell retail and survive economically. "There's great pride in keeping your family business going," Ms. Rung said.
One hundred years ago, the Island's farmers had 100,000 acres under cultivation, making the area the richest agricultural section of the state. Today, while the Island still produces the most valuable cash crops in the state, just 31,000 acres are planted, with potatoes and cauliflower, fruits, and, most recently, wine grapes. About 8,000 of those acres have been preserved through county, state, federal and private programs.
"We want to show people that farms are still important economically and that local produce enhances our health," Mr. Gebhard said.
"A Farm Picture" will be shown at 7 p.m. on Saturday at the Long Island Museum of Art, History and Carriages on Route 25A, at a benefit for Long Island Traditions, a nonprofit group that documents cultural traditions on the Island. Information: (516)767-8803. Another screening will be held on April 10 at 6:30 p.m. at Suffolk Community College in Riverhead. Information: (631)727-3777.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
The Wind Blows Freely, But It's Not Free

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
WINDMILLS conjure up pictures of breezy fields, quaint Dutch landscapes, the hypnotic rotation of fan-like blades. But such clean and peaceful images are not what comes to mind when most people think of energy plants that require gas, oil and nuclear fuel.
 The difference is a major reason that Croton-on-Hudson last month began bringing in some of the power required by its municipal buildings from a wind farm near Syracuse. 
 "It costs a few cents more per kilowatt hour," said Robert W. Elliott, the Croton mayor. "But it's clean. It's safe." 
That is important to the village board, which passed a resolution in March 2002 expressing the village's commitment to start using alternative sources of energy. 
Croton is the first municipality in the state to use wind-generated energy, a form of power that is centuries old, according to Ron Kamen, regional director of Community Energy Inc., the private Pennsylvania-based corporation supplying Croton's power. 
The environmental argument emphasizes that wind power draws on a limitless , readily available source of energy, while conserving fossil fuel reserves. It also does not dirty the air by emitting soot or fumes.
It has been more difficult to build a convincing economic argument. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said wind power emerged in California in the 1980's after the legislature provided financial incentives for its use. But until recently, in most states, it cost up to 10 times more than conventional forms of power. 
Redesigned technology, in the form of more efficient windmills, or turbines, has gradually been helping to lower the cost. And in New York a few years ago, the state government began offering incentives to develop wind power. 
Croton is buying its power from a wind farm in Fenner, east of Syracuse, that is owned by Community Energy. Two other wind farms have been built in the last 1o years, in Madison County and in Wethersfield, south of Buffalo, and five others are being developed; each of these is owned by a separate alternative energy company, Mr. Collins said.
Though wind power still costs more than gas or nuclear power - about $5 a month more for an average two-bedroom suburban home - its environmental advantages are attracting more new customers, said Mr. Kamen. And the more customers, the lower the cost for each, he said. 
Croton pays about $21,000 per month for power for about 10 municipal buildings. Currently 10 percent of the bill goes to the wind power company, and the town plans to increased its wind-power use to 25 percent of its total usage. 
Croton will be joining Hobart College, the University of Buffalo, the federal buildings in Utica and Binghamton and several private organizations in switching to wind. 
Individual homeowners can also sign up for wind power. Amy Chender, an Irvington resident who has been active in the movement to shut down the Indian Point nuclear power plant, said: "I've sent away for the brochures. I think it's great. We're definitely thinking of making the change."
Upstate New York may not have underground oil, but it is rich with breezes that can keep a windmill's blades rotating most of the year. Winds of at least nine miles per hour are needed to turn the turbine's blades, which operate like fans. An average annual wind speed of 17 miles per hour is the minimum needed to produce enough power to make a wind farm profitable, Mr. Collins said. The turbines are able to store power, just as solar energy systems do. 
The blades power the engine in the turbines, just as gas powers a car engine, Mr. Collins said. The power is run through cables to nearby power lines and fed into the main grid and out to customers. The power that any single customer receives is a mix of all the sources that feed into the grid: oil, gas, nuclear and wind. 
Wind farms require open fields, a high average annual wind speed and proximity to power lines. Private wind companies are leasing land from upstate farmers to install turbines, negotiating fees privately, said Mr. Collins. The farmers are also able to continue using the property to raise livestock or grow crops. 
Community Energy, for example, has installed 20 turbines on a 1,500-acre site in Fenner, the largest wind farm in the state. A turbine is 220 feet, or 15 stories tall, and each blade is 100 feet long. A turbine, which costs between $1 million and $1.5 million to buy and install, produces 1.5 megawatts of power annually, enough to power 500 homes. The capacity of 30 megawatts is enough to provide power for 10,000 homes for a year. By contrast, the plants at Indian Point produce 2,000 megawatts of power annually. 
Currently, there are fewer than 35 windmills on three commercial wind farms in the state, which produce a total of less than 50 megawatts a year, according to figures from the state Energy Research and Development Authority. (That does not include private windmills that may be operated by individuals for their own use.) But the state is windy enough to produce 10,000 megawatts of energy, enough for 150,000 homes. To harness the wind, 7,000 turbines would be required. But even if the 7,000 turbines were up and running, they would only be able to produce 25 percent of the energy required by New York and its residents, said Mr. Kamen. 
Last August, the Pataki administration announced the allocation of $17 million for the development of five new wind farms that could generate enough electricity to power as many as 315,000 homes.

HEADLINE: Shelter I. Could Take Its Foot Off the Gas 

BYLINE:  By PETER BOODY 

 BODY:
DAIMLERCHRYSLER is looking at Shelter Island as a great place to test its little cars known as NEV's (neighborhood electric vehicles). They don't go faster than 25 miles per hour, produce no exhaust emissions, can carry two or four passengers, can cover 35 miles on one charge, and can be recharged overnight, connected to a 110-volt household outlet. 
 Barry Carr, whose job is to market the electric cars on the East Coast for DaimlerChrysler's Global Electric Motorcars subsidiary, based in Fargo, N.D., visited the Shelter Island Town Board two weeks ago, suggesting that the town use some of the cars, known as GEM's, for parking patrols and to rent to summer visitors. They could leave their gas-powered cars behind at the Greenport ferry, he said, ride over as foot passengers and rent the electrics on the Island, puttering around from home to shop and beach without speeding, clogging up parking places or polluting the air. 
 "You can fit four of these things in one parking space," Mr. Carr told the amused board members, who didn't say if they favored the idea. They were equally mum when he compared tourist-saturated Key West, Fla., where cruise-ship visitors rent the same neon-bright electric vehicles from a local dealer, to Shelter Island, where second-home-owners and houseguests are far more common than foot-bound day-trippers.
Mr. Carr said his company planned to give a fleet of the cars to the Long Island Power Authority, which he suggested the town should approach for a donation of one, two or more. An authority spokesman confirmed last week that DaimlerChrysler and the utility were in the early stages of discussing the gift. DaimlerChrysler also gave electric cars to the State University of New York and the state parks system. Some 127 went recently to the University of California at Los Angeles.
Shelter Island's police chief, Jim Read, said in an interview that he would be willing to put his two part-time traffic control officers in electric cars as an experiment. Town Supervisor Art Williams liked the idea too. "I'm willing to do something to reduce congestion and pollution," he said. He doesn't have to do a lot of driving on town businesses but "I'd be willing to drive one myself" for its symbolic value, he added.
The open-sided cars look like fancy golf carts, a term Mr. Carr dislikes. But unlike golf carts, they are legal on many secondary roads. Last year New York became the 38th state to allow "low speed vehicles" on local roads. The vehicles must have many of the safety features required of gasoline-powered cars, including seat belts, brake lights and turn signals, but they cannot exceed 25 miles an hour. They require insurance, registration and plates. Under state rules, they cannot operate on streets with speeds limits greater than 35 miles an hour except to cross them. 
Mr. Carr was frank with the Shelter Island Town Board in explaining why the company wants to give them away. Several states -- including California, New York and Vermont -- give DaimlerChrysler "emission credits," he said, that can benefit its profitable but far less fuel-efficient vehicles like S.U.V.'s. Mr. Carr said it made economic sense for the company to give the cars to public agencies, where their practicality can be demonstrated, as it gears up for a major marketing campaign.
Private individuals can buy the electric cars for between $7,000 and $9,000, depending on model and options, or for far less when special incentives are offered, as they were recently by dealers in New York State. Doors are an option. 
This spring the Eagle Auto Mall in Riverhead is becoming the first dealer on Long Island to carry DaimlerChrysler's Global Electric Motorcars. Dealers in Danbury, Conn., and Amenia, N.Y., have been selling them for some time. The owner of Eastlands Nursery in Water Mill, Mike DeRosa, has 10 of the cars, some for use by workers around the six-acre nursery and some for sale. "We're acting as kind of a dealer," he said. "We can demo them here and give test drives. We just make a little on it." So far he's sold three. 
New York State's parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, sounds ecstatic about the 330 electric cars DaimlerChrysler recently gave the state park system, some of which will be deployed on Long Island at Jones Beach and perhaps in Montauk. She called them a "wonderful addition" to the state's fleet and credited Gov. George E. Pataki's "green and clean" environmental philosophy for DaimlerChrysler's eagerness to give the state so many of the cars. "We are very grateful," she said. "This is as clean as they get."
DaimlerChrysler is giving 130 of the cars to the State University, 8 for the Old Westbury campus and 8 to SUNY-Farmingdale, according to a SUNY spokesman in Albany, Laurence Sombke. Steve Brennan of East Hampton, the co-owner of a pool-maintenance company, was one of the first Long Islanders to buy a Global Electric car. Bad weather has kept him from using it much. "It's sort of a laugh but cruising around in it is sort of neat," he said. He expects to use it to drive around Springs , his neighborhood in the town of East Hampton, between his home, the beach, his boat and the deli.
When Mr. Brennan bought his car last winter, he told Mr. Carr that the East End of Long Island would be the perfect place to give electric cars away. "Sag Harbor, Shelter Island and East Hampton would be the perfect venues," because weekenders could use them for short trips around town, he said. 
"One of my trucks gets about 10 miles to the gallon. My boat gets about three-quarters of a mile to the gallon," Mr. Brennan said. "Perhaps this is my way of doing something somewhat greener for a change."

HEADLINE: Hip Yet Prospering. Can Jersey City Do It? 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN MILLER 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
THE man in the black knit cap wanted to break the bad news, but first he had to out-shout the guy on the saxophone.
 "We're going to have to find a new place," the man in the cap, Alex Saavedra, bellowed glumly to a visitor at Uncle Joe's, a tiny bar nestled among the warehouses downtown here. "They're turning Wednesdays into House Night." 
 Mr. Saavedra -- the 27-year old founder of Eyeball Records, based in Kearny -- was not even sure what house music is. But he was sure it would be an excellent way to kill off what had taken hold in the unlikely place that had become a hangout for him and dozens of other tattooed, pierced young people who want to hear tomorrow's music today. 
For a year and a half, Uncle Joe's has been at the center of a much larger phenomenon: Jersey City has become unmistakably hip.. 
"It's been kind of amazing to watch, to see this transformation," said Ralph Cuseglio, 27, who attended high school here and is now the lead singer of Rye Coalition, a well-known local band. 
The evidence is everywhere. In a short time, Uncle Joe's has transformed itself from a run-down gay bar on First Street to a live-music venue for up-and-coming bands -- the only one of its kind in this city of about 240,000, long a haven for blue-collar workers and immigrants. 
On Grove Street, across from City Hall, a storefront that was boarded up for years is now a cafe that sells Belgian beer for $12 a bottle. A renovated dive on Newark Avenue is a lounge bar that since September has been selling beer in fluted glasses and attracting a diverse crowd. Farther west, on Fourth Street, where youths once chucked rocks at newcomers, there is a tiny French restaurant called Madame Claude that since October has featured escargot ($8.50) and creme bruleee ($5). Business is humming.
More change is on the way. A pricey bakery is opening not far from theFrench restaurant. And in an even more inescapable sign of what is to come, a Starbucks may be headed for Erie Street.
What is even more remarkable is that this evolution has occurred during a decidedly rough patch for towns along the Hudson River. All along the waterfront in Jersey City, jobs have disappeared. The city's unemployment rate stands at 8.8 percent, compared with 5.5 percent statewide. Vacancy rates for office buildings have soared to 17.5 percent, up from around 10 percent in 1999. 
About 6,000 employees of the investment bank Goldman Sachs were to move into a 781-foot tower -- the tallest building in the state -- by June 2004, but those plans have been significantly scaled back. Plans to build a university, hotel and convention center at the site have all been shelved for now, and far fewer than 5,000 employees will be moving in next year, says a senior official at Goldman who requested anonymity.
Ground was to be broken by the end of the year for the second-tallest building in the state -- at 665 feet -- at 99 Hudson Street. But Merrill Lynch, which was going to occupy it, has shelved the plans indefinitely; it is still a parking lot. 
Not a single office project has broken ground since Sept. 11, 2001. 

Building Is at Standstill
With war raging in Iraq and concerns about terrorism, the situation will probably get worse before it gets better, said Carl Eriksen, the senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage firm. Others say Governor McGreevey has made things worse with his threat to eliminate a state program that has lured businesses from New York. 
When asked if anyone had plans to break ground on a new project, Dan Frohwirth, the director of real estate and marketing for the Jersey City Economic Development Corporation, put it this way, "You'd have to be out of your mind."
But bad news for some is good news for others. With less demand, apartment rentals are cheaper than they have been for years, real estate agents say. And with Manhattan prices astronomical and housing costs in Hoboken also high, Jersey City is an affordable alternative. 
For years artists, musicians and immigrants have called the waterfront section of downtown Jersey City home. In the 1980's, luxury apartment towers started rising on abandoned railroad yards in Newport, and in the 90's the site of the former Colgate-Palmolive factory gave way to offices. Indeed, the waterfront in Jersey City has for years welcomed a steady stream of young professionals. Yet there was little reason to explore west of Washington Boulevard, a de facto Berlin Wall.
That is changing, however, and downtown neighborhoods like Van Vorst Park, Hamilton Park, Paulus Hook and even the far western stretch of Newark Avenue underneath the New Jersey Turnpike have been drawing bargain bunters from Manhattan and Brooklyn. Older professionals have bought brownstones and are raising their children here. 
Many of the young, artsy and educated have become protective of their newfound turf. "We don't want to make it sound too great because everyone will want to move here," said Pam St. Jean, a 30-year-old massage therapist from Providence, R.I. 
She extolled Jersey City's virtues while relaxing at Ground, a coffee shop on Jersey Avenue that features photography and light installations by local artists.
"I think hipsters look for the void," said Robert Lanham, 32, a Brooklyn resident who wrote "The Hipster Handbook" (Anchor Books, $9.95), published last month. Even though his car was booted on his first visit there, he thinks Jersey City has potential now that Williamsburg has nearly reached hipness senescence. But he has this warning about hipsters: "They look for the place that's undiscovered. And they take it over like the plague, so watch out."
They have taken over Wednesday nights at Uncle Joe's, a place that even the owner considers "dangerously inviting."
It was inviting enough for Carl Severson, who has lived in Jersey City for four years and is the founder of Ferret Music, a punk rock label that he operates out of his apartment. A few months ago, Mr. Severson, 27, decided that the arts intelligentsia needed a salon night -- one in which local musicians, record label owners, promoters and other hangers-on could meet, drink and network. He has made overtures to his New York friends, noting the quick train ride and the impending smoking ban in the city. 
"I want this to be like 'Cheers,"' he said. Last fall, The New York Press labeled the bar "Best New York Club in New Jersey." 
Friday and Saturday is when rising stars play here, like the band Rye Coalition, a hometown group that was once banned for more than a year from Maxwell's, the venerable Hoboken club (the band enraged the owner when its last song became a 20-minute rendition of Led Zeppelin's "Moby Dick"). Monday is open mike night. And on Wednesday, jazz, disc jockeys or some hybrid groups play. The performance space is ridiculously small, the sound system is so-so, and the presence of 15 people makes it feel jammed.
On a recent Wednesday night, about 60 people packed the bar. A jazz fusion fivesome was noodling aimlessly in the back room, and the conversations among the gathered were just as aimless. The big news was that My Chemical Romance, an up-and-coming band, has signed with a new management team. 
Mr. Saavedra, the owner of Eyeball Records, took several calls on his cellphone, and talked excitedly -- first about his band, and later about his hometown.
"It was a dump," he said of Jersey City. "I never thought I'd be back here."
Mr. Saavedra grew up in Jersey City, and he recalls that there was absolutely nothing to do when he was a youth, so he would often slip into Manhattan, hang out in Washington Square Park with the punks and skateboarders, or sneak into CBGB, the legendary rock club. These days he lives and works in neighboring Kearny and rarely wanders into New York City. Instead, he comes to Jersey City.
This is not to say that fashionably dressed youngsters are roaming the streets here in packs. On most nights and even weekends, Newark Avenue, which runs through the heart of downtown, is desolate. Trash flutters through the street, and gates shutter the gantlet of 99-cent stores.

'Raggedy on the Outside'
"Until you live here for a good period of time, it looks really raggedy on the outside," said Beverly Gonzalez, a co-owner of Marco and Pepe, a cafe on Grove Street. "When we first moved here, I was really, really afraid. Downtown was sort of dangerous."
The city's leaders recognized this problem and in 1999 designated the heart of downtown -- made up of parts of Newark Avenue, Grove Street, Jersey Avenue and Christopher Columbus Drive -- "restaurant row." Though a new zoning law made it easier to get a liquor license, other restrictions have appeared to stymie development.
A bar or restaurant on the row must stop serving liquor at 11 p.m. during the week and midnight on weekends, yet places outside the zone can serve alcohol until 2 a.m. on weeknights and 3 a.m. on weekends. 
City leaders said they agreed to the restrictions in part because residents convinced council members that later hours would encourage a wild bar atmosphere in residential areas. They seem to have got their wish. In the three and a half years since the laws were adopted, only a handful restaurants have opened in the zone.
"We're supposed to row restaurants in," Domenic Santana, owner of the Hard Grove Cafe near the Grove Street PATH station, told The Jersey City Reporter in 2000, "and instead they're rowing out." 
The funky spots have flourished just outside the zone -- around Grove Street near City Hall, around Brunswick Avenue near the turnpike overpass, and near Hamilton Park, on the northern edge of downtown.
One of the first of the new breed in the area was Marco and Pepe -- named for the owners' dogs.
"Our friends said, 'You're crazy, the neighborhood can't support a place like that yet,"' said Beverly Gonzalez, who nevertheless opened the cafe in 2001 with her husband, Ralph. 
Theirs is the place that sells the expensive imported beer, and in the last six months started a limited menu, with a chef who once toiled at the Manhattan restaurants Bouley and Danube. 
This strip of Grove Street is also home to the slightly swanky Merchant Bar, an bakery called Holidays and, on nearby Mercer Street a place called Ria's Cafe. In the home of the former Cooper Gallery, a sign announces, "Coming Soon: Family Bistro." 
None of this existed two years ago.
There are many reasons for the success of Jersey City, according to James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University: Spillover from Manhattan, good housing stock and, more recently, a downturn in the economy that might be prompting people to stay closer to home.
Consider Mark Dalzell . When he was working toward a music degree at the University of Delaware in 1999, Mr. Dalzell decided to move to New York, though he was quickly discouraged by the high cost. Instead, he settled in Jersey City, where he found a three-bedroom apartment for $1,500 a month in Hamilton Park, a neighborhood of walk-ups and brownstones. 
"Hamilton Park," he said, "is very Upper West Side-ish." 
Not too long ago, he and his girlfriend moved into the top two floors of a brownstone, and though he says he is overpaying at $1,900, he is happy with it. When not rebuilding and repairing violins and guitars in his apartment, he would be making forays into Hoboken to buy strings. But he said he grew weary of trying to find parking, and thought of starting his own store.
Metropolis Music opened in November 2002, and even Mr. Dalzell has been surprised at the response. He sells much of his equipment to locals who often end up playing at Uncle Joe's and schoolchildren who never had any other place to go. He gives lessons to about 40 students. 
"In my neighborhood," he said, "practically every person plays a musical instrument."
His store sits on the scruffy western edge of Newark Avenue, but he has seen the changes even in his short time here. "Definitely, new businesses have been popping up like crazy," he said.
As he spoke, one of his teachers, Tom Condon, emerged from a back room, grabbed a guitar and impatiently picked at strings while waiting for his next student. Mr. Condon is a recent Manhattan refugee who came Jersey City last fall to save money. Soon afterward, he lost his job at a publishing house and has been scraping by teaching guitar and working at Ground.
"I lived in the East Village for six years," he said, "and I knew six people." In the four months he has lived here, he said, he has met 10 or 15 people. "It's more of a community," hesaid. "It's a bit smaller."

Brooklynites Look West
A smaller community, but growing, according to real estate agents.
As Phil Rivo, a sales agent at Armagno Agency in Jersey City, put it, "The Brooklyn people are coming" from neighborhoods like Carroll Gardens, Williamsburg, Fort Greene. 
At the playground near his house, he noted, "there's a fight for the swings."
For Lawrence Perlaski, a broker for Joseph A. Del Forno Inc., the economic downturn has meant lower prices. 
"The rental market has taken a hit," Mr. Perlaski said. Three years ago, he explained, a one-bedroom cost $1,200 to $1,600, but now these are the prices for a two-bedroom place.
"If you take a ride around," he said, "and the amount of dark windows that you see at 7, 8 at night, those are obviously empty apartments. And there's a surprisingly high amount of vacancies in Hoboken." 
However, Mr. Perlaski and Mr. Rivo both said that sales of single homes and condominiums had been strong because of low interest rates, though not as robust as in previous months. An average brownstone that sold for $300,000 in the late 1990's now costs about $500,000. Condominium prices have risen about 20 percent in the last year. That said, prices are 20 to 40 percent lower than in Manhattan.
"We might not have the amenities that a Brooklyn has with a bistro on every corner," said Mr. Rivo, though he went on to say that if a person had not been to Jersey City in three years, he would notice a marked change.
It is that change that worries some here. 
"I think it's riding the fence right now," said Ms. St. Jean, the massage therapist. "It could get gentrified." 
To Jaime Vazquez, gentrification is already well under way. As the director of veterans affairs for the city, Mr. Vazquez, 53, earns $40,000 a year. He plans to marry in May and will need a bigger place for his new wife and her 11-year-old daughter, at least bigger than the two-room $600-a-month apartment on Fifth Street where has lived since 1991. So far, he has had trouble finding a two-bedroom apartment for less than $1,500 a month, his limit, and he is hesitant to move from the neighborhood he has called home since 1959.
"It's kind of ironic," said Mr. Vazquez, who was councilman for the downtown ward from 1985 to 1997. "Once being an elected official in that district, I now almost can't afford to live there."
The neighborhood was long a stronghold of Hispanic, Filipino and Polish immigrants, but figures from the 2000 Census show it has changed quite a bit in the last decade. The number of Hispanics downtown declined in the 1990's -- from 10,952 to 9,801, while the number of non-Hispanic whites rose --to 13,005 from 11,688. In the same period, the Hispanic population of rose 18 percent, while the non-Hispanic white population shrank 32 percent. 
"The transformation of Jersey City is not a 10-year story," said Jeff Kaplowitz, director of commercial development for Plaza 21st Century and a former chairman of the city's planning board, "It really is based upon a 25-year story."

Along Came LeFrak
By the late 1970's, the network of railroads that were once the city's lifeblood had gone and manufacturing had started to die. In the early 80's, a developer from Queens, Samuel LeFrak, began building high-rise apartments on the site of the former railroad yards, and people thought he was misguided. Now, the entire section -- known as Newport -- has a mall, the offices of insurance and brokerage companies, two hotels and a forest of high-rise buildings.
Despite the good news, there is a tenuous nature to muchof Jersey City's nightlife. For instance, the "house night" rumors that spread like wildfire at Uncle Joe's are not entirely off the mark. John Chiodi, the club's owner, has talked about bringing in a more "mainstream" crowd.
"I'd like to showcase live new music and mix in a little more mainstream music so the two crowds can intermingle a little bit," he said, explaining that he wants to do more than break even.
At Ground, the phone has long been disconnected, though it is still open. At Side by Side, which reopened last September as a lounge with blood-red walls, an inexperienced disc jockey blew out the club's sound system, and the bar had to limp along for some time on a personal stereo.
Even worse, many artists fear that their main stronghold, a former tobacco warehouse on 111 First Street, may soon disappear. Lawrence P. Wolf, a lawyer who represents the landlord for the building, New Gold Equities of Manhattan, said plans were in the works to gut much of the interior and convert the warehouse into a "mixed use" project --rental apartments with minimal artist occupation. 
"This area looks like a disgusting graveyard of buildings," Mr. Wolf said. "It's an eyesore." 
Ron English, a 43-year-old painter who for a decade lived in Manhattan and now occupies a studio there, often refers to Jersey City as "Mississippi on the Hudson" -- so close, yet so far from the Big City -- though he believes there is tremendous potential.
Farther west, in the Journal Square area -- long viewed as the next major target of revitalization -- the first new apartment project in 20 years won council approval in February, and a 3,000-thousand-seat movie theater, Loew's Jersey, is under renovation.
Despite the short-term dreariness of the New York economy, Mr. Hughes of Rutgers said that Jersey City would continue to grow.
"It obviously depends on the health of the regional economy," he said. "Lower Manhattan is enormously weak." 
But he said there was a growing number of those 25 to 34 who could fill the rental market. "As that critical mass grows, Jersey City becomes an even more favored location," he said, though he cautioned that it was "not a slam dunk."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 6, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a passage about the overall growth of the Hispanic population -- despite a dropoff downtown -- omitted a reference to the area under discussion. It was in Jersey City that the Hispanic population rose 18 percent in the 1990's, while the non-Hispanic population shrank 32 percent.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Oddly, McGreevey Ventures Near the State's Third Rail

BYLINE:  By David Kocieniewski; David is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
For a few befuddling hours, it appeared as though the McGreevey administration might maroon itself, voluntarily, in the middle of the most treacherous minefield in New Jersey politics, the thermonuclear issue of high property taxes.
 Motivated by a logic decipherable only to accountants, bureaucrats, and other deep thinkers, the governor's top education officials announced that they would with not send additional educational aid to 11 of the state's poorest school districts unless the districts first increased property taxes. 
 Within a day or so, administration officials recognized the disastrous political ramifications of their plan, which would add an average of $125 a year to the tax bills of some homeowners -- raising a marginal amount of money but potentially enraging voters throughout a state that suffers the nation's most burdensome property taxes. The McGreeveyites retreated, and to underscore their contrition, the administration even had officials from the Department of Education utter a phrase one rarely hears emanating from within the Educational-Administration Complex, "We made a mistake." 
The bewildering incident is just the latest sign of an exasperating array of bad choices facing Mr. McGreevey as he struggles to close a budget gap estimated to be more than $4 billion.
Back in October 2001, when James E. McGreevey the candidate took the bait from his Republican opponent and pledged not to raise taxes, it must have seemed like a grand idea. At a time when the economy was already swooning, both candidates already knew that the downturn made such a vow nearly impossible to keep. Public opinion polls at the time indicated that the voters themselves expected tax increases, regardless of who won the race.
Since Mr. McGreevey took office, however, the sluggish economy has contributed to two consecutive years of budget problems, making his no-tax pledge a noose around the governor's agenda.
Within two months of his inauguration, Mr. McGreevey issued a clarification, saying that he had only promised not to raise the sales or income taxes, and he balanced the budget by raising an assortment of levies, including the business tax and an assortment of government fees.
Now that he's struggling with the second consecutive shortfall, Mr. McGreevey no longer has the option of using the gimmicks he used to lessen the pain inflicted in last year's budget. That has intensified the pressure on the governor and his aides to search for new, politically viable, sources of revenue.
There are few easy options. Mr. McGreevey has proposed increasing the taxes on casinos, curtailing property tax rebates, eliminating state-subsidized health care for 60,000 people, slashing funds for the arts, higher education and business incentive grants. All those proposals have met fierce resistance in the Legislature, much of it from the governor's fellow Democrats.
But the issue that most angers voters, and galvanizes New Jersey Republicans, is high property taxes, an issue that Mr. McGreevey, like governors before him, has little power to control. Like so many aspects of the budget battle, that claim is a half truth. Most municipalities and local school districts depend on state aid for a major chunk of their budgets, so it is reasonable to argue that the governor's decision to freeze aid to schools and municipalities last year is at least partly to blame property tax increases that have averaged 7 percent across the state this year.
If the administration had followed through on its plan to force schools to raise property taxes, the governor would have handed Republicans a convenient way to blame him for the entire convoluted problem. With legislative elections coming this fall, and the state Senate split 20-20, the stakes could hardly be higher.
As he sensibly tiptoes away from the state's property tax troubles, Mr. McGreevey still must find some way to solve the budget gap. An increase in the cigarette tax is all but assured. The state is selling bonds against future payments from the tobacco settlement. The administration is also under pressure to enact a so-called "millionaire's tax" on its wealthiest residents.
But if he opts for income tax increases that are broad-based enough to inflame the public, Mr. McGreevey runs the risk of letting Republicans portray him as the second coming of Jim Florio -- whose attempt to revamp New Jersey's system of financing education led to a taxpayer rebellion that limited him to a single term -- and that is a minefield all its own.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
School Year of Discontent

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
THE numbers tell only part of the story. Almost half of Yonkers' 41 public schools appeared on the state list of "most improved" schools in math and English this year. In 1999, only 34 percent of its fourth graders passed the state English test. In 2002, 60 percent did. But members of the N.A.A.C.P. in Yonkers are not satisfied.
 Almost a year after a long-running federal desegregation lawsuit against the Yonkers school district was settled, the public schools, long riddled with budget deficits and high turnover rates among top administrators, have shown significant improvement, but signs of trouble linger. 
 "The results Yonkers has produced in elementary schools are very impressive," said Tom Dunn, a spokesman for the state Department of Education. "They are real gains and results of hard work." 
A different, and unequivocal, answer came from Gail Baxter, the parent coordinator for the school district and a vice president of the districtwide Parents and Teachers Association, when she was asked whether the district had changed for the better. 
"Hell, no," said Ms. Baxter, an executive board member of the Yonkers' branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the plaintiff in the desegregation suit. "Things haven't gotten worse, but my standard for better is much better than what we have." She said she would like to see the closing of achievement gaps between white and minority students. The school district has slightly more than 26,000 students, 75 percent of whom are minorities.
The suit, started in 1980 when the Yonkers branch of the N.A.A.C.P. sued the city over what it called racial segregation in housing and schools, was settled last March when the state agreed to pay $300 million to the Yonkers school district over five years for programs intended to eliminate disparities between white and minority students.
Two weeks after the settlement, the school district received the first installment of $70 million to provide extra help to failing students, to train teachers to improve their skills and to reduce suspension rates.
But difficulties soon surfaced. The district has not met a deadline for hiring a settlement compliance officer by May 1 last year. Last August it offered the job -- then withdrew its offer -- to a Hispanic lawyer, Janet Alvarez, who had held a similar post in New York City. The job was turned down by a second candidate, Tracey Collins, a former teacher in Louisiana, on Feb. 28, leaving the post still vacant 10 months after the deadline.
Joseph M. Pastore Jr., the court-appointed monitor until thesettlement was in place, said that after Ms. Collins turned down the job, he volunteered to be the host of a meeting earlier this month with representatives from the Yonkers mayor's office, the school district and the local N.A.A.C.P., with officials from the Justice Department participating on the phone. At the meeting, Mr. Pastore said he urged the school district to disclose its compliance more fully to the public. 
The resignation of the district's superintendent, Joseph L. Farmer, last Novmember upset many parents, who said he was instrumental in obtaining the settlement.
Budget woes have persisted. Despite the settlement money, the Yonkers school district had a $4.2 million gap this year. It laid off 158 teachers, guidance counselors and administrators last August. Although some were rehired, parents complained that some enrichment programs at smaller schools were eliminated because of the layoffs.
But many teachers and students said the settlement made the difference between a budget disaster and a budget squeeze. 
"The teachers became less distracted after the settlement money came," said Steve Gurusaran, a senior at Yonkers High School. "They worried less about layoffs. For us, it's hard to lose a teacher after you have grown to know him or her."
The interim superintendent, Angelo Petrone, and his team have made efforts to improve the district and comply with the settlement agreement, said many white and minority parents. One achievement was the expansion of smaller classes offered after the end of the regular school days for failing students and anyone who wants to participate.
For Abby Saleh, a sixth grader at Yonkers Middle School whose parents immigrated from Egypt, the benefits of these smaller classes are obvious. She received a 73 in the final exam of social studies two semesters ago; after she began to stay after school almost every day, she earned a 98 in the same subject. 
"The after-school program helps me to form good study habits," Abby said. 
In a recent after-school class, the teacher, Joseph Vicari, asked the children to write a review of a short documentary he had shown them. Mr. Vicari instructed the students to begin their essays with "broad or general" first sentences. When he looked for volunteers to read aloud their essays, virtually all of the 12 children raised their hands high.
But Mr. Vicari estimated that only half of the failing students stay, and often, the top students are the ones who participate in after-school programs, because participation is strictly voluntary. One student who stayed for Mr. Vacari's English class, for example, was Justina Passarelli, who received a 98 in English two semesters ago and 102 -- the highest score in the class -- last semester.
The afternoon sessions, partially financed by the settlement, however, may disappear four years from now when the settlement money dries up. Many educators and parents are concerned that the district, which can barely balance its budget now even with the settlement funds, might undergo draconian cuts.
The answer is for the state government to appropriate more schools financing to Yonkers, the state's second-largest urban center, Mr. Petrone said. Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse, which along with New York rank in the top five, all receive far more dollars per student than Yonkers, he said.
"Why should the Yonkers taxpayers be hit with the brunt of paying for our kids' education while the other big cities are funded by the state?" asked Mr. Petrone, a former principal at Yonkers Middle School. 
Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for thestate budget office, said: "While the state faces major fiscal challenges due to 9/11 and the national recession, our schools will still benefit from overall spending levels that will place New York among the top states in the nation, and well above other major states, such as California, Texas and Florida." 
Analysis of the school district's budgets show that over the last decade, annual state aid to Yonkers schools grew by 258 percent to $233 million from $65 million, while Yonkers' own spending on education dropped by 12 percent from $130 million to $115 million. 
Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed cutting state education aid to Yonkers by 12 percent next year, and Nicholas A. Spano, the Republican representing Yonkers in the State Senate, has vowed to lobby to have at least part of the cuts restored.
But in the view of Karen Edmonson, the education chairwoman of the N.A.A.C.P. in Yonkers when it reached the settlement, the lack of financing is not the major issue. Instead, it's where the money is spent. 
"The best high schools are still on the east side" of Yonkers, she said, bristling. Minority neighborhoods are concentrated on the west side of the city. And since high school students have to take public transportation instead of school buses, some students who live on the west side of Yonkers are unwilling to go to school on the other side of the town. "They are not improving the schools on the west side," Ms. Edmonson said.

Going, Going, Gone

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The statistics have a striking symmetry: before 1995, players hit 50 or more home runs in a season 18 times; in the last eight seasons, beginning with 1995, players have hit 50 or more home runs in a season 18 times.
 Either the home runs or the players, they ain't what they used to be. 
 Don't expect Barry Bonds to provide an explanation. "I've only done it once," he said, referring to hitting 50 or more home runs. Of course, the one time Bonds did it he hit 73, putting him at the forefront of the individual explosion in home runs. 
In each of the past eight seasons, at least one player has hit 50 or more home runs. In 2001, three players joined Bonds in doing it. Last year Alex Rodriguez slugged 57 and Jim Thome 52. 
Before this eight-year period, 50 or more home runs were hit in two successive seasons only three times, twice by Babe Ruth.
Adding even more perspective: in the past five seasons, Sammy Sosa has hit more than 60 home runs three times; the 60-homer mark had been reached only twice in baseball history before 1998, the year Mark McGwire and Sosa waged their scintillating home run duel. 
"The numbers are ridiculously inflated," Bob Brenly, the Arizona Diamondbacks' manager, said. "I don't know what you can do. Do you move the fences back? I don't know. Do you move the mound closer to home plate?"
Maybe you don't do anything.
"That's just the way the game is right now," Brenly added. "The fans don't seem to mind at all, so we do what we have to do."
Baseball people offered a variety of reasons for the 50 phenomenon, including the speculation about steroids and dietary supplements. They also acknowledged difficulty in relating today's home run developments to past times.
Some former players, not surprisingly, felt that the artificial reasons for the new numbers are unfair to the hitters who established the career-leading totals in what they feel were purer days.
But no one wanted to propose that baseball should devise a new system to evaluate home runs compared with the prior highest totals.
"I've been re-evaluating home runs forever," said Bob Boone, a former catcher who is manager of the Cincinnati Reds. "Fifty now is what 40 used to be. Thirty now is what 20 used to be." But, he added, "I don't compare them."
Andy MacPhail, the Chicago Cubs' president, suggested that these things should be taken in stride. 
"The game evolves," he said. "It's always changing, always evolving. This is one aspect of it."
And, don't get too caught up in the dramatic increase of home run hitting, St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa suggested, because the rise will most likely soon abate.
"I just think there will be some natural corrections," he said. "It will be interesting to see how many hit 50 this year. There is an issue about how you equate the last few years of home run hitting versus the Hank Aaron-Roger Maris-Willie Mays type. I think there are some extras working for hitters. Some of those will not be there."
La Russa declined to expand. "I don't want to get specific," he said.
But he wasn't talking about the smaller parks, the poorer pitching, the legitimately bigger and stronger hitters, the lighter bats or the allegedly livelier balls. 
No one is willing to talk about steroids and specific home run hitters. But suspicions abound.
During a recent visit to the Oakland Athletics camp, Cecil Fielder said steroids are a problem but rejected the percentages that some current and former players have claimed use them. 
But, he said, "I hit 50 home runs one year when no one was hitting 50 home runs. Now everybody, even the little guys, are hitting 50 home runs."
Fielder hit 51 home runs in 1990, the 18th time a major leaguer had reached 50, the first time in 13 years and only the second in a quarter century.
Then, in 1995, Albert Belle hit 50, and there was no holding the hitters. In the next four seasons McGwire slugged 52, 58, 70 and 65. Sosa had a four-year run, too, hitting 66, 63, 50 and 64. Ken Griffey hit 56 in successive seasons. 
Brady Anderson's 50 in 1996 was the most bizarre total. In approximately the same number of at-bats, he hit 16 the season before and 18 the season after. His next highest total to 50 was 24.
Luis Gonzalez went from a career-high 31 in 2000 to 57 the next year.
"During my 50 homers I remember, in San Francisco, half the crowd was yelling 'steroids,' at me and the other half was yelling 'stick man,"' recalled the sinewy Gonzalez, whom no one would mistake for a steroids user.
It isn't just the individual season totals that have grabbed peoples' attention. This season especially will focus attention on career totals. With 168 home runs in the past three seasons, Bonds has catapulted to fourth on the career list with 613, trailing only Aaron (755), Ruth (714) and Mays (660). And the 500 home run circle, which has only 17 members, can easily grow by four this season. Sosa has 499, Rafael Palmeiro 490, Fred McGriff 478 and Griffey 468.
Frank Robinson, who is fifth on the career list with 586, was asked if he is bothered that the home run explosion may cause people to undervalue previous highs.
"It shows a disrespect to players who put those numbers up in the past, naturally," Robinson, now the Montreal Expos manager, said. "Guys are using supplements to make themselves better and bigger and stronger. Over time, players like the Aarons and the Mayses won't get their just due."
Home run inflation could also affect the way Hall of Fame voters view career totals. Voters have always accepted 500 as automatic fame certification, but by the time Palmeiro and McGriff appear on the ballot, they may look at that number differently. 
Decisions could be based on a voter's perception of the player. If the player was suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs, for instance, he might lose votes. On the other hand, voters will have to consider the evolution of the game..
"The culture of the game has changed," the Cubs' MacPhail said. "It used to be that strikeouts were humiliating and unacceptable. Today it's more acceptable. Close to 25 percent of the outs are strikeouts. You have players taking a 2-2 swing today they didn't take 20 years ago. Putting the ball in play is not in favor as it once was."
At 40, Jamie Moyer is one of the older players in the major leagues, but even he has no firsthand knowledge of what the game used to be.
"I can't look back 25, 30 years," Moyer, a pitcher for Seattle, said. "But I've got to believe from watching old clips, guys gave themselves up more to move the runner. There's more emphasis on home runs now." 
One of the most noticeable differences in home runs, Moyer said, is the direction they take.
"Twenty-five, 30 years ago," he said, "did guys drive the ball out of the ballpark the opposite way as much as they do today? Probably not. What does that tell you? To me, it says they're looking for a ball over the plate more."
Moyer's former manager confirmed his suspicion.
"The biggest thing to me," Lou Piniella said, "is when I played there were a handful of players who could hit the ball with consistency over the center-field wall or to the opposite field. Now that list has grown immensely. At times you see four, five, six home runs hit in a game and nothing is hit to the pull fields. They're hit either the opposite way or to the center part of the field."
Players can more readily hit balls over opposite-field fences because they are bigger and stronger. Some may be bigger and stronger because of steroids and supplements, but most players work for their size.
"There's a lot of work being done in the weight room," Moyer said. "You can't say it's all steroids."
Alex Rodriguez sat in the Texas Rangers' clubhouse in the new spring training complex in Surprise, Ariz., and talked about conditioning and weight work.
"You look back 20 years ago, you come to a place like this, nowhere could you find a weight room," he said. "Now the first thing they do when they build a place like this is build a weight room. The nature of the game has changed completely."
Bigger salaries have eliminated the need for off-season jobs and have provided inducement to work out during the winter as well.
Rodriguez, who has hit 109 home runs the past two seasons, is a prime example of the change in size of today's players.
"There was only one Cal Ripken and Ernie Banks," he said, referring to the size of those shortstops. "Now you're seeing Jeter, Rodriguez, Garciaparra. These are big people playing shortstop. That's not normal. Is there going to be a 6-8 shortstop in the year 2030? I hope not. But at the pace we're going, that's where it's going."
While players are growing, parks are shrinking. Most new parks have been deliberately made smaller than their predecessors, to make them more intimate for fans. Their size has enhanced home run hitting.
"When I was playing," Robinson said, "we'd go into team meetings and the manager would say, 'When you need an out, make the guy hit it to the big part of the ballpark.' Today there's no such thing. It's not because the hitters are hitting the ball over the center-field fence. Center-field fences are much shorter; the gaps are much shorter."
He added: "The Polo Grounds was a cab ride to center field. There's no place for a pitcher today to get hitters out."
Players have introduced other changes. Jeff Torborg, the Florida Marlins manager, said he used a 34-inch, 32-ounce bat, "which is not a little bat now, and Willie Mays picked it up and said, 'I pick my teeth with this."'
Today's players use smaller and lighter bats, the better to generate bat speed, which in turn creates power. Boone recalled that Fred Lynn, in the late 70's, initiated that trend. 
"E equals MC squared," Boone said. "Reduced mass, but you get more velocity."
Piniella explained that the faster a player can get his bat to the hitting area "the more power you're going to have." And the more power a hitter has, the wealthier he can become.
"Guys who can hit home runs with frequency are like heavyweight boxers," Piniella said. "They make more than the middleweights and the lightweights."
All of the changes raise the question of how Babe Ruth would have fared if he were playing today with the new technology and training.
"I don't know if he would take advantage of it," Brenly said. "He'd take advantage of that 2 a.m. closing time. I don't know if Babe would have the work ethic to hit it as hard as some of these guys do."

Twins Are Looking to Win A Title, Not Recognition

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
The dutiful fan had his baseball cards wrapped in sheets of plastic this spring as he waited beside the Minnesota Twins' dugout for autographs. But whenever one of the Twins approached, the fan cheated to determine his identity. He peeked down at his cards a few times before he was confident enough to holler for "Mr. Mientkiewicz" or "Mr. Guzman" or "Mr. Koskie."
 The plucky, contraction-dodging Twins reached the American League Championship Series last season before losing to the Anaheim Angels, the eventual World Series champions, but a part of them that remains refreshingly anonymous. The cautious fan was a fitting metaphor for the Twins because there are times when casual observers look at them and still wonder who they are. 
 The Twins do not care about recognition. Let the Yankees be showered with attention for investing $53 million in a Japanese outfielder and a Cuban pitcher; that amount was the equivalent of Minnesota's entire payroll last season. Let everyone marvel about how arduous it is to play in the treacherous A.L. West. Meanwhile, the Twins, who hung around longer than any A.L. club except the Angels a year ago, will muddle along, winning and hoping. 
Maybe this is the magical season when the Twins shed another layer of their anonymity and take one or two more steps. The first big step would mean getting to the World Series, and the second would mean winning it. The Twins, who play in the Charmin-soft Central Division, stress that they are not a one-season wonder and believe they can do what the Angels did and win it all.
"We're pretty much the same team," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "We've gained a year's worth of good experience, we've grown closer and matured a little bit, and hopefully we've learned from what happened last year. We think we can improve on it and have a chance to win the World Series."
When the Angels won the first title in their 42-season history, it was a wonderful tale about a fundamentally sound team that showed what playing properly can accomplish. The Angels took pitches, they rarely struck out, they made productive outs, they had a deep bullpen that obscured an ordinary rotation and they had a feisty attitude. 
The Angels also had a reasonable payroll of $77.3 million, almost $100 million less than the Yankees', so their improbable triumph gave hope to a number of teams. "If the Angels could win a title, why not us?" was a question uttered in several spring training camps. The Angels, the Twins ($53.8 million) and the Oakland Athletics ($65.4 million) all joined the Yankees ($171.3 million) in the postseason, three small spenders and one big spender.
But Commissioner Bud Selig called the success of the Twins, the Angels and the A's, who have been in the postseason for three straight years, an aberration. Selig probably thought he needed to say that because the collective bargaining agreement reached last August increased the revenue sharing from the large market to the small market clubs, and he believes those changes were essential.
Now the Angels are the model for some teams. Play baseball the right way and do it economically, which the Twins have been doing. Even after signing Torii Hunter to a four-year, $32 million deal and Jacque Jones to a two-year, $7.1 million contract and adding pitcher Kenny Rogers for $2 million to replace the injured Eric Milton, the Twins will still have one of the lowest payrolls in the major leagues.
The Twins, like the Angels, embody the team concept. The Yankees have a deep rotation, a deep bullpen and a stacked lineup. The Twins are different. No player drove in more than 94 runs. No pitcher won more than 15 games. Hunter, a spectacular center fielder, is their one superstar. 
The Twins have sturdy pitching and will rarely hurt themselves on defense; they made only 74 errors, the least in the majors. Hunter and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz are Gold Glove winners, and shortstop Cristian Guzman and third baseman Corey Koskie are reliable. The Twins were not the Angels, but they want to be just like the Angels. 
"It just goes to show you that you don't need to have a huge payroll to be successful," infielder Denny Hocking said. "I think the Angels were such a phenomenal team. They were in a pennant race the whole month of September. They were used to that atmosphere and, when it came time for the playoffs, they were ready. I think they caught the Yankees by surprise."
Can that situation unfold again? In 2001, the Angels won 75 games and finished 41 games out of first place. Even pitcher Jarrod Washburn conceded that it would have been a bit presumptuous for the Angels to focus on the World Series. But once the 2002 season started and the Angels overcame a sluggish first few weeks, their confidence soared. 
"What we did is play baseball," Anaheim's Tim Salmon said. "That's the way baseball is supposed to be played. The challenge is putting things together and doing it again."
Paul Molitor, a future Hall of Famer who is a minor league coordinator for the Twins, said bluntly that another low payroll team was unlikely to repeat what the Angels did because history shows higher payroll teams usually dominate in the postseason. Between 1995 and 2001, teams from the bottom two quartiles of the payroll scale won 5 of 224 postseason games. The Twins almost matched that by winning four postseason games in 2002. 
Still, Molitor -- the one man in uniform the autograph-seeking fan recognized without peeking at his cards -- explained grudgingly that the opportunities for teams with lower payrolls to win a title are rare. Doing what Anaheim did in winning the World Series will be difficult for the Angels to repeat and difficult for the Twins to mimic, too. 
"We got some experience, we kept our players, but the odds aren't in your favor," Molitor said. "Realistically, our players might not say that. But that's how I feel."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Needs Technology Programs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Much attention has been drawn to Governor McGreevey's proposed cuts in financing for the arts (Feb. 23, March 16) but little to his plan for equally severe cuts to science and technology programs. 
If approved by the Legislature, the plan will eliminate all state investments in research and development programs that bring academic scientists at our universities together with industry researchers and engineers while also spinning out new businesses and providing other benefits to our economy. 
 The plan will eliminate federally supported programs on our university campuses and operating support for all 11 of our business incubators, entrepreneurial centers that have helped create new businesses for 18 years, especially in urban areas. It will also eliminate the entire staff and operations of the Commission on Science and Technology, of which I am the executive director. This is the state agency that administers and monitors these programs, which historically have obtained at least $3 in nonstate funds for every $1 invested by the commission. 
While we are aware of the budget crisis facing our state, New Jersey needs these programs to maintain its competitive position in a technology-based and technology-driven economy.

HEADLINE: Abuse of Horses Is a Growing Problem 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Tough Times for the State Animal" (Feb. 23): 
 Of importance when speaking of "tough times" for horses is the work of New Jersey's private, nonprofit equine-rescue farms. The state has no rescue system in place for horses in crises. Sadly, in today's economy the number of horses neglected and abused grows steadily, and the rescue farms are bombarded daily with requests to provide food and shelter for these animals. The financial burden is great, and the demand for shelter is shrinking. One such farm, Mylestone Equine Rescue, in Phillipsburg, can be reached at (908)995-9300 or www.mylestone.org.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
For Young Artists, a Show With Just the Right Slant

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO 

 BODY:
THE people at Real Art Ways in Hartford have been pestering me for weeks to come see this show. Now I know why, for it's a corker. Eungie Joo, the curator, has assembled, under the shady title "Lean To," a compelling array of works by seven young and emerging artists. All but one are from New York City.
 A lean-to is a temporary shelter, either free-standing or supported by one wall of a larger building. It is usually makeshift, economical and provisionary. The same goes for the works in this show, which exude a hip urbanity. Herein lies their appeal. 
 Take Mark Bradford's "Burn Baby Burn" (2002), a whopper of a painting made from strips of color copier paper, chunks of metal and singed squares of industrial tissue, the kind used for perm rollers in hairdressing salons, embedded in gesso, then covered in a light lacquer glaze. The overall effect is reminiscent of those big, coolly expressive New York abstracts of the 1960's, yet with a vernacular quality that hints at the curbside grittiness of Pop. 
"Double Stretch," made this year also by Mr. Bradford, is similarly beguiling. A casual glance at this pot-au-feu of a painting on mesh yields a dizzying array of optical effects. After more prolonged viewing, what appeared at first to be a random accretion of colors and shapes begins to cohere into a solid picture. Although only 40, Mr. Bradford is set to pass slower traffic on the road to fame.
Deborah Grant's paintings have the playful, cartoonish quality of Pop art. But her imagery is laced with angst, deriving mostly from painful memories of school dormitories, mental wards, crack dwellings, dead end bars and the people she met there. Imagine Roy Lichtenstein channeling Jean-Michel Basquiat, and you've got an idea of the ferocious graphic quality of these works. Imagine Raymond Pettibon meets Marilyn Manson, and you've got an idea of the content. Yikes! 
Over in the far room is a video by Paul Chan, a new media artist from New York City. Mr. Chan is best known for his placard-waving, political/aesthetic web page for longhairs, National Philistine, and recently spent a month in Baghdad as a member of a group working to end sanctions against Iraq. His video samples radio broadcasts and television news footage to satirize the Bush cabinet and its policy on Iraq. Although mischievous, it's a hoot.
The public to which Mr. Chan's video speaks is mostly anti-war, although whatever your views on the conflict, you cannot help laughing at what appears to be the voice of Colin Powell reading from the writings of Michel Foucault on the inevitability of history, or Condoleeza Rice at the front line dictating a letter to her family back home. My favorite is a voice sample of Donald Rumsfeld saying, "We must learn to live with low-density hope." 
One can find all manner of references to other artists in the works in this show. Perhaps the most obvious are Andrew Rogers' snapshots of mundane urban landscapes. There's been so much of this dimly lighted, painfully banal photography over the last few years that the entire genre is starting to wear a little thin. Much of this sort of work will surely sink like a stone in the next few years. 
Out on his own, working in three dimensions, is Isami Ching. His contribution consists of a huge plastic funnel hanging from the ceiling beneath a skylight. Aside from being beautiful, its design and placement reveal a keen formal and conceptual intelligence. Light streams through the skylight to illuminate the vessel. At other, rather more rare, moments, it begins to glow. 
Just as young artists get ahead by showing whenever and wherever they can, young curators get to be players in the art world by also adopting a scattergun approach. The logic goes something like this: The more shows you do, the more you get your name about town, build up your curriculum vitae and have a shot at a coveted museum post. 
Perhaps that's what Ms. Joo was thinking when she was selecting a theme and artists for "Lean To," while at the same time arranging another exhibition, "Lean," at the ISE Cultural Foundation in New York City. The inspiration for both shows is pretty much the same, as are a bunch of the artists. Hartford is some way from New York, but it's not so far that nobody will notice.
"Lean To" is at Real Art Ways, 56 Arbor Street, Hartford, through April 27. Information: www.realartways.org. or (860)232-1006.

HEADLINE: Flour Power 

BYLINE:  By Ann Hodgman; Ann Hodgman is the author of "One Bite Won't Kill You," a book of recipes for children.

 BODY:
How small and humble this book is to have made such a big difference. Look at it: the title, "The Tassajara Bread Book," in calligraphic type. The circular cover drawing -- a loaf of bread and sunflowers -- like something from a small-town literary magazine. The cover itself, made of coarse brown paper. Even the text, printed in brown. You feel as though the book should be sitting on a butcher-block kitchen counter 30 years ago, next to an avocado pit that someone's trying to sprout in a jar of water. 
 The 30-years part would be right, anyway. "The Tassajara Bread Book" was written in the late 1960's by a young Zen student named Edward Espe Brown, who lived and worked at a Zen retreat named Tassajara, in Monterey County, Calif. His manuscript was published in 1970 by the Shambhala press in Berkeley, Calif. The book began with a $100 advance and a 3,000-copy printing. Now there are 750,000 copies in print, and it still sells a steady 3,000 copies every year. Many people consider it the bible of bread baking, one of the most influential cookbooks ever, an inspiration not only to bakers and chefs but also to an entire generation of food writers. The same bread and sunflowers remain on the cover. And Brown, who was ordained as a Zen priest in 1971, is still working to disseminate his vision of what we could be, if we could remember how to use our hands. 
 Those of us who remember baking our first bread in the 60's remember very, very heavy bread. When you're using whole grains for the first time and you're using yeast for the first time and you can't believe that the bread dough actually has to double in bulk before you bake it -- because no matter how pure and virtuous bread baking is, whoever heard of a food you have to wait for? -- well, like the majority of first-time bakers in the 60's, you turn out loaves that could be used to build forts. This somehow seems to add to the bread's moral worth, but worthiness isn't much fun to eat.
"The Tassajara Bread Book" changed that. Not that our parents' food tomes, like "The Joy of Cooking," didn't have bread recipes. But with their primly efficient format and their teeny industrial illustrations, they were too much like something you'd use in home-economics classes. Here, on the other hand, was a book that began:
"Dedicated
with respect and appreciation
to all my teachers
past, present and future:
gods, men, and demons; 
beings, animate and inanimate, 
living and dead, alive and dying.
Rock and water
wind and tree
bread dough rising
Vastly all
are patient with me."
The book was illustrated with drawings of laughing Buddhas, cats and sandals. It told you not to become intimidated by bread dough, and that getting angry at yeast's failings "does not help."
The book was a perfect fit for the times (one fan wrote that learning to make his own bread had liberated him from corporate America) and an ongoing addition to Tassajara's operating budget.
Which was why it was written in the first place. "I was so grateful," Brown says now, "for the opportunities I had to practice Zen at Tassajara," where he studied with Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. "Suzuki Roshi was not a particularly demonstrative person, but I know that he loved me as much as anybody ever has -- and just for who I was, not for being a great cook. I wanted to do something to repay my tremendous feeling of gratitude, and I thought maybe a book about making bread would earn some money for the Zen center and be a nice thing to do for people."
There was a reason for such gratitude. When Brown was 3, his mother died. Three days later, Brown and his older brother, Dwite, were placed in an orphanage in San Anselmo, Calif., by their grief-stricken father. It was the only way he could continue to regularly see his sons, who otherwise would have had to live with relatives in South Dakota. Edward Brown was the youngest child who had ever lived there. "My father told me that when I first got to the orphanage, I just sat on a rocking chair on the porch all day long," he says. "I wouldn't talk or play with the other kids. Now I look at that and I think, Wow, my first meditation." Four years later, Brown's father remarried, and the boys were able to return home. "Still, I do have the feeling sometimes that I've spent a good deal of my life figuring out how to be my own mother. I think my cooking and baking can be seen in that light."
A happier inspiration came a few years later, when Brown and his brother visited their aunt in Washington, D.C., and she made them the first homemade bread they'd ever tasted. "The house smelled so amazing when we'd get back from sightseeing -- so friendly and appetizing. Even at that age, I thought: What's happened in our culture? Why aren't we eating bread like this? What's gone wrong here? I basically decided, I'm going to do this. I'm going to share this with people. There's no reason we shouldn't have something this delicious in our lives." (Later Dwite would say, "What I remember about that trip is the Smithfield ham, but it didn't change my life.")
In the summer of 1967, Brown took a job as a dishwasher at Tassajara. "I asked the cooks right away if they could teach me to make bread, and they said, 'Well, of course.' It meant less work for them. For me, it was like love. I started making the bread all the time." Later that summer, when one of the cooks quit, Tassajara's owners invited Brown to be a cook. Gradually he began asking the other people in the kitchen to write down their recipes, and things grew from there.
The bread book's first printing sold out immediately, and it continued to sell so well that it was printed in two subsequent editions, slightly revised, with additional recipes for things like desserts and flavored butter. "In 1985, I realized, to my horror, that I'd written the whole book in Suzuki Roshi English, leaving out the articles and pronouns," Brown says. "I decided to put them back in."
"Tassajara Cooking," the book's sequel, came out in 1973, two years after Suzuki Roshi died, "and we had learned how to speak English again." The Tassajara cookbooks were followed by "The Greens Cookbook," written with Deborah Madison, and the tragically out-of-print "Tomato Blessings and Radish Teachings." Brown also edited a collection of Suzuki Roshi's lectures, called "Not Always So."
Asked what he thinks about bread machines, Brown pauses. "I try to be tolerant," he says after another pause. "I've had some pretty decent bread from bread machines. But I'm convinced that working with your hands is fundamentally nourishing. As the Shakers said, work is a gift to the person doing the work. Why turn it down? When you knead bread, you're kneading all the channels and acupuncture points in your hands. Whether or not you call that a spiritual benefit or just a physiological one, doing something with your hands is just incredibly invigorating to your whole body."
After Tassajara, Brown worked at San Francisco's Greens Restaurant in virtually every capacity, from busboy to wine buyer to manager. He mainly teaches now: occasional vegetarian-cooking classes, frequent meditation and yoga workshops. He is still asking, "What's gone wrong here?" But being an idealist is harder in these pinched days. Apart from his distress over the nation's politics, he worries that America has lost its most fundamental independence. "When I was growing up," he says, "nobody could show me how to bake bread -- and it's only gotten worse. It seems such a shame that as a culture we don't teach our children about the basic things in life -- bread making, gardening, sewing -- and the value of work. At some point, all these things got to be beneath our dignity. If you can't work with your hands, you lose the richness of your life and the sense of being productive."
He continues: "In my book, I wanted in a small way to share the fact that you could actually learn skills in your life that would help you become able to take care of yourself. It's so simple. It's such a clear vision. People have the capacity to cook and garden and farm, and we don't use it. It's very sad to me that it's come to this."
But he keeps baking. And he rarely ends a conversation with Goodbye. Instead, he says, "Blessings." 

Tassajara's Flaky Biscuits

1 cup unbleached white flour
1 cup whole-wheat flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk.
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Combine flours, baking powder and salt. Cut butter or margarine into dry ingredients with a pastry cutter or two knives, or rub gently between hands until pea-size pieces are formed. 
2. Make a well in the center and add the eggs and milk. Beat the eggs and milk with a fork until smooth. Continue stirring with the fork, gradually incorporating flour until it is all moistened. 
3. On a floured board, knead the dough just enough to bring it together. Roll the dough into a rectangle 1/2-inch thick. Fold in thirds. Turn the dough a quarter-turn and repeat, rolling and folding. Repeat once more. (The rolling and folding make a flakier biscuit.)
4. Roll out the dough again to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into rounds with a floured cutter or glass. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 450 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned and the tops slightly golden. Do not overbake.
Yield: 12 to16 biscuits.
Note: for a variation, add 1/2 cup roasted sesame or sunflower seeds to the dry ingredients.

 BEING AMERICA
Liberty, Commerce, and Violence
in an American World.
By Jedediah Purdy.
337 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
 JEDEDIAH PURDY was the wunderkind du jour a few years ago. In 1999, when he was 24, he published "For Common Things: Irony, Trust, and Commitment in America Today," an ambitious assault on his own generation for its narcissism and self-absorption. Purdy's target was the ironic sensibility that, he said, had infected just about everyone under 35; his arch villain was Jerry Seinfeld, "irony incarnate." In a cynical Seinfeldian world -- also the world of "Saturday Night Live" and "Beavis and Butt-head" -- nothing mattered, nothing was true; it was "all spin, all the way down." "For Common Things" was a courageous book, not only because it was articulating a decidedly unfashionable view but also because it is hard to attack irony without sounding like a pill. Purdy could sound like a pill. His calls for sincerity and mutual obligation blurred all too readily into a posture of self-righteousness. Still, in an age bounded by Madonna and Eminem, it was refreshing to encounter a young, secular author making an impassioned appeal for moral commitment and social responsibility.
His second book, "Being America: Liberty, Commerce, and Violence in an American World," shows that Purdy has lost none of his ambition. His theme now is globalization in its social, economic and, above all, intellectual aspects, his goal an answer to the oft-repeated question "Why do they hate us?" In 2001 Purdy went to see for himself, traveling through the Middle East and Asia, talking to students, business executives, ethnic nationalists, religious fanatics. This is his report on the bad news.
Globalization, Purdy says, has produced disruption everywhere, an unavoidable "tectonic" shift. Traditions have been uprooted, institutions overturned, populations left untethered and resentful. Does this sound familiar? It should. Marxism may be dead, but Marx's picture of the awful destructiveness wrought by free markets still has force, and his famous comment on the psychological impact of capitalism could be Purdy's as well: "All that is solid melts into air." But Purdy diverges from Marx in two key ways. First, he does not have a 19th-century faith in the inevitability of progress. Where Marx was confident that the proletariat would usher in a golden age, Purdy sees a still unresolved conflict between two tendencies, one liberal and tolerant, the other illiberal, fanatical and violent. These tendencies, he is keen to point out, exist side by side within countries, even within the same person. 
Second, where Marx understood history to be driven by inexorable economic forces, Purdy gives those forces an American face. Throughout the world, he writes, globalization is viewed as an American phenomenon, so that when difficulties emerge or conditions turn sour, fairly or unfairly, the United States is blamed. Consequently, it is for America, the "prophetic nation," to show the way, to ensure that the values of freedom and openness prevail over religious and nationalistic extremism. Greatness has been thrust upon us.
Purdy is at his best describing the people he met on his travels. One might well object that there is nothing representative about them: he talks to the Bill Gates of India; he manages to find a non-Coptic Christian family in Egypt (who complained that the Americans weren't as tough on Muslims as the Israelis were). But for somebody who lives so much in his head, Purdy is a surprisingly sharp observer. Mainly, what he observes is paradox, contradiction -- the woman lawyer in Cairo, Westernized in every way except that she has refound her Islamic faith and declares that if Osama bin Laden had attacked the White House, "no one could have said it was murder"; or the cosmopolitan gay AIDS activist in Bombay, who believes Hinduism "needs a whip" to use against the Muslims; or the upwardly mobile students at Beijing University who see through the government's Marxist rhetoric and tell Purdy that what China requires is "to be ruled by good kings."
Purdy's eye for contradiction extends beyond individuals. He has the ability to perceive the mix of good and bad in most things. Capitalism sets people free; it also destroys lives. Nationalism provides inspiration and ideals, a sense of shared purpose. But because it is exclusionary, setting "us" against "them," it is "intrinsically violent." This bifurcated outlook is one of Purdy's strengths. He is not likely ever to go off the deep end. He may support liberal democracy as the best solution yet devised for mankind's problems, but he understands that one size does not fit all. Americans make a mistake when they try to apply their model everywhere, he says; institutions and social structures must be shaped to particular circumstances. All true.
NEVERTHELESS, this is not an easy book to like. It's so diffuse that you never know what's coming next. A conversation with Indonesian environmentalists segues into a critique of Christian evangelicalism; a chapter on Benetton's advertising (of all things) is followed by one on Subcomandante Marcos and the Mexican Zapatistas. Purdy can be preachy, homiletic. He is fond of the disingenuous "we," which seems to include everyone but himself, as in: "We do not pause to consider that we bearers of civilization might display some barbarism ourselves." Purdy pauses -- you can count on it. He also enjoys showing off his learning: within the space of eight pages he cites the Buddha, St. Augustine, Plato, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Tocqueville, John Winthrop, Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln, Walt Whitman, Michael Oakeshott and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Purdy knows what the big questions are. It's the answers that give him trouble. In his closing chapters he offers some suggestions for healing global divisions, and what they come down to is that the wealthy countries should play nice. They should be "generous and fair-minded," "principled" and "humane." The United States in particular will have to put its house in order and learn to lead by example. The whole world is watching, and unless America becomes a paragon of liberal democracy, the forces of illiberalism will grow. "In the end," he writes, "peoples cannot take responsibility for each other; but they serve each other when they take responsibility for themselves." Given the dangers we now face from international terrorism and nuclear proliferation, Purdy's stress on tending our own garden seems at least a little beside the point, and some of his readers may see in this a faint family resemblance to the "blame America first" mentality identified years ago by Jeane Kirkpatrick. But a closer relative is the strain of American Protestantism that in the face of external threats emphasizes personal purity and redemption from sin. When the towers fell, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson looked inward for the cause. Purdy's impulse takes the same form; it's the content that differs. Where Falwell and Robertson worry about school prayer and sex, Purdy worries about poverty and trees.
The problem is that Purdy has a deep aversion to the employment of power. In this he is not very different from many others on the left, and it is a major reason large numbers of Americans look upon liberals (understood here in the narrow sense) as wimps. Do not try to imagine Jedediah Purdy with his head poking out of a tank. At one point he says that "Being America" is a book concerned with varieties of power, but it is more accurately a book about the avoidance of power. The United States is urged to be prudent and recognize its limits, to use its strength to nurture and protect. Be modest, he says. "It is better not to speak too loudly of one's own principles." Purdy himself has certainly learned to speak softly. So far, however, he has failed to grasp the other half of Theodore Roosevelt's equation for surviving in the real world.

America and Europe
in the New World Order.

 Every now and again, American thinking about foreign affairs is galvanized by an essay that seems to explain the confusing and disparate phenomena of a changing world -- a sort of unifying theory that, whether accepted or rejected, cannot be ignored. Such were George Kennan's "X" article in 1947, which set the strategy for the cold war; Francis Fukuyama's "End of History" article in 1989; and Samuel Huntington's 1993 essay "The Clash of Civilizations." 
These days, the loudest buzz is over Robert Kagan's "Power and Weakness," an essay that appeared in the June-July 2002 issue of Policy Review. It presented the provocative notion that America and Europe are fundamentally different and are becoming more so as the United States amasses extraordinary military might while the Europeans seek to supplant it with international cooperation. 
"That is why on major strategic and international questions today, Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus," Kagan proclaimed at the outset: "They agree on little and understand one another less and less." This, he further declared, could not be attributed to any single factor -- say, the team currently in the White House -- but rather represented a profound, long-developing and enduring divergence. 
It is, indeed, a tantalizing notion, made all the more so by the unexpectedly real anger manifested in the struggle between Washington and Paris over Iraq. The Atlantic has not seemed so wide in decades, and if Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld really believes that France and Germany represent the dying vestiges of an "old Europe," soon to be supplanted by the fresh pro-American legions of Eastern Europe, he'd better take a look at the polls. There's a Europe out there that sees things very differently from the way we do, whether the issue is the Balkans, the environment, the death penalty, bioengineered food, the ABM treaty, the International Court of Justice, the United Nations or how to handle Saddam Hussein. These differences, moreover, have steadily deteriorated into mutual mudslinging: Europeans see Americans as cowboys, belligerent and crude; Americans dismiss Europeans as decadent, spent and weak-willed. 
The fact that Kagan published his essay months before Washington and Paris squared off in the United Nations Security Council makes him seem almost prophetic. Now, in an expanded and revised version, his treatise has been transformed into a slim volume with the new name "Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order." 
The basic idea is that the conclusion of the cold war ended the need to present a common Western front, and allowed a host of fundamental differences to rise to the surface. The Europeans, battered by centuries of warfare, envisioned the post-Soviet future as a world governed by international cooperation and transnational institutions, with the European Union as the shining example. Armed conflict was not to be their tool, but rather the "soft" weapons of economic and diplomatic enticements. At the same time, the United States, with its global reach and responsibility, remained locked in a world where a secure and democratic order depended on the possession and use of arms. The "entirely natural and predictable consequence," Kagan argues, was an American willingness to use that force and European objection to that exercise. 
It is difficult to dispute that Europe and the United States have assumed very different notions of how the post-Soviet world should be ordered. In the debate over the International Criminal Court, even Britain -- which is far more comfortable with the United States as a partner than are the nations of the Continent -- resisted Washington's demands to exempt American peacekeeping troops from the court's reach. At the same time, Europe and the rest of the world have learned that there is a clear limit to how much transnational authority the United States will accept. One can see an obvious irony in the notion that only in collapse did the Soviet Union achieve its goal of dividing the Europeans and Americans. 
But then the cold war put an artificial lid on many a conflict, and Kagan's argument is that the definitive victory of the Western liberal ideal lifted the need to maintain a common Western front. "The existence of Muslim fundamentalism may force Americans and Europeans to defend themselves against devastating attack, and even to cooperate in providing a common defense," he writes. "But it does not force 'the West' to prove itself unified and coherent, as Soviet Communism once had." 
Kagan has drawn fire when he suggests that the enormous disparity of power has led Europe to duck responsibility for policing a dangerous world of terrorists, rogue nations and failed states, or to settle for what one European describes as a division of labor that consists of Americans "making the dinner" and the Europeans "doing the dishes." Kagan serves up an especially provocative image when he compares the United States and Europe to two men confronting a dangerous bear, one armed only with a knife and the other with a rifle. It is psychologically inevitable, he declares, that the one with the knife will choose to lie low, while the one with the gun will find greater security in trying to shoot the bear. "This perfectly normal human psychology has driven a wedge between the United States and Europe," he asserts. 
The analysis comes close to giving an implicit approval to the Bush administration's furious pursuit of Saddam Hussein as a "perfectly normal" course of action, while relegating Europeans to permanent timidity in a world teeming with rogue bears. But if Kagan's analogy were in fact accurate, would not the Europeans cheer the American hunter on? Is not the real issue here that the Europeans fear the unconstrained hunter -- and specifically George W. Bush -- more than they fear the bear? And is the bear that Bush decided to pursue the real threat out there? 
However compelling Kagan's arguments about the causes and effects of the divergence of Europe and the United States, it is difficult to accept the idea that the current level of animosity is natural or unavoidable, that it would have been the same no matter who was in the White House or in the Elysee Palace. It is specifically the Bush administration that put forth a military doctrine calling for overwhelming American military superiority unto eternity, that has been neglecting the Israeli-Palestinian struggle as it spins out of control and that consistently pushed for war against Iraq. 
Yes, Democratic administrations have not shied away from using force: the last administration did bomb Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan and Yugoslavia. Yet Bill Clinton avoided a "you're with us or against us" posture, and managed to remain popular in Europe. The fact that Europe and America are different, and that the United States wields such extraordinary power, should be an argument for a more patient foreign policy. 
For all the balance and careful argument of his essay, Kagan sometimes lets slip a certain frustration with such thinking. "The facile assertion that the United States cannot 'go it alone' is more a hopeful platitude than a description of reality," he writes. "The problem today, if it is a problem, is that the United States can 'go it alone,' and it is hardly surprising that the American superpower should wish to preserve its ability to do so." Yet to argue against "going it alone" is not necessarily a sign of weakness. From a continent that has a clear memory of what war is, it may be wisdom. 
It is probably unfair to Kagan to continue in this manner, summarizing his thoughts and challenging various tidbits, since even in book form his discussion fills only 103 pages, and they are well worth reading. This is especially so since his prose is lucid and elegant, and his arguments are thoughtfully marshaled. A veteran of four years in the State Department, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of several books and articles, Kagan demonstrates a confidence and authority that demand serious attention. To disagree with his theses is not to argue against the importance of his essay. On the contrary, generating an intelligent and focused debate is a major function of such works. The true measure of Kagan's small book is that it is hard to imagine any future serious discussion of trans-Atlantic relations or America's role in the world without reference to it.

HEADLINE: The Trading Desk 

BYLINE:  By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine. This article is adapted from "Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game," to be published in May by W.W. Norton & Co.

 BODY:
It was late July of last year, July of last year, which is to say that Mike Magnante had picked a bad time to pitch poorly. Mags, as everyone called him, had come in against Cleveland in the top of the seventh with two runners on and a three-run lead. The first thing he did was to walk Jim Thome -- no one could blame him for that. He then gave up a bloop single to Milton Bradley, and the inherited runners scored -- just plain bad luck, that. But then he threw three straight balls to Lee Stevens. Stevens dutifully took a strike, then waited for Mags to throw his fifth pitch. 
 After the game the first question the Oakland A's' general manager, Billy Beane, asked his manager, Art Howe, was why he brought in Magnante. Howe's first answer was that he thought that Mags, the lefty, would be effective against a left-handed slugger like Thome. Which was just more conventional baseball nonsense, in Beane's view, since Mags hadn't got anyone out in weeks. Howe's second answer was that Beane put Mags on the team, and if a guy is on the team, you need to use him. Howe won't say this directly to Beane, but he'll probably think it. The coaching staff had grown tired of hearing Beane holler at them for using Magnante. "The guy has got braces on both legs," said Rick Peterson, the pitching coach. "We're not going to use him as a pinch runner. If you don't want us to use him, trade him." 
 Magnante went into his stretch and looked for the signal. He had recently turned 37 and was four days shy of the 10 full years of big-league service he needed to collect a full pension. Paul DePodesta, Oakland's assistant general manager, often said that "for guys to be available to us, there usually has to be something wrong with them," and it wasn't hard to see what was wrong with Mags, to discern the defect that made him available to a strapped team like Oakland. He was pear-shaped and slack-jawed and looked less like a professional baseball player than most of the beat reporters who covered the team. 
Magnante made an almost perfect pitch to Lee Stevens, a fastball low and away. The catcher was set up low and outside. When you see the replay, you understand that he had hit his spot. If he missed, it was only by half an inch. It was the pitch Mike Magnante wanted to make. Good pitch, bad count. The ball caught the fat part of the bat. It rose and rose, and the two runners on base began to circle ahead of the hitter. It was Lee Stevens's first home run as a Cleveland Indian. By the time the ball landed, the first and third basemen were closing in on the mound like bailiffs, and Art Howe was on the top of the dugout steps. Magnante let in five runs and got nobody out. It wasn't the first time that he had been knocked out of a game, but it wasn't often he had been knocked out on his pitch. That's what happens when you're 37 years old: you do the things you always did, but the results are somehow different. 
The game was effectively over. The Indians' own left-handed relief pitcher, Ricardo Rincon, struck out David Justice on three pitches and got Eric Chavez to pop out on four. The contrast cast Mags in unflattering light. The A's had the weakest left-handed relief pitching in the league, and the Indians had some of the strongest. To see the difference, Billy Beane didn't even need to watch the game.
The next day, when Billy Beane sits upright in his office, a few yards from Oakland's Coliseum, he faces a wall covered entirely by a white board and, on it, the names of the several hundred players controlled by the Oakland A's. Mike Magnante's name is still on that board. Swiveling around to his rear, he faces another white board with the names of the nearly 1,200 players on other major league rosters. Ricardo Rincon's name is on that board. At this point in the year Beane doesn't really need to look at these boards to make connections; he knows every player on other teams that he wants, and every player in his own system that he doesn't want. The trick is to persuade other teams to buy his guys for more than they are worth and to sell their guys for less than they are worth. Jermaine Dye, Johnny Damon, Ray Durham, Mark Ellis, CoryLidle, Chad Bradford: in just the past few years Billy Beane acquired an obscene amount of talent at so little cost to himself that he is finding other teams reluctant to do business with him. The Cleveland Indians are not yet one of those teams.
Waiting for the Cleveland general manager, Mark Shapiro, to call him back, Beane distracts himself by paying attention to several things at once. On his television is "Lou Dobbs Moneyline." On his desk is the most recent issue of Harvard Magazine, containing an article about a Harvard professor of statistics named Carl Morris. The article explains how Morris had used statistical theory to determine the number of runs a team could expect to score in the different states of a baseball game. No outs with no one on base: .537. No outs with a runner on first base: .902. And so on for each of the 24 possible states of a baseball game. "We knew this three years ago," Beane says, "and Harvard thinks it's original." 
He shoves a wad of tobacco into his upper lip, then turns back to his computer screen. He was made the Oakland G.M. just before the 1998 season. Not long before that, the Oakland A's figured out that they were long-term poor. Their financial disadvantage was not only permanent but growing. Each year they would have less money to spend on players than the Yankees and the Red Sox. They responded by creating, in effect, a research-and-development department inside the organization. Oakland R.&D. at first consisted of applying hidden truths about baseball unearthed by hobbyists -- Harvard statistics professors, research scientists, Wall Street analysts turned amateur baseball analysts -- and ignored by organized baseball. This practice had evolved into something more elaborate and original. The reason Billy Beane, high-school graduate, could condescend to abstruse statistical arguments in Harvard Magazine was that he himself had, for several years, employed graduates of Harvard to make abstruse statistical arguments. 
Paul DePodesta was the main one. In the past few years DePodesta helped Beane to put a dollar value on everything from foot speed (almost always overpriced), defense (often overpriced and more often misunderstood) and offense (better understood but still not so well that there wasn't money to be made from a more nuanced understanding of its origins). Batting average wasn't usually worth what it cost, but on-base percentage was usually worth a great deal more. So much more, in fact, that if you set about buying as much of it as you could, you could build a winning team with very little money at all. There were all sorts of ancillary traits in a hitter -- the number of pitches he saw per plate appearance, for instance -- that had concrete value to a baseball offense but that were treated by most baseball people as worthless. 
Pitching was another subject. You could make a fair living as a G.M. selling flamethrowers and buying guys who found other, subtler ways to get outs. 
At the bottom of the Oakland experiment was a willingness to rethink baseball: how it is managed, how it is played, who is best suited to play it and why. The Oakland front office was on a perpetual search for new baseball knowledge. It had studied everything from the market price of foot speed to the inherent difference between the average major league player and the superior Triple A one. This experiment in bringing science to baseball had some odd consequences.
One was to turn the manager in the dugout into a mere functionary and concentrate rare powers in the office of the general manager: everythingof importance, from whether to steal bases to which relief pitchers to use and when, was decided in advance by the G.M. Which was useful. The benefits of bunting and stealing -- and a lot of other tactical decisions that made field managers legends -- usually did not justify their cost.
Maybe the simplest inefficiency of all were the significant shifts that occurred in the prices of players over the course of a season. On July 30, the eve of last season's trading deadline, Billy Beane is still pursuing players, and one of them is the Cleveland Indians' left-hander Ricardo Rincon. At that very moment, Rincon is still just a few yards away, inside the visitors' locker room, dressing to play the second game of a three-game series against the A's. The night before he threw only seven pitches. His arm, no doubt, feels good. The Cleveland Indians have given up any hope of winning this year, and are now busy selling off their parts. "The premier left-handed set- up man is just a luxury we can't afford," Shapiro says, as a way of explaining why he has been shopping Rincon around the league. Beane has found out -- he won't say how -- that the other bidder is the San Francisco Giants and that the Giants' offer may be better than his. All Beane has offered the Indians is a minor-league second baseman named Marshall MacDougal.
For three of the past four years, the Oakland A's have played like a different team after the All-Star break than before it. The previous year, 2001, they had been almost bizarrely better: 44-43 before the break, 58-17 after it. Since the All-Star game was created, in 1933, no other team had ever won so many of its final 75 games. The reason the Oakland A's, as run by Billy Beane, played as if they were a different team in the second half of the season is that they were a different team. As spring turned to summer, the market allowed Beane to do things that he could do at no other time of the year. The bad teams lost hope. With the loss of hope came a desire to cut costs. With the desire to cut costs came the dumping of players. As the supply of players rose, their prices fell. 
Halfway through the 2002 season, Billy Beane was able to acquire players he could never have afforded at the start of the season. And by late July, his antennae for bargains quivered. Shopping for players just before the deadline was like shopping for used designer dresses on the day after the Oscars, or for secondhand engagement rings in Reno. His goal at the start of the season was to build a team good enough to remain in contention until the end of June. On the first of July, the A.L. West standings looked like this: 
Seattle 52-30
Anaheim 47-33-4GB 
Oakland 46-36-6GB
Texas 35-45-16GB
Having kept the team close enough to hope, he could now go out and shop for whatever else he needed to get to the playoffs. When he set off on this shopping spree, he kept in mind five simple rules: 
1) No matter how successful you are, change is always good. There can never be a status quo. When you have no money, you can't afford long-term solutions, only short-term ones. You have to always be upgrading. 
2) The day you say, "I have to do something," you're in trouble. Because you are going to make a bad deal. You can always recover from the player you didn't sign. You may never recover from the player you signed at the wrong price. 
3) Know exactly what every player in baseball is worth to you. You can put a dollar figure on it.
4) Know exactly who you want and go after him. (Never mind whom they say they want to trade.)
5) Every deal you dowill be publicly scrutinized by subjective opinion. If I'm the C.E.O. of I.B.M., I'm not worried that every personnel decision I make is going to wind up on the front page of the business section. Not everyone believes that he knows everything about the personal computer. But everyone who ever picked up a bat thinks he knows baseball. To do this well, you have to ignore the newspapers.
Billy Beane compensated for his complete inability to heed Rule No. 5 by fanatically heeding the other four. Otherwise, his approach to the market for baseball players was by its nature unsystematic. Unsystematic -- and yet incredibly effective. 
For more than a decade, the people who run professional baseball have argued that the game was ceasing to be an athletic competition and becoming a financial one. The gap between rich and poor teams in baseball is far greater than in football and basketball, and widening rapidly. In the middle of the 2002 season, the richest team, the New York Yankees, had a payroll of $133.4 million, while two of the poorest teams, the Oakland A's and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, had payrolls of less than a third of that. A decade before, the highest-payroll team, the New York Mets, spent about $44 million on players, and the lowest-payroll team, the Cleveland Indians, a bit more than $8 million. The growing raw disparities meant that only the rich teams could afford the best players. A poor team could afford only the maimed and the inept, and was almost certain to fail. Or so argued the people who ran baseball. 
But when you actually look at what happened over the past few years, you have to wonder. The bottom of each division has been littered with teams -- the Rangers, the Orioles, the Dodgers, the Mets -- that have spent huge sums and failed spectacularly. On the other end of the spectrum is Oakland. For the past four years, working with one of the lowest payrolls in the game, the Oakland A's have won as many regular-season games as any other team except the Atlanta Braves. They've been to the playoffs three years in a row and twice taken the richest team in baseball, the Yankees, to within a few outs of elimination. How on earth did they do it? As early as 2000, Commissioner Bud Selig took to calling the Oakland A's' success "an aberration," but that was less an explanation than an excuse not to grapple with the questions: how did they do it? What was their secret? 
And there did, indeed, appear to be a secret. A leading independent authority on baseball finance, a Manhattan lawyer named Doug Pappas, pointed out a quantifiable distinction between Oakland and the rest of baseball. The least you could spend on a 25-man team, if everyone was paid the minimum salary, was $5 million, plus $2 million more for players on the disabled list and the remainder of the 40-man roster. The huge role of luck in any baseball game, and the relatively small difference in ability between most major leaguers and the rookies who might work for the minimum wage, meant that the fewest games a minimum-wage baseball team would win during a 162-game season was something like 49. The Pappas measure of financial efficiency was this: How many dollars over the minimum $7 million does each team pay for each win over its 49th? How many marginal dollars does a team spend for each marginal win? Over the past three years Oakland has paid about half a million dollars per win. The only other team in six figures has been the Minnesota Twins, at $675,000 per win. The most profligate rich franchises -- the Baltimore Orioles, for instance, or the Texas Rangers -- have paid nearly $3 million for each win, or more than six times what Oakland paid. Oakland seemed to be playing a different game from everyone else.
Anyone who really wanted to understand how this team with no money kept winning more and more games would do well to examine the impact of Billy Beane's shopping sprees. 
On July 25, he acquired the All-Star second baseman Ray Durham, plus a portion of the money to pay his salary, from the White Sox, who had abandoned all hope for their season. Now he has sights on Ricardo Rincon, and the absence of ready cash is becoming a problem. Rincon is owed about $508,000 for the rest of the season, and that is $508,000 the Oakland A's' owners will not agree to spend. To get Rincon, Beane not only has to persuade Shapiro that his is the highest bid; he also has to find the money to pay Rincon's salary. Where? If he gets Rincon, he won't need Mike Magnante. No one else does, either, so he is unlikely to save money there. No matter what he does, the A's will wind up eating Magnante's salary. But he might well be able to move Mike Venafro, the low-budget left-handed reliever he just sent down to Triple A. Venafro is a lot younger than Magnante. Other teams might be interested in him. 
This gives Beane an idea: auction Mike Venafro to teams that might be competing with him for Ricardo Rincon. 
He knows that the San Francisco Giants are after Rincon. He knows also that the Giants don't have much to spend and that, if offered a cheaper option, might be less inclined to stretch for Rincon. "Let's make them skinnier," he says, and picks up the phone and calls Brian Sabean, the G.M. of the Giants. He'll offer Venafro to the Giants for almost nothing. In a stroke he'll raise cash he needs to buy Rincon (because he won't have to pay Venafro's salary) and possibly also reduce the Giants' interest in Rincon, as they'll now see they have, in Venafro, an alternative. 
Brian Sabean listens to Beane's magnanimous offer of Mike Venafro; all Beane wants in return is a minor-league player. Sabean says he's interested. "Sabes," Beane says, after laying out his proposal. "I'm not asking for much here. Think it over and call me back."
The moment he hangs up, he calls Mark Shapiro, current owner of Ricardo Rincon, and tells him that he has the impression that the market for Rincon is softening. Whoever the other bidder is, he says, Shapiro ought to make sure his offer is firm. 
As he puts down the phone, DePodesta pokes his head into the office. "Billy, what about the Mets on Venafro? Just to have options." 
"The Mets could be after Rincon," Beane says.
The phone rings. It's Mark Shapiro, calling right back. He tells Beane that, by some amazing coincidence, the other buyer for Rincon has just called to lower his offer. Beane leans forward in his chair, chaw clenched in his upper lip, as if waiting to see if a fly ball hit by an Oakland A will clear the wall. He raises his fist as it does. "I just need to talk to my owner," he says. "Thanks, Mark." 
He puts down the phone. "We have a two-hour window on Rincon," he says. He now has a purpose: two hours to find $508,000 from another team, or to somehow sell his owner on the deal. Never mind that his owner, Steve Schott, has already said that he won't spend the money to buy Rincon. He shouts across the hall. "Paul! What's left on Venafro's contract?" 
"Two hundred and seventy-five thousand, two hundred and seventy-three dollars."
He does the math. If he unloads Venafro, he'll still need to find another $233,000 to cover Rincon's salary, but he isn't thinking about that just yet. His owners have told him only that they won't eat 508 grand; they've said nothing about eating 233 grand. He has two hours to find someone who will take Venafro off his hands. The Mets are a good idea. Beane picks up the phone and dials the number for Steve Phillips, the general manager of the Mets. A secretary answers.
"Denise," Beane says, "Billy Beane, vice president and general manager of the Oakland Athletics. Denise, who is the best-looking G.M. in the game?" Pause. "Exactly right, Denise. Is Steve there?"
Steve isn't there, but someone named Jimmy is. "Jimmy," Beane says. "Hey, how you doin'? Got a question for you. You guys looking for a left-handed reliever?" 
He raises his fist again. Yes! He tells Jimmy about Venafro. "I can make it real quick for you," he says. 
How quick?
"Fifteen minutes?" 
Fine.
"I can give you names in 15 minutes," Beane says. "Yeah, look, I'd do this if I were you. And I'm not expletive you here Jimmy. I'm being honest with you." 
Paul sees what is happening and walks out the door before Beane is finished. "I gotta find some more prospects," he says. He needs to find who they want from the Mets in exchange for Venafro.
Beane hangs up. "Paul! We got 15 minutes to get names." Paul's already in his office flipping through various handbooks that list all the players owned by the Mets. Beane takes the seat across from him and grabs one of the books; together they rifle through the entire Mets farm system, stat by stat. It's a new game: maximize what you get from the Mets farm system inside of 15 minutes. They're like a pair of shoppers who have been allowed into Costco before the official opening time and told that anything they can cart out the door in the next 15 minutes they can have free. The A's' president, Michael Crowley, walks by and laughs. "What's the rush?" he says. "We don't need Rincon until the sixth or seventh inning." 
"What about Bennett?" DePodesta asks.
"How old is he?" Beane asks.
"Twenty-six."
"He's 26 and in Double A? Forget it."
Beane stops at a name and laughs. "Virgil Chevalier? Who is that?"
"How about Eckert," Paul says. "But he's 25."
"How about this guy?" Beane says and laughs. "Just for his name alone. Furbush!"
Anyone older than about 23 who is desirable will be too obviously desirable for the Mets to give up. They're looking for a player whose promise they have a better view of than the Mets have. Someone very young. It will be someone they do not know and have never seen, and have researched for 30 seconds. 
"How about Garcia?" Paul DePodesta asks.
"What's Garcia? Twenty-two?" 
"Twenty-two," DePodesta says.
He shows Beane the stats for Garcia, and Beane says: "Garcia's good. I'll ask for Garcia." He gets up and walks back to his office cursing. "I know what I'll do. Why don't we go back to them and say, 'Give us cash too!'? What's the difference between Rincon and Venafro?"
Paul punches numbers into his calculator: "232,923."
"I'll ask him for 233 grand plus the prospect," Beane says. "The money doesn't mean anything to the Mets." 
Being poor means treating rich teams as petty cash dispensers. If he can get the Mets to give him the 233, he doesn't even need to call his owner. He can just make the deal himself. 
He pauses before he picks up the phone. "Should I call Sabean first?" he's asking himself; the answer, also provided by himself, is no. As Beane calls Steve Phillips, Paul reappears. "Billy," he says, "you might also ask for Duncan. What can they say? He's hitting .217."
"Who would we rather have, Garcia or Duncan?" Beaneasks. 
The Mets' secretary answers before DePodesta. Beane leans back and smiles. "Denise," he says, "Billy Beane, vice president and general manager of the Oakland Athletics. Denise, who is the coolest G.M. in the game?" Pause. "Right again, Denise." 
When he was a young man, Billy Beane could beat anyone at anything, and often did. As a freshman in high school, Beane was the quarterback on the football team and later the high scorer on the basketball team; but it was on the baseball field that he truly excelled. By his junior year he was 6-foot-4, 180 pounds, and his high-school diamond was infested with major league scouts. In the first big game after Beane came to the attention of baseball scouts, he pitched a two-hitter, stole four bases and hit three triples. He encouraged strong feelings in the older men who were paid to imagine what kind of pro ballplayer a young man might become. 
The boy had a body you could dream on: ramrod straight and lean but not so lean you couldn't imagine him filling out. And that face! Beneath an unruly mop of dark brown hair, the boy had the sharp features that the scouts loved. In the late 1970's, when Beane was coming of age, some scouts still believed they could tell by the structure of a young man's face not only his character but also his future in pro ball. They had a phrase they used: "the Good Face." Beane had the Good Face.
What the scouts failed to notice is what happened when things did not go well for Beane on the field: a wall came down between him and his talent, and he didn't know any other way to get through the wall than to try to smash a hole in it. The moment Billy failed, he went looking for something to break. It wasn't merely that he didn't like to fail; it was as if he didn't know how to fail. The scouts never considered this. By the end of Beane's senior year the only question they had about Beane was, Can I get him? And the answer was a firm no. Beane insisted that he didn't want to play pro ball; he wanted to go to Stanford on a joint football and baseball scholarship. But the New York Mets took him in the first round anyway, one thing led to another and Beane took the $125,000 offered by the Mets. He appeased his mother (and his conscience) by telling her (and himself) he would attend classes at Stanford during the off-season. 
Stanford disagreed. When the admissions office learned that Beane would not be playing sports for Stanford, they told him that he was no longer welcome in Stanford's classrooms. "Dear Mrs. Beane," read the letter from the Stanford dean of admissions, Fred A. Hargadon, "we are withdrawing Billy's admission. . . . I do wish him every success, both with his professional career in baseball and with his alternate plans for continuing his education." 
Only there were no plans. One day Beane could have been anything; the next he was just another minor-league baseball player, and not even a rich one. On the advice of a family friend, Billy's parents invested on their son's behalf his entire $125,000 bonus in a real-estate partnership that promptly went bust. 
It got worse. In his first year of pro ball, Billy Beane hit .210. He didn't know how to think of himself if he couldn't think of himself as a success. His second full season, in the Double A Texas League, he played alongside Darryl Strawberry and hit .220; Strawberry was named the league's most valuable player. Beane spent a lot of hours in the outfield dwelling on Strawberry's heroics and on his own failure. "That was the first year I really questioned if I'd made the right decision to sign,"Beane says. 
Strawberry presented one kind of problem for Billy; Lenny Dykstra presented another. Beane and Dykstra lived together and played side by side in minor-league outfields for nearly two years, beginning in 1984. That year both were invited to the Mets' big-league spring training camp. Dykstra thought of himself and Beane as two buddies racing together down the same track, but Beane sensed fundamental differences between them. Physically, Dykstra didn't belong in the same league with him. He was half Beane's size and had a fraction of Beane's promise. But mentally, Dykstra was superior. Beane remembers sitting with Dykstra in a Mets dugout watching the opposing pitcher warm up. "Lenny says, 'So who's that big dummy out there on the hill?' And I say: 'Lenny, you're kidding me, right? That's Steve Carlton. He's maybe the greatest left-hander in the history of the game.' Lenny says: 'Oh, yeah! I knew that!' He sits there for a minute and says, 'So, what's he got?' And I say: 'Lenny, come on. Steve Carlton. He's got heat and also maybe the nastiest slider ever.' And Lenny sits there for a while longer as if he's taking that in. Finally he just says, 'I'll stick him.' "
The point about Dykstra, at least to Billy, was clear: Dykstra didn't let his mind mess him up. Only a psychological freak could approach a 100-m.p.h. fastball aimed not all that far from his head with total confidence. "Lenny was so perfectly designed, emotionally, to play the game of baseball," Beane said. "He was able to instantly forget any failure and draw strength from every success. He had no concept of failure. I was the opposite."
Dykstra went on to be a star with the Mets; Beane was traded to Minnesota, which eventually passed him on to Detroit. After leaving the Tigers, he signed with Oakland. No matter how often he moved, his problem never changed: he couldn't hit. By the end of 1989, after six seasons in the major leagues, his career stat line (301 at bats, .219 batting average, .246 on-base percentage, .296 slugging percentage, 11 walks against 80 strikeouts) told an eloquent tale of suffering. You didn't need to know Billy Beane at all -- you only needed to read his stats -- to sense that he left every on-deck circle in trouble. That he had developed neither discipline nor composure. That he had never learned to lay off a bad pitch. That he was easily fooled. That, fooled so often, he came to expect that he would be fooled. That he hit with fear. That his fear masqueraded as aggression. That the aggression enabled him to exit the batter's box as quickly as possible. 
During spring training of 1990, Beane walked out of the Oakland dugout and into the front office and said be wanted a job as an advance scout. An advance scout traveled ahead of the big- league team and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of future opponents. Beane was 27, entering what was meant to be his prime as a baseball player, and he had decided he would rather watch than play. Baseball had rendered him unfit for anything but itself. 
Denise, who is the coolest G.M. in the game?" The New York Mets' secretary is charmed. Her laughter reaches the far end of Billy Beane's office. "Billy has the gift of making people like him," said the man who made Beane a general manager, Oakland's former G.M. Sandy Alderson. "It's a dangerous gift to have." 
This time Steve Phillips is present and ready to talk. "Look, I'm not going to ask you for a lot for Venafro," Beane says, generously, as if acquiring Venafro had been Phillips's idea. "I need a player and 233 grand. I'm not going to ask you for anyone really good. I have a couple of names I want to run by you. Garcia, the second baseman, and Duncan, the outfielder, who hit .217 last year." 
Phillips, like every other G.M. who has just received a call from Billy Beane, assumes there must be some angle he isn't seeing. He asks why Beane sent Venafro down to Triple A. He's worried about Venafro's health. He wonders why Beane is now asking for money too.
"Venafro's fine, Steve," Beane says. He's back to selling used cars. "This is just a situation for us. . . . I need the money for something else I want to do later."
Phillips says he still wonders what's up with Venafro. The last few times he pitched he was hammered. Beane sighs: it's harder turning Mike Venafro into a New York Met than he supposed. "Steve, me and you both know that you don't judge a pitcher by the last nine innings he threw. Art misused him. You should use him for a whole inning. He's good against righties too!" 
For whatever reason, the fish refuses the bait. At that moment Beane realizes: the Mets are hemming and hawing about Venafro because they think they are going to get Rincon. "Look," Beane says. "Here's the deal, Steve." He's no longer selling used cars. He's organizing a high-school fire drill and tolerating no cutups. "I'm going to get Rincon. It's a done deal. Yeah. It's done. The Giants want Venafro. I've told them they can have him for a player: Luke Robertson."
"Anderson," DePodesta whispers.
"Luke Anderson," Beane says, easing off. "We like Anderson. We think he's going to be in the big leagues. But I'd like to deal with you because Sabes doesn't have any money. You can win this because you can give me 233 grand in cash, and he can't. I don't have to have the 233 grand in cash. But it makes enough of a difference to me that I'll work with you." He has ceased to be the fire drill instructor and become the personal trainer. You can do it, Steve! You can win! 
Beane likes whatever place he has reached in the conversation. "Yeah," he says. "It doesn't have to be Garcia or Duncan. I'll find a player with you. If it makes you feel better." (I want you, and only you, to have Venafro). "O.K., Steve. Whoever calls me back first gets Venafro." (But if you drag your heels, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.) "Watching Billy do a deal," said his best friend, the Toronto Blue Jays' G.M., J.P. Ricciardi, "is like watching the wolf talk to Little Red Riding Hood."
When Beane hangs up, his assistant tells him that Peter Gammons, the ESPN reporter, is on the line. In the hours leading up to the trade deadline, Beane refuses to take calls from several newspaper reporters. One will get through to him by accident, and he'll make her regret that she did. Most reporters, in Billy's experience, are simply trying to be the first to find out something they'll all learn anyway before their deadlines. "They all want scoops," he complains. "There are no scoops. Whatever we do will be in every paper tomorrow. There's no such thing as a paper that comes out in an hour." 
It's different when Gammons calls. Gammons might actually tell him something he doesn't know. "Let's get some info," he says and picks up the phone. Gammons asks about Rincon, and Beane says, casually, "Yeah, I'm just finishing up Rincon," as if it's a done deal, which clearly it is not. He knows Gammons will tell others what he tells him. Then the quid pro quo: Gammons tells Beane that the Montreal Expos have decided to trade their slugging outfielder, Cliff Floyd, to the Boston Red Sox. Beane quickly promises Gammons that he'll be the first to know whatever he does. 
"Billy, Steve's still waiting to talk!" Mike Crowley again. His owner, Steve Schott, keeps calling. Beane looks around as if he has forgotten something. Money! He goes back to his phone and calls Steve Phillips, the Mets G.M., one last time. "Steve, here's the deal. I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight." He listens for a bit and hears nothing that makes him happy. When he hangs up, he says, "He has no money."
The Mets have no money to waste. This is new. The market for baseball players, like the market for stocks and bonds, is always changing. To trade it well, you need to be adaptable. 
Every minute that passes is a minute Brian Sabean -- or even Steve Phillips! -- has to talk Mark Shapiro into closing the two-hour window on Rincon he has opened for Beane. Beane hollers to Mike Crowley: "Tell Schott that if we don't move Venafro, I'll sell Rincon for twice the price next year. No. Tell him that I'll make him a deal. If I don't do it, I'll cover it. But I keep anything over twice the savings." 
The A's' president doesn't know what to do with this. His G.M., who earns 400 grand a year, is telling his owner that he'll take an equity stake in a single player. Billy Beane could make himself a very rich man, simply by dealing players as well as he has done. No reply comes back from the owner, and Beane assumes he is free to do what he wants with Rincon (and hold on to Venafro). He gives the Mets and Giants 15 minutes more. Finally, he decides. He'll take the risk. He picks up the phone to call Mark Shapiro to acquire Rincon. 
When he trades players, Billy Beane always operates with total certainty. He doesn't know it yet, but that is the real edge he has in his quest for Ricardo Rincon: he is more decisive than the other G.M.'s. From the others Mark Shapiro hears only vagueness and uncertainty; from Billy Beane he hears the most alarmingly concrete and rapid proposals. This is odd. In any ruthlessly competitive market for complex assets -- stocks and bonds or baseball players -- it isn't normal for any one trader to act with perfect confidence. Those who do are either deluded or have some brief informational edge. 
Beane has an edge, but it isn't brief. He has been dealing in players in this manner for five years, and never made a trade he regretted. The market for baseball players is inefficient, and he knows it. He knows in his bones how completely a seemingly efficient market can misvalue a human being -- because it so completely misvalued him. With Paul DePodesta's help, he is able to put fairly exact numbers on the value of any given baseball player. And those numbers are often shocking.
That is another strange consequence of the Oakland experiment: to undermine a lot of old prejudices about who, and who was not, meant to play pro ball. Constantly looking beneath the surface of a player's performance to discern its underlying value, the Oakland A's became a magnet for guys who didn't look all that good on the surface. Guys who were too fat, too skinny, too short, too slow or too old. The inability to envision a certain kind of person doing a certain kind of thing because you've never seen someone who looks like him do it before is not just a vice. It's a luxury; and the Oakland A's couldn't afford luxuries. They needed to find ballplayers, as cheaply as possible. On the team's current roster there is hardly a player who wasn't dismissed at one point in his career as ill designed to play big league baseball. Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, Miguel Tejada, Scott Hatteberg, Chad Bradford: most of the players knew what it felt like to be on the receiving end of professional baseball's irrational scorn. Oakland R.&D. liberated many players from unthinking prejudice and allowed them to demonstrate their true worth. A baseball team, of all things, was at the center of a story about the possibilities -- and the limits -- of science in human affairs. 
The A's' left-handed reliever Mike Magnante had once been the beneficiary of baseball science; now he was its victim. Beane acquired Mags on the down slope of his career, when most other teams thought he was washed up, and milked a hundred or so useful innings of relief pitching out of him. But now Mags was done, and someone needed to tell him. And so, phone in hand, almost casually, Beane says to DePodesta, now seated on Billy's sofa, "Do you want to go down and release Magnante?" 
"Do I want to?" DePodesta says. He looks right, then left, as if Beane must be talking to some other person who enjoys telling a 37-year-old relief pitcher that he's washed up. When he looks left he can see the Coliseum a few yards away, through Billy's office window. It wasn't that Mags was just four days short of his 10-year goal. He'd get his pension. It was that, in all likelihood, Mags was finished in the big leagues. 
"Someone's got to talk to him," Beane says. Now, suddenly, there is a difference between trading stocks and bonds and trading human beings. Beane never lets it affect what he does. He is able to think of players as pieces in a board game. That's why he traded them so well. 
"Call Art," DePodesta says. "That's his job."
Beane picks up his phone to call Art Howe and then remembers that he hasn't actually made the trade, and so reverses himself and calls Mark Shapiro in Cleveland. It's 6:30. The game against the Indians starts in 35 minutes.
"Mike Magnante has just thrown his last pitch in the big leagues," DePodesta says.
"Sorry I took so long, Mark," Beane says.
No problem. But since you did, do you want to wait until after the game to take Rincon? 
"No, we want him now. We want to get him in our dugout tonight."
Why the rush?
"By and large Magnante cost us the game last night, and Rincon won the game."
O.K. No big deal. We'll do it now.
"You feel comfortable with Ricardo's health, right?"
Right. 
Beane hangs up and dials Art Howe's number. The A's' manager has just returned to his office beside the clubhouse. 
"Art. It's Billy. I have some good news and some bad news."
Art gives a little nervous chuckle. "O.K."
"The good news is you've got Rincon."
"Do I?!"
"The bad news is you gotta release Magnante."
Silence on the other end of the line. "O.K.," Art finally says. 
"And you've got to do it before the game."
"O.K."
Beane makes several quick calls. He calls the A's' equipment manager, Steve Vucinich. "Voos. We gotta get rid of Mags by game time. Yeah. You have 25 minutes to get him out of there." He calls the Mets' Steve Phillips. "Steve, I got the guy I wanted. Rincon." (For you, it's Venafro or nothing.) He calls the Giants' Brian Sabean. "Brian. Hey Brian. Hey, it's Billy. I've made a deal for Rincon right now." (So don't think you can wait me out.) He calls Peter Gammons and tells him what he has done, and that he's not doing anything else.
After the final call, his phone rings. He looks at his caller ID and sees it's from the visitors' clubhouse. He picks it up.
"Oh, hi, Ricardo." It's Ricardo Rincon, whose English skills are rudimentary. 
"Ricardo, I know it's a little bit shocking for you," Beane says. His syntax changes slightly; he's groping fora Mexican mode of expression and winds up saying whatever he can think of that Ricardo might understand. "But we have been trying to get you for a long time. You're going to love the guys on the team. They're fun."
Ricardo is trying to get it clear in his head that he's supposed to do what he has just been asked to do, take off his Cleveland Indians uniform, gather his personal belongings, walk down the hall into the Oakland clubhouse and put on an Oakland uniform. He can't quite get his mind around it. 
"Yes! Yes!" Beane says. "I don't know if you'll pitch tonight. But you're on our team tonight."
Whatever Ricardo says, he means: Oh, my God, I might actually have to pitch tonight? 
"Yes. Yes. Possibly you'll punch out Jim Thome!" Possibly you will punch out Jim Thome. Beane is becoming, quickly, a Mexican immigrant.
"We'll have a uniform and everything ready for you." And everything. He's had just about enough touchy-feely for one evening. He tries to lead the conversation to a not horribly unnatural conclusion. "Where are you from, Ricardo?"
Ricardo says he's from Veracruz, Mexico. 
"Well, Veracruz is closer to here than to Cleveland. You're closer to home!"
He finishes that one, hangs up and says, "It's gotten to be a longer road trip for Ricardo than he expected." He looks absolutely spent. The wad of tobacco is gone from his upper lip, and his mouth is dry. He gargles with the glass of water on his desk and spits. "I've got to work out," he says. 
At that moment, Mike Magnante was removing his Oakland uniform, and Ricardo Rincon was removing his Cleveland one. Mags left the Oakland clubhouse quickly; he would come back for his things later when no one was around. His wife had brought the kids to the game, so he couldn't just leave. Magnante watched the game with his family until the sixth inning and then left so that he wouldn't have to answer questions from the media. He had no desire to call further attention to his situation. In his youth he might have mouthed off. He would certainly have borne a grudge. But he was no longer young; the numbness had long since set in. He thought of himself the way the market thought of him, as an asset to be bought and sold. He'd long ago forgotten whatever it was he was meant to feel.
The main thing was that Mags was gone from the clubhouse before Beane walked across to change into his sweats. As Beane headed in, however, he bumped into Ricardo Rincon heading out, in street clothes. Ricardo remained confused. He had heard he was going to the San Francisco Giants, or maybe the Los Angeles Dodgers. He never imagined he might be an Oakland A. And he still didn't understand the full implications of what happened. The Oakland A's' primary left-handed relief pitcher was going out to find a seat in the stands to watch the game. Beane led him back into the clubhouse where the staff had just finished steaming RINCON onto the back of an Oakland A's jersey. "You're on our team now," Beane says. 
Ricardo Rincon walked back into his new clubhouse, put on his new uniform and sat down and watched the entire game on television. "I was not ready," he said. "I couldn't concentrate." His left arm, however, felt great. 
No matter how you look at it, the season was a miracle. Ricardo Rincon and Ray Durham helped to turn the 2002 Oakland A's into one of the top 10 second-half teams in the past 50 years. All but written off when they could not afford to prevent Jason Giambi from signing with the Yankees, the A's won 103 games, one more than they had the year before, tied for the most in all of baseball.Maybe more astonishingly, at least for economic determinists, the teams in baseball's best division, the American League West, finished in inverse order to their payrolls. 
Oakland 103-59 -$41,942,665
Anaheim 99-63-4 -$62,757,041
Seattle 93-69-10 -$86,084,710
Texas 72-90-31 -$106,915,180
Then they did a favor for everyone who wanted to ignore or dismiss their importance: they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Minnesota Twins. That was all right, Beane said, because the playoffs were a crap shoot, impervious to baseball science. He could control what happened over a 162-game season; in a 5-game series, his magic didn't work. There were no secret recipes for the post-season, except maybe having three great starting pitchers, and he had that. 
His objective spirit survived his team's playoff exit for a week. The fact that his team had lost to the clearly inferior Minnesota Twins festered. He never said it, but it was nonetheless evident that he could not quite believe how little appreciation there was for what they had achieved. Even his owner, who was getting multiples more for his money than any owner in baseball, complained. The public reaction to the thing ate at Beane. In these situations, when his mind was disturbed, he often went looking to make a trade. But there was no player on whom his mind naturally fixed; the only person in the organization whose riddance would make him happier was his manager, Art Howe. It wasn't long before he had a novel idea: trade Art. 
It took him about a week to do it. He called Steve Phillips and told him that Howe was a superb manager, but his latest one-year contract called for a big raise, and Oakland couldn't really afford to pay it. The Mets had just fired their own manager, Bobby Valentine, and Phillips was in a bit of a fix. Beane had thought he might even get a player from the Mets for Howe, but in the end settled on moving Howe's salary. Howe signed a four-year deal for more than $2 million a year to manage the New York Mets. In Howe's place Beane installed Ken Macha, the A's' bench coach. 
That made him feel better for a bit. Then it didn't. He had the feeling he had come to the end of some line. Here they had run this low-budget franchise as efficiently as a low-budget franchise could be run, and no one had even noticed. No one cared if you found radically better ways to run a big-league baseball team. All anyone cared about was how you fared in the post-season crap shoot. For his work he had been paid about as well as a third-year relief pitcher. He was worth, easily, more than any player; his services were more substantially undervalued than those of any player he'd ever acquired. He could see only one way to exploit this grotesque market inefficiency: trade himself. 
That superior management armed with science could be had so cheaply was easily the greatest inefficiency in all of baseball. John Henry, a Wall Street billionaire who had recently purchased the Boston Red Sox, understood this. Henry knew all about how to exploit market inefficiencies; he had long since decided that he wanted to reinvent his franchise in the image of the Oakland A's. The trouble was, how? Only one guy had ever actually proved he could impose reason on a big-league clubhouse, and that guy, two weeks after his team had been bounced from the playoffs, was now dissatisfied with his job. One thing led to another, and before long Billy Beane had agreed to run the Boston Red Sox. He would be guaranteed $12.5 million over five years, the most anyone had ever been paid to run a baseball team. 
All that remained was for Beane to sign the Red Sox contract. And he couldn't do it. In the 24 hours after he accepted the Red Sox' job offer, Beane became as manic and irrational and incapable of sleep as he was back in May, after the A's were swept by the Blue Jays. As decisive as he was about most things, he was paralyzed when the decision involved himself. He had convinced himself that he wasn't taking the job just for the money. Since it was pretty clear he wasn't doing it for the love of the Red Sox, it raised a question of why he was doing it at all. He decided he was doing it just to show that he could do it. To prove that his own peculiar talents had concrete value. Dollar value. And that in any sane world he'd be paid a fortune for them. 
Now he had a problem: he'd just proved that. Baseball columns everywhere were abuzz with the news that Billy Beane was about to become the highest-paid general manager in the history of the game. Now that everyone knew his true value, Beane didn't need to prove it anymore. Now the only reason to take the job was the money. 
The next morning he called Henry and told him he couldn't do it. A few hours later he blurted to a reporter something he wished he hadn't said but was nevertheless the truth: "I made one decision based on money in my life -- when I signed with the Mets rather than go to Stanford -- and I promised I'd never do it again." After that Beane confined himself to the usual blather about personal reasons. None of what he said was terribly rational or "objective" -- but then neither was he. 
Within a week, he was back to scheming how to get the Oakland A's back to the playoffs, and DePodesta was back to being on his side. And he was left with his single greatest fear: that no one would ever really know. He and Paul might find ever more clever ways to build great ball clubs with no money, but unless they brought home a World Series ring or two, no one would know. And even then -- even if they did win a ring -- where did that leave him? He'd be just one more general manager among many who were celebrated for a day, then forgotten. People would never know that, for a brief moment, he was right and the world was wrong. 

GRAPHIC: Photo: Billy Beane (Andrew Eccles); The Deal Ricardo Rincon, far right, was the prize that Beane sought, and the Indians, who had fallen out of contention, were willing to let him go. To land him, Beane would have to dangle Mike Venafro, middle, to a few different teams, and get rid of Mike Magnante, near right, a war-horse reliever four days short of his pension. Beane would also have to come up with half a million dollars out of somebody else's pocket.; The G.M. and His Sidekick:Beane, front, executes deals with the confidence he never had as a ballplayer. Paul DePodesta, the A's' assistant G.M. and a Harvard graduate, helped Beane devise his system of evaluating players, and is sometimes called on to do Beane's dirty work.; The Submariner: Chad Bradford's bizarre motion and lack of velocity left him stranded in the White Sox system, but Beane trusted his solid stats more than he trusted the dubious scouts.; The Little Guy: Tim Hudson's slight build left the scouts unimpressed, but Beane saw his excellent numbers at Auburn as a better bet than the athletic high-schoolers most teams draft.; The New New Closer: According to Beane most any pitcher can be a competent closer, so he brought in the inconsistent Keith Foulke as the A's' closer, their third in three years.; The Selective Slugger: Erubiel Durazo can't hit left-handed pitching at all, but Beane acquired him for his power and his ability to draw walks.; The Convert: A former catcher, Scott Hatteberg was a potential hazard at first base last year, but to Beane, his patience at the plate more than made up for that.; The Captive: Miguel Tejada was the American League M.V.P. last year, but Beane can only afford players of his caliber in the years before they are eligible for free agency.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-30-03: QUESTIONS FOR JOHN W. DOWER; 
Occupation Preoccupation

BYLINE:  By David Wallis 

 BODY:
Q: Your book "Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II" reportedly is required reading in the Bush White House. Describe the inherent differences between the occupation of Japan and the likely postwar rule of Iraq.
 The differences are quite conspicuous. First, the occupation of Japan had great moral and legal legitimacy in the eyes of everyone -- the American people, the victorious Allied powers, Japan's Asian neighbors. It also had legitimacy in the eyes of most of the Japanese themselves. Unlike Iraq, Japan was an isolated country, an island facing no threats of infiltration. And despite the shattering effects of the war, there was internal cohesion and continuity in Japan in the form of the emperor, the bureaucracy, administrative structures. 
 Isn't it true that few people after World War II expected democracy to blossom in Japan?
That's absolutely true. Many Westerners and many conservative Japanese argued that democracy was not possible in Japan. For historical reasons and because of the horrors they had gone though, however, there was great receptivity to democracy. But the manner in which "regime change" is being effected in Iraq has created worldwide opposition to what is sensed as American aggression and arrogance. In the case of Japan, there was not a single incident of terrorism against U.S. forces there after World War II. 
Given the differences between Japan and Iraq, could the administration still learn something from the Japanese occupation and reconstruction?
I think there are both positive and negative lessons to be learned. The first challenge to be addressed is to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in an immediate, massive way. Then you have to give immediate attention to creating institutional structure for democracy. And you must mobilize popular support. You just can't work with your chosen delegates. There are negative lessons, too. One of the great differences between Japan then and Iraq now is that the people who occupied Japan had a breathing space of several years. The Americans were preoccupied with Europe and the emerging cold war, so MacArthur had a relatively free hand for two years. And Japan had no precious natural resources, so there was no outside intervention. 
Many people expect companies that support the administration financially, like Bechtel and Halliburton, to profit from the occupation of Iraq. Did that kind of thing go on in the Truman administration?
No. Japan after World War II was not seen as having a particularly bright economic future. There were no American economic interests hankering to get into Japan after the war. In Iraq, we are going to have carpetbaggers and special interests trying to manipulate what's going on there for their own advantage. This could be disastrous. Given the incredible focus on Iraq's strategic importance, the more appropriate analogy may not be Japan proper but Okinawa, which was turned into a grotesque appendage of the American military empire.
What Japanese proverb or parable comes to mind when you consider the coming occupation of Iraq?
In the weeks before the attack, we heard people say, "Well, maybe this isn't the best thing, but we've gone so far we can't turn back." This is what Tojo said before Pearl Harbor. There is a famous temple called Kiyomizu-dera on a steep hillside in Kyoto, and on the eve of Pearl Harbor Tojo realized that he had gotten himself into a terrible predicament, and he said, "Well, sometimes you just have to close your eyes and leap off the veranda at Kiyomizu-dera." Why did he have to take the plunge then? Because the weather was going to be bad in Southeast Asia, the troops had already been mobilized and he had pumped up his rhetoric. 
What was the best decision that Gen. Douglas MacArthur made as Supreme Commander of Japan?
General MacArthur had a charisma and an authority that we cannot envision anyone having today. He believed in putting his weight behind a really radical program of democratization. It included encouraging labor movements, releasing Communists from prison, legalizing the Communist Party and having an agenda of breaking up the big economic trusts. He had a great vision of making Japan a demilitarized country. He expressed confidence to the Japanese people that they could indeed do this. We all hope that the Iraqi people will be given such an opportunity. But I don't see it taking place given the present circumstances. David Wallis

The Calendars Never Lie

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
DO you wonder why Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of the New York City Opera, is determined to move that company out of Lincoln Center? Or why James Levine, despite his devotion to the Metropolitan Opera, decided to take on the music directorship of the Boston Symphony Orchestra as well? And how is Carnegie Hall faring as it anticipates opening Zankel Hall, its new downstairs auditorium?
 Looking at the recently announced 2003-4 season offerings of these and other performing-arts institutions in New York may provide insights. An organization's programming affords tangible evidence of its priorities. How is it balancing the need to please tradition-bound patrons with the urge to take artistic risks, risks that, I'm convinced, can attract new, eager and younger audiences? 
 Of course, these days arts administrators may not feel like risking anything, given the woes of the economy. Add the Baltimore Symphony, the Rochester Philharmonic and the San Antonio Symphony to the list of orchestras that are facing dire deficits.
The Met, at any rate, will follow its bold and popular new production of Berlioz's taxing and unconventional yet profoundly great opera "Les Troyens" with its premiere production of another Berlioz epic, "Benvenuto Cellini." Mr. Levine conducts, and Marcello Giordani sings the title role. There will be new productions of "Don Giovanni,""Salome" and, a rarity, Halevy's "Juive," all with promising directors and casts.
But overall it's a status quo season. The Met remains unsure of itself when it takes on works written since the mid-20th century. Watch Mr. Levine conduct the Met Orchestra in the premiere of a knotty work like Milton Babbitt's Second Piano Concerto, and you realize the breadth of his musical intellect. Yet he has proved unable to make the company a fostering ground for new and recent opera. Though intensely involved in the premiere of John Harbison's "Great Gatsby," he has been notably mum about the commissioned works that are coming over the next five years from Tobias Picker and Tan Dun.
Mr. Levine has used his clout to bring back the landmark 1999 production of Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron." But come next spring, when he's in the midst of three more cycles of Wagner's "Ring," he may be secretly thinking of all the bracing symphonic repertory and contemporary works he'll be able to conduct when he takes charge of the Boston Symphony next year.
Next door, meanwhile, the New York City Opera has not presented a season without a new or recent work since Mr. Kellogg arrived. Next season offers Marvin David Levy's "Mourning Becomes Electra," based on the O'Neill play. Though the opera was commissioned by the Met and given a tepidly received premiere there in 1967, Mr. Levy extensively revised it in 1998 for the Lyric Opera of Chicago. What resulted was a tautly paced and musically intense work. City Opera has carved out an essential niche for itself with its modern-dress productions of Baroque operas, and next season brings Handel's "Alcina" and "Xerxes." Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd" is also in the lineup.
The company's problem remains the New York State Theater. If the auditorium is too cavernous and acoustically dull for a big show like "Carmen," it's even less adequate for Baroque operas and musicals, which want intimacy. Mr. Kellogg hopes to be part of any proposed development of the World Trade Center site.
Carnegie Hall, with Robert Harth as executive director, provides a model of smartly balanced programming. Next season you can catch familiar works in performances by esteemed ensembles, like the Philharmonia Orchestra under the probing conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi. Or you can hear the Berlin Philharmonic exploring fresh vistas with its dynamic new music director Simon Rattle in three programs that include recent works by Henri Dutilleux, Heiner Goebbels and Gyorgy Ligeti. Premieres of 30 pieces are scheduled, a list that should grow on Wednesday with the announcement of the programming for Zankel Hall. And Carnegie is not as dependent on selling subscription tickets as most major orchestras. People pick and choose among events, and there's something for everybody.
The lively artistic team that runs Lincoln Center's Great Performers series is hampered by the limitations of the center's performance facilities. Next season's innovative offerings include an ambitious festival of works by the visionary Dutch composer Louis Andriessen, the New York premiere of Osvaldo Golijov's first opera, "Ainadamar," and a multimedia production of Monteverdi's "Ritorno d'Ulisse." As in the past, most of the music-theater works will be presented at sites off campus, like the John Jay College Theater. Even if the center can raise the needed $1.2 billion for its huge redevelopment plan, its old-fashioned auditoriums will still not be conducive to inventive music-theater productions.
To judge from its programming, the New York Philharmonic continues to have trouble with vision. The critical response to Lorin Maazel's work in his first season as music director has been, at best, mixed. For me, his most willful and attention-grabbing performances were of two Beethoven symphonies: the Fifth and the Ninth. So what do we get next season? A complete cycle of Beethoven's symphonies and piano concertos, courtesy of Mr. Maazel. There will be premieres of substantial works commissioned from two powerfully original composers: Poul Ruders and Stephen Hartke, and a fair number of American premieres and 20th-century scores. But there is little sense of an integrated programmatic mission.
For that, we may have to wait. Mr. Maazel, who has a four-year contract, increasingly seems an interim music director.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Richmond

BYLINE:  By RAY CORMIER; RAY CORMIER is an editor in the Travel section of The Times.

 BODY:
It is not true that there are no new buildings in Richmond. The opening of a convention center and a state-of the-art botanical conservatory in the last five weeks is proof. 
 But the former capital of the Confederacy has worked so hard at preservation -- not only for its obviously historic buildings but also in its neighborhoods -- that it can seem like the archives of the Old South. 
The architectural and natural riches are varied: the Thomas Jefferson-designed State Capitol and Jefferson Davis's White House of the Confederacy; former English manor houses and tree-lined streets of Victorian row houses; quiet, lush public gardens and a walkway along the James River below skyscrapers where office workers watch kayakers riding Class III rapids. 
 Each April, as part of Virginia Garden Week, a sampling of the city's homes -- grand and ordinary -- and their gardens show off the graciousness of Southern life. For three days, private homes and gardens in three Richmond neighborhoods will be open for tours. Considering that daffodils were pushing up in late February, there should be lots of color -- from azaleas, cherries, peonies and other blooms.

Events
 The 70th Historic Garden Week of Virginia runs April 19 to 27 across the state, with Richmond properties featured on April 22, 23 and 24. The first day will showcase six homes on the 2300 block of Monument Avenue, just east of the Jefferson Davis Monument; the homes, all built from 1909 to 1926, include the neo-Classical Blair House, erected by a Confederate veteran to face the monument. 
 The next day, seven houses in Church Hill, the city's oldest section, east of I-95, will be open. They include the 1810 Turner House, and two other fairly rare antebellum homes (much of Richmond burned in 1865); ticket holders can also tour St. John's Church, where Patrick Henry made his "Give me liberty or give me death" speech. The third day focuses on the Cary Street Road corridor in the suburban West End. 
 A guidebook is available for a $5 donation to the Garden Club of Virginia, 12 East Franklin Street, Richmond, Va. 23219; information and tickets, $30 a day or $10 a house in Richmond, are available from (800) 867-5940 or www.vagardenweek.org. 
 In conjunction with Garden Week, Maymont, a former estate overlooking the James, is offering a tour on April 24 at 10:30 a.m. Partly by tram, and partly on foot, it will cover the 100-acre grounds, including the Italian and Japanese gardens, arboretum, zoo (including bison and black bears) and carriage collection. The Gilded Age mansion, including its swan bed, will open for tours at noon. The grounds are open daily, free; inside exhibits ($4 donation) are closed Monday. The main entrance is at 2201 Shields Lake Drive. Information: (804) 358-7166 or www.maymont.org. 
 A cultural highlight of the spring will be Itzhak Perlman's appearance with the Richmond Symphony on May 10 for the 75th anniversary of the Carpenter Center for the Performing Arts, a beautifully restored 2,041-seat former movie palace at 600 East Grace Street; tickets, $50 to $200. Tickets are available through Ticketmaster, (804) 262-8100 or at the center box office; www.carpentercenter.com. 
 Re-enactments of Patrick Henry's famous speech to the Second Virginia Convention in 1775 at St. John's, 2401 East Broad Street, take place Sundays from May 25 to Aug. 31, preceded by an organ recital at 1:30 p.m.; a donation is asked. Daily tours of the 1741 church and graveyard (among those interred are George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Elizabeth Arnold Poe, Edgar Allan's mother) are $5. Information: (804) 648-5015 or www.historicstjohnschurch.org. 
 "The Confederate Nation," an exhibition from May 23 to Dec. 31, 2004, at the Museum of the Confederacy, 1201 East Clay Street, will explore the South's independence movement, including the role of patriotism among a populace that included many people who opposed the Confederate cause. The 40-minute tours of the White House of the Confederacy next door, carefully restored to its wartime appearance, focus on the lives of Jefferson Davis and his family. Open daily; general admission and tour, $9.50. Information: (804) 649-1861, www.moc.org. 
 It's not the South without Nascar, and the 100,000-seat Richmond International Speedway, 600 East Laburnum, stages four big racing weekends a year. The next one features the Hardee's 250 on May 2 and the Pontiac Excitement 400 on May 3. Tickets, $35 to $80 from (804) 329-7914 and www.rir.com.
 The Diamond, 3001 North Boulevard, is the modern 12,134-seat home of the Richmond Braves, the top farm team for the Atlanta Braves. There are home games Wednesday through April 16, then from April 23 to 27. Tickets, $6 to $9; (800) 849-4627 and www.rbraves.com.

Sightseeing
 A proper introduction to Richmond is a drive along Monument Avenue. The statues of heroes of the Confederacy -- J.E.B. Stuart, Robert E. Lee, Davis, Stonewall Jackson and Matthew Fontaine Maury (a developer of the torpedo) -- are stunning. And the sixth monument -- the farthest west (at Roseneath Street) -- raised in 1996 to the tennis star and humanitarian Arthur Ashe, a Richmond native, is telling about how the city has changed. Information available at www.monumenthouse.com/richmond. 
 A good place to begin touring Richmond is the National Park Service's Civil War Visitors Center at Tredegar Iron Works, next to Brown's Island at 500 Tredegar Street. The exhibits and orientation film present an overview of the war and how the city suffered. Civil War buffs can plan visits to the many battlefields in the area. The picturesque Tredegar complex was the largest foundry in the South, and made most of the Confederacy's cannons. Open daily free, but parking is $4. Information, (804) 771-2145 and www.nps.gov/rich.
 The visitor center is at the west end of the 1.25-mile Canal Walk, along the Kanawha Canal, which bypassed the falls and allowed Richmond to become a major economic center in the 1840's. You can stroll past downtown's modern office buildings to Shockoe Slip and Shockoe Bottom, where the old brick tobacco warehouses are now atmospheric restaurants, pubs and nightclubs. 
 Uphill a few blocks is Capitol Square, dominated by Jefferson's neo-Classical home for the Legislature and the 1858 statue of Washington by Jean-Antoine Houdon, a patriotic symbol for separatists. Tours of the first floor of the early Federal-style Governor's Mansion, continuously used since 1813, are offered free from 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday; (804) 371-2642. While looking at the antique piano in the ballroom or the grand oval dining room you might meet Buster, Gov. Mark Warner's Portuguese water dog. 
 The new classical conservatory at the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, 1800 Lakeside Avenue, north of I-64, was opened March 22 with 8,000 square feet of space for palm trees, orchids and special exhibits. Outside are 30 acres with blooms all year. Open daily; $8. Information: (804) 262-9887, www.lewisginter.org.
 The gardens at Agecroft Hall, 4305 Sulgrave Avenue, (804) 353-4241, www.agecrofthall.org, are impressive. But go inside the 15th-century Tudor manor house, which was dismantled in England, and rebuilt here in 1925, to learn about Elizabethan England in this 400th-anniversary year of the death of Elizabeth I. Admission, $7; closed Monday. 
 Heading back downtown and to the 21st century, stroll through the nine-block stretch of the Fan District called Carytown, a funky strip of trendy boutiques, antiques shops, restaurants, pubs and the ornate Byrd Theater, 2908 Cary Street, where second-run movies show daily for $1.99; (804) 353-9911.

Where to Stay
 To sleep in the lap of history, try the landmark Linden Row Inn, 100 East Franklin Street, (800) 348-7424, fax (804) 648-7504, or visit www.lindenrowinn.com. Most of the 70 rooms are in a renovated 1847 Greek Revival row house and are quite spacious with tile baths; the six suites have Victorian parlors with antiques and ceiling-to-floor windows. The newer garden rooms are smaller. Use of the nearby excellent Y.M.C.A. fitness center is free. The inn has new owners, who plan some freshening, a good idea. Doubles, $89 to $189, with Continental breakfast.
 About half the 49 handsome suites and 10 standard rooms at the Commonwealth Park Suites, in a century-old building at 901 Bank Street, (888) 343-7301, fax (804) 343-1025, www.commonwealthparksuites.com, look over the Capitol. Rates, $89 to $169, include Continental breakfast off the small, comfortable lobby.
 Budget: The Quality Inn and Suites, 201 East Cary Street, (804) 788-1600, fax (804) 788-1661, opened less than two years ago in a former office building. The 100 rooms are standard but clean, and there is free parking under the hotel and use of the Y. Doubles from $79 (without discounts), with Continental breakfast.
 Luxury: For a Scarlett and Rhett moment, descend the grand staircase at the elegant Jefferson Hotel, 101 West Franklin Street, (800) 424-8014, fax (804) 649-4693, www.jefferson-hotel.com. This 1895 landmark has 264 luxurious rooms and suites, the elegant Lemaire restaurant and marble everywhere -- including a life-size sculpture of Jefferson in the main lobby. The fitness center's facilities rival many clubs'. Doubles start at $285, suites at $465.
 The Omni Richmond, 100 South 12th Street, (804) 344-7000, fax (804) 648-6704, www.omnihotels.com, is a modern business traveler's hotel straddling the financial center and the lively Shockoe Slip area. The 361 traditionally decorated rooms have marble baths, and many have river views. There are indoor and outdoor pools. Doubles start at $185. 

Where to Eat
 The Hard Shell, 1411 East Cary Street, (804) 643-2333, is what Shockoe Slip is all about. This casual, boisterous place with painted brick walls and an outdoor terrace serves fresh local seafood, like Chesapeake Bay oysters and large steamed shrimp; huge salads; well-grilled steaks; and live jazz as background to the party atmosphere. Open for dinner daily, lunch weekdays and Sunday brunch; reservations are a good idea. Dinner for two with drinks, $90.
 Helen's, 2527 West Main Street, (804) 358-4370, looks like just another Fan District corner nook: there are only 10 tables under a tin ceiling and along a copper bar and the open kitchen; nonsmokers should know that there's no place to hide. But like its reputation, the changing menu is not ordinary: roasted beet salad; swanky mac and cheese with chunks of lobster; and lavender creme brulee. Dinner only, nightly; $100 for two with wine.
 Strawberry Street Cafe, 421 North Strawberry Street, (804) 353-6860, famous for its salad bar partly set on an old claw-foot bathtub, is a Fan landmark. The salad bar and soup can make a meal ($7.95), but the burgers, steaks and quiches are good, too. Lunch and dinner daily, plus Saturday and Sunday brunch. Dinner for two with drinks, $60. 
 Downtown, Chez Foushee, 203 North Foushee Street, (804) 648-3225, has an ornate Spanish roof, but a contemporary interior that seems almost exotic in this city. The soups, salads and sandwiches are good and the chocolate torte rich. Lunch only, weekdays; about $35 for two with a glass of wine. 
 Up on Church Hill, the Hill Cafe, 2800 East Broad Street, (804) 648-0360, is a laid-back neighborhood spot with painted brick walls, old tables and good pulled-pork sandwiches, burgers and salads. Open daily for lunch, dinner and weekend brunch. With beers, lunch for two is about $25.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
War Chips Away At Airlines' Schedules

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
THE schedules of airlines around the world have become as chaotic as a sandstorm in the Persian Gulf. Passenger bookings plummeted with the advent of the American and British invasion of Iraq, and the big carriers -- already financially drained by the weak global economy -- are canceling many low-demand flights. International flights in particular have taken a beating, with many airlines drastically cutting their service to the Middle East.
 Travel experts say people should call the airlines and make sure that specific flights have not been canceled before booking a ticket. Besides service to the Middle East, flights that will probably see the most fluctuation in schedules are those that cross the North Atlantic. In February 1991, just after the start of the first Persian Gulf war, traffic across the Atlantic fell 44 percent compared with February 1990, according to the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group in this country. 
 "I would expect cutting flights to increase," said Morten Beyer, chief executive of Morten Beyer & Agnew, an airline consulting company based in Arlington, Va. "They're not supposed to do that. The Department of Transportation frowns on airlines cutting out a flight because there are few passengers on it. This inconveniences people. But I think you're going to see some of that."
On March 18, a day after President Bush gave a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq, airline schedule planners began putting some cuts into effect.
Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest domestic carrier, said it would pare its trans-Atlantic schedule because of low bookings. It cut out one of two daily flights from its hub in Newark to both London and Paris. It also said it would cut its daily service from Newark to Tokyo to four times a week until April 24.
To further reduce trans-Atlantic capacity, the carrier said, it will fly smaller planes between Newark and both Amsterdam and Rome from April 6 to May 1.
If the war goes on too long, the airline might trim service to small and medium-size American cities, as well as additional foreign cities, said Gordon M. Bethune, the company's chief executive. 
So how long is too long? Mr. Bethune said even a month of ongoing conflict would severely hurt his airline and the rest of the industry, as oil prices fluctuate and passengers shy away from the skies.
United Airlines, operating under bankruptcy protection, said it might have to cut capacity by 10 percent to 12 percent during the war. Many airline analysts say the industry has an overcapacity right now of 10 to 15 percent, so an across-the-board reduction from the major airlines would not be surprising. For the carriers, this would give them more leverage to raise ticket prices, something that experts say they must do if they are to return to profitability.
American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, said on March 20 that it would probably make cuts in its international schedule. Even Southwest Airlines, which has been profitable for 30 years and runs only domestic flights, was not entirely ruling out changes in its schedule. It did not reduce capacity during the first gulf war, but a spokesman, Ed Stewart, said this war could turn out to be quite different.
Many international airlines have also taken trimming shears to their schedules.
On March 20, Singapore Airlines said it was cutting 65 flights a week from late March to May 31 between Singapore and the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. The airline said it made the cuts because of "softening demand in the past few weeks attributed to concern about the situation in the Middle East."
Meanwhile, other airlines were temporarily suspending flights to the Middle East. British Airways halted its two daily flights from London to Tel Aviv and one daily flight to Kuwait. Swiss International Air Lines cut seven weekly flights from Zurich to Cairo and said it would assess each day whether to trim flights to its nine other destinations in the region. Thai Airways said it was suspending flights from Bangkok to Kuwait and Bahrain.
Those are not the only carriers making changes. At least a dozen airlines announced schedule cuts during the first week of the war. More were expected to follow.
Travel experts recommend that passengers try to book flights earlier in the day because those are less likely to be canceled. Travelers might also want to ask for a paper ticket, even if this costs more, because such tickets are considered more interchangeable for passengers trying to switch flights. What's more, many airlines have substantially relaxed restrictions on tickets for now, so rebooking flights or getting credit for an unused ticket should be easier.
The only hitch is that these more lenient rules vary widely from carrier to carrier, so travelers need to call their airline to find out the details.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Fallout From War; 
Hotel Use Declines; Office Sector Faces Uncertainty

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE war in Iraq is hurting the hotel industry in the New York metropolitan region, as airlines scale back their flight schedules and the threat of terrorist attacks makes people reluctant to visit the region, real estate executives say. 
 The effect on the office leasing and investment sales markets is not as easy to measure. Some executives say uncertainty about the conflict's duration and economic effects is causing companies to put off making decisions to buy or lease. Others, though, say it is a good time for bargain shopping, particularly for tenants who want to lock in a good deal. 
 Bookings at hotels started to drop even before the war broke out, said Thomas P. McConnell, senior managing director of the hotel group at Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company. "The impact on travel took hold at the beginning of the year," he said, with hotel revenues down 5 to 10 percent from last year's level. "A lot of people blamed it on the weather, but a lot of travel was curtailed in anticipation of the war." 
Hotels, he noted, are the most vulnerable of real estate sectors to shifts in public moods, because rooms are rented on a night-to-night basis. "Lodging is the most likely to be affected," Mr. McConnell said. "It is the first to go up and the first to go down."
Nicholas Buss, vice president of research for PNC Real Estate Finance Group, said: "The hotel sector is most at risk. It has been reeling since 9/11, and if travel continues to decline, we could see some distressed hotel owners."
The war is likely to delay, but probably not prevent, an expected upturn in occupancy rates and revenues, said Daniel H. Lesser, managing director of the hospitality industry group at Cushman & Wakefield, another major brokerage and services company. He said hotels have adjusted their marketing strategies to appeal to domestic travelers rather than the international tourists that previously sustained the local industry.
"The fly-to markets are softer than the drive-to markets, so hotels are reorienting toward the drive-to markets," he said. "In New York, hotels are marketing to people who live within 500 miles of the city, rather than the international travelers, who are not coming anyway."
He said the industry has been depressed for so long that a cyclical recovery can be expected. "It is not a matter of if, but when," he said. But, he conceded, the war could push back the time of the recovery. 
"If we have a quick war and do not experience a terrorist attack, there will not be much impact on the industry in New York," he said, noting that outside investors are still interested in buying hotels in the city.
Nationally, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting company, said a brief war -- defined as one lasting 30 to 45 days -- would depress hotel revenues during the first half of this year, with normal growth resuming in the second half. Under this chain of events, the revenue per available room, a standard industry measurement, would increase only 0.5 percent in the first half of the year, compared with what had been anticipated as a growth of 2.1 percent. A war lasting more than a month and a half, however, would reduce first half revenues to 0.1 percent and shrink them 3.6 percent in the second half, according to the study.
In other sectors of the market, the economic uncertainties produced by the war are seen as an opportunity for the determined to lock in deals when landlords are willing to make concessions to fill office space.
Quoting a saying that she attributed to an early Rothschild, "Buy when there is blood in the streets," Ruth Colp-Haber, a partner in Wharton Property Advisors, a tenants' broker, said, "There are good deals out there, and now is the time to lock in good long-term leases."
SHE said some of the best deals are to be found in sublease space that was expensively built out for dot-com and telecommunications companies and then returned to the market. "They can be complicated deals, but they are among the best available," she said. "The space is built and the phones are installed, so a tenant can move in two weeks rather than waiting nine months if you are starting with raw space."
Michael T. Cohen, the president of the GVA Williams brokerage and services company, said he was more concerned with national economic policies that might push up interest rates than with fallout from the war. The war, he said, has been used as an excuse to postpone decisions. 
"It is easy to blame the war in Iraq for the inability to make a decision," he said. "But unless there is a protracted war or a loss, it will not push the economy into a recession. The real recession threat is unbalanced budgets in Washington that will crowd out the private sector in financial markets."
This, he said, would tend to drive up interest rates to the detriment of the economy and the real estate industry.
James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage that represents tenants, said he is among the bargain hunters. "I'm seeing things move forward as tenants drive harder to get better deals," he said. "This is a time when tenants can pull out a sledgehammer and do deals."
Because of the weak leasing market, he said, landlords are offering longer periods of free rent and are contributing more money to interior construction. "We are looking at 12 to 14 months of free rent on 10-year deals and work letters of up to $60 a square foot," he said. The uncertain economic outlook is allowing aggressive tenants to push for better economic terms, he added.
The very uncertainty about the economic effects of the conflict is a drag on the industry, said John F. Powers, a vice chairman of Insignia/ESG. "Our business is all about confidence in the future," he said. "You need to be confident to sign a lease for 15 years."
He said the actual outbreak of hostilities had changed little, since the diplomatic run-up to the war had already unsettled the office leasing market. "The last three months have been disrupted by anxiety over the anticipation of war," he said.
He said the fact that New York is a possible target for terrorism has combined with the nature of the current economy to slow the pace of office leasing. "This is an environment of slow growth and relatively high unemployment," he said. "Productivity gains do not need office space."
The uncertainty about the economic effects of the war is also slowing the investment sales market, as foreign investors hesitate to make purchases until the outlook is clearer, said Bruce Mosler, the president of United States operations for Cushman & Wakefield.
"Foreign investors have been taking a wait and see position for some time," he said, "and they may find other areas more attractive" if the war goes badly or there is another terror strike.
UNCERTAINTY aside, some investment deals are being done. James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, said the 600,000-square-foot building at 636 11th Avenue sold recently for about $45 million. The seller was Global Crossing, an ailing telecommunications company, and the buyer was Jacob Frydman, a local investor.
The war appears to be aggravating a mismatch between long-term opportunities in the office leasing market and short-term thinking on the part of many space users, said Michael Colacino, the president of Julien J. Studley, a tenants' broker. "There are opportunities to grab early renewals, but most people are thinking month-to-month, so there is very light demand," he said.
He said a lot of clients were concerned about security, and those with three or four years left on their current leases are not certain they want to make a commitment to stay in Manhattan. 
A quick, decisive victory in battle might improve the leasing market by giving business managers a feeling of confidence in the future, said Peter G. Riguardi, the president of Jones Lang LaSalle. "Real estate is a reflection of the general business environment, which has been in limbo for months," he said. "If the conflict were to resolve itself, that might be the impetus for recovery."

HEADLINE: Far West Side: a Vision of the Far Future 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
"THIS project, more than any other, is the single best investment in our future that this city can make," Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff told a planning conference at Baruch College last month.
 He was not talking about the World Trade Center site. 
 Instead, he was talking about the far West Side, where the Bloomberg administration envisions some 28 million square feet of commercial development and 12 million square feet of residential development by midcentury.
Radiating from a plaza at 11th Avenue and 33rd Street would be an exoskeletal stadium, arena and exposition hall to serve the New York Jets and, if the city lands them, the 2012 Olympics; a new four-block-long boulevard lined with very large office towers and apartment buildings; a transportation hub reached by an extended No. 7 subway line; and an expanded Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
In the name "Hudson Yards" and features like the plaza and the new boulevard between 10th and 11th Avenues, the project can be traced to Mr. Doctoroff's campaign to lure the Olympics, which began in 1996 and involved Alexander Garvin, who now directs planning for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The Olympic bid meshed with the Giuliani administration's hope of redeveloping the area as an extension of Midtown, an effort that needed a catalyst. The current project is an alloy of these plans, said Vishaan Chakrabarti, director of the City Planning Department's Manhattan office. 
Zoning details are evolving. "We have all the ingredients, but I don't know what the bouillabaisse is going to be yet," said Alexander Cooper of Cooper, Robertson & Partners, design consultants to the planning department and the Economic Development Corporation, with Arquitectonica and the Olin Partnership.
Even in broad outline, the Hudson Yards project has already attracted criticism for the gigantism and density of the buildings that might result, for the novelty of its $3 billion economic underpinnings, for the prospect that it will divert municipal resources from more urgent needs and for the possibility that it would disrupt and displace residents and small businesses in Clinton and Chelsea.
Mr. Doctoroff is pressing ahead, however. In an interview on Monday, as the dimensions of the Iraq war were becoming evident, he conjured up the construction of Central Park during the Civil War and the Empire State Building during the Depression. "What really defines this city," he said, "is the ability at critical junctures to take fear, to take tragedy, to take economic woe and channel it into the accomplishment of magnificent achievements that truly set a different course for the city."
One tangible sign of a new course locally is Hudson Crossing, a 15-story, 259-unit apartment building at Ninth Avenue and 37th Street that will open next month. A lottery for 52 apartments set aside for lower-income tenants attracted about 4,000 applicants. Rents for the market-rate apartments begin at $1,495 for a studio.
"Olympics or no Olympics, the city has obviously decided that the whole area is going to be redeveloped," said William P. Dickey of the Dermot Company, developers of the $74 million Hudson Crossing.
Mr. Dickey, a Bronx native who was formerly a partner in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore and then a managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston, founded Dermot in 1991, naming the company for his father, Joseph Dermot Dickey. The name now does the double duty of honoring his brother, Joseph Jr., who perished at the World Trade Center in the Sept. 11 attack.
Although Hudson Crossing is Dermot's only project in the immediate area, the company was designated this month by the Housing Preservation and Development Department to build 600 units on two city-owned parcels on 10th Avenue, between 51st and 53rd Streets. Dermot owns buildings in Washington Heights and Astoria, Queens, and is planning 400 new units in Queens.
Dermot is associated in three projects with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Building Investment Trust and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Housing Investment Trust. In the case of Hudson Crossing, the building trust has made a $25 million equity investment, while the housing trust has purchased $10 million in Housing Development Corporation bonds. "Our focus is on housing because the need is so great," said Marcie Cohen, senior vice president of the housing investment trust.
Construction is running about twomonths ahead of schedule and may cost about $4 million less than budgeted. The chunky red-brick structure was designed by H. Thomas O'Hara. It has 5,300 square feet of retail space and a 166-stall garage.
Prospective tenants are largely in their 20's and 30's, said Stephen N. Benjamin, a principal in Dermot. "We felt this neighborhood had great promise, given its proximity to most of the jobs in Midtown," he said. "Frankly, we thought the only thing it lacked was comprehensive zoning that would encourage new development."
Hudson Crossing was built on a strip of Ninth Avenue that is already zoned for residential development. Most of the area to the west, around the Long Island Rail Road's John D. Caemmerer yards, is zoned for manufacturing. The predominant allowable density is a floor-area ratio of five to one; that is, five square feet of floor space for every square foot of land on the site.
THE Hudson Yards plan would create a high-density spine between 10th and 11th Avenues, with floor-area ratios that might range from 15 to 18 per square foot of land. This zone would extend like two arms around a medium-density area between Eighth and 10th Avenues, 33rd and 40th Streets, with a floor-area ratio of 7.5 to 10. In the center would be a lower-density district along Ninth Avenue, from 34th to 39th Streets, carrying a ratio of 6 to 7.5.
Potentially higher density, up to a floor-area ratio of 21.6, is being considered for sites closest to the proposed transportation hub at 11th Avenue and 34th Street, where the No. 7 subway line would extend beyond its current terminus at Times Square, perhaps linked to platforms for L.I.R.R. and even Metro-North Railroad trains. This very high density might also be applied to the current site of Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue, if the Garden moves out.
Such density is "required to accommodate long-term growth," Mr. Chakrabarti said, and is also tied to the public financing of the subway extension, new streets and parks, and the vast platform over the Caemmerer yards on which the Jets stadium would sit, through the transfer of development rights and the use of tax-increment financing. This financing technique earmarks tax revenues from increased property values to cover the debt on bonds used to pay for the infrastructure that induces new development. "If you had less density, you couldn't fund the No. 7 line or the parks," Mr. Chakrabarti said. "The density creates the revenue stream that allows you to fund the infrastructure improvements."
A financing plan should be ready by the end of April or early May, Mr. Doctoroff said. He once called for a Hudson Yards Development Authority with the power to issue bonds, acquire land, and hold and sell development rights, but now declines to be any more specific than to say that a "city-state partnership is critical."
"There is no single investment, in our view, that we can make in infrastructure in this city that earns such a high rate of return," Mr. Doctoroff said, without indicating what that would be, other than "multiples" of the $3 billion public investment.
But opponents of the project, like John Fisher of the Clinton Special District Coalition, ask what will happen if the city's assumptions prove wrong. "When you add debt on more debt, that causes interest rates to go up," he said. "The whole financial plan is a diversion of tax money that's not going to be available to the city budget.
"There is no way to print money," Mr. Fisher said. "It's all smoke and mirrors."
And, he added, intense redevelopment is simply not necessary. "They're pretending this area is empty," Mr. Fisher said. "It's not Park Avenue. But it's not empty. It's full of tax-producing businesses. You may not like a parking lot, but you need it."
In contrast, property owners in the 34th Street Partnership look at the parking lots and railyards as conveying a sense of abandonment, said Daniel A. Biederman, president of the partnership, which administers a business improvement district that runs to 10th Avenue. They generally feel "highly positive" about the Hudson Yards project, he said, but cannot foresee commercial rents reaching the levels necessary to prompt development until about a decade of steady market improvement.
That is roughly when city officials assume the first office tower will get under way on the far West Side. "We feel very comfortable that's not taking away from other important development priorities; in many ways most importantly, Lower Manhattan," Mr. Doctoroff said. "First of all, Lower Manhattan hopefully will be more or less built out 10 to 12 years from now."
An environmental impact statement on Hudson Yards is to be finished in the spring of 2004, when the project would go into land-use review, meaning that it could reach the City Council later that year. If it were approved, construction of the No. 7 line and the railyard platform might begin in 2005.
NO one expects the review to go smoothly, given the fears of neighbors that a stadium will flood the area with traffic and wall off the waterfront with its gargantuan scale. (The structure would be 600 feet across, 800 feet long and about 300 feet tall at the uppermost parapets, roughly equal to a 25 to 30 story building.) Critics are unpersuaded by an assurance from L. Jay Cross, the president of the Jets, based on polls of the patrons and studies of comparable stadiums elsewhere, that at least 70 percent of season ticket holders would use mass transit.
"I wish the city's plan was not inextricably linked to the stadium," said Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn. "It seems as though the city has carried over Mayor Giuliani's commitment to the stadium and then backed into a zoning plan."
Borough President C. Virginia Fields has offered a plan in which the Caemmerer yards would be covered by apartment towers of 30 stories along 11th Avenue, with a park to the west. Paul Buckhurst of Buckhurst Fish & Jacquemart, which prepared the plan, said, "It seemed to us that having 5,000 units with views of a park might be, from a planning standpoint, a slightly saner use than an enclosed stadium."
But since the mid-90's, city officials have seen the stadium as the catalyst for larger redevelopment. "While the media played it mostly about the stadium, it was really about the growth of the city," said Joseph B. Rose, the planning commission chairman under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The first talk was of a new Yankee Stadium. However, Mr. Doctoroff recalled his concern that a baseball stadium could not win approval. "Baseball teams play 81 home games, many of them at 7 o'clock on a weekday night," he said. "And, of course, there was the issue of wrenching the Yankees out of their historic home."
By contrast, the Jets' lease at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands has six years to run and they would play 10 home games a year. That opened the possibility of a structure that could be used by the Olympics, as an adjunct to Javits and perhaps by Madison Square Garden, leaving the Garden's current site available for redevelopment.
In 2000, Robert Wood Johnson IV, the new owner of the Jets, brought Mr. Cross to New York from Miami, where he had helped develop the American Airlines Arena for the Miami Heat, also in the face of opposition.
"The Jets knew that to build their stadium, they would have to push very hard in the arena of public opinion and they decided to pump up the architectural vision," Raymond W. Gastil wrote in "Beyond the Edge: New York's New Waterfront" (Princeton Architectural Press, 2002).
The design of the $1 billion stadium is unlike the poured-concrete bunkers of the 1970's and the nostalgic brick ballparks of more recent vintage. Instead, it is a starkly industrial-looking steel structure, with an array of wind turbines along the top, that is meant to evoke the pier sheds along the Hudson and the towers of the George Washington Bridge, Mr. Cross said. The architects are Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, working with Heinlein Schrock Stearns, specialists in sports design. The engineers are Thornton-Tomasetti and Flack & Kurtz.
The structure would extend from 11th to 12th Avenue, 30th to 33rd Street. It would have a retractable roof and movable seats. With the stands opened to their fullest extent, some 70,000 spectators could be accommodated. With the stands compressed, a 20,000-seat arena would be created, adjoining a 120,000-square-foot exposition hall. At such times, the roof would be closed.
Mr. Cross said the structure would probably be used 14 times a year as a stadium, 55 times as an arena and 40 times as an exposition hall. The site can also accommodate 640,000 square feet of underground space that might be used as a truck marshaling area for Javits or as a new home for the city tow pound, freeing up Pier 76.
To bring crowds across 10th and 11th Avenues, the Jets propose to reuse parts of the High Line, the abandoned New York Central viaduct that runs north from Gansevoort Street and across 30th Street into the Caemmerer yards. While the Giuliani administration sought to demolish the High Line, its preservation and adaptation has been embraced by Deputy Mayor Doctoroff.
A design competition sponsored by the Friends of the High Line is open for submissions until April 25. It is the latest in a series of planning exercises for the far West Side, including 13 community-based proposals put forward last year by the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association and the Design Trust for Public Space.
In 1999, the International Foundation for the Canadian Center for Architecture sponsored a $100,000 prize competition for the redesign of the area. Peter Eisenman won with his proposal for an undulating, low-rise megastructure with a rooftop park covering a new Garden and Javits extension.
Phyllis Lambert, the founding director of the center, said at the time that the plan was "eminently realizable." But now she says that construction of the winning entry was not the point, but rather focusing architectural attention on a neglected precinct. "To me, the most important thing about the site is that this is public land," she said. "And New York needs more public space."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
March of History Is Seldom in Step With Market Timing

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DESPITE the stock market's strong rally two weeks ago, as the United States began attacking Iraq, many market timers doubt that the beginning of the war meant the end of the bear market that began in 2000.
 "News events rarely turn markets around," argued Michael Burke in the newsletter he edits, Investors Intelligence, "and reactions to news can be sharp but brief." In his view, the long-term market trend is likely to be down because "that was the direction of trading shown prior to this event." 
 The historical record, however, is not so clear cut. Building on an often-cited 1989 study that measured the one-day impact of big news events not directly related to the economy, I assessed the 12-month impact. I found that these events had no discernible effect on the stock market's trend, and that there was no way an investor could use this information to time the market. 
The authors of the 1989 study were three economics professors -- James M. Poterba, David M. Cutler and Lawrence H. Summers. Mr. Summers would later become Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration; he is now president of Harvard. Professor Cutler is also at Harvard, and Professor Poterba is at M.I.T.
To come up with their list of the biggest noneconomic news events, they relied on the World Almanac's chronology of important world events, from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, to the stock market crash on Oct. 19, 1987.
The professors excluded any event that The New York Times did not carry as a lead article and that its business pages did not report as having had an impact on markets. They were left with 49 events, including the North Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and President Richard M. Nixon's resignation in 1974. If the professors updated their study to include March 2003, the start of the Iraq war would undoubtedly qualify.
For my extended study, I first eliminated big events that fell within a few days of one another. For the 36 events that remained, I compared the direction of the Dow Jones industrial average over the previous 3, 6 and 12 months with its direction over the next 3, 6 and 12 months.
Regardless of the length of the period, I found that about half the time, the stock market's direction did not change after momentous events. In other words, investors would have had an even chance of being correct had they always bet that the market would revert after a big event to the upward or downward trend that prevailed before it.
That finding alone, however, is not enough to conclude that momentous events have had no effect on the market's direction. After all, under more normal circumstances, maybe the market has a better-than-even chance of changing direction on any given day.
TO find out if that has been the case, I checked the historical record back to 1896, when the Dow was created, to see how often the market's 3-, 6- and 12-month trends changed direction. They did so with virtually the same frequency as they did after the three dozen momentous events.
Finally, I checked whether there was any market pattern associated with an even narrower group of momentous days, those that were preceded by a declining market. (That situation, of course, is most analogous to today's.) I found that the market turned higher about three-fourths of the time on those occasions, though that probably can be explained by the market's historical tendency to go up more often than it goes down. After every other 12-month period of declining stocks since 1896, the market turned higher with virtually the same frequency.
There is little evidence, then, of any enduring market pattern from the biggest geopolitical events. That means market timers should look for more justification than a quick end to the war before turning bullish.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "No Clear Direction"The stock market's direction after a major news event does not differ significantly from the market's trend after any other given day, according to an analysis of a 1989 study.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
A Philanthropy Rush In Corporate Brazil

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
IF Brazilians needed any proof that having a social conscience is in fashion here, they got it recently, when, during Sao Paulo Fashion Week, the supermodel Gisele Bundchen gave half her $30,000 runway fee to Zero Hunger, a program to eradicate poverty in this country.
 Not coincidentally, Zero Hunger is the mainstay project of Brazil's left-leaning new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. For that reason, many executives are eager to emulate Ms. Bundchen, the icon of Brazil's fashion industry, and to do -- or at least be seen to be doing -- their part. The leaders of a growing number of companies, including multinational giants like I.B.M., Ford Motor, Bayer and Unilever, are clamoring to support Zero Hunger, which says it needs $1.5 billion in financing over the next four years. 
 Their motives, government officials say, range from naked opportunism to a conviction that Brazil desperately needs to distribute its wealth more equitably. Whatever the reason, officials said, the aid is welcome.
Despite Brazil's success in curbing hyperinflation the last decade, the number of poor Brazilians has stayed stubbornly at around 60 million -- more than a third of the population. Lackluster economic growth and rising unemployment in recent years means that 46 million Brazilians -- about one in four -- still live on less than $1 a day, according to Instituto Ethos, an association of companies that champion corporate responsibility.
According to statistics from the United Nations, Brazil has the third most unequal distribution of wealth in the world, trailing only Swaziland and Nicaragua. The wealthiest 10 percent of the people here take in more than half of the national income, while the poorest tenth receive less than 1 percent.
"Business always tries to please the government currently in office," said Oded Grajew, special aide to Mr. da Silva for mobilizing corporate support for social projects. "If you want to impress this government, then your visiting card has to be the social question."
It appears to be working. Perusing a letter from Bayer in his office as he waited for the chief executive of IBM Brazil to arrive for a meeting, Mr. Grajew said he was "drowning in offers of help."
Nestle has pledged 1,000 tons of food aid; Ford is donating 440 pounds of food for every truck it sells for a month, while the leading supermarket chain Pao de Acucar has agreed to help with distribution.
The Institute of Applied Economics Research, a government agency, found that 462,000 companies spent a total of $2.5 billion in 2000 on social projects, from improving adult literacy to financing local dance troupes. While that is only a quarter of what corporate America spent in absolute terms on similar projects, it is four times as much as companies in the United States spend when calculated as a percentage of the economy's size.
Eduardo Monteiro, institutional marketing director at Pao de Acucar, says his company now spends more than $6.5 million a year on social projects, up from $4 million two years ago. It is increasing its food donations to 250 tons a month from 140 tons and is hiring 500 young people to assist in the Zero Hunger project.
FOR that, Mr. da Silva can be thankful.
With the jobless rate soaring to nearly 20 percent in some parts of the country and violent crime spiraling, underfinanced public schools, the health service and other social support agencies appear increasingly unable to cope.
Ricardo Young, president of Instituto Ethos, said companies "got a wake-up call" when they realized that Brazil's social fabric was so frayed.
"In a country with a social apartheid like Brazil has today, all our businesses are at risk," Mr. Young said.
Instituto Ethos, founded by 16 chief executives in 1998, now has more than 700 corporate members, which employ more than a million people and have sales of about a third of Brazil's annual economic output.
In some projects run by these companies, street youths learn to read, shantytown dwellers get their first jobs and drab streets are brightened with graffiti art.
The number of companies encouraging their employees to join volunteer work programs is also rising. Ford workers paint hospital wards on their own time (the company lends them a truck to carry the equipment), while BankBoston employees help regularly in soup kitchens and tell stories at child care centers.
Recently, 200 employees from Unilever, which sponsors centers for handicapped children and runs volleyball clubs in Sao Paulo shantytowns, distributed condoms on a beach near the northeastern city of Recife for a local program to fight AIDS.
Milu Vilela, a businesswoman who is president of Faca Parte, Brazil's main volunteer institute, estimates that the number of Brazilians doing some sort of voluntary work more than doubled, to about 44 million last year, from 20 million in 2000.
"Before, people used to think they could buy their place in heaven by writing a check," Ms. Vilela said. "Today they know it's not just a question of dipping into their pockets, but rolling up their sleeves and getting their hands dirty."
Ms. Bundchen's agent and manager, Monica Monteira, said her client donated her fee "because she wanted to serve as an example to all Brazilians who could help so that they would help," but it also helped to burnish her image after months of bad publicity for wearing fur on the runway. 
In the same way, charitable companies could have a lot to gain by being seen to do good.
Ford became the first automaker in Brazil to set up a department for social responsibility, in 2000, after a struggle with unions tarnished its image.
Ford now spends half a million dollars a year on social projects in Brazil, joining a trade union in an adult literacy program and supplying cars and spare parts to a mechanics' school for underprivileged adolescents. It also encourages workers' committees to come up with ideas and expects to donate and deliver 200 tons of food to Zero Hunger in February.
"It's not opportunism," said Flavio Padovan, director of Ford's truck division. "I won't sell any more trucks because of this campaign, but it's certainly good for brand image."
Nestle took out advertising in major newspapers to deny an article in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo that suggested that its donation could influence the government antitrust agency, which is about to ruleon Nestle's acquisition of a local chocolate maker, Garoto.
But for many, motives are not important.
"Yes, some people want to be close to the government; they want to be in the family photo," said Guilherme Leal, chief executive of Natura, a cosmetics company that has burnished its reputation by harvesting rare Amazon fruits and herbs from sustainable forest plantations. "But it doesn't matter, because they end up participating and committing themselves," he said. "Once you're involved, it's costly in image terms to get out."

HEADLINE: Another War, Same General 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was August 1990, just a few weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and Alan Greenspan was wrestling with questions eerily similar to those he faces today.
 Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, fretted that Iraqi troops were close enough to start "kamikaze raids" on major Saudi oil fields. Then, as now, oil prices had soared and financial markets were panicky. Then, as now, the American economy had begun to weaken even before the fighting started. 
 But then, as now, Mr. Greenspan was convinced that the Fed's main job was to project stability rather than rush to action. 
"Those who argue that we are already in a recession, I think, are reasonably certain to be wrong," he then told the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. "We have to recognize that there is a rather limited chance of affecting the economy in a significant way. I would suspect at this point that the Pentagon has more policy-making clout than we do."
As it happened, Mr. Greenspan was wrong on an important point. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which officially defines the peaks and valleys of economic cycles, concluded later that a recession had begun that very month. The Fed soon began cutting interest rates, but the slowdown persisted and contributed mightily to the re-election defeat of the first President Bush in 1992.
Today, Mr. Greenspan again faces the impact of war against Iraq and what he has called a "soft patch" at home. Even more than he did in 1990, the Fed chairman has argued that the American economy is fundamentally sound and that growth will recover as soon as "geopolitical uncertainties" are resolved. 
But the uncertainties have been increasing. A growing number of experts worry that business confidence may remain low for some time, even if the war ends quickly. And when the war may end has become an increasingly open question. Unemployment has continued to climb, industrial production remains stagnant and the economies of Europe and Japan are slumping even more than that of the United States. 
Michael Prell, an economist consultant who was the Fed's director of research from 1987 to 2000, said Mr. Greenspan may be overly optimistic.
"My impression is that he has put a big weight on the war and on the oil market," Mr. Prell said last week. "But I am not persuaded that uncertainty about the war is anywhere near the whole story behind the sluggishness of the economy."
Mr. Greenspan, now 77 and one year away from the end of his fourth four-year term as Fed chairman, has a complex relationship with the White House. Alert and energetic as ever, he recently annoyed many administration officials by casting doubt on the wisdom of the president's tax-cutting plans. 
But Mr. Greenspan is in many respects President Bush's quiet partner in the war on Iraq. 
If the war goes worse than expected, or if the economy does not bounce back when combat ends, Fed officials have strongly suggested they will pump money into the economy by reducing interest rates even more than they have already.
Perhaps equally important to the Bush administration, Mr. Greenspan has betrayed little anxiety about the costs of war or the risks of disruption to world oil supplies. Given the extent to which political leaders and financial markets dissect every word Mr. Greenspan utters, his apparent comfort is a crucial source of support for Mr. Bush. 
The Fed chairman meets regularly with Vice President Dick Cheney, a longtime friend who is President Bush's most trusted adviser, as well as with John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary. Mr. Greenspan has been at the White House at least three times in the past 10 days, and he met with Mr. Bush on Monday to review the economic outlook.
AT the same time, tensions exist between the Bush White House and the Greenspan Fed. 
Many people who worked in the first Bush administration still blame Mr. Greenspan for the 1992 re-election defeat. And many in the current Bush White House would dearly like to install their own candidate when Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman ends in June 2004. Whether Mr. Greenspan will want to step down then is unclear. 
But his credibility in financial markets is so strong and his acuity so well regarded that Mr. Bush cannot do without him for the moment.
Despite having long passed what many people consider retirement age, Mr. Greenspan still appears to thrive in his job. He pores over economic data like a sports fan immersed in baseball statistics, hunting for anomalies that provide unexpected clues to what is really happening in the economy.
In private meetings, administration officials say, Mr. Greenspan has been unruffled by possible disruptions in Middle East oil supplies. Oil production is more "elastic" than many people believe, he has told listeners. And though higher oil prices would constitute a "tax" on the economy, he has said, they would not necessarily lead to broader inflation or a recession. He told finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized countries on Feb. 25 that their countries were only half as vulnerable to oil shocks from the Middle East as they were during the price shocks of the early 1970's.
The Persian Gulf now accounts for a smaller share of world production than in 1990, he has said, and the major industrial economies have grown faster than their consumption of oil. 
Mr. Greenspan has also proved himself adept in financial crises. When the stock market crashed on Oct. 19, 1987, two months after he became chairman, the Fed lent tens of billions of dollars to financial institutions and pushed down overnight lending rates. The moves flooded financial markets with money, which helped them restore confidence. 
When terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, obliterating large parts of Wall Street's financial infrastructure, the Fed pumped $100 billion into the monetary system in four days. On Sept. 12 alone, the Fed lent banks $46 billion. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which runs the Fed's trading operations, flooded the banking system with additional billions by buying up Treasury securities at record volumes throughout the week. 
NO Fed chairman has had as much influence as Mr. Greenspan, but the key to that influence is his credibility in financial markets and with political leaders. Though his reputation has been tarnished since the stock market bubble burst in 2000, most economists still credit him with being early to recognize major turns in the economy and bold in his responses.
In 1994, he began gently raising interest rates in an effort to prevent the economy from overheating and to engineer a "soft landing" without a recession. By 1997, he was far ahead of the Fed's own economists in recognizing that American productivity growth had accelerated sharply, allowing the economy to grow at a considerably faster rate without causing inflation. His navigation of rate policy, many economists agree, helped to foster the longest economic expansion in American history.
"It was the most brilliant forecasting call I can think of in my entire career as a professional economist," said Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor at the time of that debate who acknowledged he was a "grudging" convert to Mr. Greenspan's views.
A large number of economists say Mr. Greenspan was too slow in recognizing the excesses of the "new economy" in the stock market bubble. But many say Mr. Greenspan was alert in recognizing the economic slowdown that began in early 2001.
Since then, the Fed has lowered interest rates 12 times and reduced its benchmark federal funds rate to the lowest level in 41 years. 
So far, Mr. Greenspan's policies have dovetailed fairly well with President Bush's goals. When talk of war escalated last year, raising anxiety levels in business and among investors, the Fed reduced the federal funds rate in November by an additional one-half percentage point, to 1.25 percent from 1.75.
But that decision only focused more attention on how the Fed will respond to events in coming months.
Fed officials are far less worried about the impact of high oil prices now than they were during the Persian Gulf war. Back then, fears about inflation were still widespread and the Fed felt much greater pressure to respond to higher oil prices with an increase in interest rates. 
Today, inflation expectations are extremely low; in fact, there is more fear of possible deflation. Even if oil prices move up, Mr. Greenspan has made it clear that the Fed could easily reduce interest rates further, without causing inflation.
On March 18, one day before President Bush ordered the bombing of Iraq to begin, the Fed declared that uncertainties about Iraq had made it too difficult to assess the "balance of risks" to the economy.
Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly expressed optimism that business and investor confidence will rebound as soon as shooting subsides in Iraq. But minutes from the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee suggest that many other Fed officials, expecting a war, were both baffled and anxious.
"Indeed, a number of members commented that it was possible that some easing of geopolitical tensions would not lead to a major near-term upturn in business confidence," the committee reported, adding that economic growth could turn out to be either much higher or much lower than expected. 
The Fed could face uncomfortable choices regardless of whether the United States achieves a quick victory.
If the war goes badly, depressing business confidence further and tilting the country toward a new recession, the Fed has only so much room for cutting interest rates, since it cannot reduce the federal funds rate for overnight loans to below zero.
But Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials insist that even if the overnight Fed funds rate is zero, they still have tools to stimulate the economy. They would do so by buying up longer-term Treasury securities, such as two-year or five-year or even 10-year securities. By paying cash for such securities, the Fed would essentially be pumping money into the economy and pushing long-term interest rates even lower than they already are.
Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor who is now a senior economic adviser with Schwab Capital Markets, said that the Fed could push 30-year mortgage rates as low as 2.5 percent. 
"They would have to be ready to stand by and buy every 10-yearTreasury security that anybody wants to sell them at that rate, and they would have to persist until they have long-term success," Mr. Gramley said. "We're talking about massive increases of liquidity into the system."
But the Fed has almost no experience with that kind of effort, and officials acknowledged that the precise impact might prove unpredictable.
There are scores of other issues. The Fed's easy-money policies have already stoked a storm of home buying and refinancing, prompting consumers to convert the equity in their homes to cash to buy furniture, appliances and cars. But this easy money has done nothing to rejuvenate business spending, and a growing number of economists suspect that war jitters are not the only reason.
"The Fed is powerful, but it's powerful over the long term," said Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and author of a voluminous new history of the Federal Reserve. "The mistake comes in thinking that they can turn things around quickly."
But the White House may face problems from the Fed if the war in Iraq turns out exactly as administration officials hope. Assuming that a quick victory helps to revive business confidence and the stock markets, Fed officials have already made it clear that they would soon need to start raising interest rates to thwart inflation.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corporation, predicted that the Fed could start raising rates just as the presidential election campaign heats up. 
"It's going to take a lot of skill, and it's going to take some conflict between the administration and the Fed," added Mr. Meltzer, noting that Fed monetary policy has been relaxed for a long time and that rapidly rising federal budget deficits create added pressures on the Fed to tighten up. 
Mr. Greenspan has provided no hint of whether he wants to continue after his term as Fed chairman expires. Because of the peculiarities of rules governing terms on the Fed board, Mr. Greenspan's term as a governor does not actually expire until 2006. That raises the perplexing possibility of Mr. Greenspan staying on as a governor even if the White House wants a new chairman. 
People who know Mr. Greenspan -- and who emphasize that they have no direct information -- say they believe he wants to remain chairman at least until 2006. Most of the speculation about possible successors centers on Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Ronald Reagan.
Others mentioned as possible successors are John B. Taylor, a respected monetary economist who is now deputy secretary of the Treasury; and R. Glenn Hubbard, who stepped down recently as chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and returned to Columbia University.
Still, none of the names have generated much excitement among Fed watchers and most analysts believe the Bush administration will not focus on the issue until the war with Iraq is over.
WHAT is most striking is the White House's refusal to criticize Mr. Greenspan publicly, even when he upsets it with disparaging remarks about the administration's contention that the country needs big tax cuts. Shortly after Mr. Greenspan expressed skepticism during a Senate hearing last month, Robert Novak, the conservative columnist, quoted unidentified White House officials as saying that Mr. Greenspan might not be nominated for another term as chairman.
But administration officials quickly put out the word that they were not at all unhappy with Mr. Greenspan, and that they held him in the highest regard. 
Whether or not that is true, the behavior is in sharp contrast to that of top officials in the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration, who routinely and publicly criticized Fed decisions that displeased them.
David M. Jones, an economist and author of many books on the Fed, said Mr. Greenspan's importance in world markets and his close ties to people like Mr. Cheney meant that Mr. Greenspan still had control over his future.
"I think the most important person in deciding the successor of Alan Greenspan," Mr. Jones said, "will be Alan Greenspan."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Russia Sees a Chance To Get Some Respect

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
PUT yourself for a minute in President Vladimir V. Putin's loafers. Russia's economic revival and global status, not to mention your own political fortunes, hang in no small part on your much-vaunted partnership with the United States. But with the next presidential election barely a year away, about all most Russians see in the romance is a nuclear weapons treaty you resisted, NATO forces on your European doorstep and American military bases in what was once your southern empire.
 Now the Americans are ignoring your protests and invading Iraq, the only Middle Eastern nation where you still have serious political and economic clout. Ordinary Russians are pouring Coca-Cola down the sewers, and your generals and oil barons are hopping mad. What's a president to do? 
 Some influential Russians are now starting to say that the best thing that could happen to Mr. Putin -- and maybe to the partnership -- might be for the United States invasion of Iraq to go badly.
Not to fail. Just to fumble enough that average Russians could take some pleasure in Washington's public humbling. And enough that Washington would think twice before going it alone again.
Such speculation is not rooted in Russian delight at the prospect of an American comeuppance, though that is surely on the rise. It is in a dry-eyed calculation of Russia's strategic interests, which include an increasingly close relationship with Washington, war or not.
Sergei M. Rogov, the director of the Institute for the Study of the U.S. and Canada here, said the diplomatic damage from the American decision to invade Iraq over Russian objections already has been wrought, and will take years to mend. The potential for further injury now, he said, is that the invasion will succeed too well.
"If America decides to repeat the Iraqi precedent," he said, "the fragile Russian-American partnership will fall apart for good."
The operative word is fragile. 
At the very top, Mr. Putin and President Bush still talk of a growing partnership. But the facts increasingly speak otherwise: on most major strategic issues resolved since Sept. 11, 2001, Russia has resisted, then grudgingly accepted, American dictates that it has been powerless to change.
Even where interests coincide, as in the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia, where American advisers are helping root out terrorist bands active in neighboring Chechnya, United States involvement is seen as much as a calculated intrusion on Russian turf as an aid. That was clear last week when Russia complained for the second time in a month about flights by American U-2 spy planes in Georgia, near the Russian border.
The United States expressed similar public pique last week when it angrily accused the Kremlin of allowing arms merchants to sell Iraq sophisticated electronic jamming devices in defiance of an arms embargo. Separately, American officials acknowledged that the devices had probably already been destroyed in combat and were therefore useless.
Some of the Russian barbs are clearly meant to stoke nationalism, this country's great unifying force, as an election campaign starts to gear up. 
But to a degree that neither side may yet fully realize, the Moscow-Washington sniping raises the grave question of whether the two partners really do have enough in common, beyond a hatred and fear of terror, to sustain their romance.
Which is what generates the gut feeling among Russian experts that what the American-Russian relationship needs most is a United States with less sharp elbows. What was envisioned here -- a true global partnership against truly evil forces -- has become, in the Russian view, one-sided.
It is not that Russians wish Saddam Hussein well, for a majority see him as a dictator in need of his own comeuppance. Rather, the view is that Russia, with genuine if reduced global influence, must be regarded not as a Potemkin partner in the new world order, but as a real one, with real power.
By that way of thinking, a painless American victory in Iraq would only reinforce the notion that Russia does not matter to Washington -- and right now, to bruised Russian egos, that would be the worst outcome of all.

Politics Shapes the Battlefield in Iraq

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
"HE that makes war without many mistakes has not made war very long."
 So said Napoleon, whose first military discovery was that deadly sprays of artillery-fired grapeshot were more effective than cannonballs in subduing the royalist mobs storming the Tuileries in Paris in 1795. It was, in its way, an early version of the "shock and awe" approach to war. 
 In Iraq, military experts predicted that intensive bombing at principal military installations, combined with a lightning quick thrust by a lean force to the gates of Baghdad, might cow the Iraqis into surrendering, ousting Saddam Hussein and welcoming coalition forces as liberators. 
But the war in Iraq opened with a less than overwhelming force on the ground -- and, it turned out, a less than broadly applied bombing campaign from the air. Whether or not these decisions turn out to have been a mistake, one thing is clear: According to those participating in the decisions, both the original plan and the changes made to it were driven not by military tactics alone, but by the politics swirling around a war that is opposed and hated by much if not most of the world.
With the war now stalemated at least temporarily, some experts say the original plan cannot be judged to have failed for a simple reason -- it was not tried. 
The bombing has been less than fully aggressive, because of fears of killing civilians and destroying wide swaths of the country, deepening international opposition to the war. 
And the ground war has been hampered because Turkey did not accept its role as host of the northern front forces, again for political reasons. Its government was too weak in the face of antiwar feeling.
Military experts say President Bush and his military advisers now face a decision: whether to build up forces more rapidly and step up the bombing of Baghdad and other cities to bring the war to a more swift conclusion, even if that incurs greater wrath overseas, especially in Arab countries. 
"If this war bogs down further, a lot of factors will come into play, and you can't divide the military from the political," said William E. Odom, former head of the National Security Agency and a retired lieutenant general.
"The dilemma is whether to kill more people in order to bring the war to a quick conclusion, making people angry abroad, or string the war out and risk losing support here at home."
Almost everyone knows one of the most famous axioms about this dilemma, from Karl von Clausewitz: war is the extension of politics by other means.
Applied to Iraq, it raises the question of whether a war aimed at achieving political objectives -- ousting a regime and instilling an economically viable pro-Western democracy as a model for the region -- engages in tactics that undermine this very purpose.
Advisers to any modern president waging a war are likely to say it is a mistake to let politics interfere. 
Look at what happened when President Lyndon B. Johnson himself selected bombing targets in Vietnam because he was afraid of waging a war so ruthless that it might outrage Americans and antagonize Russia and China, bringing them more directly into the fight.
A generation of generals concluded that the military had its hands tied in Vietnam, and thus lost the war, because of politics.
But others say that trying to separate political considerations from war is unrealistic. Johnson's restraint made sense in the context of the time, says Eliot A. Cohen, author of "Supreme Command," a book about wartime leadership.
Johnson was haunted by the experience of President Harry S. Truman, who dismissed Gen. Douglas MacArthur for disobeying his orders and making a foray into North Korea that provoked the Chinese to intervene.
Now the inseparability of politics and war is on display again.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was one general who believed that politics had too much influence in Vietnam, and his so-called Powell Doctrine held that the United States should never again start a military enterprise without overwhelming force.
But that doctrine was challenged long before the current battle for Iraq. In 1990, for example, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Mr. Powell, then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, presented the first President George Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney with a proposal to oust the Iraqis with a show of force substantially larger than was eventually used.
"I was not happy with the briefing," recalled Brent Scowcroft, then the national security adviser, in the memoirs he wrote with the first President Bush. "It sounded unenthusiastic, delivered by people who didn't want to do the job."
In 1991, Mr. Cheney and his aides devised a lightning strike at Iraqi troops from the west. It was generally regarded as a military success despite the decision, stemming from political constraints, to stop, letting large numbers of Iraqi Republican Guards escape and leaving Saddam Hussein in power.
Similarly, in the current war, Vice President Cheney and his longtime friend, Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary, rejected military plans for a larger force to oust Mr. Hussein. Instead, they settled on a modest initial force, combined with precision bombing, that would be a "rolling start," paving the way for greater forces if needed.
Their decision to use a ground force less than half the size of the coalition forces in 1991 was made for several reasons, administration officials say.
First, those officials said, Mr. Rumsfeld again thought the generals' call for overwhelming force reflected uneasiness about the war itself. Second, he wanted to prove that a newly transformed armed force, relying on technology and creative tactics, could work better than a blunderbuss approach.
But third, some in the administration say, was a concern at the Pentagon that the war would be a hard sell to the public and the world if it would take an enormous force.
IT is far too early to say whether that view was right or wrong.
But what no one counted on was how the Iraqis would apply their own military strategy dictated by politics. 
Instead of destroying their own country and torching oil fields to slow down the coalition forces' advance, they left them largely intact in an effort to convince the world that they were innocent victims. 
The Iraqis surprised American commanders by keeping some of their special forces in the south to attack from the rear, hoping to slow the attack, create an impasse and inspire frightened Middle East nations to demand a cease-fire.
"What to the Americans was shock and awe designed to force them into capitulation has become shocking and appalling to much of the world that's looking at it," said John W. Dower, a historian of World War II.
While the United States was planning its spectacular bombing campaign, in other words, the Iraqis were planning a campaign that looked as if it was based on Clausewitz.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
The End of Taxes as We Know Them

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
IN the economy as well as in Iraq, the White House is aiming for regime change.
 "The president concluded we needed a package of tax relief of sufficient size to move the needle on the economy," Pamela F. Olson, the assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, said on Wednesday. "Tinkering around the edges won't do that. Small won't do that." 
 But tax relief does not begin to describe the fundamental changes the White House wants to make in how the economy and the government are run, and how revenue is raised. To achieve its goals, the Bush administration has turned to supply-side economics, which advocates removing taxes that are held to discourage people from working and investing their savings in the private sector. This may cause government to lose revenue in the short term, the argument goes, but faster economic growth will ultimately erase any deficits that result. 
The experience of the Reagan administration, however, famously left supply-side theory open to debate. Though tax rates were cut across the board, military spending increases helped to create enormous deficits in the 1980's. This swamped whatever supply-side benefits the tax cuts might have had, forcing the Treasury to borrow huge sums -- money that business might otherwise have used for investments.
There is still debate among economists about whether Reaganomics was successful in the long term, and President Bush is proposing changes that dwarf those enacted by Mr. Reagan. Like Mr. Reagan, who was fighting to defeat the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush too is trying to win a war -- in this case a hot one -- while enacting supply-side economic policies. And once again, the dual pressures on the government's budget have attracted criticism.
Last week, Mr. Bush asked Congress for $75 billion to pay for the war in Iraq, a request that some Democrats said was only a down payment on the eventual costs. Occupying and rebuilding Iraq could cost $30 billion in each of the next few years, according to estimates from institutions as various as the United Nations Development Program and Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group.
It was the threat of worsening deficits, rather than the supply-side principle itself, that was at issue last week when three Republicans joined Senate Democrats to halve the administration's proposal for a tax cut worth $726 billion in the next 10 years.
"I think all of us realize that this is a long-term commitment that we're making to bring stability to that region of the world, and it's going to cost some money," Senator George V. Voinovich, an Ohio Republican and a co-sponsor of the amendment to reduce the tax cut, said on Tuesday. "We should be looking down the road to see where are we going to be getting to a balanced budget."
Because the House of Representatives had already agreed to Mr. Bush's proposal in its entirety, the two houses must now reach a compromise. Even the Senate's plan would mean tax cuts of $350 billion -- enough to carry out some of the White House's goals -- and the compromise figure may be considerably larger.
When the administration's previous cuts in income and investment taxes became law in 2001, they were projected to cost the government more than a trillion dollars through 2010. Still, they left the tax system largely intact. That would not be the case under Mr. Bush's latest budget proposal, which could eliminate almost all taxes on investment income and wealth for almost all Americans, in an ambitious attempt to raise the amount of investment capital available to business.
The White House strategy has three parts. The first and most hotly debated is ending taxes on many stock dividends. The second is arguably more important: the establishment of tax-free saving accounts, which could quickly shelter most families' entire portfolios from taxes. A family of four could move $60,000 worth of investments into the accounts each year. Finally, discarding the estate tax would take away the last tax on the most affluent Americans' wealth.
Last month, the administration officials said the White House would not lobby for the tax-free accounts until the fall. But Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, vowed last week that Congress would take it up after the current budget debate. A fourth part of the plan, which would make private investment accounts a part of Social Security, was not proposed this year. But the White House is continuing to promote the idea, in the face of widespread criticism.
If adopted, the first three parts would essentially replace the current income tax system with a tax on paychecks. Bigger investment portfolios would no longer come with bigger tax bills, so the tax burden would shift toward those whose income comes from wages.
Allowing investors to keep more of their money, supporters of the cuts say, would lead to a permanent expansion in available capital. Its cost to corporations would fall, and they in turn would spend more on new initiatives, creating new jobs. This would help the economy grow faster for at least several years. 
But that outcome is far from certain. The most recent assessment of the nation's finances came in a report released last week by the director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, who was chief economist of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers until last month. His report estimated that the president's budget would add $2.7 trillion to projected deficits over the next decade and might actually depress corporate investment.
Even omitting the war's costs, it would be the deepest run of deficits since the early 1990's, when Mr. Bush's father was left to deal with the fiscal hangover from the Reagan years. By 2013, the budget office predicted, the Treasury would have almost twice as much debt with the president's plan -- about one third of gross domestic product -- as it would without the plan. And the red ink could grow if Congress undertook costly reforms of Social Security and Medicare.
Like most wholesale changes in economic policy, the Bush administration's steps represent a giant gamble. Would the benefits justify the risks? 
THE administration says that its policies will lead to faster growth in the short term and higher living standards in the long term, and that the deficits are a small price worth paying. But even some conservative economists disagree.
"I don't have any trouble borrowing if we're fighting a real system-threatening war, and I don't have any trouble with borrowing if we're engaged in a real capital-building program," said William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute and a former acting chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. "But I don't think any of those apply right now."
Dissents like Mr. Niskanen's are having trouble being heard, however, above the din of the war. And therein lies a surprising result: the cost of the war in Iraq may dim enthusiasm in Congress for big tax cuts, but if it lasts long enough to overshadow debate on the details of Mr. Bush's economic program, the war abroad could actually help him win his battle for regime change at home.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE MOOD; 
As a Quick Victory Grows Less Likely, Doubts Are Quietly Voiced in Washington

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
After 10 days of watching smart bombs, sandstorms and stiff resistance from the Iraqi regime, a capital that usually embraces the president and his strategy in wartime is beginning to show fissures.
 Few have openly split with the president, or the decisions made so far. But one does not have to scratch deep to hear the doubts. 
 There are the Central Intelligence Agency analysts, quietly complaining that their warnings that Saddam Hussein's government might not crack like peanut brittle were dismissed. There are ex-generals on nightly television, expressing unease about a plan that relied more on speed than on numbers, and that seemed overly dependent on welcoming cheers from the Iraqis. There are field commanders like Lt. Gen. William Wallace, whose public complaints of an enemy that was "different from the one we'd war-gamed against" set off alarm bells and denials at Central Command. 
There are the terse comments of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who, in an interview on Friday, declined to say whether the Iraq war planners were in danger of violating the famed "Powell doctrine" -- the use of overwhelming force. He assured two visitors to his office that he was certain the Pentagon would, in time, "bring decisive force to bear" -- and then changed the subject.
And there are Democrats who chafe about the war's progress but will not say so publicly. Acutely aware that their Senate leader, Tom Daschle, walked into a hornet's nest two weeks ago when he suggested that the war itself was the inevitable result of failed diplomacy, they measure every word.
"No one is going to make that mistake again," said one veteran Democrat. Still, plenty of Democrats recognize that Mr. Bush has staked his presidency on success in Iraq, and suspect that a war that is lengthy and costly, combined with a weak economy, could be their ticket back to power. So they will not hold their fire for long.
Finally, there is a White House that is scrounging for evidence that it warned the nation all along that this could be a long slog, even in the face of predictions by Vice President Dick Cheney and others that, in all likelihood, the war would be quick and that "the streets in Basra and Baghdad are sure to erupt in joy."
Mr. Cheney may yet prove to be right, the White House says, but 10 days into the war there is a recognition that the enthusiasm of the hawks got out of control.
"There were very high expectations about the conduct of the war and enormous confidence in the military forces; we've all had drummed into us how superior they are," said Lee Hamilton, the former Democratic head of the House International Relations Committee. 
"Then you run into difficulties," he said. "And that creates a reaction all over town."
On Friday morning, Democratic critics of the White House were circulating e-mail containing the most optimistic prewar quotes from prominent hawks. 
So it was not surprising that when Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, appeared in the press room, he was armed and ready for a barrage of critical questions.
Mr. Fleischer was asked about Mr. Cheney's statement 12 days ago that the war should be over in "weeks rather than months." The press secretary reached for the vice president's next sentence that there could be "complications you can't anticipate" and also dug out a speech Mr. Bush gave Oct. 7 in Cincinnati, wherehe said, "Military conflict could be difficult." Yet as one senior administration official conceded: "We got ourselves in the bind that before the president decided to go to war, he couldn't dwell much on the risks. And after we were at war, it seemed a little late."
All this has left Mr. Bush unfazed, his aides insist. Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said the president did not spend much time worrying about how the war is portrayed and picked apart each day. "His general message in this has been, 'patience, we've seen this kind of coverage before; keep your eye on what's important,' " Mr. Bartlett said. 
Mr. Bush is hardly the first president to encounter such doubts over the conduct of war.
When the Mexican-American War broke out, President James Polk was constantly harassed by opponents. Chief among his tormentors was a one-term congressman named Abraham Lincoln. 
"Lincoln kept raising all these doubts -- why did the war start? -- but he went on to say he supported all the boys at the front," said David Donald, a Lincoln biographer. "It's where the Democrats are today."
Much the same happened in the Spanish-American War. Mark Twain called President William McKinley's war "a mess, a quagmire," and wrote that "there must be two Americas: one that sets the captive free," and one that occupies the captive's land in the name of freedom.
Polk and McKinley did not have to live with what Senator John McCain this week called "real-time war," where "every ambush, every explosion in Baghdad has an effect that it might not if it were taken in context." Viewers now get live video-phone pictures of the troops as they stop to sleep and await resupply. The result, Mr. McCain said, "has also contributed to any feeling of impatience."
So has the fact that defectors have been in surprisingly short supply. Even if the Iraqi government collapses in three weeks, or three months, the war is unlikely to be remembered as an easy struggle. 
"It was hubris to go on Fox News and proclaim the war would be a cakewalk," one former aide to the first President Bush said. "The gods were bound to hear it."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Bush Peril: Shifting Sand and Fickle Opinion

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29 

 BODY:
Though the scion of a family steeped in politics and public service, George W. Bush remains a young president who came to the White House with relatively limited knowledge of the world and its ills. Yet for two years he has ridden high in public esteem, thanks to confident leadership after Sept. 11 and a surer political touch than his detractors give him credit for.
 Is his luck about to turn in the winds and sands of Iraq? 
 It is quite true, as administration officials say with metronomic regularity, that coalition forces have scored singular successes in the early days of the war, and it is too early to rule out a speedy conclusion. But there have been military surprises and diplomatic shortfalls. 
With every passing day, it is more evident that the failure to obtain permission from Turkey for American troops to cross its territory and open a northern front constituted a diplomatic debacle. With every passing day, it is more evident that the allies made two gross military misjudgments in concluding that coalition forces could safely bypass Basra and Nasiriya and that Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq would rise up against Saddam Hussein.
Already, the commander of American ground forces in the war zone has conceded that the war that they are fighting is not the one they and their officers had foreseen. "Shock and awe" neither shocked nor awed. 
Other potential perils lie ahead. Among senior Washington political figures of both parties, four are mentioned most, as follows:
The war could last so long that the American public loses patience, having been conditioned by predictions from American officials (to quote one of them, Vice President Dick Cheney) that Mr. Hussein's government would prove to be "a house of cards." This has not happened yet; the polls indicate that nearly three of four Americans remain unshaken in their support of Mr. Bush's war policies, despite surprises on the battlefield. The White House believes that public patience, often fickle in recent years, was fortified by 9/11.
Street-by-street fighting in the rubble of Baghdad and other cities -- an eventuality that American strategists have long sought to avoid -- now looks more likely. Mr. Hussein's aides have promised savage resistance. If it materializes, it could produce large coalition casualties, challenging American resolve, and equally large Iraqi civilian casualties, with dire consequences for the coalition's attempt to picture itself as the liberator of Iraq. A heart-rending picture of a wounded 2-year-old was widely published today after a Baghdad market was ripped apart by an explosion Iraqi officials attributed to a coalition bomb.
Saddam Hussein could escape, denying the war effort a definitive totem of victory. It sounds improbable, given the terrifying array of force available to the coalition, but other notorious figures remain at large despite intensive manhunts, including the wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the Qaeda mastermind, Osama bin Laden.
The hunt for weapons of mass destruction could prove futile -- a development that would make the war look like a wild-goose chase.
Of course, all that is a worst case prognosis. As the war in Afghanistan showed, hard military slogging can give way suddenly to victory. But will victory in Iraq take the shape the United States so badly needs?
Mr. Hussein seems to have decided that he can turn this war into Vietnam Redux. He appears willing to take casualties and to give away territory to gain time. Over time, his strategy implies, he thinks he can isolate the United States and build a coalition of third world nations. Already he is seen as less of an ogre and more of a defender of Islamic honor across the Arab world.
Most Republicans radiate confidence in not only military but also political and diplomatic success.
The longtime Republican pollster Robert Teeter said recently, "If we've gotten rid of Saddam and stabilized Iraq, then things will look pretty good." Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, steadfast in his argument that that is precisely what will happen, told the naysayers on Friday that "it's a bit early for history to be written."
Democrats are more dubious.
"Saddam won't win," said Richard C. Holbrooke, the former United States representative at the United Nations. "Unlike L.B.J. in Vietnam, Bush won't quit. He's a different kind of Texan. He'll escalate and keep escalating. In the end his military strategy will probably succeed in destroying Saddam.
"But it may result in a Muslim jihad against us and our friends. Achieving our narrow objective of regime change may take so long and trigger so many consequences that it's no victory at all. Our ultimate goal, which is promoting stability in the Middle East, may well prove elusive."
Mr. Bush came to office determined, by his own account, not to swagger and not to overreach. "If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us," he said in the second presidential debate against Al Gore in 2000. "If we're a humble nation but strong, they'll welcome us." That was a promise to check hubris at the door, an effort to guard against the temptation to believe that because he had such awesome power at his fingertips, he could and should use it to achieve grandiose objectives.
Like remaking a chaotic region in our own democratic image. 
The very term "shock and awe" has a swagger to it, no doubt because it was intended to discourage Mr. Hussein and his circle. But it rings hollow now, and there are other signs of overconfidence. A reserve officer was told some time ago, for example, that he would be needed as part of a provisional government in Baghdad, on March 28.
For the moment, Mr. Bush seems secure. People like him. None of his possible Democratic opponents loom as a major threat, not so far.
Still, for presidents, especially for wartime leaders, political capital can drain quickly from the White House account. After the guns fall silent, voters' eyes turn elsewhere, often to social and economic needs. It happened to Winston Churchill late in World War II, and as this president remembers better than most, it happened to his father, too. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page news analysis article on Sunday about the political perils faced by President Bush over the war with Iraq misattributed a comment about Saddam Hussein's government being "a house of cards." While some American officials had used the phrase to predict a shorter conflict and a quick collapse of the Iraqi leadership, Vice President Dick Cheney was not among them.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: DAMASCUS; 
Syrian Party Watches Iraq With Unease and Ponders Its Own Fate

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, March 29 

 BODY:
The provincial Baath Party apparatchik, smoking a hookah in a downtown cafe, lowers his voice under the clack of the backgammon games around him and expresses the kind of criticism that still breeds fear of arrest. 
 "The party might be affected here," the middle-aged man said quietly when asked whether events in Iraq had any echo in Syria. "If things improve for the Iraqis, people will demand reform here, but if things get worse there, of course they won't." 
 In the Arab world, the American-led attack on Iraq generated near-universal condemnation, which grows more vociferous daily. Beyond the fighting, however, both governments and their populations wonder what will eventually emerge in postwar Iraq. 
Perhaps nowhere do the questions about what comes next generate a sharper sense of dread than in neighboring Syria, controlled since 1963 by a rival branch of the same Baath Party that grips Iraq. 
Syrian officials dismiss the notion of any possible effect of the war or any unease that their country might fall into United States sights next. But Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld made such a possibility explicit on Friday by saying Syria risked provoking American ire by allowing military equipment to flow into Iraq.
Syria denied the charge within hours -- unusual alacrity for an Arab government.
"The idea of de-Baathification and other such terms for the region is frightening for the regime," one Syrian professor said. "But the idea that Baath rule would collapse or be washed away is heartening for the intelligentsia."
When Bashar al-Assad, a 36-year-old Internet-savvy doctor, inherited the presidency from his father nearly three years ago, his inaugural address included a vision of a less officially controlled Syria, jettisoning the creaky socialist economy and allowing greater openness. 
But in the ensuing years it has become clearer that he did not mean dismantling the one-party police state his father built. The president revised his remarks in a speech this month, castigating some for interpreting his call for tolerance as a sign of weakness. 
Syria has proved remarkably resistant to change. For example, Mr. Assad issued a law in April 2001 allowing private banks. Not one has been able to cut through the bureaucratic thicket to go into business. Nine outspoken government critics have been silenced with jail terms of up to 10 years. 
In the latest prominent case involving the press, Ibrahim Hamidi, the Damascus correspondent for Al Hayat, one of the Arab world's best newspapers, disappeared into jail in December, accused of breaking Syria's press law by quoting supposed presidential remarks in closed meetings and writing about possible changes in the army. His trial is expected to be secret. 
Syrians undoubtedly hunger for a better life. Government officials say that it is coming and that replacing a system where essentially one man made every decision takes time, especially in the face of repeated regional crises.
"Any change, any reform, is connected to the regional situation," said Saadalla Agha al-Kalaa, the minister of tourism and one of the staunchest reformers brought into the cabinet by Mr. Assad. "I don't think the will for change will increase; the will needed is there."
The Iraq war could prove an especially harsh economic blow. Western governments said Syria received about 200,000 barrels of discounted oil daily from Iraq, shipments the government always denied receiving because they violated United Nations sanctions. 
That alone was worth some $1.5 billion annually in government savings, and Syria last year sold $2 billion in goods to Iraq, many of which it would be hard pressed to sell elsewhere. Thousands of Iraqi government employees were on prewar waiting lists for rickety Syrian kerosene heaters, for example, because they had no choice. The 100 trucks a day that left Syria at Al Tanef crossing alone have dwindled to none. 
It is the lack of any improvement in their lives, unlikely to improve with the war, that really grates. 
"Our standard of living has not changed at all," complained the provincial Baath Party man. He blames corruption for much of it, telling how his local elementary school principal was fired because the man refused to demand bribes from the students that local party hacks pocketed. 
Baath Party officials at all levels admit that rampant corruption and bureaucratic resistance is retarding reform. Even the most senior officials concede that a transformed Iraq might lessen the resistance to change. Some Syrians speculate, however, that it might make the security services more repressive. 
"The regime in Syria fears this war in Iraq because it might affect things here," said Haitham Maleh, a lawyer and human rightsactivist jailed for seven years as a political prisoner and now facing renewed charges of defaming the government. "They don't feel secure." 
Yet like all Syrians interviewed, he adamantly rejects any American role: "We hate the regime here because they are a dictatorship, but we don't agree with any power coming in from outside to change it." 
Syrians are convinced that the United States went to war in no small part because Israel found Iraq a threat. Seeing the way the Iraqis are fighting back, Syrian officials profess confidence that the United States will be preoccupied for far too long to worry about Iraq's neighbors. 
"Let's wait and see how long they will be in Iraq," said Buthaina Shaaban, the spokeswoman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry. "I think they will be in Iraq for a very long time."

A.L. East

NEW YORK YANKEES
Joe Torre, eighth season -- 2002: 103-58, first place
 If the Yankees don't win the World Series this season, it will mark the first time in 10 years that they will have played three complete seasons without a World Series championship. But first things first. 
 The Yankees, playing with the highest-paid collection of baseball players ever, a luxury-tax payroll that could reach $182 million, would have to take an extended vacation not to win their sixth successive division title. 
 The only uncertainty is the bullpen. Mariano Rivera displayed a human streak at times last year, and the Yankees shed the reliable Mike Stanton and Ramiro Mendoza. One of their replacements is Chris Hammond, who will be hard pressed to duplicate the 0.95 earned run average he compiled in 63 games for Atlanta last season.
 Another probable but unlikely reliever, at an $8 million salary, is Jose Contreras, the Cuban defector, who will have to wait for his turn to start.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Hideki Matsui, Jose Contreras
KEY LOSSES -- Mike Stanton, Ramiro Mendoza
KEY TO SEASON -- Winning will keep George Steinbrenner silent.

BOSTON RED SOX
Grady Little, second season -- 2002: 93-69, second place
 As if they don't take enough heat from their fans, the Red Sox have left themselves open to major second-guessing by passing up the chance to add Bartolo Colon to their starting rotation and by eschewing the traditional role of a bullpen closer.
 They preferred a still untested Casey Fossum to Colon, a 20-game winner, and they opted for a collection of relievers to do the job Ugueth Urbina did for them 40 times last season. They deserve time to see if their decisions work, but if they don't, if they can't reinvent the game, the Boston brain trust will become persona non grata among the Fenway faithful.
 Besides sorting out his relievers and slotting them into the right situations, Grady Little will have to keep track of all of the players he can choose from for first base, third base and designated hitter: Kevin Millar, David Ortiz, Jeremy Giambi, Shea Hillenbrand and Bill Mueller.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Mike Timlin, Ramiro Mendoza
KEY LOSSES -- Ugueth Urbina, Cliff Floyd
KEY TO SEASON -- Their schemes had better work, or it's back to the drawing board.

CLOSER Mix and match

TORONTO BLUE JAYS
Carlos Tosca, second season -- 2002: 78-84, third place
 The team that a decade ago won two consecutive World Series is still in the early stages of a major reconstruction project. It's a mixed project. The hitters are relatively young: center fielder Vernon Wells, designated hitter Josh Phelps and infielders Eric Hinske, Chris Woodward and Orlando Hudson have a combined six years of major league experience. But the new starting pitchers, Tanyon Sturtze and Cory Lidle, and the trio of catchers are 30-something.
 Roy Halladay, on the other hand, is only 25, and he has become a model of development for the others to follow. After several false starts, Halladay last season was 19-7 with a 2.93 E.R.A., and he led the A.L. in innings pitched with 239.
 The Blue Jays believe they are on the right track. It just might not be a fast track

KEY ADDITIONS -- Cory Lidle, Tanyon Sturtze
KEY LOSSES -- Jose Cruz Jr.
KEY TO SEASON -- Continued development by Wells (100 r.b.i.) and Hinske (84 r.b.i.) could make the Blue Jays at least a little interesting.

BALTIMORE ORIOLES
Mike Hargrove, fourth season -- 2002: 67-95, fourth place
 If two general managers are better than one, the Orioles should enjoy marked improvement this season. But it will probably take a little longer for the efforts of Jim Beattie and Mike Flanagan to pay off in drastic change in the team's fortunes.
 The Orioles have had losing records for five successive seasons. They have to go back to the mid-50's to find the last time that happened to the organization, which moved from St. Louis, where they were the hapless Browns, to Baltimore during that period. 
 The most promising sign from last season was the development of the team's No. 1 starter, Rodrigo Lopez (15-9), and its closer, Jorge Julio (25 saves). But the Orioles didn't have any other young pitchers ready to join that pair, so they took to the free-agent market and signed Omar Daal and Rick Helling. They signed another free agent, Deivi Cruz, to play shortstop.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Omar Daal, Rick Helling
KEY LOSS -- Chris Singleton
KEY TO SEASON -- If they can get the bad taste of last season's finish, 32 losses in 36 games, out of their system, maybe the Orioles could at least improve on their overall record.

TAMPA BAY DEVIL RAYS
Lou Piniella, first season -- 2002: 55-106, fifth place
 A general manager's wife once said, "I married George for better or worse but not for lunch." Anita Piniella has husband Lou for lunch.
 When he asked out of the last year of his Seattle contract and said he wanted to be closer to home, he didn't mean Tampa Bay, but the Mariners made sure they took him literally. As a result, one of the game's better managers is stuck with its worst team.
 Piniella will have the youngest and lowest-paid team and very likely the team with the worst record. The question is, will he have his sanity when the season ends?
 The new manager's goal is to break the 70-victory barrier, something the Devil Rays have not done in their five-year existence. He will try to do it with young pitchers like Nick Bierbrodt and a young center fielder like Rocco Baldelli.

KEY ADDITION -- Lou Piniella

A.L. Central

CHICAGO WHITE SOX
Jerry Manuel, sixth season -- 2002: 81-81, second place
 If they reach the playoffs, the White Sox players might want to vote the Red Sox front office a post-season share. The White Sox have Bartolo Colon because the Red Sox fended off the Expos' attempts to trade him to Boston. 
The presence of Colon, a 20-game winner last season with Cleveland and Montreal, gives the starting rotation far more credibility than it had with only Mark Buehrle, a 19-game winner, as a consistently effective starter. Getting Billy Koch as their closer in another trade also enhances the chances of eclipsing the Twins and playing beyond September.
 Should Frank Thomas rediscover the menacing bat that produced career highs of 43 home runs and 143 r.b.i. three seasons ago and combine his production with that of Magglio Ordonez (career highs 38, 135 last season), the White Sox will give the Twins more competition than they would like.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Bartolo Colon, Billy Koch, Tom Gordon
KEY LOSSES -- Keith Foulke, Todd Ritchie
KEY TO SEASON -- If Colon and Buehrle get help from their fellow starters, the division could have a spirited race for first.

MINNESOTA TWINS
Ron Gardenhire, second season -- 2002: 94-67, first place
 A year ago the Twins, as contraction targets, were frustrated because they didn't know how much longer they would be in existence. Now, as defending division champions, they are frustrated because they feel they squandered a chance to go to the World Series. 
 If a blown lead in the seventh inning of the fifth game of a four-of-seven-game series can inspire the Twins this season, they could be even tougher to beat. 
 They have basically the same team, young but with the added experience of another season and a post-season. Eric Milton, an important member of the starting rotation, is out, possibly for the season, with a knee injury, but the Twins uncharacteristically signed Kenny Rogers as a free agent to replace him.
 Offensively, the Twins could use some improvement. They were the only A.L. playoff team without a hitter who drove in 100 runs or batted better than .300.

KEY ADDITION -- Kenny Rogers
KEY LOSS -- David Ortiz
KEY TO SEASON -- They could repeat if their starting pitchers stay healthy and effective.

CLEVELAND INDIANS
Eric Wedge, first season -- 2002: 74-88, third place
 A team in transition, the Indians could be surprisingly competitive, or they could have growing pains and fare no better than they did last season, the first of their decline from division-title status.
 Omar Vizquel is the only regular who remains from those championship seasons, but he isn't looking to go elsewhere. He wants to finish his career with the Indians, and he only hopes they become contenders again before he is finished.
 Instead of joining Albert Belle, Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton and Jim Thome in winning championships, Vizquel is prepared to join Travis Hafner, Ben Broussard, Brandon Phillips and Josh Bard. 
 The Indians are also working young pitchers into their rotation. They have Ricardo Rodriguez and Jason Davis at the start and Brian Tallett in waiting.
 But the players aren't the only youthful part of the new Indians. Eric Wedge, the new manager, is only 35.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Jason Bere, Brian Anderson
KEY LOSS -- Jim Thome
KEY TO SEASON -- The young Indians will determine how far the team goes.

KANSAS CITY ROYALS
Tony Pena, second season -- 2002: 62-100, fourth
 They are shedding payroll so that they can get better. That's what the Royals say, though what they say has been viewed skeptically.
 If they are better this season, the improvement is likely to be the result of the passion and enthusiasm of their manager, Tony Pena, who took over in midseason last year.
 Because the plan is to reduce the payroll to $37 million by the trading deadline, July 31, Carlos Beltran and Joe Randa may not be with the team by or beyond that date. They both can be free agents after the season, and the Royals can more easily dump their salaries than they can win games.
 The young players will remain, that is, as long as they do a creditable job: pitchers Runelvys Hernandez, Jeremy Affeldt, Miguel Asencio and Chris George, for example, and designated hitter Ken Harvey.

KEY ADDITIONS -- None
KEY LOSSES -- Paul Byrd, Jeff Suppan, Roberto Hernandez
KEY TO SEASON -- Their young players will have to swim fast and furiously for the Royals to keep their heads above water.

DETROIT TIGERS
Alan Trammell, first season -- 2002: 55-106, fifth place
 The Tigers will go down in history as the epitome of a team that squandered the benefits of a new park. In three seasons at Comerica Park, the Tigers have watched their attendance plummet from 2.5 million to 1.9 million to 1.15 million. 
 At the rate they're going, the Tigers won't reverse the trend because their fans know a dreadful team when they see one. The fans couldn't be blamed for wondering when the expansion team came to town.
 In the interest of saving money, the Tigers gave up their two best hitters from last season, Robert Fick and Randall Simon, and for hitting this season look to young players like Carlos Pena, Ramon Santiago, Brandon Inge, Gene Kingsale and Eric Munson.
 Young pitchers will also be important: Mike Maroth, Nate Cornejo, Jeremy Bonderman and Gary Knotts.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Gene Kingsale
KEY LOSSES -- Robert Fick, Randall Simon, Mark Redman

ANAHEIM ANGELS
Mike Scioscia, fourth season -- 2002: 99-63, second place, wild card
 Some baseball people were still shaking their heads this spring. "That was a very hot baseball team and a very disciplined and well-managed baseball team; they were the epitome of getting on a roll," said Ron Gardenhire, whose Minnesota Twins lost to the Angels one step short of the World Series.
 The Angels have kept their championship team intact, but if they again contend this season, as they are expected to do, they won't surprise anyone; after all, they finished 41 games back the previous season.
 They could be stronger this season because of two pitchers: John Lackey, who was 9-4 after joining the rotation June 30, then was the winning pitcher in Game 7 of the World Series, and Francisco Rodriguez, the young reliever who was a postseason sensation, striking out 28 in 18 innings and gaining five victories.

KEY ADDITIONS -- None
KEY LOSSES -- None

OAKLAND ATHLETICS
Ken Macha, first season -- 2002: 103-59, first place
 Looking back, the Athletics are frustrated because just when they thought it was safe to go to the first round of the playoffs without having to play the Yankees, they encountered the Twins and lost.
 Looking ahead, they are frustrated because their owner has already said that for economic reasons this is the last season they will have Miguel Tejada, their terrific shortstop, who last season had career highs with a .308 batting average, 34 home runs and 131 R.B.I.
 That prospect would seem to make it all the more urgent for Ken Macha, who replaced Art Howe as manager, to find a way to get beyond the first round, no matter whom they play. Tejada, Eric Chavez (34 homers, 109 r.b.i.) and the three pitchers, Barry Zito (23-5), Mark Mulder (19-7) and Tim Hudson (15-9) should ensure that they at least get to the playoffs.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Keith Foulke, Erubiel Durazo
KEY LOSSES -- Billy Koch, Ray Durham
KEY TO SEASON -- Keith Foulke, who was acquired for Billy Koch in another economic move, has to do the job that Koch did as the closer (44 saves).

SEATTLE MARINERS
Bob Melvin, first season -- 2002: 93-69, third place
 In leaving the Mariners after managing them for 10 years, Lou Piniella said his one regret was that he didn't get Seattle to the World Series. If the Mariners couldn't attain that goal under Piniella, who won a World Series with Cincinnati, can they expect to do it with Bob Melvin as their rookie manager?
 Melvin, bench coach with 2001 World Series champion Arizona, begins basically with the same team Piniella had in his last season. That team, in first place midway through August, stumbled in the final weeks, losing its lead and 17 of 27 games in a monthlong stretch.
 If the Mariners lost anything with Piniella's departure, it brought them Randy Winn, who the last few years has been developing into a solid hitter and should make a strong lineup even stronger. Piniella left behind Bryan Price, the pitching coach to whom he attributed the team's pitching success.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Randy Winn

TEXAS RANGERS
Buck Showalter, first year -- 2002:72-90, fourth place
 Given that the Rangers finished 31 games from first last season, Buck Showalter, the new manager, was asked this spring if they could duplicate the Angels' surprising ascent from a 41-game deficit last year.
 "They had something at their disposal from their track record that we're hoping some people become," Showalter said. In other words, the Rangers don't enter the season with the talent the Angels had, so don't expect any huge surprises.
 Showalter has neither the kind of hitters nor the pitching that Mike Scioscia had at his disposal. The Rangers continue to try to improve their pitching, but they still have a long way to go with their starting rotation. Ismael Valdes (8-12 with Texas and Seattle) and John Thomson (9-14 with Colorado and the Mets) are the primary acquisitions.
 They did enhance their relief corps by adding Ugueth Urbina (40 saves with Boston last year) and Esteban Yan (19 with Tampa Bay).

KEY ADDITIONS -- Ismael Valdes, Ugueth Urbina
KEY LOSSES -- Ivan Rodriguez, Kenny Rogers
KEY TO SEASON -- Unless Showalter works some magic, they remain the fourth team in a three-team race.

Plum Island Strikers Give Up Picketing

BYLINE:  By John Rather 

 BODY:
Saying they have run out of time and money, striking workers at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center have stopped seven months of picketing at an Orient Point ferry terminal that connects to the high-security island laboratory.
 The end of the picketing appeared to signal that the strikers, 76 members of International Union of Operating Engineers Local 30, are losing hope they will regain jobs now held by replacement workers. 
 LB&B Associates of Columbia, Md., which holds a maintenance contract at the government-owned laboratory, hired the replacements after the union went on strike for higher wages in August.
In December, the union agreed to a strike settlement that provided no increases. But the settlement fell apart when LB&B insisted that replacement workers would remain, denying all but a handful of the striking workers their former jobs back.
LB&B's use of replacement workers became controversial after a series of mishaps, including generator failures during losses of power, raised questions about the competence of the replacements to maintain the laboratory, where researchers study highly contagious and deadly animal diseases. 
The strikers gained support from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, Congressman Timothy Bishop, a Democrat from Southampton, and state and local officials who said the union workers had been mistreated and that the use of the replacement workers endangered the public.
But last week the strikers said their union strike benefits and unemployment insurance had run out, compelling them to take or seek jobs elsewhere. "It's been a long winter," said Ronald Grilli of Greenport, one of the strikers. "Tm surprised we stuck it out as long as we did." John Rather

HEADLINE: Out of Jail, In Search Of Someone To Protect 

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
Not yet 35, Israel Adrian Caetano is a rising star of the Argentinian new wave. His second feature, "Bolivia," which played in New York earlier this year, was an examination of poverty and displacement in modern Latin America, as self-assured as it was bleak. "A Red Bear" ("Un Oso Rojo"), his new film, which will be shown tonight at 6 and tomorrow night at 9 as part of the New Directors/New Films series, is a more conventional, genre-bound story, but its combination of toughness and smooth, understated style makes it touching and absorbing. 
 Bear (Julio Chavez), recently released from prison after serving seven years for killing a police officer, is not one for remorse. Within a few days of leaving the penitentiary, he shows that his propensity for violence is undiminished when he mugs a yuppie outside a telephone office. 
 Though he has supposedly paid his debt to society, Oso does, as Bruce Springsteen might put it, have debts that no honest man can pay. He also, like movie thugs from Britain, Hong Kong, Paris and New Jersey, hides a soft core of sentiment under his sociopathic, macho carapace.
Whatever tenderness he is capable of is directed toward his young daughter, Alicia (Agostina Lage), whose first birthday party he abruptly left to commit the crimes that led to his incarceration. Now she and her mother, Natalia (Soledad Villamil), are living on the brink of destitution with Sergio(Luis Machin), a weak-willed, unemployed compulsive gambler. Oso, whose fumbling paternal instincts become stronger as his actions become more decisive, appoints himself their shadowy protector. Their salvation gives him a sense of purpose.
The themes of "A Red Bear" -- payback, sacrifice, honor -- are familiar elements of gangster melodrama, and Mr. Caetano explores them in a mood of bloody, brutal melancholy. Mr. Chavez, bald, stout and smoldering, has a spring-loaded physicality that suggests Vin Diesel with a two-pack habit and a lapsed gym membership. He is not especially handsome, but his blunt, impassive charisma dominates every scene. Half the time you are as scared of him as poor Sergio is; the other half you can't help feeling sorry for the guy.
Mr. Caetano tells Oso's story with flair and economy, lingering over the seamy details and pungent idioms of the Buenos Aires underworld long enough to give the picture a harsh, smoky flavor. As with most tough-guy fables of this kind, you don't know whether the protagonist is heading for ruin or redemption, but that is less a matter of suspense than a philosophical conundrum, and in the end Mr. Caetano has the wit to split the difference.

A RED BEAR

Written and directed by Israel Adrian Caetano; in Spanish, with English subtitles; director of photography, Jorge Guillermo Behnisch; edited by Santiago Ricci; music by Diego Grimblat; art director, Graciela Oderigo; produced by Lita Stantic. Running time: 94 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown tonight at 6 at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, 1941 Broadway, at 65th Street, and tomorrow night at 9 at the Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, as part of the 32nd New Directors/New Films series of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the department of film and media of the Museum of Modern Art.

WITH: Julio Chavez (Oso), Soledad Villamil (Natalia), Luis Machin (Sergio), Agostina Lage (Alicia), Enrique Liporace (Guemes), Rene Lavand (Turco), Daniel Valenzuela (Alfarito), Freddy Flores (Tuerca) and Ernesto Villegas (Quique).

HEADLINE: War's Effect on Retailers Appears to BeMixed 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Shoppers -- buoyed by the spring weather and, analysts say, exhausted by wall-to-wall coverage of the war -- have taken to the nation's malls in surprising numbers. The question is whether they are buying.
 Preliminary figures, issued by Wal-Mart and Federated department stores, which include Bloomingdale's and Macy's, said that sales had slowed during the first week of the war but appeared to be recovering as of last week. A spokeswoman for Lord & Taylor, another large department store chain, said on Friday that the general United States economy, with the war thrown in, had created a challenging retail environment, but that it was "business as usual," with no more drastic markdowns than had been planned before the Iraqi war began. 
 Still, things at Lord & Taylor's Manhattan store were slow at noon yesterday, with a saleswoman standing in front of a mirror trying on sunglasses. In the nearly deserted men's department, a man rejected a tie he was trying on as "too shiny." When asked about shopping during a war, he shrugged. "Life goes on," he said, reaching for another tie. (A sign announced "50 percent off ties already marked down 25 percent.") 
Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, said on Saturday that "people are still shopping for necessities -- trading sweaters for swimsuits -- but there's probably a lot of them who are putting off big purchases." The times are "still scary," she said, "more because of the economy than the war."
Maybe scary, but not positively petrifying. While the Retail Federation will not issue its forecast for 2003 until tomorrow, Ms. Mullin said it was clear that "it's not as bad as people thought it was going to be."
At Thomson First Call, which compiles analysts' predictions, Ken Perkins, a research analyst, said that estimates were starting to come in. Of the major players, "no one is doing really well, " he said, "but no one is doing really badly, either."
At a Wal-Mart in Kingston, N.Y., shoppers were lining up 10 deep at the many checkout counters. In Kansas City, the parking lots at a Best Buy were full, and an advertised combination DVD-VCR machine was sold out, said Mike Green, who specializes in retail consumer products and distribution in the United States for Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, a consulting business. 
"You sure can't tell there's a recession here," he said. "I don't see a big impact. I'm baffled." But Mr. Green agreed with other industry experts who predicted that the situation could change drastically for the worse if the war drags on.
In Portland, Ore., Jennifer Black, a retail analyst for Wells Fargo Securities, said she had been cruising the malls this past weekend, and agreed that business, if not booming, was at least moving. "If your product is right, you're selling it," she said, echoing other analysts.
"In Abercrombie & Fitch, they have a lot of stuff sold out, particularly for girls and teenagers," she said. "It's the baby boomers who aren't shopping as much; they're the ones glued to their televisions." 
Burt Flickinger III, managing director for the Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm, is more pessimistic about the current retail picture.
Mr. Flickinger said that although many malls have customers, they do not appear to be buying. He said several store managers in malls in Phoenix, where he was yesterday, had confirmed that sales this weekend were running below projections.
"At Wal-Mart's new Supercenter in Phoenix, the customer count is way off," he said. "On Friday in the malls here, even PacSun was light; traffic was light even for the March Madness sale at the Foot Locker.
"Saks was virtually empty out here, as was Robinsons-May. Dillard's was deserted, Target was light," Mr. Flickinger said. "Costco was doing pretty good business, but mostly groceries."
There were a few exceptions. In the Arizona Mills mall in Tempe, Ariz., he saw one really thriving business: Steven Spielberg's GameWorks video arcade. Very few people were shopping, he said, "but the teenagers were all playing video games."

HEADLINE: Plans for Cultural Complex At Ground Zero Take Form 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
As plans begin to take shape for a cultural complex at ground zero, American Express has agreed to support a Museum of Freedom that may be built there. The museum would present exhibitions about the terrorist attacks as well as about issues like women's equality andcivil rights.
 An American Express executive said that the company, based in Lower Manhattan, decided to help sponsor the project because of its theme. "This will allow people to learn about freedom and hopefully cherish it more," said the executive, who would speak only anonymously in advance of any announcement. The executive said that the amount of the support had not been determined. 
 The museum would be part of a two-building cultural complex as conceived by Daniel Libeskind, whose design for the 16-acre site was chosen earlier this year. The second building would house a performing arts center, which would probably become the home for the New York City Opera. In addition to its repertory, the opera company would stage musical theater at the hall that it may want to take on the road. 
As envisioned, the first floor of a Museum of Freedom would be devoted to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; the second floor would be dedicated to the history of New York City; the third would explore freedom from a national perspective; and the fourth would have an international focus.
"We see it as the intellectual and educational complement to the emotional experience of the spiritual memorial," said Tom A. Bernstein, president of the Chelsea Piers recreation complex, who has been developing the museum over the last year. His partner in Chelsea Piers is Roland W. Betts, a director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the city-state agency formed to direct the rebuilding of the Trade Center site. The Libeskind plan would also include a separate ground zero memorial park.
How much the complex will cost, and how all of it would be paid for remains in question, particularly given the weak economy's effect on charitable giving. Those involved in the cultural possibilities for the site say they expect government and private money will be involved. 
"It would be multiple sources," said John C. Whitehead, chairman of the development corporation. "We would expect an organization that arrives to come with some money and a plan for a balanced operating budget with charitable funds included." Mr. Whitehead also said that tax-free federal Liberty Bonds might be used for one or both buildings and that "as a last resort, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation might have some funds to fill out a gap."
Officials from the New-York Historical Society and the Museum of the City of New York say they are interested in being part of a museum on the site. Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the historical society, met with Mr. Whitehead and Mr. Bernstein about what role his institution might play.
Were the historical society to participate, it would also almost certainly keep its home on Central Park West, but it is undecided whether the Museum of the City of New York would remain in its building on Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street or relocate to ground zero.
The historical society and the museum have been in merger talks for some time. The museum has been trying to determine its future ever since the Bloomberg administration rescinded the offer to move the museum to the Tweed Courthouse, a promise made by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The Tweed, near City Hall, is occupied by the Department of Education.
The museum's director, Robert R. Macdonald, resigned after the Tweed plan fell apart. Susan Henshaw Jones, former president of the National Building Museum in Washington, took over in February and said pooling the resources of the two institutions would create a more complete historical picture of the city. "It's a wonderful venture because both of usare focused on New York and neither has a collection that covers the whole thing," she said.
Mr. Bernstein said the freedom museum would examine social, economic and political issues through archival photographs, documentary footage and artifacts. 
"We want to have some place that gives context and history and meaning to the whole thing," he added. "There is no one museum that tells the story of our freedom."
Also involved in the project are the documentary filmmakers Philip B. Kunhardt Jr. and his brother, Peter W. Kunhardt, who recently produced with their father "Freedom: A History of US," the 16-episode PBS series. The actor Christopher Reeve is also expected to play a role in enlisting the support of the creative community as he did with the Kunhardt series, Mr. Bernstein said.
As to the international component, Mr. Whitehead said there was interest from several institutions. "Various museums around the world have indicated a willingness, indeed a desire for their communities to play a part," he said. "This might be a way for them to do that."
The second cultural building at ground zero would be a performing arts center with City Opera as its probable primary tenant. "There has been no final decision," Mr. Whitehead said. "But I would say it looks favorable now."
Mr. Whitehead said he saw the building as being about five stories high, with a large auditorium on the ground floor and two smaller stages above it, one for music and another for theater. He said that "various people" were interested in managing each of those theaters, but declined to be more specific, adding that rehearsal space and offices would also be included.
The Joyce Theater has expressed interest in being part of a performing arts complex, adding the downtown site to its stages in Chelsea and SoHo.
Irwin Schneiderman, the chairman of City Opera, said that in addition to the regular opera season, he anticipated producing or co-producing musical theater at a new auditorium "to supplement or complement the season."
City Opera on Saturday concluded its run of Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music," and has a long history of producing musical theater. Mr. Schneiderman said the opera house might be used as "a launching platform" for productions that would then tour. "We might take things out on the road," he said.
City Opera has been looking to leave its home in the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, which it shares with the New York City Ballet. Because the State Theater was designed to muffle footfalls for dance performances, the opera has long sought a more acoustically appropriate space.
Some City Opera officials would also welcome the chance to move out from under the shadow of its larger, wealthier neighbor, the Metropolitan Opera. 
Considerable questions remain as to whether City Opera's audience would follow the company downtown. City Opera has been conducting demographic surveys to determine how much of a new audience it would gain from places more convenient to Lower Manhattan, like Brooklyn, Long Island and New Jersey.
"Preliminarily, it's looking encouraging," said Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of City Opera. 
"We know we're going to lose -- not a large percentage, but a percentage of our audience," he added. "And we will need to make up that percentage from elsewhere."
The company's move downtown is very much dependent on the development of transportation in Lower Manhattan, and City Opera executives said these plans for a transit hub looked promising. 
In addition, Lincoln Center executives have expressed doubt about City Opera's ability to sustain itself financially, much less raise money for a new building.
Both Mr. Schneiderman and Mr. Kellogg said there was considerable interest from potential corporate sponsors, though the officials declined to name any possible donors because these talks were still underway. "There are interesting prospects now that we're getting more specific," Mr. Schneiderman said. 
The philanthropist Robert Wilson had previously offered $50 million toward a new City Opera, but said he was "not enthusiastic" about the company moving downtown. Asked whether he would make his contribution if City Opera relocated to ground zero, Mr. Wilson said: "I doubt it, but I'm not sure. They would have to make a case."
City Opera executives are scheduled to meet with officials at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation on April 14. "After the meeting, we will be in a position to make some kind of decision," Mr. Kellogg said. "One has to believe there are enough people who really want us to come downtown to bring that area to life."

HEADLINE: Avid Bourgeois Respectability, Japanese-Style 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
There are moments when "Wild Berries," Miwa Nishikawa's mild comic satire of Japanese family values, suggests a more tempered Asian answer to Todd Solondz's "Happiness." That notorious film, you will recall, lifted up a rock in the plush green lawns of suburban New Jersey and discovered all kinds of crawly creatures feasting on one another.
 Here, the hungers gnawing at its characters insides are not erotic. (There's nothing half as sensational as that movie's portrait of a psychiatrist who is a secret pedophile.) The sins of the family under Ms. Nishikawa's critical microscope have to do with money, pride, and public image. 
 While putting on a desperate show of bourgeois respectability, Yoshiro (Sei Hiraizumi), a middle-age unemployed engineer who is deeply in debt, will do almost anything to stay afloat. His ultimate willingness to let his disgraced son, Shuji (Hiroyuki Miyasako), the black sheep of the family, return and assume management of the purse strings, reveals a fundamental flaw in the family's character.
Without bearing down too heavily, the movie implies that the willingness of Japan's bourgeoisie to indulge in shady financial shenanigans is one of the dirty little secrets of the country's middle-class.
Observing her flailing family and keeping a stiff upper lip is their attractive, strait-laced daughter, Tomoko (Miho Tsumiki), a grade-school teacher who has somehow escaped her parents' moral curse. She is the only household member with a job and a solid sense of ethics. An early scene shows her giving one of her classes a stern lecture about lying and truthfulness. When she begins dating a well-to-do young teacher her own age, her parents, who fantasize her as their rescuer, urge her to snag him as a husband, but it isn't as easy as they imagine.
In the funniest scene, Tomoko brings her boyfriend home for a family dinner that is intended to demonstrate what a happy, normal household she comes from, but everything goes wrong. Much of that humor is slapstick and involves the grotesquely slobbering table manners of Tomoko's senile grandfather, who barges into the gathering and makes a disgusting spectacle of himself. The old man, who appears to have an insatiable appetite, ravenously slurps his food, then complains about how bad it is. He is also prone to seizures that require immediate medication. At one point, his distress signals are pointedly ignored, and he abruptly dies, much to everyone's secret relief. 
It is at the grandfather's funeral that Shuji makes a dramatic surprise appearance and saves the day. When Yoshiro is angrily confronted by a creditor in front of the guests, Shuji poses as a hard-nosed lawyer, issuing ominous counter-threats. Shuji may have been banished for stealing from his father, but his father is so grateful that he welcomes his son as his financial savior.
Once Shuji appears, this grinning, hyperbolic con man takes over the movie and rides it home. Mr. Miyasako creates an incisive portrait of a sleazy charmer who can talk his way out of any situation. When one creditor comes banging on the door, Shuji flashesa wad of bills and pays him off. But that creditor is only one of many. And where did that money come from? The local news is carrying the story of a series of robberies of funeral offerings, including one at the very mortuary that oversaw the grandfather's funeral.
Tomoko's alienation is embodied in the fable that gives the movie its title. She recalls as a girl hearing her brother boast about discovering a remote patch of wild berries deep in a forest not too far from their home. But when she went looking for the fruit she couldn't find it and got lost. When she reminds Shuji of the incident, he offers to show her the patch. What happens during their hike into the woods encapsulates the dangerous moral quagmire Tomoko finds herself so desperate to flee.

PERSON: Alfred Eisenpreis 

HEADLINE: Alfred Eisenpreis, 78, City Administrator 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Alfred Eisenpreis, New York City's economic development administrator for two and a half years in the mid-1970's, died at Lenox Hill Hospital on Thursday. He was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
 The cause was not immediately disclosed, but he had been suffering from lymphoma. 
 Dr. Eisenpreis was a vice president for marketing with the Allied Stores Corporation, a nationwide chain, when Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed him to head the city's Economic Development Administration in January 1974.
Mr. Beame said at the time that the appointment was "an important part of a message I wish to convey to the business community," and "I want business to know that this is a city where business interest and public interest can be brought together for everyone's benefit."
Dr. Eisenpreis, whose doctorate was in public policy from Union Institute, was also a member of the National Council for Urban Economic Development in 1975 and 1976.
He resigned as economic development administrator in June 1976, while Mr. Beame went ahead with plans to revamp his administration's efforts to assist the city's drooping economy.
Mr. Beame said at the time that he had not requested Dr. Eisenpreis's resignation. But other mayoral aides indicated that he had grown disappointed both with Dr. Eisenpreis's work as administrator and with City Hall's entire unsuccessful drive to halt the city's job losses, which by then totaled 645,100 from 1969.
Over the years Dr. Eisenpreis held many posts in business and other fields. He was a member of the board and treasurer of Congregation Emanu-El of New York City.
Born in Vienna, he moved to the United States in 1939. He received a bachelor's degree from St. Thomas College in Scranton, Pa., and master's degrees in political science, management and human resources from the New York School of Social Research. His marriage to Bettijane Long Eisenpreis ended in divorce.
He is survived by his companion, Joan C. Schwartz; and his son, Steven, both of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: A Deadly Virus on Its Mind, Hong Kong Covers Its Face 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 30 

 BODY:
It is beginning to feel a lot like Halloween here, with more and more people wearing masks and the health news getting scarier by the day.
 Health officials here announced 60 more cases today of a mysterious pneumonia known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The additional cases bring the total for the last four days to 204 -- more than in the rest of the world combined, not counting mainland China, which has not yet reported any cases in March. 
 The State Department warned over the weekend that the quality of medical services here and in Hanoi, Vietnam, was being affected by the pressure on hospitals of treating the illness. 
Singapore said today that nurses would meet flights from here and other affected cities to assess the health of passengers, while Thailand said it would quarantine, for 24 hours, anyone who arrived from here and showed any sign of being unwell. In Canada, a fourth person died today, linked to a previous death in the same Toronto area hospital. 
When an employee falls ill with the infectious disease, companies like HSBC and Hewlett-Packard temporarily close offices for disinfection and send other workers home. Economists warn of serious damage to the local economy, which depends on tourism and particularly on its place as a base for businesses with operations across Asia.
Some expatriates and affluent citizens are beginning to flee the city, taking home leave or extended vacations. But for those who stay, the common surgical mask has become a subject of obsessive interest.
For starters, there are the practical difficulties, as people who have never worn the masks try to figure out how to tie knots on top of their heads and behind their necks. "It is very suffocating and hot, and it is inconvenient, as I have to take it off before eating and put it on after eating," said John Fung, a 30-year-old researcher.
Wearing a mask can also make everyday tasks more difficult, especially when it is poorly adjusted. "It is very inconvenient when talking with people," because a mask can muffle sound, complained Ho Sau Ying, a 52-year-old delivery clerk. "When I drink water, I have to take it off, and it is not good for seeing."
Isabella Kau, a popular author and commentator on etiquette in this status-conscious city, declared that there was no socially acceptable way to wear a face mask. But, she added, "in today's circumstances, I do not think it is embarrassing to wear a face mask in public."
Markups on masks are sometimes steep. While basic green or white surgical masks remain the most common, they are coming in a growing array of colors, as well as with cartoon images, including Hello Kitty and characters from "101 Dalmatians." Some show the United States flag, still identified here to some extent with democratic values and the students who were massacred at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989.
To wear a mask at all has become something of a political statement. Pro-democracy lawmakers have been pushing the government to ask everyone to wear them; initially, they saw the masks as an alternative to government quarantines and what they consider other infringements on the civil liberties of patients and their families, although hostility to quarantines has faded as the spread of the disease has accelerated.
Government officials have resisted wearing masks, while trying to reassure businesses and tourists that Hong Kong is not a dangerous place to work or to visit.
Doctors say sick people who put on masks become less likely to transmit the illness when they cough or sneeze. But it is unclear whether the masks help the healthy. They quickly become saturated with moisture from breath and lose some usefulness when worn for hours -- much less for days, as is happening here now -- local doctors warn.
Many people here tie the masks so loosely that air flows around the edges instead of being filtered by the fabric. The virus responsible for the respiratory syndrome also appears to be transmitted like common cold viruses by people who touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hong Kong Health Department have all said masks are mainly of value for health care workers, to help prevent the spread of illness by people who feel sick and to protect those in close contact with those who feel ill. Advocates of wider mask use contend that people who are starting to feel unwell, and are thus perhaps on the verge of infectiousness, are more likely to wear masks if they are less likely to be stigmatized in a community where healthy people are wearing masks too.
Hong Kong has had 530 cases so far among its seven million people, so healthy people with no close contacts with ill ones may not need to worry too much yet, unless the spread of the disease continues to accelerate. 
"In my head, I know that it's not a big deal," said Alfie Wong, who wore a mask on Saturday afternoon. "But in my heart, I'm frightened."

PERSON: Robert E. Hudec 

HEADLINE: Robert E. Hudec, 68, Expert on Global Trade Law, Dies 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
Robert E. Hudec, a professor who broadened the study of laws governing international trade to embrace matters of diplomacy and politics, died on March 12 while vacationing in North Captiva Island, Fla. He was 68.
 The cause was coronary heart disease, according to an announcement by Tufts University, where Professor Hudec had taught since 2000. He lived in Newton, Mass. 
 Along with John H. Jackson, who directs the Institute of International Economic Law at Georgetown University, Professor Hudec "was simply one of the founders of international trade law as a discipline that was a subject of scholarly research and teaching at major universities," said Robert L. Howse, a law professor at the University of Michigan.
"He developed an approach that neither reduced international trade law to economic policy nor made the law into a kind of formal structure impermeable to politics and diplomacy," Professor Howse said. "He gave both legalism and diplomacy their due."
According to Professor Hudec's philosophy, a legal institution governing international trade would have to be sensitive to political and diplomatic considerations -- even allowing them to supersede its authority in some circumstances -- to avoid becoming so inflexible as to render itself harmful or irrelevant.
This belief, combined with his legal expertise, led Professor Hudec to become a participant in, and critic of, the dispute-settlement processes of the World Trade Organization and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Robert Emil Hudec was born in Cleveland and raised nearby in North Olmsted, Ohio. Though his parents, who had immigrated from Slovakia, were unsure of the value of a college education, a high school guidance counselor persuaded him to apply. He was accepted at Kenyon College, where he met Marianne Miller, a student at nearby Denison College, on a blind date. They were married in 1956.
Professor Hudec began as a chemistry major but broke so much glassware in the laboratory that he could not afford to continue. He graduated summa cum laude in political science and moved to England, were he studied at Cambridge University as a Marshall Scholar.
After serving as editor in chief of the Yale Law Journal while earning a law degree, he became a clerk for Justice Potter Stewart of the United States Supreme Court from 1961 to 1963.
After a short stint at the predecessor of the United States trade representative's office and several years as a professor at Yale, Mr. Hudec taught law for 28 years at the University of Minnesota and then joined Tufts. 
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Katharine Wright Hudec, of West Newton, Mass.; a son, Michael Robert, of Austin, Tex.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Foundations' 2002 Giving Held Steady, Report Finds 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Neither volatile stock market nor weak economy nor bad investments made much of a dent in giving by foundations last year.
 Grants from the nation's more than 62,000 foundations in 2002 totaled $30.3 billion, basically keeping pace with those in the previous year, according to a survey to be released today by the Foundation Center, a research organization in New York. 
 But foundation executives and experts on philanthropy are bracing themselves for a decline next year, although no one was willing to guess how sharp reductions would be. Foundation giving did fall by 0.7 percent, a number that was statistically negligible but still the first decrease since 1983, after six consecutive years of double-digit growth. 
"We're in a different time right now," said Loren Renz, vice president for research at the Foundation Center. "I don't think it came as fast as people expected or feared, but now we're at the point where foundations are faced with a real dilemma: how to balance the desire to preserve assets with the responsibility to maintain the viability of the nonprofits you support."
Jon Small, president of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, a trade group representing more than 1,100 organizations, said nonprofit organizations were still trying to assess how big the hits would be.
"My sense is that for the most part, foundations are sticking with the organizations and programs they know and love, so it's very hard for a new face or program to find funding," Mr. Small said.
Giving has been stable so far largely because many foundations, particularly the largest ones, determine their spending based on a three-year average of their asset values. Thus, while asset values have dropped, in some cases markedly, the average reflects one or two years when assets were buoyed by robust stock prices.
Those better years, however, are beginning to fall out of the mix.
The Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation's assets, which are almost entirely Tribune Company stock, peaked at almost $2 billion in 1999, and that figure was included in the average used last year to determine giving.
This year, the 1999 figure fell out of the average and was replaced by the value of the foundation's 2002 assets, $1.8 billion, reducing the average used to determine gifts by 3.6 percent, so the foundation's giving will fall by roughly 4 percent this year, said Louis I. Marsico, its treasurer.
Only 6 of the 50 largest foundations had gains in their assets in 2001, the latest year for which data is available. Only two of those, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Moody Foundation, gained 10 percent or more -- and the Hewlett Foundation's increase was solely attributable to a $3.1 billion bequest. 
In contrast, the assets of 29 percent of those foundations fell 10 percent or more, and five foundations -- the Ford Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, the J. Paul Getty Trust, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Starr Foundation -- lost more than $1 billion each.
Asset values continued to fall last year, although most experts say the biggest declines occurred in 2001. For instance, the Annie E. Casey Foundation's asset value remained relatively stable last year at $2.7 billion after falling 13.6 percent in 2001.
Doug Nelson, president of the Casey Foundation, said it had moved quickly to diversify its asset base, which is still largely tied up in United Parcel Service stock, and change its investment managers. 
The Casey Foundation is among those that say they are committed to maintaining their spending levels despite fluctuations in asset values. It plans to spend $186 million this year, or about 7 percent of its assets, almost exactly what it spent last year.
That is higher than the 5 percent foundations must spend to maintain their tax exemption, but Casey is one of a growing number of foundations spending more than required.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: YANKEES NOTEBOOK; 
Matsui And Mates Bracing For Boos

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 30 

 BODY:
Late in spring training, Hideki Matsui enjoyed a rare moment alone in the visitors' clubhouse in St. Petersburg, Fla. As the final innings of a game played out on the field, Matsui studied a Japanese book about major league ballparks. He lingered on the Skydome page for several minutes.
 It is finally happening for Matsui, the Yankees' $21 million free-agent prize. He will begin his American major league career at the Skydome on Monday, batting fifth and playing left field. If Matsui thought the Blue Jays welcomed him rudely today, he was not saying. 
Taped to the door of the Yankees' clubhouse was a team-sponsored newspaper ad that targeted Matsui. "Boo Matsui," it read, in English and Japanese, with a photo of a Yankee cap pelted by bird droppings. The ad offended Yankees Manager Joe Torre, but Matsui was restrained.
"I don't have anything special to say," he said through an interpreter. "I guess I'm happy that the fans are actually aware of my name."
Torre saw the ad while riding the team bus this morning. He believed it was inappropriate and said it went "beyond having fun."
"I thought it was tasteless, especially in the climate of what's going on in the world," Torre said. "I can understand fun and games, but I thought it was a little bit too much."
The Blue Jays did not even scout Matsui in Japan, knowing that teams like the Yankees could outbid them by millions. Toronto's director for corporate marketing, Jim Bloom, devised the ad as a way to tweak the Yankees.
"We don't mean any disrespect to Matsui," Bloom said. "It was a high-profile, high-priced signing. We are a team trying to live within the constraints of current baseball economics. It's just done with a sense of humor."
The Blue Jays are trying to revive sagging fan interest, and they will give away Eric Hinske bobblehead dolls as further enticement for Monday's game. The team's president, Paul Godfrey, said more than 40,000 tickets had been sold.
Godfrey said he hoped fans would be respectful when "God Bless America" is sung during the seventh-inning stretch. Fans in some Canadian arenas have booed the American national anthem.
"As far as I'm concerned, you never go wrong by paying respect," Godfrey said.
"If there are fools and idiots who stand up and boo, they're silly. We have American players playing for us, and our guests in town are Americans, the New York Yankees. People should stand up and honor that."
As for Matsui, he will get used to booing, several teammates said. Matsui said Japanese fans rarely boo.
"I don't think everybody who comes out is going to boo Matsui," first baseman Jason Giambi said. "They're going to boo the Yankees, period."

No Surprises in Lineup
Against Toronto's Roy Halladay on Monday, Joe Torre will use the same lineup he used late in spring training.
Alfonso Soriano will lead off, followed by Derek Jeter, Jason Giambi, Bernie Williams, Hideki Matsui, Jorge Posada, Robin Ventura, Raul Mondesi and designated hitter Nick Johnson.

Trainers Warn Yankees
Team trainers told Yankees players to take precautions against severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, which has caused two Toronto-area hospitals to close and thousands of people to be quarantined. Players were given information explaining SARS, which has resulted in deaths around the world, and told to stay away from hospitals.
"It's scary, no question about it," Joe Torre said. "But I haven't sensed a whole lot of worry about it."

Latham Makes Team
As the Yankees' reserve center fielder, Chris Latham has made an opening day roster for the first time since 1999, when he played for Minnesota. Latham played for the Blue Jays in 2001 and was let go on waivers last March. He spent last season with the Mets' Class AAA Norfolk team, had elbow surgery in the winter and signed with the Yankees.
"To not be able to make a team like Toronto and to come over here and make a team like the Yankees, it's been a blessing," Latham said.
The Yankees will use Latham mainly as a pinch-runner.

HEADLINE: Union Drive at Montefiore Could Be Labor Landmark 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
For a decade, New York hospitals have talked about the need to be more efficient -- to trim staff, attract patients, invest in technology and find less costly ways of delivering care.
 At many places, it has been little more than talk. But Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx has pulled it off, becoming one of the most financially successful hospitals in the city, a model that other hospitals look to. 
 Now, that very success lies at the heart of a labor dispute that could have repercussions far beyond the hospital walls. Many residents and interns, the hospital's doctors-in-training, say the pressure to do more with less is compromising their medical education and patient care, and they are trying to unionize, still an extreme rarity in American hospitals. 
Officials at Montefiore dispute the complaints, and unlike the handful of other hospitals around the city where doctors have organized in recent years, Montefiore is waging an aggressive campaign against the union drive. The hospital has taken several steps to delay or defeat a possible unionization vote and, more important, it is asking a federal government agency to rule that residents and interns do not have the standard rights of an employee group to unionize.
To the union, the Committee of Interns and Residents, Montefiore represents an enormous opportunity. It is one of the largest hospitals in the city, with more than 1,000 beds, and if the union wins, Montefiore's will be the largest corps of unionized doctors anywhere in the country. Union leaders hope that if Montefiore, after putting up a fierce fight, fails to stop them, then other hospitals, at least those in the city, will fall like dominoes.
In short, Montefiore, already a trend-setter, is seen by both sides in this dispute as setting precedents -- perhaps national ones -- in labor relations.
Unlike many labor disputes, this one is not about wages. (Montefiore pays interns and residents $43,000 to more than $50,000 per year, according to the hospital, similar to the scales at other premier teaching hospitals.) Rather, the doctors' main complaint is that staff cuts have forced them to perform chores that used to be done by less-skilled workers, at Montefiore's main campus in Bedford Park, in the northwest Bronx, and at the campus in Morris Park in the east Bronx, adjacent to the affiliated Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
"To have to answer the phones, to have to draw the bloods, to have to wheel the patients to X-ray ourselves, that is not the best use of our time and our resources," said Dr. Stephen Cha, a third-year resident in internal medicine. "That's time not spent on patient care."
The union contends that even as the number of patients treated has climbed rapidly, Montefiore has reduced its work force within the hospital by about 5 percent over the last five years. Hospital officials say that is an exaggeration, while acknowledging some reduction.
Some doctors say that attending physicians -- the doctors who have graduated from their residencies and are employed by the hospital -- have been forced to spend more time on patient care and less on teaching interns and residents.
To the complaints of the doctors, also known as house officers, Montefiore's president, Dr. Spencer Foreman, said, "It was ever thus, and it will ever thus be."
"The house officers' notion of the way it should be is there should be a team of four people standing beside them," he said. "It would be wonderful but you couldn't keep the doors open. So everyone works like hell."
Even so, he said, the hospital has listened to their complaints and has worked hard to respond. And he said the hospital has specialists with double board certification on duty -- not on call, but on duty -- around the clock in each of its critical care units, a rare and expensive investment in quality care.
The central figure in this fight is Dr. Foreman, universally known as Spike, the hospital's leader since 1986, and a suave, canny administrator who is viewed by his staff as a figure of both admiration and intimidation. He is one of the city's longest-serving hospital chiefs, and one of the best paid, at more than $1.5 million a year in salary and other forms of compensation.
No one disputes that he has taken a hospital that was near bankruptcy and turned it into a success story. Under him, revenues have doubled, admissions have nearly doubled, and the hospital has invested $1 billion in capital improvements and added one million square feet of space, including a new Children's Hospital loaded with such eye-catching extras as outer space-themed decor, plasma-screen televisions and Internet connections in each room. In 2001, Montefiore reported clearing $12.7 million on $1.2 billion in revenue -- a 1 percent margin that would be considered meager in most businesses, but qualifies as robust in the troubled world of New York City hospitals.
Other hospitals in the city tried to economize by merging in the 1990's, and often regretted it. Dr. Foreman resisted the trend. In an era when the city's hospitals have tried to save by shifting primary care out of their main buildings and into community clinics, Montefiore's is one of the few clinic networks not considered a money-loser.
Montefiore was an early convert to hospital marketing, holding itself out as a leader in pediatrics, women's health and cancer care, and it has succeeded in drawing large numbers of patients from the more affluent Westchester County, improving its bottom line. Montefiore has also invested heavily in high technology, becoming one of the first hospitals in the country to adopt a paperless system for tracking all doctors' orders, like prescriptions and blood tests -- a practice that advocates say reduces medical errors.
But conversations with doctors reveal a widespread unease. "It's a great hospital and they've done some great things," said Rob Darzynkiewicz, a fourth-year resident in emergency medicine. "But we've got residents changing bedpans, which prevents us from seeing more patients. The doctor is ultimately responsible, medically and legally. We aren't going to allow these chores not to get done, even if that means doing them ourselves."
The idea of a union remains alien to most doctors and hospitals. Attending physicians around the country have long had the right to organize, but they rarely do.
But until recently, the National Labor Relations Board viewed interns and residents as students more than employees. As a result, they did not have the rights that federal law grants almost all worker groups: to unionize by a majority vote, in an election overseen by the board, with management obliged to recognize and bargain with the resulting union. Residents' and interns' only real leverage to force management's recognition was to strike, an almost unheard-of step.
Then, in 1999, in a case involving Boston Medical Center, the labor board overturned its longstanding policy, and ruled that residents and interns were entitled to the same protections as other employee groups. Since then, those doctors have unionized at only about a dozen hospitals around the country, half of them in New York City, according to the Committee of Interns and Residents, an arm of the Service Employees International Union.
Montefiore has become the first hospital in the country to challenge that 1999 decision, asking the labor board to reverse itself again -- a position that could delay any union vote until most of the residents who began the drive last year are gone. The hospital's request is the subject of a hearing that has been under way at the board's regional office since October. Whatever the outcome, it will probably be appealed to the board, itself, in Washington.
"The house staff represent a class of person who are indistinguishable from any other class of students," Dr. Foreman said. "The union-management interface is not the appropriate one in an educational setting. I think the Boston decision was wrong."
Under the Boston ruling, residents and interns at each hospital are lumped into a single bargaining unit with attending physicians, unless both union and management agree to treat them separately. Other New York City hospitals that have seen union drives have agreed to divide the two groups.
But Montefiore has insisted that any vote, if it comes, must include all the doctors -- a position that will make it much harder for the union to win such a vote. Montefiore is one of the few teaching hospitals where the hospital, and not the medical school, employs the attending physicians. That means that at Montefiore, unlike most hospitals, attending physicians outnumber residents and interns, by about 1,200 to 800.
While an overwhelming majority of residents and interns signed a petition last year seeking a union vote, a fairly small minority of attending doctors signed. In interviews, attending doctors were less likely than residents and interns to be sharply critical of the hospital -- and much less likely to allow their names to be used.
Doctors say that since the unionization drive began, the hospital has, as one put it, "thrown candy at us," in an attempt to win them over. In the last year, residents and interns have received a $500 textbook allowance, new health benefits and parking privileges and free meals in the hospital cafeterias, and they have been promised a raise in July.
"They're obviously taking this organizing drive very seriously, as are we," said Michael Phelan, organizing director of the Committee of Interns and Residents. "This one could be a watershed for us and the industry."
Montefiore has a long record of milestone labor relations. Decades ago, it was one of the first hospitals in the city to recognize and bargain with 1199,the union for most hospital workers, and the Committee of Interns and Residents -- well before the law required that they acknowledge the unions.
Then, in 1981, residents and interns struck seven municipal hospitals, defying a court order. In solidarity, they struck Montefiore, too, enraging its administration. Montefiore rescinded its recognition of the Committee, and 22 years later, the union still has not regained that status.

HEADLINE: In Albany, the Only Surplus Is of Plans to Increase Taxes 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Last week, New York's legislative leaders reached a deal on how to borrow $4.2 billion to help solve the state's budget mess, the worst since the Depression.
 The next decisions the Legislature must make to reach a budget consensus are, however, the toughest of all: What to cut. What to keep. And how to pay for it. 
 Lobbyists have been descending on the Capitol in Albany, trying to influence the thinking of lawmakers on what is essential and what is expendable. Busloads of teachers, students, health care workers and nursing home employees show up -- especially on Tuesdays -- to plead their cases. It is a ritual known as tin cup Tuesday. Tomorrow, the state's largest health care union is planning a demonstration at the Capitol, and have rented buses from as far as Ohio to help transport its members.
The special interest groups are lobbying for changes to Gov. George E. Pataki's plan for closing a $11.5 billion deficit through a combination of borrowing, budget cuts and $1.4 billion in tax increases, higher fees, fines and other revenues.
Legislative leaders have criticized the governor's $90.8 billion budget for its cuts to education and health care. Further, Democratic lawmakers and others say, raising college tuition and cutting student aid amount to tax increases.
So a variety of tax-increase plans are being floated around the Capitol, on the theory that a Legislature reluctant to raise taxes would be even more phobic about cutting core services to constituents.
"The only thing that is an even greater unspoken fact than the willingness of many of these guys to do a tax increase is their unwillingness to even think about other kinds of spending cuts," said E. J. McMahon, a fiscal analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute and a former legislative budget director in Albany.
Among the new kinds of tax proposals are a few that aim to close corporate tax loopholes; some that would place a temporary personal income tax surcharge on the wealthiest New Yorkers; a revival of a tax on stock trades, and a tax on businesses that do not provide insurance coverage for their employees, a sort of penalty tax dedicated to a pool of money that compensates hospitals for charity care.
A coalition known as New Yorkers for Fiscal Fairness and Dennis Rivera, the powerful leader of the health care workers' union, 1199/S.E.I.U., say closing some corporate tax shelters would raise about $1.5 billion. One idea is to tax companies on the combined income from their subsidiaries, including those in states where income tax is not collected. Another is for a minimum tax on companies' gross receipts, or sales, rather than on profits, to garner $400 million to $460 million. New Jersey did that last year, calling it the alternative minimum tax.
To raise what advocates an estimated $545 million, the state could reverse its decision last year allowing companies to write off capital investments on an accelerated schedule. 
The unions have also floated the idea of increasing, by seven-tenths of 1 percent, the tax rate for people earning more than $100,000, and to institute a 1.4 percent tax increase for people making more than $200,000. That would bring in about $3 billion, the unions say.
Dan Cantor, executive director of the Working Families Party, advocates a revival of the stock transfer tax, which had existed in New York for 70 years before it was suspended in 1981. It would tax the buying or selling of shares on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, but not Nasdaq.
The tax, ranging from a penny to a nickel depending on the cost of a share, would produce about $7.6 billion in one year, said Mr. Cantor, citing statistics from the State Department of Taxation, which he said collects the tax and instantly gives it back. Mr. Cantor said the tax could be capped at a lower amount than it had been capped before -- at $175 per transaction compared with $350 per transaction before it was suspended. 
The state's biggest gap-closing revenue proposal involves borrowing about $4.2 billion against future income from a settlement with tobacco companies. That deal, reached by the Legislature last week, has so troubled Elizabeth A. Lynam, director of state studies for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, that she has called for temporary broad- based surcharge on personal income taxes.
The surcharge would start at 15 percent and decline each year until it ended after three years, provided that state spending could be cut to match revenues and that the state reformed its budget process.
"We reluctantly support a tax increase," Ms. Lynam said. "But to us, that's preferable to borrowing, which asks future New Yorkers to pay for services today."
Business leaders are already lining up against the tax proposals. Many say closing corporate tax loopholes is just another way of rescinding tax benefits created to help businesses. They argue that adopting the options floated so far would harm the state's overall economic health.
It is an argument that Governor Pataki has often made. His budget proposal resisted raising broad-based taxes, concentrating instead on smaller tax increases.
The business community says that a disproportionate share of the state's tax burden falls on them. 
"Business pays its fair share, if not more," said Robert B. Ward, director of research at the Business Council of New York State. "It pays one of every four dollars in taxes at the state level."
He said the state collects about $1.8 billion in corporate income taxes compared with $24 billion in personal income taxes, so that squeezing revenue from the corporate side would require huge percentage increases that would hurt businesses.
"At some point, the recession is going to end," Mr. Ward said. "When that happens, there's going to be a rush toward investment, and we want that investment to happen in New York as much as possible."
He and others say that lavish spending is partly to blame for the current crisis. If spending of state funds had kept pace with inflation over the past five years, instead of significantly outpacing it, this year's deficit would be $7.9 billion lower, Mr. Ward said.
For that reason, Mr. McMahon, of the Manhattan Institute, is calling for a package of eight spending reductions that he says would save $1 billion next year, and more in the future. They include reducing the state payroll beyond what Mr. Pataki has proposed, reining in health care costs, eliminating rent regulations and repealing the state Wicks Law, which requires most public building construction projects to use different contractors for different types of work. 
"Putting a big tax increase on the table in front of the New York State Legislature and calling it temporary," Mr. McMahon said, "is like driving a truckload of pure uncut heroin into a neighborhood of junkies and calling it a temporary fix."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: AGAINST THE GRAIN; 
Bonds Treats Age Like Bad Pitch

BYLINE:  By ALLEN BARRA 

 BODY:
From 1990 to 1999, Barry Bonds was arguably the best player in baseball. For the decade, Bonds hit .302 and averaged 36 home runs and 115 walks a season. In the two most important hitting categories, he led the National League in on-base percentage four times and slugging percentage three times. 
 By 1999, at the age of 35, Bonds seemed to be on the downside of a Hall of Fame career, hitting only .262 with 219 total bases, his worst numbers since his rookie year in 1986. In the 2000 season, though, Bonds increased his home run total by 15 (34 to 49), his batting average 44 points (.262 to .306), his on-base percentage 51 points (.389 to .440) and his slugging percentage a whopping 71 points (.617 to .688). 
 Not many players get significantly better after the age of 35, but that was just the beginning. In 2001, the 37-year-old Barry Bonds was no longer competing with the young Barry Bonds: he was competing with the young Babe Ruth. That year, Bonds set a major league record for home runs (73) and slugging percentage (.863). From 35 through 37, when most players are contemplating retirement, he more than doubled his home run total. 
Because Bonds hit 27 fewer home runs in 2002 than in 2001, it wasn't obvious to many that he was an even more effective hitter. He won his first National League batting title at .370 (the oldest player in league history to win a batting crown) and set major league records for walks (198) and on-base percentage (.582). He struck out only 47 times in 143 games, posting the lowest ratio of strikeouts per at-bats in his career. By some yardsticks, it may have been the greatest performance by a National League hitter. 
Some baseball analysts like to add on-base and slugging percentages as a quick measure of all-around batting effectiveness. George Ignatin, a professor of economics and a sports statistician at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, argues that multiplying on-base and slugging gives a more accurate assessment of a hitter's run-producing potential. Ignatin refers to the statistic as SLOB. Bonds's 2002 SLOB of .465 means that Bonds created 46.5 runs per 100 at-bats, topping even his 2001 mark of .444. Let's put that in perspective: in 1921, Babe Ruth posted a .433 SLOB, the highest of his career. 
If Bonds had had seasons like his last two when he was 25 and 26, it would have been remarkable enough. That he has done so at 37 and 38 practically puts him in a league of his own, not only in baseball but also in sports history. Michael Jordan was a great player when he came out of retirement at age 38 in 2001, but no one said that he was the best player in basketball or that he was better than he had been at his peak 10 years earlier. George Foreman was 45 when he won one of the numerous heavyweight championship belts in 1994, but no one claimed that he was better on that night than when he beat Joe Frazier for the undisputed heavyweight title in 1973. 
N.F.L. history suggests one example of a Bonds-like performance. In 1962, at age 36, Y. A. Tittle threw 33 touchdown passes in 14 games for the Giants, then topped that with 36 in 13 games in '63. (Tittle's previous high was 20 touchdown passes in 1953.) A large part of Tittle's success, though, was his going to a much better team in New York than the one he had left in San Francisco.
The reasons offered for Barry Bonds's amazing late-career resurgence have ranged from steroid use (which Bonds vehemently denies) to laser eye surgery (for which no evidence has yet been found) to his maple whip-handled bats to his famous body armor (said by some to mysteriously supercharge his reflexes). The problem with all these theories is that they don't explain why Bonds's level of performance has been so much higher than that of his younger contemporaries, who have had access to the same advantages. Meanwhile, Barry Bonds finds himself in the unique position of a 39-year-old who, if he bats .300 with 40 home runs, will hear talk that he is slipping.

HEADLINE: Police Arrest Brooklyn Man In Slayings of 4 Shopkeepers 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
The police have arrested a Brooklyn man who they believe has shot and killed four shopkeepers without provocation in Brooklyn and Queens since early last month, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced last night.
 The suspect, Larme Price, 30, confessed on Saturday to the four slayings, which terrorized residents and small-business owners and had been described as the work of a serial killer, the police said. Mr. Price said he was motivated by a desire to kill people of Middle Eastern descent after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Kelly said at a news conference at police headquarters. 
 Only one of the four victims, all foreign-born men, was from the Middle East, but Mr. Price was apparently under the impression that they all were, Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Price, the police say, shot the four victims in the head, usually without demanding money. He will be prosecuted first by the district attorney's office in Brooklyn, where three of the killings took place, Mr. Kelly said. A law enforcement official said charges would include multiple counts of first-degree murder, a crime that could be punishable by death. He will also face two counts of attempted murder, Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Price drew attention to himself when he walked into the 77th Precinct station house on Friday night and offered to help the police find the killer, Mr. Kelly said. 
Mr. Price told investigators the killer went by the nickname "Dog" and "appeared eager to help the investigation," Mr. Kelly noted. The investigators quickly became suspicious of Mr. Price, whose walk and appearance, they say, resembled that of the killer. They did not have enough evidence to detain him. But the next day, speaking to investigators on a cellphone, Mr. Price broke down and confessed to the killings, Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Price said he was confessing because he had been reading the Bible, particularly the commandment "Thou shalt not kill," Mr. Kelly said, and because he was concerned about his two daughters. 
The police said Mr. Price did not appear to have been involved in a fifth fatal shooting that took place at an auto parts store in East New York, Brooklyn, on March 1. Members of the task force assigned to the case had believed that killing was carried out by the same man.
Mr. Price told the police that he killed one of his victims, a Russian-born man who worked at an all-night coin laundry in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, because Mr. Price felt disrespected when the man told him he could not sit in the store unless he was doing laundry there, Mr. Kelly said. 
Asked about Mr. Price's statement that he wanted to kill people of Middle Eastern descent, Mr. Kelly said, "I believe it fits the definition of a bias crime." 
But Mr. Price's mother, Leatha Price, said yesterday that her son's anger at Middle Easterners was a matter of mental illness, not ethnic hatred.
Speaking at the door of her apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Ms. Price said her son had a history of drug abuse and mental health problems, and that as recently as three weeks ago she had tried unsuccessfully to have him admitted to Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn because he appeared to be mentally unbalanced. She said her son ranted wildly, claiming that the Central Intelligence Agency was after him and that the hospital had put a tracking device in his hand. 
After the Sept. 11 attacks, "he walked around scared all the time, he couldn't sit still," Ms. Price said. At one point he said, "I'm going to join the war," she added. After themost recent trip to the hospital, he was scared to come out of the car, saying, " 'They're following me, Ma, they're following me,' " she said.
"We kept trying to get help for him, but they kept letting him go," Ms. Price said. 
The police are investigating the possibility that Mr. Price is mentally ill, Mr. Kelly said.
The police have also detained a man who was with Mr. Price during the first killing, at a food market in Ozone Park, Queens, on Feb. 8, Mr. Kelly said. That man, whose name was not released, is being considered a witness. Mr. Price was alone during all the other shootings.
In addition to Mr. Price's confession, there is ample evidence linking Mr. Price to all four killings, Mr. Kelly said. Investigators have recovered the 9-millimeter Intertech handgun that they say was used in the most recent killing, on March 20, at the Stop I Food Market in Crown Heights. They said they had also found a distinctive hat, gloves and other clothing that could be seen on surveillance videotape taken at the scenes of other killings.
The gun and clothing were found at the home of Mr. Price's girlfriend, who is pregnant with his child, Mr. Kelly said. She is not the mother of Mr. Price's two other children, who have different mothers, Mr. Kelly added.
Mr. Price discarded the .40-caliber handgun he used in the first three killings because he was out of ammunition and knew that the police were looking for it, Mr. Kelly said. That gun has not been recovered.
Mr. Price, who is unemployed, has eight prior arrests dating back to 1989, on charges including robbery, assault, burglary and criminal possession of a weapon, Mr. Kelly said. In the past, he has sold textbooks, which the police believe were stolen, on the street near the campuses of New York City colleges, Mr. Kelly said. 
Mr. Price lives at 1225 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Mr. Kelly said. The building is less than a block from the Stop I Food Market, where a Yemeni immigrant was shot and killed on March 20. Several residents in the building said yesterday that Mr. Price had often shopped there. 
After that shooting, the police say, Mr. Price also shot Yakoob Aldailam, 21, an employee at the market, three times, seriously wounding him. Like many others in the neighborhood, Mr. Aldailam, who is still recovering at the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn, was relieved to hear the news that someone had confessed in the string of deadly shootings, his family said.
"Before, when I went to see my nephew, he would tell me, 'Hold my hand, stay with me,' " said Adel Aldailam, Mr. Aldailam's uncle, whose family owns the Stop I Food Market. "But now my nephew is very happy. He is relieved a lot. Now he is going to be O.K."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE HOME FRONT; 
Rallying Round Those the Reserves Left Behind

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: DRESDEN, Tenn., March 27 

 BODY:
Sgt. Don Winstead of the 1174th Transportation Company of the Tennessee National Guard is a self-employed logger who carries big loans on his trucks and tree-cutting machinery. On active duty since late January, he has been stuck 80 miles away at Fort Campbell, Ky., and expects to be shipped to Kuwait any day. He has taken a big cut in his income, to $2,300 a month, so he cannot keep up his payments.
 As required by law for mobilized soldiers, his banks lowered interest rates to 6 percent, in Sergeant Winstead's case from 7 and 8 percent. But Bobby German, president of the Dresden branch of First State Bank, went further. He postponed all payments on the principal for a year, for now the duration of Sergeant Winstead's active duty, so the sergeant pays only the interest. 
 "They said: 'If you can't make that, don't worry about it. We'll work it out,' " Sergeant Winstead said. 
Dresden, in West Tennessee, population 2,800, seat of Weakley County, population 35,000, is one of those thousands of places that are home to members of the Reserves and National Guard. They are men and women, some in their 40's, teachers and social workers and business owners and retail clerks, who have been taken away for war in Iraq. This week, the Pentagon said 216,811 members of the National Guard and the Reserves had been activated, 150,071 of them by the Army.
To help, the people of Weakley County are going beyond letters, cards and prayers for troops who were once lightly called weekend warriors. "No one's place will go up on the auction block for failure to pay property taxes," Don Gifford, the county executive, said. 
 Dresden's mayor, Danny Forrester, said that if the 1174th's families, deprived of their breadwinners, fall behind on the waterand sewer bill, the city will postpone or forgive it. If they need a handyman, he will send somebody out. "The soldiers do not have to worry about their families," Mr. Forrester said. "We'll do everything to look after them." 
 As customers finish their business here, the clerks in the courthouse, florists and bankers say, "Come back." If as old and automatic as tying a shoe, there is an edge of unease to a goodbye with a war going on. 
 Carved on a marble slab on the courthouse lawn are the names of people who did not come back. Forty-four from Weakley County died in World War I, 98 in World War II, 9 in Korea, 17 in Vietnam. Soon nearly all 166 members of the 1174th will be going to war to back up the Fourth Infantry Division, which left Fort Hood, Tex., today. 
 Dresden is out of the way, more than a two-hour drive from Nashville and Memphis. "If you leave your lights on in Dresden," Mayor Forrester said, "someone will call and say, 'Hey, your light's on.' " Families with names like Taylor, Davis, King, Johnson and Moore stay put and proliferate. 
 With the closing of a big printing plant recently, eliminating 1,000 jobs, and layoffs of another 1,000 by a Goodyear plant nearby, Suzie German, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr. German's wife, said the economy had taken some blows. Because of the state budget deficit, Mr. Gifford, the county executive, said he was planning cuts in budget items that the state helps finance. 
 The county is historically Democratic and home of Al Gore's mother, Pauline, but like the state, it voted for President Bush over Mr. Gore in 2000. American flags have not sprouted around town as they did after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Views of the war are mixed, though support for the soldiers is solid. "Women tend to have more sadness about it, that our troops have to go," Mrs. German said. 
As yet there have been no demonstrations.
 "Everybody knows everybody else's opinion, so who would you demonstrate to?" Mr. German said. 
At Fort Campbell, a two-hour drive from Dresden, Sergeant Winstead, 35, who has a 3-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son, has been whiling away the weeks with his buddy and fellow self-employed logger Sgt. Corky King, 35, father of 11- and 13-year-old boys. Big, muscular, towheaded men, they have been sleeping in a crowded barracks, leaving just twice since Feb. 6 for weekend visits home to Dresden. 
 "We were both in Desert Storm," Sergeant King said. "We supported the First Infantry." They retired from the 1174th right after the war, but after 9/11, they rejoined. "It's something we need to do," he said. They drive trucks that haul fuel to Army trucks, tanks and Humvees on the front. In the Persian Gulf, they took turns riding shotgun, but in this war, they said, gun trucks will ride alongside. They fret about finances, but in lots of ways they say the town is helping them and their families. 
When the 1174th went off to Fort Campbell, churchwomen followed to sew patches on the troops' newly issued desert fatigues. Shops and offices around Court Square bloomed with fat, satin yellow ribbons, many distributed by the Brownies. Jennifer Tiede, a young mother in Martin, a neighboring town, is collecting $25 donations so she can make Easter baskets for the 120 children the 1174th has left behind.
 "We just love the military, all the men and women," Ceclia Nanney, 38, said. "I saw them in the sandstorm. I just cried. I got all mushy." Ms. Nanney works at Kountry Korner, a convenience store and restaurant. A brother-in-law, Terry Woodruff, and his wife, her sister, Laura Woodruff, have built the business into one of Dresden's liveliest. They also own a real estate business. 
 The Woodruffs are hands-on managers, cooking, serving, managing a staff of 20. But Mr. Woodruff is also a staff sergeant who has gone off with the 1174th, and Mrs. Woodruff has a lot to handle. "You have a job," she said. "You have to do all the jobs. There's no one to meet in the middle." 
 But the town has rallied. "I've had repairs done on the building, and I haven't received a bill," Mrs. Woodruff said. She has been calling on Phillip Davis, who mows the grass, to fix the coolers and freezers, a chore Sergeant Woodruff normally does. "I said, 'Give me a bill.' He said, 'Don't worry about it.' " Mr. German said he was keeping an eye on the Woodruffs' loans, in case they need a break.
 Mrs. Woodruff, meanwhile, is keeping an eye on another guardsman at Fort Campbell, a manager of a fast-food restaurant with five children. "He's getting about a third of his pay," she said. "So the community is getting together to be sure they're all taken care of."

WPP's Rating Cut But Outlook Rises

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott and Nat Ives 

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings has downgraded by one notch the debt ratings for the WPP Group in London, which owns agencies like Ogilvy & Mather, J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam. Fitch also upgraded the WPP rating outlook to stable from negative. 
 The WPP debt ratings were cut to BBB from BBB+ for senior unsecured debt. Fitch attributed the downgrading to concern over WPP's ability to repay debt, as well as the uncertain operating environment for the ad industry. The rating outlook was upgraded to stable, Fitch said, because of new-business wins and lower operating costs. 
 The changes came after Fitch made similar shifts with the ratings and outlook for the Omnicom Group in New York and after Standard & Poor's made similar changes for Omnicom and the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York.

More Suds Than Insights In 'Rudy'

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
IT gets people out of context and scenes out of sequence. It was made in Toronto instead of New York and bungles easily checked quotations. But hey, this is television. Those inconsistencies and near-misses are nothing compared with the larger disappointment of "Rudy: The Rudy Giuliani Story," the unfortunate TV film about the former mayor of New York that debuted on USA last night and will be replayed all week.
 The real problem with "Rudy" is what it does not do. The film, directed by Robert Dornhelm, had a chance to explore the mystery of Rudolph W. Giuliani, to probe a complex political figure. It could have tried to explain the transformation inherent in the movie's tag line: "He divided a city. He united a nation." 
 How could it be that the often willfully fierce, avenging man who led New York for eight years as if he owned the place found the inner resources to get the city through its darkest hours, to give the country the reassurance it craved? It was, for Giuliani-watchers, a perplexing performance, the equivalent of watching the dark Richard M. Nixon turn into the I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. 
Before the terrorist attack, Mr. Giuliani nurtured so fearsome a public demeanor that as his tenure was ending, even supporters had grown impatient with him.
Then came Sept. 11, and he became Mayor of America. Once the immediate danger had passed, Mr. Giuliani reverted to type, trying unsuccessfully to stay in charge by extending his term. But when it most counted, when New Yorkers needed reassurance, guidance and candor, they got it. And they got it from the same man who seemed to court enemies as avidly as he fought crime and improved the city's reputation, with help from a strong economy.
Now this is one potentially great story. If only "Rudy" had told it, or even tried to.
Instead, the film gives Sept. 11 -- as well as the former mayor's performance in that tragedy -- a minor role, choosing to focus on Mr. Giuliani's personality. Even there, he is shown as so one-dimensional that cardboard comes to mind. Or maybe a cartoon. The Rudy in "Rudy" is a driven, ill-tempered man who uses obscenities, refers to New York as "my city," and is insensitive to those closest to him.
He is intolerant when the demands of her career make his wife, Donna Hanover, inattentive to him. The film has him turning to his communications director, Cristyne F. Lategano (now Cristyne L. Nicholas), for help and support and maybe a personal relationship, which both have denied. Then he pays her off with a good job when he unceremoniously dumps her for Judith Nathan, now his fiancee.
SOME of the timing is off, but the scenes draw on what was an uncomfortable public unraveling of Mr. Giuliani's marriage. The awkward revelations about his personal life, which came at the same time that the public learned about his prostate cancer, were the stuff of soap opera -- irresistible to Hollywood (or Toronto). 
But what about the rest? The metamorphosis of Mr. Giuliani is all but ignored, the subtleties missing. Predictably, the film even fumbles what history will surely record as the most eloquent remark of the former mayor's career. In the hours after the attack on the twin towers, Mr. Giuliani declined to estimate the death toll, instead saying in a halting voice, "The number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear." In the film, the actor James Woods intones, "The loss of life is greater than any of us can possibly bear." (Oddly, this line is also misquoted in the former mayor's own book, "Leadership.")
The thought is the same, but the altered quotation gets the sentiment wrong. As does so much of the film, written by Stanley Weiser from the investigative biography of Mr. Giuliani by Wayne Barrett of The Village Voice. The only moments in "Rudy" that give the mayor some emotional depth are those showing him going to funerals and comforting a friend and aide who lost her husband on Sept. 11.
Just a film, right? But it is through movies and television that most people get what passes for reality now. The public gets some of its war news through televised briefings with White House advisers. Candidates wage campaigns in paid political ads. Filmmakers pretend to teach history through movies that spin conspiracy theories, like Oliver Stone's "J.F.K.," or turn ancient Rome into flashy vehicles for stars like Russell Crowe.
"Rudy" might have given New Yorkers revealing insights into the man who helped get them through the trauma of Sept. 11, 2001. Instead, the best thing to be said about this film is that it leaves plenty of room for the next one.
