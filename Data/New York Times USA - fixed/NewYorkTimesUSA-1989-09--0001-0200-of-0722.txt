HEADLINE: U.S. Renews Attack on Noriega, Offering Evidence of Ties to Drugs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In a new effort to turn world opinion against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the United States asserted today that the Panamanian strongman continued to play a major role in the laundering of drug money and the shipment of narcotics through his country.
The Bush Administration also said the general had built a personal fortune of $200 million to $300 million, mainly through drug trafficking and other criminal activities.
But General Noriega once again defied the United States, arranging for the selection of a new figurehead president, Francisco Rodriguez. The selection insures that General Noriega, the Commander in Chief of the Panama Defense Forces since 1983, will retain power as the de facto leader of Panama. 
 
'Haven for Drug Traffickers'
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, addressing a special session of the Organization of American States, presented a catalogue of evidence to support accusations that General Noriega had turned Panama into ''a haven for drug traffickers.''
The United States appeared to be taking advantage of the new concern about drug trafficking caused by the assassinations of three prominent Colombians who had defied drug traffickers associated with the Medellin cartel. While denying any plans for military action to oust General Noriega, American officials said it would be justified if he continued to give refuge to drug smugglers.
 
Cocaine Shipments 'Protected'
''General Noriega protected cocaine shipments flown from Medellin, Colombia, through Panama to the United States,'' Mr. Eagleburger said. ''Further, he arranged for the transshipment and sale of ether and acetone to the Medellin cartel.'' Ether and acetone are chemicals used in the processing of cocaine.
Mr. Eagleburger added: ''He provided refuge and a base for continued operations to the members of the Medellin cartel after the murder of the Colombian Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, in 1984.
''He agreed to protect a cocaine laboratory being constructed in Darien Province, Panama. And he assured the safe passage of millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds into Panamanian banks. In return for these services, Noriega received in excess of $4.6 million.''
The United States requested the meeting of the organization so it could respond to a challenge from Panama to present evidence supporting the accusations against General Noriega.
Some evidence was familiar, having been cited in the indictments of General Noriega returned by two Federal grand juries last year. But the estimate of General Noriega's wealth, said by Mr. Eagleburger to total $200 million to $300 million, and the details of his links to the Medellin cartel were new.
As part of his presentation, Mr. Eagleburger disclosed a letter from General Noriega to a London bank ordering the transfer of $14,936,426 to a bank in Luxembourg. The letter was dated Feb. 8, 1988, three days after the United States indictments were made public.
Outside the organization's chamber, a diplomat from a Central American country said there was ''no smoking gun'' in the evidence offered today. But he said the cumulative effect of such evidence tended to strengthen the United States' case against General Noriega.
President Bush, on vacation in Kennebunkport, Me., acknowledged today that he was frustrated with the failure of Washington's efforts to drive General Noriega from power. But he said he would not abandon hemispheric diplomacy as a means to achieve that goal.
''There's a high frustration level,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'm ready to concede that. But we are not going to give up on this. We are not going to permit the will of the people of Panama to be thwarted by this dictator, especially at a time when the whole hemisphere is moving down democracy's path.''
Mr. Bush also said, ''I am not going to give up on multilateral diplomacy.'' And he asserted that efforts to isolate General Noriega were succeeding, saying he saw a consensus among ''major nations'' that ''Noriega ought to get out.''
The Panamanian radio announced today that Mr. Rodriguez, an economist who has been Comptroller General for seven years, would take office as President on Friday.
Elections to choose a new president were held in May, but General Noriega annulled the elections after independent observers concluded that he had lost by a margin of about 3 to 1.
A leader of the Panamanian opposition, Ricardo Arias Calderon, said the new government would be ''a continuation of the military dictatorship'' behind a new facade. Mr. Rodriguez attended high school with General Noriega and is a longtime friend.
Panama's representative at today's O.A.S. session, Jose Maria Cabrera, said evidence offered by Mr. Eagleburger was nothing but ''lies, fabrications and half-truths.'' He said the United States was using the 31-nation organization as ''a platform for a propaganda campaign against Panama.''
Mr. Rodriguez was selected by Panama's Council of State, which is made up of Cabinet ministers and senior officials from Government agencies and the armed forces. American officials said the council was controlled by General Noriega.
The council said that Mr. Rodriguez would be the head of a ''provisional government'' and that the timing of new elections would depend, in part, on actions by the United States.
Whoever is president of Panama, his term ends Friday under the Panamanian Constitution. It is not clear who, if anyone, will be recognized as the lawful ruler of Panama.

HEADLINE: Racial Pattern Is Found in Boston Mortgages

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston criticized mortgage lenders in this city today, saying that the percentage of loans for properties in predominantly black neighborhoods was substantially lower than that in white neighborhoods.
Real estate agents, developers, lenders and others share responsibility for the racial pattern of the mortgage loans, a report by the bank concluded. But it singled out banks and savings institutions, saying they had failed to meet their obligations under a Federal law intended to serve the credit needs of the community.
''Black neighborhoods are part of the community to be served,'' the Federal Reserve bank said in a statement accompanying the report. ''Even if the disparities in mortgage activity are not of the lenders' making, banks and thrifts can and should lead the way in correcting the situation.'' 
The Federal Reserve Bank called on the banks and savings institutions to re-examine how they determine credit needs, and to market their services and lending practices ''to insure that they are reaching out to black neighborhoods in their communities, not walling them off.''
From 1982 to 1987, mortgages were issued on 6.9 percent of properties in predominantly white neighborhoods, as opposed to 3.5 percent in predominantly black neighborhoods. In neighborhoods that were virtually all white or all black, the difference was even greater, 6.8 percent for those that were virtually all white, compared with 2.7 percent for those that were virtually all black.
The study, one of the few of its kind done by the Federal Reserve System, noted that other reasons could account for the racial pattern besides lender bias. These included income differences and considerations of legitimate risks by banks. It also noted that decisions by white buyers to avoid black neighborhoods could reduce the number of transactions in those areas and thus cut the number of mortgages.
 
Economic Factors Considered
Still, even after the study took into account economic factors like income and property values as well as other nonracial characteristics, the report said a sharp difference remained between the percentage of mortgages in white neighborhoods and the percentage in black neighborhoods.
The bank's conclusions are likely to give ammunition to community and civil rights groups that have long contended that Boston's financial institutions discriminate against blacks in their lending practices.
Recently, banks in Atlanta and Detroit have stepped up inner-city lending after reports of discriminatory practices appeared in local newspapers.
''Most of us in the civil rights community would say, 'So what's new?' '' said Alex Rodriguez, chairman of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
 
Mayor Cites 'Social Chaos'
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, citing the ''devastating economic and social chaos that such practies had in Boston's neighborhoods in the 1970's,'' when racial tensions were especially high, issued a statement urging the city's banks to remedy the situation immediately.
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts ordered two cabinet members to review the Federal Reserve Bank's findings and ''to use every means at our disposal to insure that every citizen has the opportunity to own a home regardless of race or national origin.''
Bankers said the study was fair and accurate, but they denied having discriminatory lending practices.
''If people think that somehow banks don't want to make mortgages in black areas, that couldn't be further from the truth,'' said Richard F. Pollard, chairman of the Massachusetts Bankers Association who is vice chairman of BayBanks Inc. of Boston. #22% of Population Is Black Boston's black population is concentrated in the Roxbury and Mattapan districts in the south-central part of the city. The report said blacks made up 22 percent of the city's population in 1980, but half of the 60 distinct neighborhoods studied had a black population of less than 5 percent.
The report took banks and savings institutions to task for what it said was insufficient attention to their responsibilities under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires that banks and savings institutions meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
The Federal Reserve is one of several agencies responsible for administering and enforcing regulations under the 1977 law.
There are no explicit penalities for failure to comply with the act's provisions. But when financial institutions apply to regulators for permission for mergers, acquisitions, branch closings or openings, their compliance with the act is taken into account.
 
Major Source of Loans
Banks and savings institutions accounted for 46.3 percent of the transactions documented in the report. The biggest other source of loans was mortgage companies.
The report was prepared by Katharine L. Bradbury, assistant vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College who is a visiting scholar at the bank, and Constance R. Dunham, a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who is now senior research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington.
The study grew out of research by Ms. Dunham on how to judge the Community Reinvestment Act records of financial institutions, Ms. Bradbury said.
The study, ''Geographic Patterns of Mortgage Lending in Boston, 1982-1987,'' is scheduled to appear in The New England Economic Review, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Is Playing The Jobs Numbers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Government reported a rise of 169,000 non-farm jobs last month but also revised June employment upward to 250,000 from 180,000. It was the third consecutive upward revision and raised the prospect that the July statistics would be revised upward when the August report is released next month'' (Business Day, Aug. 5).
Judging from the reaction to the employment figure on Wall Street, where Treasury bond prices fell, many investors must concur that the July employment figure will be revised upward. For while the 169,000 figure is substantially less than the average monthly increase of approximately 240,000 for the first six months of 1989, not to mention the average monthly increase of approximately 290,000 during 1988, thus suggesting a slowing economy, the bond market has reacted negatively and the stock market positively since the figure was released, indicating a stronger economy (or at least, a ''soft landing'' scenario). 
To see if Wall Street's reaction was logical, I decided to research whether, in the past, three consecutive upward revisions in figures for non-farm-payroll employment have presaged a fourth upward revision. Interestingly, the last time this occurred was exactly one year ago. During April, May and June 1988, the initial figures were all revised upward, the June figure being a staggering 186,000 (from 346,000 to 532,000). However, the July figure was not revised upward, but downward by 83,000 (from 283,000 to 200,000). Further, six of the next eight months were also revised downward before the three recent upward revisions.
Thus, there appears to be no more basis for believing that the July employment figure will be revised upward than there is to believe that an unbiased coin that has come up heads three times in a row will come up heads on the next toss. It will be interesting to see Wall Street's reaction if the July figure should be revised downward.

HEADLINE: U.S. Can Promote Central American Peace;
Dying for Nothing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma fears that backing off from the contras would mean ''an awful lot of young men down there died for nothing'' (news story, Aug. 9). An awful lot of young men did die for nothing in Nicaragua in the last eight years. And so did some 50,000 Nicaraguan men, women and children, victims of United States policy.
The Sandinistas are still in power, winning the world's approval as they move toward free elections. United States taxpayers have spent millions of dollars on useless destruction. And the Central American presidents are more unified than ever in resistance to United States Government bribery and blackmail.
And now there is a new war against Nicaragua, an economic embargo that is causing skyrocketing infant mortality and malnutrition rates. How many more Nicaraguans will have to die ''for nothing'' before we realize that these policies neither strengthen us nor weaken the Sandinistas?

HEADLINE: Even in Absence, Koch Draws Most Debate Fire

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD D. MAY

 BODY:
Even in his absence, Mayor Edward I. Koch was the target of most of the spirited exchanges among his three Democratic opponents at a debate conducted yesterday by Spanish-language radio and television stations.
Borough President David N. Dinkins of Manhattan charged that Mr. Koch declined to participate because ''he doesn't have sufficient respect for the Latino community of New York.''
Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and Richard Ravitch agreed. ''I, too, think it shows a lack of respect for the Hispanic community,'' said Mr. Ravitch, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Tranportation Authority. 
In a telephone interview, Paul A. Crotty, Mr. Koch's campaign manager, said the Mayor did not attend because ''we're not doing any more debates.''
 
Koch Blamed for Racism
He said Mr. Dinkins had declined to attend a debate on Aug. 20 at another Spanish-language radio station. ''I don't think Dinkins intended any slight then and we certainly don't intend any now,'' Mr. Crotty said.
Members of Mr. Dinkins's staff said he was not at the previous debate because management of that station, WSKQ, was favorable to Mr. Koch.
The two Republican candidates, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ronald S. Lauder, also declined invitations to participate in yesterday's hour-long forum at the studios of Channel 41 in Secaucus, N.J. The Republican and Democratic candidates have not yet appeared together in a debate.
The three Democratic candidates held Mayor Koch accountable for problems like corruption, homelessness and racism.
 
Bensonhurst Killing Mentioned
Alluding to the bias-related killing of a black youth in Bensonhurst last week, Mr. Dinkins said that ''the Mayor sets the tide and tone with respect to race generally.''
But Mr. Dinkins said he does not believe racism infects all white New Yorkers. ''Most people do not agree with those standing on the sidelines jeering and shouting racial slurs,'' he said, referring to whites who heckled marchers in Bensonhurst.
He also implicitly criticized some of the marchers who shouted back at the hecklers. ''To say 'Bensonhurst' or 'Howard Beach,' '' he said, ''is to suggest that everyone there is guilty. We ought not impute to everyone the despicable acts of a few.''
Some of the questions posed by the debate's moderators, Maria Celeste Araras of Channel 41 and Dr. Orlando Garcia of radio station WADO, suggested the extent to which many Hispanic people view themselves as a distinct group, rather than as part of a larger minority community.
 
'A Genius for Dividing Us'
Ms. Araras quoted a study that found the income of ''Anglo-Saxon and African-American families'' increased during the last 12 years, while the income of the average Puerto Rican family dropped.
''Don't you believe that the economic problems of the Hispanic merit special attention?'' she asked. All three candidates said they did. The debate was generally low key, a mood the participants also attributed to the Mayor's absence. ''He has a genius for dividing us,'' Mr. Goldin said.
The Comptroller occasionally lashed out at Mr. Dinkins. ''David,'' he said, ''leadership is not just saying to the people, 'Whatever you want I'll give you.' ''
Mr. Dinkins remained largely aloof from his onstage opponents. Only once did he strike them with a rhetorical back of the hand, in answer to a question about why the candidates had not advertised more in the Spanish-language media. ''Some of us,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''aren't finished yet.''
All questions were asked in Spanish with translations for the candidates, none of whom is proficient in the language native to an estimated 10 percent of New York's Democratic primary electorate.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
White House

BYLINE: By Bernard Weinraub Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 31

 BODY:
It may be a variation of the ''good-cop, bad-cop'' routine. It may be a subtle political ploy. Or it may be only symbolic of the way George Bush conducts business.
Whatever the case, the President and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney are plainly engaged in a minuet over the Soviet Union. 
Four months ago Mr. Cheney said in an interview that he believed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would fail in his efforts to change the Soviet Union's economic and political policies and might be replaced by a leader more hostile to the West. The White House, which has welcomed Mr. Gorbachev's moves toward more openness in the Soviet Union, cringed a bit in public but privately shrugged off Mr. Cheney's remarks.
Last week, in a speech to a veterans' group, the Defense Secretary criticized his former colleagues in the House for shifting funds from programs given priority by Mr. Bush to programs favored by members of the House. Mr. Cheney said they voted as they did ''not because they had a better idea about how to deter the Soviet threat, but because many of them seemed to think there is no real threat anymore.''
He asserted that the Soviet threat had not shrunk and added, ''If anything, the United States is facing a more formidable, offensive strategic arsenal today.''
This time there was barely even public discomfort with Mr. Cheney's tough words, which ran counter to the positive messages conveyed by the President. In fact, White House officials said the Secretary's comments were welcome and, in some ways, reflected Mr. Bush's views.
''It's more a matter of emphasis; there's no lack of agreement,'' said one White House official, who contended that the President was far warier of the Soviets in private than in public.
Another senior White House official said: ''There's no inherent contradiction. You want to be absolutely sure you're responding to real changes in the Soviet Union, and there are ambiguities about what's going on in Soviet military policy. They're modernizing their forces very effectively, whatever their level of rhetoric.''
If White House officials say the President and his Defense Secretary are whistling the same tune, however discordant the separate notes, they also acknowledge that both Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney derive considerable political benefit from their dual approach to the Soviet Union.
On Mr. Cheney's part, the move to take the lead as an advocate of military spending and a hard line toward the Soviet Union is clearly an effort to adopt a role similar to the one played by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger in the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Bush, who has given his Cabinet officers considerable leverage, also derives some political benefit from the Defense Secretary's comments. They serve to deflect criticisms from conservative lawmakers nervous about Soviet intentions, officials say.
''There's a lot of good-cop, bad-cop business here,'' said Fred Greenstein, a Presidential scholar at Princeton. ''It was a central method of the Eisenhower Presidency. Eisenhower was mister sweetness and accommodation in international relations, and Dulles was the zealous proponent of the Communist menace. It suited Eisenhower's needs perfectly, just as it suits Bush's needs.
''When Cheney says this, it reaches across a broad range in the Republican Party's constituency. And it may send an important signal in international relations as well.''
Mr. Cheney's comments also reflect the latitude that Mr. Bush has given to Cabinet officers, a management style that some political analysts say may change over the next few years.
''Bush, like most Presidents, wanted a strong Cabinet, able to speak out,'' said Richard E. Neustadt, professor emeritus at Harvard who is an authority on the Presidency. ''But all Presidents get increasingly irritated as time goes on, and believe in Cabinet government less and less.''

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
Envoys' Spouses Learn What a Man's Place Is

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Practicing the etiquette of a diplomatic spouse, a Washington real estate lawyer stepped up to President Bush at a recent White House reception and introduced himself as ''Mr. Julia Chang Bloch.''
The lawyer, Stuart Bloch, is a member of a rarefied club. He is a diplomatic husband.
With 9 women nominated and 3 more appointments planned, President Bush has set a record in naming women as ambassadors; of an ambassadorial corps of 145, 6 people were women when Mr. Bush assumed office. And that has put their husbands in a somewhat unaccustomed role. 
''We all felt very proud of our wives,'' said Mr. Bloch, who has just completed a two-week Foreign Service training session for ambassadorial couples. ''But we did see ourselves as kind of freaks,'' he said. There were four other male spouses in the group.
 
Ambassador Scores a First
His wife, Julia Chang Bloch, being sworn in next Thursday as the new Ambassador to Nepal, speaks eight languages, has a master's degree from Harvard in government and East Asian regional studies, and has served in a number of high-level jobs with the Agency for International Development, which administers foreign aid abroad. She is the first Asian-American to serve as an ambassador. .
Until 1971, the diplomatic spouse was almost always a wife, and any female Foreign Service officers had to resign if they married. Although unpaid, the wife was considered a member of a diplomatic team, and her performance was evaluated and included in her husband's career record.
As the diplomatic service underwent changes, wives were no longer ''required'' to perform diplomatic duties. In high-profile capitals, nonetheless, the ambassadorial wife is still expected to manage the resident staff, entertain with elan and be a very visible presence at her husband's side.
And now, so is the husband, if his wife is the ambassador.
Having completed the training at the Foreign Service Institute, Mr. Bloch is now accomplished, he says with a smile, in such diplomatic refinements as redecorating an embassy, packing and shipping, and handling a social calendar.
 
Some Problems, Like Alcohol
While the ambassador-designates were studying terrorism and foreign policy, Mr. Bloch and the other spouses joined Barbara Bush for tea and on another occasion had lunch with Susan Baker, wife of the Secretary of State.
''We had our own media training session,'' said Mr. Bloch, ''and we got to do some role-playing. They gave us problems to solve, such as what to do with a spouse of an officer who had an alcohol problem and it comes to your attention. How would you involve the Ambassador?''
''As far as I know, this is the largest number of women ambassadors ever,'' said Brandon Grove, director of the Foreign Service Institute. Because of the novel role of their husbands, he said, ''we've asked some spouses who have had similar experiences to come in to meet with them and answer such questions as, 'What is is like to go into receptions very much behind your wife?' ''
''No matter what you've done before, being an ambassador is different,'' Mr. Grove said. He told of the training sessions, in matters like managing an embassy, pulling a team together and promoting American business abroad. ''The couple is considered a team,'' he said, ''and we talk about ethics, protocol, security, gift giving and the American community beyond the embassy walls. It is like being mayor of an American village.''
 
Political Rewards Are Defended
Several of Mr. Bush's ambassadors, men and women, have been criticized by Senate Democrats and the Academy of Diplomacy, a group of retired American diplomats, as ''unqualified'' appointees whose campaign contributions outweighed their experience. The Administration has defended rewarding political loyalty as a tradition.
Fritz-Alan Korth, whose wife, Penne, has been nominated to be Ambassador to Mauritius, plans to spend as much time there as he can spare from his corporate law practice. He notes that the island in the Indian Ocean is ''five hundred miles east of Madagascar, 13 hours from Paris or London.''
Mrs. Korth, a Texan who worked on George Bush's first campaign for Congress, was co-chairman of the Presidential inauguration and is known on the Washington scene as an organizer of benefit balls and fund-raising events. In Mauritius, it will be Mr. Korth's turn, he said, to ''become involved in eleemosynary affairs -nonprofit, community, charity-related things.''
 
'I Had A Lot to Learn'
And he says he has been invited to join ''the one thing that they have not as yet desexed,'' the Foreign Service Wives Association.
A Korth companion in spouse-training, Richard Novetzke, is the husband of Sally Novetzke, Ambassador-designate to Malta. Mr. Novetzke owns a manufacturing company that he said ''will run without me for any given period of time.''
''Fritz and I are both very proud of our wives and what they have accomplished,'' Mr. Novetzke remarked in a telephone conversation from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ''I welcomed the training course because I felt I had a lot to learn and needed some preparation for what we feel is a very serious reponsibility.''
''I believe this is the first time Sally has ever drawn a paycheck, but she has paid her dues,'' he added, speaking of his wife's work as a ''career volunteer'' for charitable and political causes. Mrs. Novetzke is chairman of the Iowa Republican Party and has known George Bush since she was co-chairman of his 1980 Presidential campaign in Iowa. ''Sally was one of the first people who met him when he pulled into town and was starting to throw out feelers,'' her husband said.
 
Several Departures Are Due
The new Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, the veteran diplomat Shirley Temple Black, and her husband, Charles, who took language training together, left for Prague in early August. A former director of the Peace Corps, Loret Miller Ruppe, and her husband, Philip Ruppe, a former member of Congress, left for her post in Oslo last week. And Ambassador Bloch will be heading for Nepal on Sept. 15, her husband to follow in November.
''I think we've always been a team, but in our society the man is usually the dominant partner,'' Mrs. Bloch said as she discussed the untested waters ahead. ''And I guess even in a situation where the wife is the ambassador, there are occasions where, nevertheless, officials might look to the husband.
''Before Loret Ruppe went off to Norway,'' Mrs. Bloch recalled, ''she said that during a conversation about NATO defense issues, she found everyone directed the conversation to Philip. She told me: 'I guess we will just have to work this out.' ''

HEADLINE: Summer's Farewell Party: Everyone Is Invited

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
LABOR DAY first marched onto the calendar more than a century ago as a celebration of working-class solidarity, yet today the holiday has become summer's bittersweet finale. While other seasons may fade in and out, governed more by climate than calendar, summer comes to an all-too-abrupt end with the arrival of the first Monday in September.
But before the traditional season of fun and sun gives way to the presumably more serious pursuits of autumn, summer will have its last hurrah in New York with a long list of festivities. Music and theater will be found in many city parks, as the outdoor performing-arts season comes more or less to a close with the final programs of such free series as Summerstage in Central Park, Celebrate Brooklyn in Prospect Park and the Riverside Arts Festival in Riverside Park. In addition, fireworks will explode above the East River on Sunday night, arts-and-crafts fairs will be held from the Upper West Side and Greenwich Village to Staten Island, and hundreds of thousands of working men and women are expected to parade up Fifth Avenue on Monday. Meanwhile, urban swimmers and sun worshippers will have their last chance to indulge themselves, as New York's beaches and outdoor swimming pools close for the season on Monday. 
The city's biggest bash will be the 22d annual West Indian-American carnival in Brooklyn, which will include daily concerts on the grounds of the Brooklyn Museum, at Washington Avenue and Eastern Parkway, and one of the country's most colorful, boisterous and well-attended parades to wind things up on Monday. The line-up of evening concerts will feature a ''Reggae Night Festival,'' with Frankie Paul and a half-dozen other reggae bands, tonight at 8 o'clock; the annual Steelband Panorama Competition, tomorrow night at 8, with more than 10 dueling bands, including last year's winner, the BWIA Sonatas; and an all-star ''Dimanche Gras'' show of calypso and other Caribbean music and dance, with Mighty Sparrow, Moko Jumbie and many other performers, on Sunday night at 8. Tickets are $25 to $20. Information: (718) 773-4052 or (718) 774-8807.
The festive excitement of Mardi Gras in New Orleans or Carnival in Rio or Trinidad can be experienced in the heart of Brooklyn on Monday, when tens of thousands of revelers and as many as two million spectators descend on Eastern Parkway for the West Indian parade. Calypso, reggae and steel bands will perform, as the parkway turns into a sea of exotic-looking celebrants donning gigantic, elaborate costumes that depict everything from ancient warriors to futuristic space voyagers. The parade will begin at 10 A.M. at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, and is expected to finish around 6 P.M. at a reviewing stand in front of the Brooklyn Museum, where there will also be a stage with entertainment.
''The carnival is spectacle and color and pageantry, and the costumes usually illustrate the kind of program a band is projecting,'' explained Chris King, the executive director of the Caribbean-American Center of New York. ''For example, one on the heartland of Africa might have colorful plumes and leopard skins, or one depicting a journey beneath the sea might have aqua colors and fish images.''
Toddlers and teen-agers will also play a role in the weekend's West Indian festivities, beginning tonight at 6:30 with a free performance by the Marie Brooks Dancers and Drummers on the roof of the Brooklyn Children's Museum, 145 Brooklyn Avenue in the Crown Heights section. Admission: $2. Information: (718) 735-4400.
A children's Caribbean carnival will begin tomorrow with a parade, featuring musicians and other performers and marchers, tomorrow at 10 A.M. at Brooklyn Avenue, and will proceed along President Street to Washington Avenue and the Brooklyn Museum grounds. The free Kiddies Carnival, at the museum will continue on Sunday from 12:30 to 4:30 P.M., with many costumed bands.
For an insider's look at these children's festivities, the calypso pianist Daphne Weeks will lead a tour tomorrow at 1 P.M. sponsored by the Brooklyn Historical Society. It meets near the token booth of the Brooklyn Museum/Eastern Parkway subway station. The cost is $8. Information: (718) 624-0890. 'STAY IN SCHOOL' CONCERTS.On the eve of the new school year, teen-age festivalgoers will be encouraged not to drop out during a ''Stay in School'' concert of rap and freestyle music at the Brooklyn Museum grounds from 1 to 4 P.M. today. The program will be repeated for Manhattan audiences tomorrow from 3 to 6 P.M. at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center. These free performances are sponsored by the Caribbean Cultural Center, a Hispanic educational group called Aspira of New York, and the city's Board of Education. Information: 307-7420. AFRO-CARIBBEAN MUSIC.Afro-Caribbean music will also resound from the Prospect Park Band Shell, barely a mile from the Brooklyn Museum, beginning with a concert tonight at 8 o'clock by Professor Yaa-Lengi and African Contempo, a band from Zaire that plays contemporary African music, and Nehesu, a group that plays traditional music. This final weekend of free concerts of the 11th annual Celebrate Brooklyn Performing Arts Festival will continue tomorrow at 8 P.M. with Kimati Dinizulu and his Kotoko Society, presenting ''sankofa'' music, and Ladygourd Sangoma, an all-woman African ensemble whose performances combine dance, music and storytelling. And on Sunday at 8 P.M., the Skatalites, a Jamaican pop band, and Randy Grant's Dynasty, a group from Trinidad and Barbados, will perform. Admission: $1. The band shell is near Prospect Park West and Ninth Street. Information: (718) 768-0699. FIREWORKS OVER EAST RIVER.A different sort of big bang is on tap above the East River on Sunday night at 9:30, when the South Street Seaport and Garden State Fireworks present a 30-minute fireworks show choreographed to classic rock-and-roll songs. This multicolored, high-decibel display should be visible in Manhattan from the Brooklyn Bridge to Wall Street, and on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. A two-and-one-half-hour Seaport Line fireworks cruise, featuring live music and dancing, will depart from Pier 16 at 8 P.M. Tickets are $20. Information: 406-3434.
PIER 16 CONCERTS.Pier 16 will also beckon to those who want to relive the proverbial golden days of rock-and-roll. Three days of free concerts by pop groups of the 1950's and 60's will begin with the Regents, a doo-wop band, tomorrow at 1, 4 and 7 P.M. The Marvelettes, one of the Motown ''girl groups'' of the early 60's, will perform on Sunday at 1, 4 and 7 P.M., and the Duprees will end the weekend with classic rock on Monday at 1, 4 and 7 P.M. Information: 732-7678. CENTRAL PARK CONCERTS.Central Park will be alive with free performances that run the gamut from modern dance to classic rock-and-roll and Trinidadian soca music during the final weekend of this year's Summerstage series at the 72d Street Band Shell. Yoshiko Chuma and the School of Hard Knocks, a troupe that makes dance out of everyday movements, will be featured tonight at 8:30, along with works by the Puerto Rican choreographers Merian Soto and Pepon Osorio and music by the percussionist Bobby Previte. Bo Diddley, the legendary rock guitarist of the 1950's, will perform tomorrow at 3 P.M., and performers from Trinidad who blend soul music and calypso - David Rudder, Charlie's Roots and Tambu -are scheduled for Sunday at 3 P.M. Bleachers and benches can accommodate about 2,000 people, and there is standing room for 6,000 more. Information: 860-1335. WOLLMAN RINK CARNIVAL.Clowns, games and music will come to the park's southern end for a weekend carnival at Wollman Rink (near 64th Street), which has been transformed into a roller-skating rink and a miniature golf course with models of New York buildings. Hours are 10 A.M. to 11 P.M. (till 9:30 on Sunday and this Monday). The fees for roller-skating are $5 ($2 for children), plus a $2.50 skate rental, and for miniature golf $4 ($2.50 for the elderly, $2 for children). Information: 517-4800. 'TITUS' AT DELACORTE.A mile uptown, in the Delacorte Theater, Shakespeare's ''Titus Andronicus'' will have its final performances at the Delacorte Theater tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8 o'clock. This grisly, rarely performed tale of a Roman military hero and his merciless enemy will conclude Joseph Papp's 27th season of free Shakespeare in Central Park. Tickets are distributed at the theater, near West 81st Street, after 6:15 P.M. on the day of each performance. Information: 861-7277. 'MACHINE' IN A PARK.Another not-so-light piece of free outdoor theater will be presented in several city parks this weekend, as a company called A Matinee Idyll presents Jean Cocteau's ''Infernal Machine.'' The French playwright's retelling of the Oedipus legend will be performed today at 4 P.M. in the Tompkins Square Park Band Shell, Avenue A and Seventh Street, and tomorrow and Sunday at 4 P.M. at the Overlook Terrace in Fort Tryon Park. Information: (201) 867-1575. RIVERSIDE ARTS FESTIVAL.On the western edge of the Upper West Side, Heather Cornell and three other dancers with the group Manhattan Tap will kick off the last weekend of the fifth annual Riverside Arts Festival tomorrow at 4 P.M. at the West 79th Street Rotunda. Before a sunset concert by Pe-de-Boi, a nine-piece Brazilian samba band, tomorrow evening at 6, complimentary champagne and cake will be served to concertgoers. Two jazz concerts will conclude the series on Sunday, beginning at 1 P.M. with the David (Fathead) Newman Quintet, the saxophonist Clifford Jordan and the pianist Buddy Montgomery; at 4 P.M., two Steinway grands will be set up for Kenny Barron and John Hicks.

The band Loup Garou will give a free performance from 2 to 4:30 P.M. on the plaza of the World Financial Center in Battery Park City. The rain date is Monday. Information: 945-0505. Nearby, a tribe of 16 growling, menacing, make-believe dinosaurs confronts visitors to the lobby of 2 World Financial Center, at 225 Liberty Street. These huge animated creatures have aluminum skeletons and foam-rubber skins and move with the help of compressed-air pistons through environments made to look like their native habitats. They are on view through Jan. 1.

Information: 786-0666. CONCERTS IN QUEENS.Queens will not be without outdoor music this weekend. One of New York's most venerable and populist musical institutions, the Seuffert Band - a big, boisterous ensemble that has been giving open-air summer concerts since the consolidation of New York City's five boroughs in 1898 - will give a free concert on Sunday at 3 P.M. in the Forest Park Music Grove, near Forest Park Drive, off Woodhaven Boulevard, in the Glendale section. The performance, which is part of a 52-concert season that extends from June to October, will include everything from arias by Verdi, Rossini and Wagner to patriotic anthems. George Seuffert, who has conducted the band for 61 years, said: ''I follow the principle of my old friend John Philip Sousa that there should be something on the program for everyone.'' In case of rain, the concert will be presented in the Monsignor Mulz Auditorium, at Jamaica Avenue and 88th Street. Information: (718) 428-1973. Patriotic and classical music can also be heard tonight at 8, when the 40-member 26th United States Army Band of New York City gives a free concert in Kissena Park, Oak Avenue and 164th Street in Flushing. Information: (718) 520-5900. LIGHTS AT EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. Patriotic sentiments will be in evidence also at the Empire State Building, which will be bathed in red, white and blue lights above its 79th floor, tonight through Monday from dusk to dawn. RICHMOND COUNTY FAIR.A bit of small-town Americana can be found at Richmondtown Restoration, the 96-acre restored village on Staten Island, where the annual Richmond County Fair will be held this weekend. There will be food, crafts and entertainers of almost every stripe, from rock-and-rollers to belly dancers and barbershop quartets, not to mention a Miss Richmond County Fair Contest tomorrow. But the real fun for otherwise jaded New Yorkers will be the 90 or so competitions that include frog jumping, raisin spitting, hollering and - believe it or not -racing with beds on wheels. The village's historic houses will be closed during the fair, which will take place tomorrow and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. The restoration is at 441 Clarke Avenue and is accessible by the S113 bus from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. Admission is $4; $3 for the elderly, and $1 for children. Information: (718) 351-1617. WASHINGTON SQUARE ART SHOW.A more familiar historic village -Greenwich - will be the setting for the 116th semiannual Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibition. The work of more than 300 artists, in watercolor, oil, sculpture and photography, will adorn the sidewalks of University Place from 13th Street to Waverly Place; Washington Square East to Third Street; La Guardia Place from the park south to Houston Street, and Fifth Avenue from Eighth to 10th Streets. In addition, 50 artisans working in glass, silver, pottery, jewelry and other media will also display their wares. The show runs from noon to sundown, tomorrow through Monday (and on Sept. 9 and 10); admission is free. Information: 982-6255. LINCOLN CENTER CRAFTS FESTIVAL. Another fair that is becoming a holiday-weekend staple is the Autumn Crafts Festival at Lincoln Center's Fordham University Plaza, at 62d Street and Columbus Avenue. More than 300 artisans from throughout the United States will display their creations, running from textiles and toys to furniture and jewelry, and various craft techniques will be demonstrated. Three bands will play Dixieland, bluegrass and other traditional American music, and fairgoers are invited to go square dancing or clogging. Admission is free. Festival hours are 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. tomorrow through Monday and Sept. 9 and 10. Information: 677-4627. PARADE IN MANHATTAN.But for those who want to remember what Labor Day was originally about, the annual Labor Day parade on Monday is expected to draw as many as 400,000 marchers representing more than 400 unions, as well as many marching bands, floats and politicians. The parade will start at 11 A.M. at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street and will proceed up the avenue to 72d Street, where it will turn east toward Third Avenue. The theme this year is ''fighting for worker-protection legislation'' to improve health and disability coverage and unemployment, family-leave and other benefits, said Ted Jacobsen, the secretary of the New York City Central Labor Council, which is sponsoring the event. Information: 685-9552.

HEADLINE: A New York During the 'World of Tomorrow'

BYLINE: By RICHARD F. SHEPARD

 BODY:
When you and I were young, Maggie, there were El trains over Third and Sixth Avenues, cafeterias that were social centers for the otherwise unoccupied, demonstrations in Union Square, burlesque on 42d Street and such Mayors as Jimmy Walker and Fiorello H. La Guardia, who were nothing if not colorful, although not in the same way. That was a long time ago, 50 years and more back, but, art being art, it has not all vanished with time, and you can see it all hanging out on the main floor of the Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103d Street.
There were great artists then and there were hungry artists - sometimes one and the same - and they rushed to immortalize New York City, so enchanting a model, one that posed for no fee, in oils, drawings, sculptures and photographs. This old New York has come out of the museum's copious collection. Jan Seidler Ramirez, its curator of paintings and sculpture, has chosen 35 works that admirably seem to fit the show's title: ''Window on Wonder City: New York in the World's Fair Era.'' 
The idea is to let New Yorkers see what the place looked like from 1929 - that's when the stock market crashed, sonny - to 1945, when World War II ended and New York City was adjusting to the change from the Depression and war into a new era of prosperity and peace. New York held its World's Fair, the ''World of Tomorrow,'' in 1939-40, about midway through the era.
For New Yorkers of an age to remember (often the age when it's hard to remember), the comparatively compact exhibition is like an installment of ''This Is Your Life.'' For New Yorkers whose familiarity with those times ranks with their memories of the Gallic Wars, it is surely a show that must arouse at least a shudder of primal memory at the different settings of a stage that somehow seems familiar.
 
Ben Shahn's Demonstrators
All the artists are good, and some are better known than others. Ben Shahn has two paintings here, ''W.C.T.U. Parade'' and ''Parade for Repeal,'' studies for what was to have been a mural for the Central Park Casino. The Women's Christian Temperance Union demonstrators have a sharp no-nonsense rectitude about them. The repeal gentlemen, led by natty Jimmy Walker in the vicinity of a closed-down speak-easy whose frustrated patrons stand thirstily outside, are Shahnian types, businessmen who easily mix profitable principle and bourgeois respectability.
Reginald Marsh's affinity for plebeian New York is exemplified twice. ''Harris Theater, New York'' (1940) depicts the cheap flash of West 42d Street with its earthy women and men in front of the theater that opened as a legitimate movie house but was converted to Grade-B status.
''No. 6, the Bowery'' (1944), an address at the corner of Doyers Street, now in Chinatown, depicts the elevated train curving over a shop whose sign is a huge shaving mug; No. 6, the caption says, was the site of the Olliffe pharmacy, said to be the oldest drugstore in the country.
Chinatown, a curious, diminutive enclave a half-century ago, also caught the eye of James W. Kerr, whose 1931 oil ''In Chinatown, New York City'' takes in Mott Street from the window of the Port Arthur Restaurant, a slice of street life that but for one Chinese sign could be any mundane working-class New York neighborhood.
A Jo Davidson bronze, ''James J. Walker'' (1931), done just before the investigation that led to the resignation of this Mayor, who was also a songwriter and man-about-town, is one of a handsome, perhaps carefree fellow of good will and maybe even a touch of dignity. Isabella Howland's ''Fiorello La Guardia, Mayor of New York 1934-1945'' is a bronze of a different thrust; it captures the Little Flower as pugnacious and determined, the sort of man beloved by New Yorkers not so much for his incorruptibility, which was legendary in a city where corruption was common, but for his ability to resonate with the lives of the citizenry, to embody the spirit of the tumultuous but always compelling town.
 
The Market Collapse
All the parts of New York that existed seem to be represented here. ''Interior of the New York Stock Exchange, October 29, 1929'' is a pen-and-ink work by Samuel Cahan, who was there on the day of the market's collapse and drew the scene for the next day's paper. Paolo Cornio caught another milestone of local history with his oil ''The First Night Game at Yankee Stadium, May 28, 1946.'' Fifth Avenue, First Avenue, Times Square, a Hooverville in Central Park and Rockefeller Center, they are all here in art as they were a half-century ago in fact.
The artworks will be on view through Jan. 14, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays and 1 to 5 P.M. Sundays. Admission is $3; $1.50 for the elderly; $1 for children under 12; $5 for family groups. Information: 534-1034. One added attraction at a preview this week will not run with the show. This was the presence of two artists represented in the exhibition, both of them who have lived most of their lives in Greenwich Village and who treasure memories of lives immersed in art.
''Here are a few paintings that bring back the good old days,'' said Vincent LaGambina, whose 1936 work ''The Life Cafeteria'' depicts women at a table in a cafeteria on Seventh Avenue at Christopher Street that was frequented by artists. Mr. LaGambina spoke with a blend of nostalgia and realism. ''We lived above a cafe,'' he said. ''We used to go ask them for the hard, unusable bread to feed to the dog. Then we soaked it, heated it and ate it ourselves.''
Mr. LaGambina, who was born in 1909, recalled the first Washington Square Art Show in 1933.
''Marsh, Soyer, they all had things in it,'' he said. ''Mrs. Whitney, I don't remember which one, gave each artist a free lunch and a pack of cigarettes.''
 
Union Square Riot
Peter Hopkins was a teen-ager when he heard of a disturbance at Union Square, not far from where he lived. That was before he thought of a life in art. Seventeen years later, working from notes and memory, he did the large canvas on view at the museum: ''Riot at Union Square, March 6, 1930.'' It is a piece that reflects violence during a demonstration by the unemployed. Mounted police officers try to constrain participants and a fire hose snakes through the crowd. Reporters stand calmly apart taking notes.
''I studied with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League after the war,'' said the 77-year-old Mr. Hopkins, whose painting has also been put on view by the American Academy and by the National Institute of Arts and Letters. ''I remember that scene in Union Square. There was violence on both sides. The demonstrators seemed to me as rough as the cops. The view is from Broadway and 17th Street. That is where the real cavalry charge came from, but I turned it around for effect in the painting.
''Isabel Bishop, the artist, lived across from Union Square. If you look in a window in the painting, you can see her standing at it and looking out. Very faintly. No, I don't know if she ever noticed it, even when she was one of a panel that picked it for an exhibition.''
Mr. Hopkins looked about at this testimony to old New York and said, ''Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a different world of the far distant future.''

HEADLINE: Auctions

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
If America's fascination with automobiles can be termed a love affair, then what started last night in Auburn, Ind., is an orgy of national proportion. Something like 150,000 people are expected to drop in.
The six-day party is the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg Club's 34th annual festival, and it combines a reunion of the classic-car club's 1,800 members with flapjack breakfasts, art shows, parades, a golf tournament and the largest collector-car auction in the world.
In all, 2,500 rather special cars will move across the block, with a like number being sold privately by their owners in a gigantic corral at the new 250-acre ''auction park'' operated by Kruse International. The company, with its home office at the park, holds 42 auctions every year around the country, and it sells an average of 10,000 cars, none of which are really average. 
''This time around, we have a 1962 Ferrari GTO that should bring from $3 million to $5 million,'' said Dean V. Kruse, national sales manager for the auction house. ''We have a '64 Bentley that was the last car Charlie Chaplin ever owned. And we have Marilyn Monroe's red Dodge convertible.''
 
Galaxy of Duesenbergs
The 30 to 40 ''celebrity cars'' will go on the block at 1 P.M. Monday, but the real attraction begins under the 600-foot-long big top at 2 P.M. Sunday. That is when the Duesenbergs -those ne plus ultra American classics of the 1920's and 30's - pass one by one in front of the auctioneer.
''We'll have 15 Duesenbergs, the most ever auctioned,'' Mr. Kruse said. ''Four or five of those Duesies should bring a tremendous amount of money. I'd like to think we could set a record, but it gets harder all the time. Still, a couple of the Duesenbergs might bring upward of $2 million.''
Mr. Kruse knows about records, and he holds more than a few of them, having handled the $6.5 million sale of a 1931 Bugatti Royale and the $1.4 million paid for the most expensive Duesenberg to date, a 1933 Model J that belonged to Greta Garbo.
The Model J was manufactured by Fred Duesenberg and E. L. Cord, who introduced it in 1928. It was big, powerful and fast. And it was amazingly expensive for the time, carrying a price tag that began at $8,500 for a stripped chassis. Because of that, production was low, and it ended when the company folded in 1937. Nonetheless, about 100 Duesenbergs are expected to be in Auburn this weekend.
That will be more Duesenbergs than anyone has ever seen at one time, Mr. Kruse said, noting that even the factory never had that many on hand. Tomorrow, the cars will lead the Parade of Classics through midtown Auburn, then will park in Courthouse Square to be photographed and generally adored.
 
Interest From Abroad
In the auction tent, cars will be displayed on a turntable, with bidders in their own section and the rest of the crowd sitting in the bleachers. On Monday, the Financial News Network will broadcast the auction on cable television and registered bidders will be able to bid by phone. The show starts at 2 P.M., Eastern daylight time, and the number to call for registration is (800) 328-0771.
As in the past, many of the bidders will come to Indiana from Europe, looking for good buys on cars made in their own countries, which they can take home duty free. But this year at least 27 of the bidders will come from Japan.
''Last year, we only had 12 people from Japan,'' Mr. Kruse said. ''But they spent $3 million, and they seem to like big American cars from the 50's and 60's.''
Those cars, the convertibles and specialty automobiles like Ford's Thunderbird, may set records this week. ''We have one guy who says he's bringing the best '57 T-Bird in the world,'' Mr. Kruse said. ''The record price for that car is $70,000, and he says he wants $100,000.''
 
Making a Small Fortune
The auctioneer said he has watched an evolution of prices as collectors began to seek the cars of the 50's and 60's. ''Cars take a big jump when they've had their 20th birthday,'' he said. ''I tell people to buy a General Motors, Ford or Chrysler convertible that's 17 or 18 years old. Make sure it's red, white or black, and that car will double or triple pretty quickly.''
Some collectors appear to make quite a lot of money that way. ''They move up,'' Mr. Kruse said. ''We've had people buy and sell through us over the years. They start with a Chevy and pretty soon they're into the classics. We've had people become millionaires.''
That doesn't tell the whole story, of course, and a gamble is a gamble.
David Brownell, the editor of Special Interest Autos magazine, agreed that prices are holding strong and growing nicely.
''The quality cars just keep sustaining,'' he said. ''I don't see any particular end to it, and it will be interesting to see if that can carry on. It's sort of in defiance of everything you know about economics.''
But it is also important to know what you are doing, he said.
''There's a lot of guys out there licking their wounds,'' he said. ''I went to an auction a couple of weeks ago and saw a '34 Packard go for $135,000. In 1979, that same car sold for 70 grand, and the buyer tore the thing apart and restored it. To what end, I don't know, because this was a perfectly beautiful original car. So he ended up getting less than he invested.''
With cars, Mr. Brownell said, sometimes the way to make a small fortune is to start with a big one.

HEADLINE: Shifting Sands, Instant Forecasts

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Just one month ago, most economic forecasters employed by banks and brokerage houses were warning of an imminent recession; now they are celebrating continued growth. Economic miracle? Hardly. Such sudden shifts have more to do with the nature of a forecaster's job than with what is actually happening to the economy.
''We are all so eager to signal changes in the economy's direction that we jump to conclusions based on very tentative information,'' said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York. ''I have to deal with currency traders and their customers, and they want to know where interest rates and the dollar are going.''
The problem is particularly noticeable when the American economy is passing through an in-between period, as it is today, and could slip into recession or rebound. Given the uncertainty, the forecasters themselves acknowledge the futility of attempting to foretell the future. But they say they are compelled by their audience - mainly investors in stocks, bonds and currencies - to issue predictions anyway. 
 
'Bad Numbers'
So they provide running interpretations of the 30 or so important statistics released each month, although the data are often incomplete and later revised. ''We are making forecasts with bad numbers, but the bad numbers are all we've got,'' said Michael L. Penzer, senior economist at the Bank of America, whose own prediction is for continued growth.
The most recent swing in the forecasts came after the Government released figures this month showing unexpected strength in employment and retail sales - data that contradicted an earlier string of numbers indicating weakness in the economy. The new numbers produced some very noticeable about-faces.
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, had written on July 24 that ''a mild recession might already be starting.'' But three weeks later, his Monday newsletter said of the job data: ''It does raise the possibility that economic growth during the second half could be modestly positive.''
And David H. Resler and Carol A. Stone, the top economists at Nomura Securities International, acknowledged in their Aug. 18 newsletter that the employment and retail sales figures ''weaken the arguments (which we were making a few weeks ago) that the economy is in danger of slipping into a recession.''
 
A Puzzled Public
Such shifting views can be puzzling for the public, which gets most of its information about economic trends and the state of the economy from a group of fewer than 300 forecasters. Because they make an effort to publicize their predictions, their pronouncements are more widely circulated than those of other economists.
But the public is not the main audience for these forecasters. They operate chiefly for their customers, employed by banks and Wall Street brokerage houses, at salaries ranging from $150,000 to $300,000. Their running interpretations of the latest data are mainly for clients who need an up-to-the-minute view of the economy to help them trade stocks and bonds.
''When you are advising investors, you have to do it with conviction,'' said Scott Pardee, vice chairman at Yamaichi Securities, whose current conviction is continued growth. (In July, he was bracing for a downturn.) ''There are a lot of economists back at university jobs or driving trucks who did not have the guts to stick their necks out and make a forecast.''
In January and February, many forecasters had expected strong economic growth. That view gave way in the spring and early summer to predictions of a slide toward recession. And now the prevailing forecast is, once again, more economic expansion, at least for the rest of 1989.
 
One View Unchanged
''The sentiment swing has been bizarre,'' said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bank in San Francisco, who has not changed his own view that the economy is weakening. ''I've told my management that the mood will change back again.''
Paul Samuelson, a Nobel Memorial Laureate in Economic Science, says the public would be better served if the forecasters offered probabilities of what is ahead rather than convictions - for example, the probability of a 1989 recession is, say, 15 percent, of continued good times, 60 percent, and of a 1990 recession 25 percent. The complex and hard-to-fathom American economy does not permit greater precision, he said.
Economists who work for manufacturing companies like General Electric or Ford are not as dependent on the latest number as their Wall Street cousins. They tend to take a longer view, to help their companies devise long-term strategies. But the Wall Street forecasters say they have no choice but to treat just-issued numbers as if they were the final word on the economy.
That is because the current economic outlook - as determined by the forecasters' speedy interpretations of the numbers - can influence market prices over the next few hours or days; at most, for the next two or three weeks. That makes Wall Street forecasting useful, even though it might not be all that accurate over the long term.
 
Views Sought by Traders
Many forecasters circulate their views through newsletters, in interviews with reporters and in briefings for their firms' brokers and traders. The brokers, in turn, pass the forecasts to clients, who seek advice on whether to buy or sell securities.
Stock prices often go up on expectations of an economic upturn and rising corporate profits. Bond prices, on the other hand, are likely to rise when the outlook is for recession - and the expectation last spring of an imminent recession helped to create a bond rally. A weak economy usually leads to lower interest rates, and lower rates raise the value of bonds that had been issued during good times, at higher rates.
In their effort to advise clients, forecasters also take a more subtle factor into account. Wall Street economists pitch their predictions not only to their own evaluations of each new statistic, but also to how they think the Federal Reserve will interpret the data.
 
'Colors Our Forecasts'
''There is betting on what the Fed will do and that colors our forecasts,'' Mr. Pardee said. The Fed's view of the economy is important because of its power to manipulate interest rates and thus the value of the securities that the forecasters' clients trade.
Indeed, the widely proclaimed early-summer predictions of a downturn in the economy came in part from the conviction that the Federal Reserve, fearing a recession, was lowering interest rates to encourage people to spend on credit and thus stimulate the economy. The Fed did in fact lower an important rate three times in June and July, but then in August left it alone - a change of heart that the forecasters attributed partly to the strong numbers for employment and retail sales.
Whatever the Fed's reasoning was, the forecasters adjusted their predictions. ''Much of this game of forecasting has to do with what the Fed will do when it sees the numbers,'' said Albert Wojnilower, a senior economist at the First Boston Corporation.
 
August Data Awaited
This week, the numbers supported the forecasts of continued growth. But two important numbers are due out today. One is the August survey of 250 corporate purchasing managers. An index produced from this survey is a barometer of how manufacturers are doing. The other is the Labor Department's August job data.
''You lose credibility if you revise your forecast too frequently,'' said Mr. Penzer of Bank of America, ''but a bad purchasers' number plus weak job growth would make people nervous.'' For Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, two bad numbers will produce more than nervousness. ''We will be back in recession forecasts again,'' he said.
Quite apart from what the latest figures seem to foretell, huge revisions in earlier numbers - as updated information becomes available - also produce swings in Wall Street forecasting. Upward revisions in the April, May and June figures for job growth and retail sales were decisive in swinging forecasters away from their early-summer pessimism about the economy.
''Life today is forecasting before revisions and after them,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Post 1.7% Decline for July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Orders to American factories slumped 1.7 percent in July to the lowest level in eight months, the Government said today, in a report indicating that growth remains subdued.
In other signs of sluggishness, shipments of manufactured goods fell 1.9 percent, the sharpest drop since March 1986, and inventories shot up 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in five years.
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $231.3 billion, the lowest level since November and the second decline in three months. 
Orders rose six-tenths of 1 percent in June and fell 2.6 percent in May.
Recently, a string of strong statistical reports have indicated that fears of a recession this year are overblown. Retail sales, personal income and housing construction all rose in July, while unemployment edged down.
Economists said, however, that today's report, which showed weaker-than-expected factory orders, suggested the economy was far from robust.
 
'Sector Is Struggling'
''The manufacturing sector is struggling,'' said Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''So far this hasn't dragged down the aggregate economy, but it may yet.''
William K. MacReynolds of the United States Chamber of Commerce blamed the slowdown on the Federal Reserve Board's efforts during the first five months of this year to fight inflation by raising interest rates.
The policy has particularly hurt manufacturers that produce expensive durable goods like autombiles and appliances that are usually bought on credit, he said.
Since early June, the central bank has reversed course, allowing rates to decline slightly. But Mr. MacReynolds said: ''They've only backed off part way. Based on their statements, I don't expect them to ease further and unfortunately that could be a disaster for the economy.''
A rise in inventories without a corresponding increase in new orders can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories try to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots.
In July, orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, fell 2.2 percent, a revision from last week's estimate of a 1.9 percent decline. Orders for nondurable goods fell 1.1 percent.
In the important category of nonmilitary capital goods, a barometer of business investment plans, orders rose 5.7 percent in July after gaining 5 percent a month earlier.
But John Hagens, an economist with the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm, said the upturn was wholly concentrated in aircraft orders, which are booming as airline companies worldwide replace their aging fleets.
A 38.3 percent increase in new orders for aircraft in July pushed the transportation sector up 2.6 percent, despite weakness in automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding.
Much of the month's weakness was concentrated in orders for military goods, down 14.5 percent, and non-electrical machinery, down 10.5 percent.
Orders fell for glass products, fabricated metal products, engines and turbines, construction and mining equipment, computers, electronic components and scientific instruments. They rose for communications equipment.

HEADLINE: Wine Makers Face Hard Truth

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SONOMA, Calif.

 BODY:
With the sales decline that began in 1987 accelerating ominously, the worries of domestic wine makers are mounting, along with disagreements over how to respond.
Shipments of domestic wines, which declined 4.9 percent last year after falling 1 percent in 1987, have dropped 7 percent in the first six months of this year, compared with 1988. The overall decline is the longest since the Prohibition era ended in 1933 and stems, industry sources say, from consumer health concerns and a resistance to price increases.
The decline began with inexpensive and middle-priced wines but now, to the consternation of the $7 billion industry that has continually reassured itself that people are ''drinking less but drinking better,'' sales of wines that sell for $7.50 or more per 750-milliliter bottle are also clearly weakening. The sales growth for such ''super-premium'' wines slowed from more than 20 percent annually between 1983 and 1987 to just 6 percent in 1988, said Paul Gillette, publisher of the Wine Investor, an industry newsletter. 
 
'Is the Party Over?'
''That is a dramatic slowing,'' Mr. Gillette said. ''The question is: Is it a hiccup or is the party over? I myself think the party is over.''
Declining sales are not the only concern. Profits are being hurt as grape prices rise, and a flood of low-priced imports threatens to erode the 85 percent share of the United States market controlled by domestic producers. Moreover, all wine makers, domestic and foreign, are concerned about the impact of new Federal regulations requiring that wines bottled for sale in the United States after Nov. 18 be labeled with a warning that their contents should not be consumed during pregnancy and that drinking wine can impair the ability to drive and may cause health problems.
The tough times are stirring conflicts within the highly diversified domestic industry about what its problems are and how to respond. Wine is currently made in 43 states, although California accounted for 90 percent of last year's production. There are nearly 700 wineries in California alone, from tiny family-run concerns to multibillion-dollar corporations that sell other alcoholic beverages.
Some winery owners attribute the declining demand to the successes of anti-alcohol lobbyists they call neo-prohibitionists, and they are urging strong counterattacks. Others say the industry needs a less-combative profile, and they fear that speaking out will make them targets of product liability suits.
Vintners also disagree on who their allies should be. Some believe they should seek to distance wine from spirits and beer by promoting it as more healthful than those drinks and as an accompaniment to food. Others say the three alcoholic beverage industries should present a united front.
Still others say the wine industry's sagging sales owe less to critics of alcohol and health concerns than to its own failure to market effectively beyond the dedicated wine drinker. Vintners should not anticipate a reversal of the changes in life style that have many Americans drinking less, some wine makers and consultants say. Rather, the industry could reach a large new group of customers if it changed wine's elitist image.
Michael Mondavi, managing partner of the Robert Mondavi Winery, said the key to broadening the industry's customer base is education. ''The problem is we're talking to ourselves,'' he told vintners gathered at Vintage 2000, a symposium on the industry's future held recently at the Buena Vista Winery here in Sonoma. ''If we would do more teaching of the use and enjoyment of wine, and less selling to the same customer, we would expand our industry and have a stronger base.''
Mr. Gillette agreed, saying that wine has never become Americans' everyday beverage of choice. ''The soft-drink people have out-marketed us,'' he said.
But given the pressures on wine, some vintners say something more than Pepsi-style marketing may be necessary to halt the decline.
 
Three-Pronged Proposal
Marcus Moller-Racke, Buena Vista's president, has proposed a three-pronged program, part of which would be a national public relations program promoting responsible wine consumption and explaining how wine is used in simplified terms. In addition to such marketing, though, he said that the industry needs to encourage independent research to determine alcohol's positive and negative effects on health and that it should establish a national data bank on wine's impact on state and national economies, to be used in lobbying efforts.
''What matters is not only the taste of a new generation, but also to be understood and welcomed,'' Mr. Moller-Racke said. ''The promotion of quality - not quantity consumption -and the idea of designating a driver are part of our growing responsibility to maintain our industry's dignity and longevity.''
The disagreements over how to respond to the slowdown have been reflected in the recent formation of two national organizations intended to promote the wine industry's interests. These groups' efforts would supplement the lobbying activities of the Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, and the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America.
 
'Jockeying for Position'
''From where I sit, it looks like you've got three or four organizations duplicating each other's efforts, jockeying for position,'' Mr. Gillette said. ''I don't think they've resolved the differences between themselves.''
The first of the new organizations is the American Wine Alliance for Research and Education, or Aware, which was formed late last year, primarily to address health issues. It intends to publish both the positive and negative reports on wine's effects. Aware's founders include vintners and growers from across the country, but the Wine Institute is notably absent from its membership.
Instead, the institute has thrown its weight behind the National Wine Coalition, which was formed in May. The coalition's stated purpose is to develop an aggressive public education and information program to combat alcohol abuse, respond to critics and increase the public's knowledge of wine's proper use in American society. Unlike Aware, the coalition does not believe it needs to devote resources to presenting criticisms of wine as well as responses in order to establish credibility with consumers.
 
Effect of Health Concerns
Both groups believe that health concerns are affecting the industry. ''There is a lot of bad information out there getting headlines, and with our national health phobia, that information is grabbed onto, and people make adjustments in their lives,'' said Sandra MacIver, vice president of Aware and co-owner of the Matanzas Creek Winery in Santa Rosa, Calif.
Because so many small wineries are only marginally profitable, even the incremental decline in sales brought on by negative reports and warning labels can be devastating, Ms. MacIver said.
Barry Sterling, chairman of the National Wine Coalition and a partner in Iron Horse Vineyards in Sebastopol, Calif., said an early goal must be to demonstrate the industry's economic importance to policy makers and consumers. ''We are part of the 'sin' industry, and we are thought of as a quaint group of part-time farmers and thus easily sacrificed,'' he said. Statistics showing the wine industry's impact on tourism, hoteliers, retailers and others will demonstrate that ''there is an economic cost to hurting our industry,'' Mr. Sterling said.
 
Conflict With Wholesalers
The platforms of Aware and the coalition overlap in more areas than they conflict, and some leaders of both groups have said they hope to combine. One group they may still bang heads with is the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers, which predictably argues that the fights of the vintners and spirits makers are the same and should be joined. Wine makers have tried to distance their product from beer and spirits by emphasizing wine's value as a food accompaniment, ''the one nonviolent alcoholic beverage,'' as one Vintage 2000 speaker put it.
This strategy is anathema to the spirits industry. ''There are misconceptions about wine's difference and separateness that just aren't true,'' said Douglas W. Metz, the wholesalers association's vice president and general counsel. Drawing these distinctions has contributed to the wine and spirits industries' public relations problems, he said.
But many others see efforts to separate wine's image as a good tactic, particularly as people do less recreational imbibing.
''In the future, bars as we know them may not exist, because people don't want to be associated strictly with the consumption of alcohol,'' said William Hulbert, Marriott Hotels and Resorts' vice president for food and beverage operations. ''I don't think we'll build any bar operations in the future that don't have kitchens, and I think wine is viewed more as an accompaniment to food than beer or spirits are.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Plan Revised By Eastern

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Eastern Airlines proposed to its unsecured creditors yesterday that it emerge from bankruptcy with more flights and less cash than it had previously planned.
Philip J. Bakes, Eastern's president, told the creditors committee that the airline wanted to keep its South American routes, which it had previously sought to sell to American Airlines for $365 million.
As a result of this and other changes, Eastern would emerge from bankruptcy with $390 million in working capital to carry it through the next two years and cushion it against any economic downturn, people who attended the airline's presentation said. The airline previously estimated it would have $774 million. 
 
'Ample Cash'
Rolf S. Andresen, Eastern's chief financial officer, said in an interview that nearly $400 million ''is ample cash for this airline.''
Mr. Andresen also acknowledged that the airline would have more debt when it emerges from bankruptcy than had previously been disclosed. He declined to give specific figures but said the airline's finances remained healthy.
Mr. Andresen declined to specify the reasons for the decision not to sell the Latin American routes, on which Eastern offers 48 flights a week. Creditors should not oppose the decision, he said.
Eastern, a subsidiary of the Texas Air Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 9, five days after its machinists went on strike and the pilots and flight attendants honored the picket lines.
The airline's presentation to the creditors was done orally. Eastern said it would not distribute documents until next week.
People close to the creditors committee said that the reaction was confused and that the decision not to sell the South American routes was especially dismaying.
The initial response will be to ask Texas Air to pay $72 million of a $97 million pension liability that Eastern is due to pay by Sept. 15, a person close to the creditors said. The payment would be a gesture of confidence in Eastern, he said.
Eastern would also emerge with an extra $300 million in debt under the revised plan, the sources said. The airline would not prepay $150 million to remove a note with a face value of $200 million from its books and would not prepay $52 million of its debts to aircraft manufacturers. And it would borrow an extra $100 million to cover higher-than-planned expenses for the training of new employees and for the lease of aircraft and crews from Continental Airlines, another subsidiary of Texas Air.
Eastern said it still planned to repay creditors in full with interest.
Both Eastern's reorganization plan, which was filed on July 21, and a disclosure statement detailing its future business operations, which has not yet been filed, require approval from the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. People close to Eastern said yesterday that the airline would probably have to ask the court for a 60-day extension of the Sept. 21 deadline for filing all statements.
As a result, the airline may not emerge from bankruptcy until late winter, instead of in late December.
In a statement, Eastern said it projected pretax profits $62 million, $140 million, $195 million and $224 million through 1993.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Difficult Task Facing the Fed

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE really exciting thing about the American economy at this point is that there is no excitement. Despite everything - the near-record seven-year longevity of the expansion, the anxieties about recession and inflation, the mounting national debt, which has been exacerbated by the bailout of savings and loans, the relatively high level of interest rates and the high cost of the dollar in international markets - the United States economy continues to climb doggedly upward.
This was evident in the revised data for the second-quarter gross national product released by the Commerce Department this week. It showed that the economy advanced at a 2.7 percent rate rather than the originally estimated 1.7 percent rate. 
The upward revision in G.N.P. came as no surprise to the securities markets. The monthly data on employment, retail sales and factory production had already signaled that the economy was not as weak as had been estimated earlier. Recessionary fears, which had even penetrated the White House, looked more premature than ever. The new report of a 14.4 percent jump in sales of new houses in July, the fastest pace in nearly three years, added to the G.N.P. report's picture of stable growth.
Nevertheless, there were two disquieting notes in this week's economic data: One was the report that, measured by the Commerce Department's fixed-weight price index, inflation in the second quarter rose to an annual rate of 5.1 percent from 4.8 percent in the first quarter.
The second report was that corporate profits slid 5.4 percent in the second quarter, the biggest setback in three years and the second straight quarterly decline. In the first quarter profits were off 1.1 percent. Together, the new data on G.N.P., prices and profits intensified the Fed's dilemma. The apparent strengthening of economic growth and the upward creep of inflation, would call for a halt to further easing of monetary policy and lowering of interest rates. But the squeeze on business profits and investments, would call for action by the Fed to bring interest rates down to head off a recession.
Steering a course beween these two dangers -and with fiscal policy still highly expansionary - is the excruciating task facing the Fed. The central bank is engaging in the finest kind of fine-tuning to avoid either inflation or recession, or both of them together in a replay of the stagflation of the 1970's and early 1980's.
The Fed's dilemma has been intensified by the rise of the dollar. Against the Japanese yen, for example, the dollar is now at about 144, up from less than 125 at the end of last year. The Fed's monetary tightening, combined with the spurt in business activity and inflation abroad, has increased the demand for dollars faster than the supply provided by the lower American trade deficit. The dollar's appreciation, though spurred on by the rush of foreign capital seeking a safe haven in this country, basically results from the shortage of international dollar liquidity. But the high dollar, if it continues, is likely to check and reverse the nation's improving international trade position and worsen recessionary dangers by hurting exports and import-competing industries.
The rise in the dollar, despite its longer-term negative implications for United States trade, has been taken as an elixir by Wall Street. As the economists at Scudder Stevens & Clark, the investment house, see it, the rise in the dollar's value, and in the foreign demand for dollar assets, has been the primary force behind this year's rally in bond and stock prices.
In the past, as the Scudder economists say, interest rate trends have usually driven currency movements. But in the first half of this year, the opposite occurred: As the dollar appreciated, it created a ''virtuous circle'' of diminishing inflation expectations and rising bond and stock prices, which encouraged additional capital inflows.
Worries that this virtuous circle might soon end were registered in the bond market in mid-August, when Treasury securities and corporate bond prices tumbled as investors reacted to reports that the American economy was picking up again and the Fed was moving to prop up interest rates against a renewed threat of inflation.
But as the Fed jockeys about to avoid dangers on either side, the latest G.N.P. data are being interpreted on Wall Street to mean that all's quiet on the economic front. The securities markets, confident of the Fed's ability to steer a course between recession and inflation, are painting a rosy, recession-free future.
In the absence of any clear and present evidence to the contrary, the White House and Congress will not do anything dramatic to tackle the nation's economic problems, but, grumbling as they go, leave the job of stabilization to the Fed.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Farmers Drop 1.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Prices that farmers were paid for raw products dropped 1.4 percent from July to August, putting the monthly average just where it was a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.
The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans, corn, lettuce and potatoes were mostly responsible for the decrease.
Higher prices for cattle, apples, eggs and grapefruit partly offset the decline elsewhere. 
Oilseeds, which include soybeans, and feed grains showed the greatest month-to-month decline, while meat animals and milk had the largest increases.
''A 90-cents-per-bushel decline in the price of soybeans from July to August was the largest month-to-month decline since June-July 1984,'' the report said. ''Corn and sorghum prices were down, but the average barley price was up.''
 
Wheat Prices Advance
Wheat prices moved up after four months of small declines. Hogs and beef cattle were up from July, but calf prices were down slightly.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said earlier today that he expects 1989 to be a good year for farmers, although there is ''a mixed situation across the country'' because of drought and other weather problems.
''I would guess net cash income would be slightly below 1988, but not very much below,'' he said. Crop production generally has rebounded from last year's drought-reduced yields, and exports are up. ''Over all, I'd say farmers feel a lot better,'' Mr. Yeutter said.
Department economists said net cash income of farmers - gross cash income minus cash expenses - rose in 1988 to a record of about $60 billion as drought forced commodity prices up. Many producers were able to sell crops at the higher prices, thus more than offsetting reduced production.
The decline this year is expected to result from farmers' larger cash expenses as they increase plantings, and also because of lower Federal subsidies.
Consumer food prices are forecast by the Agriculture Department to rise an average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year, after a 4.1 percent increase in 1988.
Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock and livestock products as a group increased 1.9 percent from July and averaged 5.3 percent above the year-earlier level.
Crop prices, over all, dropped 4.5 percent from July and averaged 5.9 percent less than in August 1988.
 
All-Fruit Price Index
The all-fruit price index for August was up 8.8 percent from July but was down 4.9 percent from a year ago, the report said. Apples were reported at 16.1 cents a pound, compared with 9.8 cents in July. A year ago apples were 24.5 cents a pound.
Grapefruit prices averaged $7.24 a box, compared with $4.62 in July and $4.09 a year earlier. A box of grapefruit is about 67 pounds.
Prices of commercial vegetables dropped 15 percent from July, averaging 6.5 percent below a year ago, the report said.
The overall index of prices paid to farmers in July averaged 144 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from 146 percent in July. That was the lowest reading since November when the index was also 144 percent.

HEADLINE: Large Retailers Report Mixed Sales for August

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The nation's largest retailers issued mixed sales reports for August yesterday, with apparel retailers and department stores faring better than mass merchandisers during the back-to-school season.
Analysts continued to detect signs that consumers were hesitant about making big purchases.
''We saw good sales in the apparel department, but many of the other departments show a cautious consumer,'' said Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. ''These are not boom times.'' 
 
'Sideways' Spending
Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., agreed that although consumers were generally in a strong financial position and were confident, ''spending is drifting sideways.''
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of American economic activity, and retail sales are considered an important indicator of spending trends.
The nation's consumers have cut back on buying discretionary items -as opposed to necessities like food -because of rising mortgage payments and other credit costs.
Sales trends take on an added importance at this time of year because August marks the beginning of the retailers' most critical season. Shopping generally accelerates in mid-August, as families prepare for the school year and then builds through the holiday season, when stores earn about half their annual profits.
 
Big Chains Affected
Caution by consumers has hurt the large chains, like Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer. Sears, based in Chicago, said its overall sales were up by 2.3 percent in August, but its sales at stores open at least a year - or same-store sales -fell by 1.1 percent.
The retailers and analysts consider same-store sales a more accurate reflection of performance than totals that include sales at stores that have opened recently.
The K Mart Corporation, another mass merchandiser that is the nation's second-largest retailer, also had a disappointing August, with its overall sales up by 4.8 percent and its same-store sales up by 1.5 percent. The company is based in Troy, Mich. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount chain based in Bentonville, Ark., that has consistently outperformed its competitors, said its overall sales jumped by 26 percent, while its same-store results rose by 11 percent.
 
Penney Posts 17.1% Gain
Positive results at stores that specialize in apparel, like the J. C. Penney Company, largely resulted from back-to-school shopping. The Dallas-based retailer, where sales have steadily improved in recent months after a long slump, reported a 17.1 percent surge in its overall sales, while its same-store sales increased by 15.7 percent.
The Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty-apparel retailer, reported an 11 percent increase in its overall sales and a 7 percent rise in its same-store sales. The company is based in Columbus, Ohio.
Department stores also had a good month. The May Department Stores Company, based in St. Louis, said its overall sales rose by 9.6 and its same-store sales grew by 6.5 percent.
Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company, said that the improvement at the apparel and department stores was better than he had expected and that the trend bodes well for retailers' profits in the third quarter.
But Mr. Edelman, the Drexel analyst, cautioned that some of the optimistic sales reports looked stronger than they actually were because the figures were compared with weak results of August 1988. A year ago, the fashion industry was just beginning to emerge from a severe drought.
The following retailers also reported August results:
 
Dayton Hudson Corporation: Overall sales rose 12.7 percent and same-store results 5.1 percent.
Montgomery Ward & Company: Overall sales increased 1 percent, while same-store sales eight-tenths of 1 percent.
F. W. Woolworth Company: Overall sales rose 13.3 percent and same-store sales 7.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Housing Index At 4-Year Low

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
An index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy a house fell in July to the lowest level in nearly four years.
 
The National Association of
Realtors said a family with a median income of $32,876 had only 98 percent of the income necessary to buy a median-priced existing house costing $96,400. Half of the nation's families earn more than the median income and the other half earn less.
That was the index's lowest level since September 1985 and was a decline from 99.1 percent in June when the index dipped below 100 percent for the first time since March 1986.
The decline was attributed to a $3,000 increase in median house prices nationally. That more than offset a decline in the average mortgage rate from 10.59 percent to 10.39 percent. The association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
By region, the median family in the Midwest had 129.2 perin the Midwest had 129.2 percent of the income needed to buy a median house; Southern families, 97.8 percent; families in the West, 73.5 percent, and residents of the Northeast, 70.5 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices for Notes and Bonds Ease

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds eased in very thin trading yesterday, as traders shrugged off two developments that could have produced a rally.
A report showing a 1.7 percent drop in factory orders during July, a much bigger decline than had been expected, failed to stimulate the market. Nor did a further rise in the dollar, which moved higher against the yen.
Ordinarily, a sluggish factory orders report strengthens credit markets because it calms inflation fears by signaling an economic slowdown. Any strengthening of the dollar usually makes fixed-income securities more attractive. 
''The factory orders numbers should have been good for the market,'' one government bond trader said, ''but right now nobody cares. I hope that we start caring about things on Friday, when the employment numbers come out. But with so many people away on vacation, there is a chance that the action from Friday's numbers may not come until next week.''
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said that ''the market was probably mistaken in discounting the factory orders report.''
Of particular interest to Mr. Harris were data showing the sharpest monthly rise in factory inventories since March 1984 and the biggest decline in factory shipments since January 1987.
''We already knew that the manufacturing sector was weak, but the implications of the July report clearly suggest it is even weaker than previously thought,'' he said.
The decline in prices yesterday erased much of the improvement recorded on Wednesday.
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 99 7/32, down 1/4 of a point, to yield 8.19 percent.
Among secondary note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 98 10/32, down 1/4 of a point, to yield 8.25 percent. The 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 30/32, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.25 percent. And the 8 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 25/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.37 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.88 percent, up 3 basis points, or hundreths of a point. And six-month bill rates fell by 2 basis points, to an offered rate of 7.76 percent.
At yesterday's cash management bill auction, the Treasury sold the eight-day securities at an average discount rate of 8.25 percent.
Some selling may have reflected preparation for economic data that were scheduled to be released this morning.
The reports include the August employment figures and the monthly survey from the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which usually is released ahead of the employment data.
Market participants will have to quickly assess the importance of the reports; today's session has been shortened in advance of Labor Day weekend.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply, M-1 and M-2, rose during the week ended Aug. 21, while the broadest measure, M-3, declined. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was extremely light yesterday.
Corporate dealers said that prices of most issues dipped by about 1/8 of a point. Municipal bond prices were unchanged to up 1/8 of a point, market participants said.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of eight-day cash management bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Average Price	99.817	Discounted Rate	8.25%	Coupon Yield	8.36%	High Price	99.818	Discounted Rate	8.17%	Coupon Yield	8.32%	Low Price	99.816	Discounted Rate	8.30%	Coupon Yield	8.41%	Accepted at low price	87%	Total applied for	$25,180,000	Accepted	$4,010,600	N.Y. applied for	$22,230,000	N.Y. accepted	$3,517,000	
 
The cash management bills mature Sept. 14, 1989.

HEADLINE: Brazil Is Offering a 6% Bond

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The Brazilian Government issued exit bonds today to reduce interest payments on its foreign debt by $40 million a year. Marcelo Ceylao, a director at the nation's central bank, said $1.5 billion worth of the bonds were delivered to financial markets in New York and London for distribution on Friday. 
The bonds will pay a fixed 6 percent interest rate annually over 25 years, replacing old debt that carried a 9 percent rate. A central bank communique released today said it was the first time Brazil had issued new bonds to foreign markets since 1982.
Mr. Ceylao said that despite the lower yield, investors showed interest in swapping old debt for the certificates because the bonds are guaranteed. The certificates of custody on the bonds can be traded in a secondary market after 90 days or converted into risk investments in Brazil. The country, whose $110 billion foreign debt is the developing world's largest, will pay $14.9 billion in interest payments this year, the central bank estimates.

Looking for Value In Airline Assets

AMERICAN AIRLINES, considered by Wall Street to be a prime takeover target, has substantial assets that could generate huge amounts of cash to finance a bid. But the airline is also headed by an executive who could mount a strong defense.
Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American's owner, the AMR Corporation, has remained on good terms with his unions, analysts and investment bankers say. He could probably get their backing for a leveraged buyout if there was no other way to stave off an outside bidder, they add. 
The jump in AMR's stock price earlier this week, analysts say, reflects the growing realization among investors that carriers like American, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have assets whose potential value has yet to be realized.
The largest of these assets is the huge numbers of planes on order or near delivery. The carriers bought the planes for low prices and could lease them out for hefty profits.
Still, analysts say, takeover speculation has driven up the stock prices of many carriers so high that there is substantial risk for investors.
AMR, for example, closed at $88 a share yesterday, down $5, after soaring $10.25 on Tuesday amid rumors of an imminent takeover bid. But yesterday some investors were concerned that the Transportation Department could begin to intervene in airline takeovers.
There is no evidence that a bid for AMR is in the making. ''There's no offer; there's nothing,'' said Paul Karos, an airlines analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''There's no obligation by management to do anything.''
Mr. Karos said the stock could fall further if no bidder materialized, although he expected it to end up in the mid-$80's, which he said would be more in line with AMR's earnings and value.
But the recent rise in AMR's price, Mr. Karos said, provides considerable evidence that investors think the airlines will have to restructure, to fend off takeover bids or to cash in some valuable assets and distribute the proceeds to shareholders.
He estimates that AMR, which has placed sizable orders for airplanes in the last five years, could raise up to $3.2 billion in extra cash over the next eight years if it leased out all of its fleet.
Helane Becker, an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., noted that American bought MD-80's from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation for an average of $18 million to $20 million. American has taken delivery of 164 of the planes.
The planes, she said, are now worth about $25 million apiece. Thus, American could sell each of the planes to investors for that amount and then lease them back, generating $7 million in extra cash on each plane.
The same option is also available to bidders. For instance, Marvin Davis, the Beverly Hills, Calif., billionaire who has bid $275 a share for the UAL Corporation, the owner of United, could use the airline's new planes and those on order to help him obtain financing and generate cash to pay the debt.
Mr. Karos said there were other favorable factors that have spurred interest. Big international carriers are seeking to increase their stakes in large United States airlines to prepare them for the increasing competition in Europe.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, for example, put up $400 million of the $700 million in equity in the buyout of Northwest Airlines by a group of investors led by Alfred Checchi, the Los Angeles financier.
British Airways could end up with a large interest in UAL under a bid that is expected to be made by the pilots union today. And Scandinavian Airlines System, which owns 9.9 percent of Continental Airlines, has been in talks about raising its stake.
There are other large European carriers that could be interested in participating in a bid or a buyout of American.
The current focus on AMR has created a difficult choice for Mr. Crandall and his management team, said an analyst who did not want to be identified.
Should they quickly restructure the company by selling some assets? For instance, its Sabre computer reservation system could be worth close to $1.5 billion, and its sale would enable the company to pay a special dividend to shareholders. That could further increase AMR's stock price and make it less attractive to an outside takeover.
Or should they wait and see if a bidder materializes. If they wait, the analyst said, a buyout of the airline with union cooperation could be much more difficult and expensive, because AMR's stock price would probably rise to $110 or $115 a share.
Mr. Karos and Miss Becker cautioned, however, that just as the airlines' stock prices ran up quickly, they could fall just as fast.
Intervention in the takeovers by Congress, the Transportation Department or the Justice Department could scare off bidders and take off the pressure on airline management to restructure.
Such a prospect may already be on the horizon. Jeffrey N. Shane, Assistant Transportation Secretary for policy and international affairs, has warned that the department may review investments by foreign airlines in American carriers and the leveraged buyouts of airlines like Northwest.
And if a recession occurred, it could sharply reduce investor interest in buying planes and leasing them back to the airlines, curtailing that potential windfall.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 9.12, but Airline Stocks Retreat

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices chalked up modest gains yesterday, except in the closely watched transportation sector, where they slumped.
Trading in the overall market was relatively thin before the Labor Day weekend, and volume declined to one of the lowest levels in recent months.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.12 points, to 2,737.27. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.80 point, to 351.45, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.36 point, to 195.27. 
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were moderately ahead of declining issues, 801 to 672.
 
Transports Lose 20.10
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slipped to a pedestrian 143.4 million shares, from 174.4 million on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones transportation average, after a string of records, fell 20.10 points, to 1,509.42, as profits were taken on recently surging airline stocks.
Investors were concerned that the Government might crack down on airline buyouts. An article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal quoted an Assistant Secretary in the Transportation Department as saying that the agency might take active steps on airline takeovers in response to concerns about debt levels and foreign ownership.
One path that might be pursued, experts say, is to require a minimum level of equity in an airline merger transaction.
UAL, the owner of United Airlines, fell 1, to 279. The company, which is the target of a $275-a-share takeover proposal by Marvin Davis, a Beverly Hills, Calif., billionaire, is expected to receive a $300-a-share offer from its pilots union.
AMR, the owner of American Airlines, plunged 5, to 88; and Delta Air Lines retreated 3 3/4, to 80 1/4. AMR was also the Big Board's busiest issue on volume of more than 3.7 million shares.
''Despite the firm close by the Dow, the day was dull except for the airlines,'' said Kenneth S. Hackel, president of Systematic Financial Management Inc., in Fort Lee, N.J. ''Such days are common around major holidays.''
He said he expected trading to be lackluster again today, except possibly in the morning, when the Government is scheduled to report on the employment situation for August and also on construction spending and the index of leading indicators for July.
 
Factory Orders Drop
Yesterday, the Government reported that factory orders had fallen 1.7 percent in July.
Among the active blue-chip stocks, Upjohn fell 2, to 39 1/8; General Motors was up 1/4, to 49; Chrysler gained 3/4, to 26 5/8, and Columbia Pictures slipped 3/8, to 19 7/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market-value index gained 0.61 point, to 382.19. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index 1.06 points, to 469.33.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks slipped 40.46 points, to 34,431.20.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Showing by Dollar; Gold Is Down Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against most major currencies yesterday, reaching a two-month high against the yen.
Gold prices weakened. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $359.90 an ounce, off $1.90 from late Wednesday. 
The market's general mood toward the dollar remained bullish following a string of recent economic reports pointing toward continued growth. Many dealers predicted that the July unemployment report, which is to be released today, would show moderate growth in new jobs.
Dealers said the dollar was also helped by reports that the United States plans to send military personnel to Colombia to help that Government fight drug traffickers.
''Any time there's a conflict somewhere in the world it usually benefits the dollar,'' said Gary Lutnick, a dealer at the New York office of Banco di Sicilia.
In New York, the dollar finished at 145.06 yen, up from 144.25 yen. Dealers said the last time the dollar closed above the 145-yen level was in June.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.9675 West German marks, up from 1.9533; 1.7005 Swiss francs, up from 1.68325; 6.6290 French francs, up from 6.5775; 1.17935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17695; and 1,411.00 Italian lire, up from 1,400.50. The British pound sold for $1.5650 in New York, down from $1.57795.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $359.95 an ounce from Wednesday's $360.75. In Zurich, gold closed at $360, down from $361.80. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.33, to close at $360.04.
Silver prices declined. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.045 an ounce from $5.085.

HEADLINE: Files Shredded, Ex-H.U.D Aide Has Told Court

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Deborah Gore Dean, who is at the center of investigations of political abuse in Federal housing programs, has said in a sworn statement that she had many of her office files shredded as she was leaving her post as executive assistant to Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. ''I gave them to the Inspector General and had them shredded by the Inspector General,'' Ms. Dean said in the deposition in April 1988, long before she became a subject of Congressional inquiries into political favoritism and mismanagement at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Asked why she had the documents destroyed, Ms. Dean replied simply, ''To get rid of them.''
 
Possible Uses for Files
In response to one more question about whether she thought there might be ''some possible use'' for the files, she said, ''Of course I didn't think I'd have any use for them - or I wouldn't have shredded them.''
A lawyer for Ms. Dean said she had done nothing wrong and that the H.U.D. Inspector General was responsible for the files. 
The Inspector General, Paul A. Adams, said today that he had no information suggesting that his staff had assisted Ms. Dean in destroying documents. ''I have no knowledge of what she's talking about,'' he said. ''I can't imagine under what circumstances we would do anything like that.''
It was not immediately clear whether H.U.D. employees routinely provide office files to the Inspector General's staff. Federal agencies differ on their rules for saving office files and there is no indication of any wrongdoing by Ms. Dean in her handling of the documents.
Ms. Dean, 34 years old, was executive assistant to Mr. Pierce from 1984 to 1987. She gave the deposition as part of a Federal civil case in Chicago involving a mortgage on a housing project there.
Among the documents destroyed, Ms. Dean indicated, were many of her files on specific housing projects. ''I got rid of the housing files,'' she said.
 
Reports of Political Influence
Her disclosure raises the possibility that investigators will never know the full scope of Ms. Dean's contacts with prominent Republicans and former H.U.D. officials who sought favors from the $15 billion agency. Federal investigators are now examining widespread allegations that political influence was used in the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in H.U.D. grants.
Ms. Dean suggested in the deposition that she had the documents shredded because they were taking up too much office space.
She said she turned over her files to the Inspector General's office in July 1987, as she was leaving her post as executive assistant to Mr. Pierce, Ronald Reagan's Housing Secretary, to become a private consultant on retainer to H.U.D. Former Federal employees generally lose access to their office files once they leave Government.
Although Ms. Dean has not been charged with any wrongdoing, she was involved in several activities that are now the subject of investigations on Capitol Hill, at the Justice Department and within the housing department.
A lawyer for Ms. Dean, Joseph E. diGenova, said in a prepared statement today: ''Miss Dean turned over her files to the Inspector General for disposition as he deemed appropriate. She delivered them in fact to the appropriate official in the agency for that purpose.''
 
'She Testified Truthfully'
''She neither shredded nor destroyed anything,'' he said. ''She testified truthfully. She said exactly what she did and has acted completely properly.''
Responding to the question of whether H.U.D. rules required the retention of office documents, an official of the agency, who asked not to be identified, said that some office files must be retained for five years, while others, ''like the stuff you used in your job but was not a part of an office program'' can be shredded at will.
At least some of Ms. Dean's files remain at H.U.D., including a number of boxes filled with her office correspondence, and duplicates of other documents that may have been shredded are thought to be retained elsewhere at the agency.
In the Chicago case, a real-estate firm accused H.U.D. of reneging on an agreement to renegotiate terms of a mortgage on large housing project in Hyde Park. In the deposition, Ms. Dean said she had become involved in trying to resolve the Chicago dispute after a telephone call in March or April 1987 from a White House aide.
The aide, whose name Ms. Dean said she could not recall, told Ms. Dean that ''there was a problem with a building in Chicago and that Congressman Hyde was upset about it and thought that H.U.D. was not acting responsibly in dealing with his constituent,'' according to the deposition.
Judy Wolverton, an aide to Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican, suggested today that the Congressman was trying to be helpful in resolving the dispute between H.U.D. and a Chicago real-estate developer. Bruce Clinton.
In the deposition, Ms. Dean was asked whether she had kept her files and notes of her involvement in the housing project that was the subject of the litigation, Regents Park. ''No,'' she replied. ''You have had no file at any time?'' she was asked.
Ms. Dean replied: ''I might have at one point, but I, you know, dispensed with files from H.U.D. when I left H.U.D., that were not directly related to the position of which I had been recently nominated. I kept my economic development files and I got rid of the housing files.''
 
Nomination to Post
Ms. Dean was referring to her nomination in 1987 as an Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. She was never confirmed for the post.
She was next asked why she had destroyed the files. ''Because I had at least four huge file cabinets, I mean, the big ones full of documents and files and papers and letters,'' she said. ''I mean, my chron files alone took up six boxes when I left the department.'' She was apparently referring to chronological correspondence files.
''I gave them to the Inspector General and had them shredded by the Inspector General,'' Ms. Dean said.
''And why did you do that?'' she was asked. ''To get rid of them.'' ''Did you ever consider at that time that there might be some possible use for your notes or files concerning Regents Park?''
''Of course I didn't think I'd have any use for them - or I wouldn't have shredded them,'' she replied.
There was no additional questioning about Ms. Dean's motives for having the files destroyed.
 
Role of White House
The fact that Ms. Dean was contacted by the White House in support of the Chicago project is signficant in light of the disclosure this week that the White House may have intervened repeatedly in the selection process for H.U.D. awards.
The disclosure was contained in a grand jury transcript obtained by The New York Times in which Ms. Dean said last October that White House aides contacted her on behalf of as least one quarter of all successful applicants in the large H.U.D. grant program.
Ms. Dean, who is now a private housing consultant, said the White House called a number of times regarding the Regents Park project. At the request of the White House, she attended a meeting with Representative Hyde and an assistant to Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat.
At the meeting, she said, Mr. Hyde said that Mr. Clinton, the real estate developer, had gotten ''the rotten potato from H.U.D. and it's really a shame and, 'I know you can straighten this out, Deborah.' ''
A spokesman for Senator Dixon had no immediate comment. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton said the developer was out of town.

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Rate Drops to 5.1%, Reflecting Steady Economic Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The economy continued to generate new jobs at a moderate clip in August as the unemployment rate edged down one-tenth of a point to 5.1 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
Analysts said the figures, which provide the first broad look at last month's business activity, reflected a basically healthy economy, if one with a flagging manufacturing sector.
Indeed, a separate report today showed a drop in purchases by industrial companies, and the drop touched off a decline in market interest rates. Investors hoped that this sign of weakness in manufacturing might prompt the Federal Reserve to resume easing credit as it did in late spring and into July. [Page 30.] 
Over all, however, today's figures suggested an economy headed neither for recession, as some had feared in July, nor a sharp rebound.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the first increase in three months. [Page 29.] 'A Nice Steady Pace'
''We are just continuing along at a nice steady pace,'' the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood, said at a news conference.
''The economy still is creating enough jobs to keep pace with population and labor-force growth,'' she said. At 5.1 percent, the jobless rate remains within two-tenths of a point of the 15-year low set in March, and the percentage of the working-age population with jobs held at its near-record 63 percent.
The department's survey of households showed that the number of jobs expanded by 160,000. Since only 84,000 people were added to the labor force, counting military personnel stationed in the United States, the ranks of the jobless fell 76,000, to 6,421,000, for an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent. The civilian jobless rate was unchanged last month at 5.2 percent.
As measured by the Labor Department's separate survey of business payrolls, job growth last month was a seemingly meager 110,000. But the gain would have been 218,000 if not for labor disputes, particularly among telephone workers. In the payroll survey, which is considered a better measure of job growth, strikers are not considered to be employed.
Adjusting for the strike effects, the monthly gain was about the same as in the three preceding months, but about 20 percent below the monthly average in 1988. ''The economy is chugging along,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, economist for Kleinwort Benson Government Securities in Chicago.
Once again, the department revised upward the job gains reported for earlier months. The job gain for June was raised to 299,000, 47,000 higher than thought last month and 119,000 higher than first estimated. The initial July figure was raised today by 62,000, to 231,000.
 
Increase for Auto Industry
In August, the number of factory jobs rose 11,000 over all. But the only real advance was in the automobile industry, with an increase of 25,000 jobs, and that reflected returns to work of those temporarily idled by summer plant shutdowns. Job losses continued in the electrical equipment industry, which exports most of its products. The industry has lost 40,000 jobs since November.
Among service occupations, there was a total increase of 25,000 jobs among the finance, insurance and real estate sectors. Health services gained of 50,000 jobs, as did state and local government. Retail and wholesale trade, however, showed little growth last month.
Reflecting the general subdued growth, the payroll survey also showed a 12-minute decline, to 34.6 hours, in the length of the average work week and a 6-minute decline, to 40.9 hours, in the factory week and in factory overtime.
 
A Drop in Longtime Unemployed
According to the household survey, the number of those without jobs for more than six months fell by 59,000, to 567,000 last month, the lowest level since February 1980. The number of workers idle for 15 weeks or more fell by 170,000.
After declining 7 points in July, the jobless rate for teen-age black women remained at 33 percent in August. The rate for all adult men edged up one-tenth of a point, to 4.4 percent, while the rate for adult women fell three-tenths of a point, to 4.7 percent.
All four major regions posted lower jobless rates last month, according to department data that are not adjusted for seasonal variations. The West's rate improved by far the most, tumbling to 4.9 percent from 5.6 percent. The rates for the Northeast, the Midwest and the South eased slightly to 4.3 percent, 5 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively.
Among the 11 largest states, California had the only statistically significant change, a drop of eight-tenths of a point, seasonally adjusted, to 4.5 percent. The only other change of more than half a point was a decline of six-tenths for Ohio, to 4.8 percent.
Average hourly earnings of private production or nonsupervisory workers were virtually unchanged in August after rising a sharp eight-tenths of 1 percent in July. Average weekly earnings, which jumped 1.7 percent in July, fell back seven-tenths of 1 percent last month.
 
Some Are Pessimistic
Despite the guarded optimism of most economists about the economy's near-term prospects, some found in today's data the seeds of a more pessimistic outcome. One is John D. Mueller, chief economist for Bell Mueller Cannon Inc. in Washington. Reflecting worldwide monetary stringency and the relatively strong dollar, he said, ''exports and investment should start to slow down,'' leading perhaps to a mild recession beginning as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.
Among the other signs of industrial weakness reported today was the Labor Department's index showing that only 52.1 percent of manufacturing industries added jobs in August. This followed four straight months when fewer than 50 percent added jobs, but was still far below the year's high of 62.4 percent, posted in January.
In all, 119,285,000 Americans had jobs last month - 117,597,000 civilians and 1,688,000 military personnel stationed domestically.

HEADLINE: Bush Welcomes New Tokyo Leader

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
In a get-acquainted session at the White House, President Bush urged Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today to transform Japan into an ''import superpower'' to curb trade tensions and cement an ''enduring partnership'' with the United States.
Interrupting his Maine vacation to welcome Mr. Kaifu, the President said that economic issues were discussed ''at great length'' during the three hours of talks. Those issues presumably included Japan's $52 billion trade surplus with the United States and recent actions by the Bush Administration against what it considers Japanese trade barriers.
Mr. Kaifu took office three weeks ago after a series of financial and sex scandals that have rocked Japan. His visit here is part of a 10-day trip that will also take him to Mexico and Canada. 
 
Stresses Equal Partnership
The 58-year-old Japanese leader took the occasion to stress Japan's role as an equal partner of the United States and called for a Washington-Tokyo partnership to help manage the global economy.
''The President and I expressed our common determination to actively shoulder responsibilities in a manner commensurate with our respective abilities under such global partnership'' Mr. Kaifu said in a departure statement on the south lawn of the White House.
Mr. Kaifu acknowledged that trade imbalances were a source of friction with the United States and, like previous leaders, he pledged renewed efforts to expand imports.
Mr. Kaifu is Japan's third Prime Minister since May. His Liberal Democratic Party has lost control of the upper house of Parliament and faces elections for the lower house within 10 months.
The Japanese leader stressed, in remarks here today and in San Francisco on Wednesday, that Japan was an equal partner of the United States and that it was not just Japan that needed to make concessions.
In a speech this afternoon to the National Press Club, Mr. Kaifu pointed to the contributions that Japan had made to the United States economy, including investments that he said have created more than 200,000 jobs.
He said that the United States needed to step up its efforts to improve industrial competitiveness, shrink its budget deficit and further stabilize exchange rates, and he took issue with the Administration's aggressive trade policy.
He said American legislation providing for trade sanctions against Japan ''could have a negative impact,'' and he specifically told the President that it was unlikely that great progress could be made by next spring in an effort known as the Structural Impediments Initiative.
The initiative seeks to examine deeper problems behind the deficit, like anticompetitive business practices, blockages in the retail distribution system, a restrictive land use policy and Japan's high rate of savings.
 
Pointing at U.S. Problems
For their part the Japanese raise objections to such factors in the United States as low savings, emphasis on short-term profit, the high budget deficit, and weaknesses in American education and training.
The United States is sending a delegation to Tokyo next week for talks on these issues.
American lawmakers are closely monitoring the situation. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's trade subcommittee, is preparing legislation that would require the United States to investigate Japan's structural barriers under the threat of sanctions if there is no successful conclusion to the talks. The sanctions could be invoked under a provision of last year's trade bill, Section 301, which empowers the President to retaliate against countries that do not remove trade barriers against the United States.
 
Bush Calls for 'Adjustments'
Brent C. Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, said Mr. Bush had made it clear to the Japanese leader ''how important some adjustments were to the success of the bilateral relationship and our being able to cooperate in a global partnership with the Japanese.''
In memory of the American lawmaker who died last month in an airplane crash in Ethiopia, Mr. Kaifu told President Bush that Japan was creating the Mickey Leland International Development Program and giving $5 million to start it. The program is intended to support research into ways to fight poverty.
Mr. Leland, a Texas Democrat, focused much of his Congressional activity on trying to improve conditions in the poorest countries.

HEADLINE: Qaddafi, Marking 20 Years in Power, Pledges 'International Revolution'

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Sept. 1

 BODY:
As he celebrated two decades in power, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi declared today that Israel ''must be removed'' and promised to pursue an ''international revolutionary program'' to rid the world of ''government and classes, parliaments and parties.''
Colonel Qaddafi spoke at a gathering of loyalists flanked by an array of foreign dignitaries, including President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua.
Laying out his vision of world revolution, he said: ''Governments and classes, parliaments and parties will disappear. Armies and the police, all the instruments of official repression, will disappear. The masses alone will take their place. Libya with full self-confidence is capable of supporting its international revolutionary program.'' 
Western diplomats said it was unclear whether the Libyan leader was signaling a new surge of what the West would call support for terrorism, or whether he was simply responding to an anti-Western mood set in an earlier speech by Mr. Ortega.
 
No Direct Attack on Bush
The Sandinista leader said Ronald Reagan had tried ''to defeat the Nicaraguan and Libyan revolutions,'' adding, ''And where is he now?''
Colonel Qaddafi took up this theme, saying the former American President had ''joined Hitler and Mussolini in the dustbin of history.'' Neither the colonel nor Mr. Ortega took direct issue with the Bush Administration.
The Libyan leader has long cast himself as a sponsor of the oppressed, a role interpreted in the United States as supporting terrorism. In recent months, however, he has shown readiness for conciliation with one-time adversaries like Egypt. and on Thursday Libya and Chad signed a peace treaty to end 16 years of hostility.
But his speech today showed him unmoved in his opposition to the existence of Israel, and there was no indication today that he and Mr. Arafat had ended a feud that prompted Libya to cut off funds for the P.L.O. earlier this year. Colonel Qaddafi has objected to Mr. Arafat's decision to renounce terrorism and accept Israel's existence, which led to the first official contacts between the P.L.O. and Washington.
''The Zionist entity that has been among us since World War II must be removed the same way as other effects of World War II have been removed,'' the colonel declared. ''All of Palestine is for the Palestinians.''
 
Armed Forces Replaced
Moreover, the brief address seemed to show Colonel Qaddafi as committed to the trappings of revolutionary transformation as he was when he took power as a 27-year-old officer in a coup 20 years ago.
In a decree published earlier, he announced the dissolution of his armed forces and their replacement by what was termed ''the armed people.'' Major personnel and commanders remained the same, but under different titles, so the move appeared largely a symbolic gesture toward the colonel's stated goal of removing institutions and replacing them with popular organizations.
The anniversary celebration has consumed and paralyzed this city on the Mediterranean, drawing heads of state from some African and Middle Eastern countries, including King Hassan II of Morocco, who arrived in his yacht.
Hundreds of desert horsemen, their faces swathed in white robes, assembled a cavalry of prancing steeds on the beachfront as a dust storm enveloped the capital.
The men of the desert represented an equestrian symbol of what Colonel Qaddafi considers his desert roots, just as the Soviet-built jet aircraft scudding in formation over the sandstorm seemed designed to display his power as a force in the Arab world.
Tonight tens of thousands of Libyans clad in green, many of them from military units, paraded past Colonel Qaddafi in Green Square.
 
A Theory of Democracy
Colonel Qaddafi made his speech at a gathering of what is called the General People's Congress, supposed to be the highest gathering of Libyans from lesser congresses through which, according to his ''third universal theory,'' the people express their wishes and run their land.
Part of the theory, which does not dent Colonel Qaddafi's supremacy, holds that the congresses reflect true democracy. ''Forming parties splits societies,'' says one of the many slogans taken from the colonel's three-volume ''Green Book,'' in which he has set out his ideas for political and economic transformation.
The highest-ranking Western here was Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis of Italy, who has earned the ire of other West European nations by bringing the symbolic prestige of his office to Libya, a former Italian colony still mistrusted and shunned in many parts of the West.
And the show of Arab unity did not cloak divisions. King Hassan, the pro-Western leader of Morocco, was not on hand for the main speech. And although President Assad was seated next to Mr. Arafat, with whom he is conducting a bitter dispute over the P.L.O. chairman's negotiation policy, the two men did not display any cordiality.

HEADLINE: Aide to Noriega Is Sworn In; U.S. Won't Recognize Him

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the United States would not have any diplomatic contact with the newly appointed Government of Panama, headed by a longtime associate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Mr. Bush also said he planned to tighten economic sanctions against Panama.
Francisco Rodriguez, a high school classmate of General Noriega, the Panamanian strongman, took the oath of office as President in a ceremony that was televised in Panama but closed to the diplomatic corps.
Mr. Rodriguez, the Comptroller General of Panama for the last seven years, was selected Thursday by the Council of State, which includes Cabinet ministers, senior military officers and other Government officials.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, described Mr. Rodriguez as ''Noriega's latest puppet President.'' She said his ''chief qualification for the position seems to have been his longtime friendship with Noriega and his slavish loyalty to the dictator.'' 
 
Naming of Canal Administrator
In another rebuff to General Noriega, the Bush Administration said today that it would not accept any candidate submitted by the Noriega Government to serve as administrator of the Panama Canal. Under the canal treaties signed in 1977, a Panamanian is supposed to take the job next year.
A State Department official said the United States would not accept ''diplomatic correspondence'' from the Noriega Government recommending a candidate.
In a statement from the White House, Mr. Bush said: ''The United States will not recognize any government installed by General Noriega. Our Ambassador will not return, and we will not have any diplomatic contact with the Noriega regime.''
Mr. Bush said, ''The United States will continue to take other steps, including the tightening of measures to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the Panamanian people.'' He did not order or announce any specific actions today.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, confirmed that the Administration had not yet increased economic sanctions.
 
Effectiveness Questioned
On a flight to Kennebunkport, Me., where Mr. Bush is on vacation, Mr. Scowcroft acknowledged that the existing sanctions had not achieved much. In April 1988 the United States froze Panamanian Government assets in this country and prohibited payments to the Noriega Government by United States citizens and companies.
A study by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that the United States Treasury had not aggressively enforced the sanctions. For example, it said, the ''Treasury authorized 46 exceptions allowing certain types of payments to the Noriega regime'' for port fees, commercial license fees, import duties, utility bills and other items.
Because of such exemptions, it said, the Noriega Government has received more than half of the $250 million it would have lost as a result of strict enforcement of the sanctions. The Bush Administration has not explicitly encouraged American businesses to leave Panama, and business executives said the exemptions were needed to permit continued operations there.
Administration officials said they were considering many options, including new restrictions on financial transactions with Panamanians and an order barring Panamanian-flag vessels from American ports.
 
'Thinly Disguised Coup d'Etat'
Ms. Tutwiler said the appointment of a provisional Government ''is completely outside Panama's Constitution and is, in effect, a thinly disguised coup d'etat.'' General Noriega is running ''an outlaw regime,'' she said.
General Noriega annulled presidential elections held in May after independent observers reported that he was losing by a ratio of about 3 to 1. Until today, the United States recognized the Government of Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was deposed by the Panamanian armed forces in February 1988. His presidential term was scheduled to end today.
Mr. Bush said Panama was, as of today, ''without any legitimate government.'' As a practical matter, Mr. Scowcroft said, ''things haven't changed a great deal.'' But ''as a legal matter, we are in another era,'' he said.
In Jerusalem, according to The Associated Press, an Israeli newspaper reported today that the United States had asked Israel to help persuade a former Israeli intelligence agent to leave Panama. The former agent, identified as Mike Harari, was said to be a security adviser to General Noriega, the Commander in Chief of the Panama Defense Forces. Israeli officials said they understood that Mr. Harari was there as a private citizen, not as a representative of the Israeli Government or its intelligence services.

Lifting a Pinkie for the Upper Crust

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The founders of the Distressed Gentlefolk's Aid Association would no doubt turn up their noses, although very discreetly, at some of the people who are passing themselves off as gentle these days.
John Marshall, the organization's general secretary, says the charity aims, as it has for the last 92 years, to provide financial assistance to elderly people who have good family, breeding and social standing but who happen to be down on their luck.
But deciding who qualifies as gentlefolk nowadays is not as easy as it was in the rigidly class-conscious Victorian era. The concept has become somewhat ''woolly,'' in Mr. Marshall's view, which he says helps explain why ''actors and even a journalist'' have slipped in among the upstanding surgeons, ministers, teachers and other professionals who have benefited from the charity's good deeds. 
 
Some Go to Oxford, Some Don't
''When the association was founded in the late 19th century, you were either quality gentle people or not, and people knew the difference,'' said Mr. Marshall, seated in his office above one of the association's nursing homes in Kensington. ''It was part of the class structure of the British. That has changed and faded a great deal. Today, we are still required to relieve distress among gentlefolk, but in practice we assist many people with professional backgrounds who have perhaps seen much better times and have come down in the world because of inflation and all these kinds of things.
''We have a range of people in our homes but nearly all - I don't know what you say - have good backgrounds, whatever that may mean. The same subtle distinctions still run in America, to some extent. Some people go to Vassar and Harvard and some don't.''
Elizabeth and Constance Finn, the widow and daughter, respectively, of a former British consul, formed the association in 1897 after they learned that people of gentility were living in penury, including an 80-year-old friend who was dying of cancer and trying to subsist on the paltry income from her failing investments. The founders were viewed as severe in personality. Mr. Marshall gave an account of an episode more than 40 years ago in which Constance Finn warned a new employee not to use modern ''inventions of the Devil,'' like the typewriter. The Distressed Gentlefolk's Aid Association always wrote its letters in longhand, she said.
 
Queen Mother Is Patron
The charity, which has the Queen Mother as its royal patron, helps only people of British or Irish nationality and cares for as many as 376 people at a time in 13 homes for the elderly around the country. The average age of the recipients is 87 years old. They pay fees on a sliding scale based on their finances, and everyone receives a subsidy. Nearly 1,000 others receive grants that enable them to stay in their own homes or help cover the cost of private nursing care.
To apply for accommodations in one of the association's homes - they offer ''a quality environment,'' Mr. Marshall said of the facilities, ''such as carpet rather than linoleum'' -applicants must submit detailed financial and medical reports. Applicants are reportedly never turned away because they are too poor, although some are determined to be too rich. The association sets limits on the financial assets that an aid recipient can have but does not publicize the guidelines for fear that those wealthy enough to afford private care might adjust their finances downward in order to appear more distressed.
Prospective residents must also undergo the scrutiny of charity representatives who visit their homes to assess their education, general attitude, behavior and whether they are the type who would ''be happy in one of our homes,'' Mr. Marshall tactfully explained.
 
Bequests Are Vital
''You can say that this is the most appalling class distinction,'' said the general secretary, a man with gentlemanly deportment and a sense of humor. ''From one point of view, I suppose it is. On the other hand, you realize that people who are happy together usually come from similar backgrounds. Most of our sort of people are educated people. They are not all out of the top drawer but they are not out of the bottom drawer either.''
Nonetheless, the charity says it does not turn away many applicants and prides itself on caring for its clients for the rest of their lives. People who are turned down are never told why, Mr. Marshall says, because the selection process is subjective and the definition of gentlefolk is so vague. Instead, the association directs these failed gentle people to other organizations that are likely to give assistance.
Some supporters and detractors have argued that the Distressed Gentlefolk's Aid Association should change its name in order to appear less class-bound and more up to date. But Mr. Marshall argues that the current title conveys the right message to prospective donors. He says bequests are the charity's most important source of income, providing up to $5 million of the $11 million the association spends annually, and are often left by people who ''like the look of us and think we help the kind of people they would like to help.''
''Distressed gentlefolk is a terribly quaint term in 1989,'' said Mr. Marshall, a former senior civil servant. ''But it's very hard to find another two or three words that describe so exactly the kind of people we help. If you look at Roget, what you get under 'gentlefolk' is 'people of the better sort.' We can't have the Association for People of the Better Sort. It doesn't sound good.
''You have a saying in America: If it works, don't fix it. While it brings in the money, we shouldn't change the name. It now almost has a period flavor to it, like Victorian furniture. People say we help only a selected group of people, but every charity helps only a selected group of people. Some help children, some help old people, some help people overseas and some help specific professions. We help a rather funny lot of gentlefolk who fall between the stalls.''

HEADLINE: Skills Needed, U.S. Study Says

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 1

 BODY:
A shortage of skilled workers and a surplus of unskilled workers is threatening economic growth, according to a report presented to Labor Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole today.
The Federal Commission on Workforce Quality and Labor Market Efficiency presented Mrs. Dole with the report, which outlines steps to upgrade what it calls the nation's ''woefully inadequate'' work force. 
''Increased demand for highly skilled workers, combined with an aging work force, has already created shortages of skilled workers'' and those shortages are likely to grow, the report said.
The report's recommendations included establishing goals in education and training, tax incentives for working parents in need of child care, and businesses making an effort to train workers.
''Given the skill shortages we found in talking to employers, we have to start today,'' Richard Schubert, chairman of the commission, said at a news conference here today.

HEADLINE: Local Jobless Rates Edge Up

 BODY:
The rate of unemployment in New York State and New Jersey edged up last month, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.
The bureau's regional commissioner, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, said the seasonably adjusted civilian unemployment rate in New York State rose to 5 percent in August, while the New Jersey rate reached 4.5 percent. That was higher than in July, when the rate was of 4.7 percent in New York and 4.1 percent in New Jersey.
A year ago, the August unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in New York and 3.8 percent in New Jersey, according to the bureau. The August figures for Connecticut will not be available until the end of September.
John Wieting, the bureau's chief for economic reports, called the August results ''pretty steady.''
New York has stayed within a narrow range, from 4.7 percent to 5.3 percent over the last four months, he noted. ''So far this year the rate is running a bit higher that 1988's average of 4.2 percent,'' he said.
He said New Jersey's rate has ranged between 4 and 4.5 percent in the last three months.
In New York in August, there were 8,557,000 people in the civilian labor force, down from 8,674,000 in July and 8,586,000 a year ago, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. The comparable numbers for New Jersey were 3,990,000 in August, 3,975,000 in July, and 3,975,000 in August 1988.
A total of 8,127,000 people were employed in civilian jobs in New York last month and 3,810,000 in New Jersey, while the jobless numbered 430,000 in New York and 180,000 in New Jersey, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.

HEADLINE: Maturing Step by Step With Europe

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, West Germany

 BODY:
It is precisely because he is a European, Hans Magnus Enzensberger says, that the idea of the European Community so galls him.
''You can't just boil the essence of this Continent down to some principle or some well-defined project,'' he says. ''If there's anything really impressive about this part of the world, it's exactly this resistance to being rollered into a unity.''
Mr. Enzensberger speaks with some authority as the onetime enfant terrible of German letters, a poet, essayist, playwright, journalist, editor and translator of high reputation who has made an art of engaged diversity. He is fluent in ''about seven languages'' and has lived in Scandinavia, Italy, France and West Berlin. 
His latest collection of essays, ''Europe, Europe,'' published in the United States by Pantheon Books, is something of a celebration of variety, a personal foray into lesser-known corners of the old Continent, all rich in rare foibles and perspectives. Mr. Enzensberger deliberately eschews a unifying ideology or viewpoint - his is an almost random voyage through the periphery, embracing ''Swedish Autumn,'' ''Italian Extravagances,'' ''Hungarian Confusions,'' ''Portuguese Reveries,'' ''Polish Incidents,'' ''Spanish Shards.'' A Reason for Ignorance Mr. Enzensberger insists that he did not start with a message or a theme. But he does conclude with a whimsical look at Europe in the year 2006, as seen by Timothy Taylor, a fictional reporter for The New Yorker. This naive and wide-eyed American travels across a Europe in which the American presence has been reduced to 200 troops in Berlin, car travel has been all but banned, Russian tourists are so widespread that they have stirred resentment, Rumania is experiencing an economic miracle, Bordeaux vineyards have been contaminated by a nuclear meltdown and the Berlin Wall has become an issue between environmentalists, who want to tear it down, and preservationists who think it a landmark.
''I wrote it at the end because publishers and critics prefer, for their convenience, that there be something like a conclusion,'' Mr. Enzensberger said. ''But because of my idea of Europe, I cannot draw a conclusion, I cannot say this is the outcome, so I made this sally into fiction, which is also, of course, ironical, because I don't claim prescience. I deliberately chose more of an outsider's point of view, an American who also perhaps does not understand fully what he is reporting about, and since I don't understand what will happen in the year 2006, the more ignorant the reporter, the better.''
 
Angry Words and a Smile
An ironic smile seems permanently etched into Mr. Enzensberger's visage, and it is sometimes difficult to know if he is serious. At times his words are angry, especially when he launches into the European Community bureaucracy in Brussels. But his expression remains bemused, as if his own words were a source of some surprise and even delight.
Mr. Enzensberger's career has been an exploration rather than a purposeful voyage. ''I've had forays into the theater, I do some radio work, even television, some translation,'' he said. ''I hate being a specialist.''
He made his name in West Germany in the 1950's as a fervent critic of the remnants of Nazism - ''that was when some mindless critic called me an angry young man.''
''Then I left Germany for a long period of time, because when you spend your time fighting something, you become in a sense part of it, and I didn't want to become an obsessive German, one way or another,'' he said. ''I felt this was really a limitation which in the long run I couldn't accept. I did my part of the job and then I left, so I could think of other things.''
 
The Student Upheavals
He returned to Germany, to West Berlin, in 1966, ''just at the moment when something began to move.'' The student upheavals that followed wrenched West Berlin and West Germany from the dependence and self-pity of the immediate postwar years.
''I was not a student, I was much older, but it was for me a very important experience,'' Mr. Enzensberger recalled. ''In hindsight, one can say it made the place inhabitable because whatever else may be said about the ludicrous sides of it, it achieved a modernization of social relations in this country, which were still sort of stuck in the 1940's or 30's or God knows when. It became a contemporary country.''
Now 59 years old, Mr. Enzensberger works out of a modern, book-lined apartment in Munich. He has a reputation as one of West Germany's finest lyric poets and is the editor of Kursbuch, literally Railroad Timetable, an influential journal for progressive intellectuals.
His ideas, Mr. Enzensberger says, were shaped by his date of birth. That was November 1929, ''at the moment of the Big Crash,'' in a small Bavarian village near the Alps.
''This gave me my political education,'' he said. ''The Nazi regime and the war and the watershed of 1945, these are things which shaped my ideas very much more than any book I can remember. In the postwar period, when I started working as a writer, I saw it as sort of being a sanitation worker: you had to clean up the place. But I always had a hand in other things because writing is an isolating task.''
 
U.S. as Empire
That fear of becoming obsessive, a specialist, of being walled in, seems to spring from the same source as Mr. Enzensberger's antipathy for the notion of Europe reduced to a technocratic and economic entity.
''In today's world, it is a great advantage to have more than one solution, more than one option,'' he said. ''It's an ecological principle, really. In evolution the faster the evolution occurs the more you need a whole assemblage, a whole barrage of possibilities, and not to reduce yourself to one. That partially is the problem with really big empires like the United States, even more so the Soviet Union and even China.''
There is in that reference to the United States as an empire an echo of the old radical. But Mr. Enzensberger is not among those who decry American influence nor the waning of it.
''There is a sea change between Europe and America,'' he said. ''It's something almost geological. It's not something you could stop by any measure. It's not a wish on the part of Europeans to get away from the alliance; I don't believe that at all. It's just a more normal relationship. This is a polycentric world. That's one of the facts of life you have to deal with and not hang onto a solution which was found, after all, in 1945.''
He travels to the United States frequently. ''To the extent that we are a protectorate, it is good to visit the capital,'' he says with a broadening smile. ''But as far as I'm concerned, it's not Washington, it's New York.''

HEADLINE: Better Leaders for Yonkers

 BODY:
Three primary races give voters a chance to shore up the leadership of Yonkers, N.Y.
In the last 15 years, Yonkers has become an unfortunate symbol of municipal irresponsibility. Three times since 1975 the city has been rescued from fiscal ruin by county or state intervention. For the past five years, a state Emergency Financial Control Board has monitored its finances. 
In 1985 a Federal district judge, Leonard Sand, found Yonkers guilty of intentional discrimination in public housing and education. While the city has had success with a voluntary desegregation plan for the schools, a stubborn majority of the seven-member City Council has risked municipal bankruptcy rather than comply with the judge's order to build moderate- and low-income housing.
The first step to better government is to re-nominate Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko. In the last two years Mr. Wasicsko has waged a brave and often lonely struggle to bring the city into compliance with Judge Sand's housing order. His effectiveness has suffered from the city's weak mayor, strong city manager structure of government. His opponent in the Democratic primary, Dominick Iannacone, is an administrator with the city's Board of Education who formerly served on the City Council and the Financial Control Board. He doesn't lack experience, but does lack conviction to carry out the judge's order.
In the most critical City Council race, in the Fifth District, Thomas Dickerson seeks to win the Republican nomination from the incumbent, Nicholas Longo. Mr. Longo, who has served on the Council since 1974, is one of four Councilmen who have consistently resisted court-ordered desegregation and vow to continue - at the expense of aggressive economic development and efficient management of city services. Though Mr. Dickerson, a lawyer, has little political experience, his focus on getting past the housing issue and putting the city's financial affairs in order is refreshing. Mr. Longo has squandered his franchise. Mr. Dickerson deserves a chance to do better.
In the First District, the incumbent, Harry Oxman, is challenged for the Democratic nomination by a promising newcomer, Joseph Farmer. Mr. Oxman, a 14-year Council veteran, has voted to carry out the housing order, which could benefit his black and Hispanic constituents. But he has not been an effective voice for compliance. Mr. Farmer, an Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Yonkers, emphasizes the need for safe, affordable housing, economic development and expanded job opportunities. He promises more energetic leadership.

HEADLINE: Somalia Warned on Human Rights Abuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Holly Burkhalter should be commended for drawing attention to the sharp deterioration in the human rights situation in Somalia (Op-Ed, Aug. 13). She is incorrect, however, when she states that ''the Bush Administration's response has been to try to shore up the faltering regime.''
The United States has strongly protested the latest human rights violations in Somalia, asked for an investigation and insisted that those responsible be brought to justice. Ms. Burkhalter was briefed on what we are doing by our Ambassador to Somalia and the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs before her article appeared. We're surprised her description is so wide of the mark. 
The Administration's request to obligate $21 million in economic support funds for Somalia was directly tied to our support for economic reforms in that country. These reforms, worked out with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, are designed to transfer economic decison-making power from the Government to the people and the marketplace - to support the very people who are suffering both from poverty and from human rights abuses.
The I.M.F. is not lending to Somalia, and we doubt that the commercial banks are providing much either. The lending programs that exist - those of the World Bank, the African Development Bank and United States economic assistance - emphasize health, education and agricultural projects designed to raise the incomes and living standards of one of the world's poorest peoples.
The serious human rights violations in Mogadishu, however, compel us to give careful scrutiny to assistance to Somalia. The events of last month are especially regrettable since there were signs over the last year that the Somali Government was improving its human rights practices and seeking reconciliation with dissident groups. The United States is waiting to see specific actions that would improve respect for human rights and return to the path of national reconciliation.
The Somali Government is in no doubt that unless these abuses stop and an investigation into the recent outrages takes place, there will be no hope for rectifying its international image or our Governments' relationship.

HEADLINE: As the Schools Go, So Goes the City

SERIES: Tomorrow's New York: The Next Mayor - An Ocassional Series

BYLINE: By FELIX G. ROHATYN; Felix G. Rohatyn, a partner with Lazard Freres & Company, is chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.

 BODY:
The failure of New York City's public schools and the implications of their disintegration for the city's future have at long last become too serious to ignore. As voters assess this year's mayoral race, they should think carefully about the candidate who has the determination and vision to create a school system to meet the city's needs in coming decades. No issue is more important to New York.
Major reform is required for two reasons. First, a decent public education should be considered a basic civil right; the goal of equal opportunity becomes a cynical slogan if decent education isn't made available. 
Second, New York City's economy will rapidly deteriorate without a supply of skilled employees for tomorrow's predominately service economy. Furthermore, the cost of unemployment and crime resulting from the high dropout rate will drive more people and businesses out of the city.
We should not accept Band-Aid approaches and mere declarations of good intent from the mayoral candidates. Turning the schools around will require fundamental changes and a new definition of what the public schools are supposed to be.
It will require strenuous political effort on the part of Gov. Mario Cuomo, legislative leaders, the next mayor, our Congressional delegation, the business community, teachers and parents. It will require a great deal of money.
To begin with, we must have competent and experienced leadership. At a time when continuity is critical, the tragic death of Chancellor Richard Green faced the Board of Education with a challenge that it failed to meet.
Chancellor Green had recently appointed a competent and experienced deputy, Bernard Mecklowitz. But the board gave in to political pressures to begin a search for a minority candidate. During this search, change is at a standstill, and a new chancellor will need from 18 months to two years to learn the system.
It is wrong to bring ethnic standards into the selection process. And it makes little sense to bring in an outsider, unless he or she is truly outstanding, when we have a perfectly experienced and able incumbent.
Second, the mayor should be made as responsibile for the performance of the schools as for the cleanliness of the streets. Accordingly, the mayor should be empowered to appoint the majority of the board, with the borough presidents appointing the balance. Under the current rules, no one appoints a majority, so no one is responsible.
Third, we should recognize that decentralization as it is now practiced has failed miserably. The community school districts are just patronage sources and corruption is rampant. The mayor, with the chancellor, should have the power to appoint half the seats on the community boards. Parents should be heavily represented.
Fourth, we have to develop new teachers. To persuade students to go into teaching, scholarships and financial incentives should be provided. To persuade them to remain in education, we need competitive compensation and civilized working conditions.
Fifth, schools must, in many cases, become extensions of the family. Schools should be open through the evening to provide after-school study and recreation facilities, meals for those children who need them and evening sessions for parents in need of educational assistance.
Counseling should be available before a child gets into trouble. There is now one counselor for every 700 children in the system; this should be brought down to one in 70 over the next five years. Tutoring should be provided on a concentrated basis; tutoring could be provided by older students in exchange for educational credits and might not involve large outlays.
Sixth, the involvement of the business community should be institutionalized. Business can assist in providing summer jobs and after-school training, furnish financial assistance for higher education and guarantee jobs for deserving graduates.
Seventh, clean and modern physical facilities should be provided by the new school construction agency on an accelerated basis.
Eighth, the schools need more money. The question, of course, is where that's going to come from.
New York City cannot afford to impose new taxes. However, it can effect savings that can be reinvested. First on the list should be the awesome educational bureaucracy, which now consumes about $600 million a year.
Citywide labor costs, which will be negotiated again in 1990, are another prime target. An increase of 5 percent to 6 percent, which would cost the city between $700 million and $900 million, is clearly unaffordable.
The city should maintain its labor costs at current levels by a combination of lower wage settlements and a smaller workforce. This can be achieved by attrition and management efforts which will produce considerable savings in future years.
By contrast, the state does have some flexibility with taxes. State income taxes have fallen from 9 percent in 1985 to 7.875 percent now, and are scheduled to drop to 7.5 percent and 7 percent in the next two years.
These cuts would amount to about $400 million in 1990 and $1.3 billion in 1991. To maintain or increase state aid to meet local needs such as education, it's worth considering whether income taxes should be temporarily frozen at present levels.
Still, it is sheer fantasy to deal with a major problem such as public education without greater Federal assistance. The budget deficit provides Washington with an excuse to do nothing. However, this is a reason to eliminate the deficit, not to ignore major problems.
The loss of Federal aid over the past eight years is dramatic. If Federal aid had continued in 1989 at 1981 levels, the city would have received $1.2 billion more in the expense budget and $1.8 billion more in housing programs. We cannot continue to make up for these losses.
An alliance of the Democratic Congressional leadership and the national business community could provide backing for a tax increase to support public education. These funds could be targeted to local governments for teacher pay, counselors, longer school hours, etc.
This is a difficult and costly agenda. But doing nothing will be costlier still. It will ultimately destroy the city's ability to function as a leading economic and cultural center.

HEADLINE: Economic Views: Koch And Challengers Differ

SERIES: The Candidates On the Issues
Last of six articles.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
When Edward I. Koch first ran for mayor 12 years ago, the issue was how to revive a city on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, after more than 10 years of an economic boom, growth is slowing - and the man who wins the mayoral election this year may have less money at his disposal to meet public demands to combat crime, drugs, homelessness and troubled schools.
The winner will have to decide whether to raise taxes to protect services, how to create more jobs and foster economic opportunity for the poor, how to keep businesses in New York City, how best to wring more money from the state and Federal governments and how to avert higher subway fares.
The candidates disagree not only about right solutions but also about the problems: just what are the prospects for this city's economy and quality of life?
In separate interviews on fiscal and budget matters, Mayor Koch's challengers painted a picture of deterioration. They said the best way to keep businesses, jobs, and prosperity was to convince New Yorkers that the quality of their lives would improve. They said they could do a better job of getting money from the state and Federal governments, and of eliminating inefficiencies at City Hall. 
As befits an incumbent, the Mayor disputed their gloomy portrayals. He predicted better economic times ahead but said he was a realist who does not expect largesse from Albany or Washington and who is prepared to raise taxes to protect services.
In assessing the health of New York's economy, economists and business executives differ, just as the candidates do.
Most economists say New York is in an economic slowdown that could lead to recession. Primarily because of cutbacks in the financial industry following the 1987 stock market collapse, New York City city lost jobs last year and has shown no job growth this year.
Mayor Koch's own financial officials predict budget gaps of $686 million in 1991, $659 million in 1992 and $125 million in 1993. And if wages for municipal employees rise at the rate of inflation, these gaps could swell by an average of $1 billion a year. Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which helped extricate New York City from its worst fiscal crisis, believes the next five years could make the mid-1970's look good by comparison.
But Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said long-term prospects were better than the current slowdown might indicate. She said an anticipated labor shortage means policy makers will have to shift their emphasis from creating new jobs to improving the work force and enhancing workers' incomes.
''We have less labor-force growth than in the 80's or 70's, which suggests we don't need to generate as many jobs overall,'' Ms. Scanlon said. ''That makes it a very different world.''
Many candidates have not touched on matters that she feels will be crucial in the 1990's economy: how to stimulate real growth in wages, which would bolster tax revenues; or how to create jobs in specific fields, like road and neighborhood improvements, which would absorb workers who do not have the mathematical or computer skills required by the new growth industries.
 
Concern, but Few Ideas
Two Democratic candidates, Richard Ravitch, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, and David N. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, voiced concern about preparing young people for the future job market. But they did not offer specific ideas on how to achieve that goal other than improving the city's schools. ''Business people know that our schools are not training the kids for the skills which we think the economy's going to require in the next 10 years,'' Mr. Ravitch said.
Mr. Ravitch, along with Harrison J. Goldin, the City Comptroller and also a Democrat, and the two Republicans, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ronald S. Lauder, said retaining businesses in New York was the key to economic development. But they differed on how to persuade businesses to stay.
Messrs. Goldin, Ravitch and Giuliani said that concerns about crime, drugs and the city's educational system were doing more to drive businesses away than the specter of higher taxes.
''The essential strategy in economic development in this city is to improve the quality of life,'' Mr. Goldin said.
Mr. Giuliani, who as a former Federal prosecutor has tried to position himself as tough on crime, said business leaders tell him: ''Taxes are a problem, but they are not the main problem. The main problem is the crime, the drugs, a work force that seems to be deteriorating, and the quality of life, the inability to move around the city, the dirtiness of the city, the condition of the roads.''
 
Taxes Remain High
New York State's and New York City's top tax rates for individuals have dropped to 11.3 percent this year from 16.3 percent in 1978, and New York City has cut its corporation tax slightly, to 8.85 percent from 9 percent, according to Stanley E. Grayson, deputy mayor for finance and economic development. These cuts make the state's tax burden more in line with that of its neighbors, but New York taxes remain higher.
Some business leaders say it would be a mistake to assume that taxes are not critical to businesses deciding whether to relocate.
James Gifford, executive director of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: ''I would hope that while the candidates pay attention to the quality of life, they would not ignore the very real pressures in terms of competitive position vis-a-vis the region and the rest of the country. We have taxes in this city we don't have anywhere else in the country.''
Mr. Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a former executive with the company, said that he would cut taxes and persuade businesses to stay in New York. ''I think a signal sent by somebody like myself to these people saying, 'Hey, we're going to make it worthwhile for you to stay here,' would stop them from leaving,'' he said.
Saying that New York City's employment growth has trailed the nation's, Mr. Lauder pledged to create ''enterprise zones.'' These would offer businesses special tax incentives and allow them to pay employees less than the minimum wage if the businesses moved to economically depressed neighborhoods.
Some financial experts endorse these ideas. Others, like Ms. Scanlon, say the benefits from enterprise zones would be confined to their neighborhoods.
 
Wall Street Dependency Seen
Along with Mr. Lauder, Mr. Dinkins made the most specific economic development proposals. He said New York's economy needed to become less dependent on Wall Street and more encouraging of small businesses. He said he would seek to develop more jobs in the garment industry and in graphic arts, medical technology and fast food businesses. Like Mr. Goldin, Mr. Dinkins is critical of Mayor Koch's $2 billion tax abatement program to keep businesses in New York. They say it offers incentives even to developers who would build in New York anyway.
Mayor Koch, defending his record, said New York City's unemployment rate was the lowest in 18 years and lower than the national average. He pointed to his administration's efforts, through tax incentives and lower energy costs, to stimulate development in boroughs outside Manhattan. He said the tax abatement program would ultimately provide $23 billion in tax revenues over 20 years, more than offsetting the $1.5 billion in taxes forgiven under the program so far.
The candidates were also divided on fiscal and budgetary issues.
 
Koch Would Raise Taxes
Mayor Koch was the only candidate to say that if the most pessimistic predictions prevail and New York City faces huge budget gaps, he would raise taxes rather than cut services. Mr. Ravitch and Mr. Dinkins said they would raise taxes only as a last resort. Mr. Goldin joined Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lauder in saying tax increases would be too harmful to the city.
Instead, Messrs. Goldin, Giuliani and Lauder said they could raise money to close budget gaps by eliminating waste.
 
Urging Preventive Investments
Mr. Dinkins said investing in preventive services - like health-care, drug education and family counseling -would spare having to spend far more money later when problems that could have been checked became crises. And he said he could be a tough negotiator in wage talks despite being endorsed by many labor groups.
''I am certainly a person who is supportive of labor,'' he said. ''But that does not mean giving away the store.''
All of Mr. Koch's opponents suggested that a new mayor could more effectively lobby for more money from Albany and Washington. Mr. Goldin suggested that he could extract tens of millions of dollars in state funds by pressing state police to patrol arterial roads in New York City as they do in other localities. Mr. Dinkins suggested that he could band together with other big-city mayors to press the Federal Government for more money. Several candidates criticized Mayor Koch for failing to make use of Federal funds for drug-education programs.
But asked whether he could expect substantial aid from Albany or Washington, Mayor Koch said: ''Realistically, you cannot. The state made it very clear this year that we lost $100 million in what the state should have given us, and we were grateful; we thanked them. We said, thank you, sir, when they gave us $300 million of the $400 million we thought we should get.''

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Gain 0.2%

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The Government index intended to predict the course of the economy rose slightly in July, suggesting that growth will continue at a moderate pace during the next three to nine months.
The increase of two-tenths of a percent in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, reported today by the Commerce Department, follows upward revisions in a series of economic statistics and provides further evidence that the economy is not on the verge of a recession.
The department also reported that construction spending edged up a scant two-hundredths of a percent in July, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $415.7 billion. A separate report from the National Association of Purchasing Management indicated that despite other economic gains, manufacturing was still sluggish. The association's index declined in August for the fourth straight month, to the lowest level since 1982. [Page 30.] In another report indicating moderate economic growth, the Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point in August, to 5.1 percent. 'Reasonably Balanced' 
''We were forecasting a recession earlier in the year, but the economy now looks reasonably balanced -moderate growth, not generating a lot of inflationary pressure,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.
The Government said the July rise in the index of leading indicators followed no change in June and a drop of 1.3 percent in May, the biggest decline since late 1987, after the stock market crash.
The small increase was in line with the expectations of many economists, who have become more optimistic in recent weeks as several Government announcements have indicated that economic growth, which had been thought to be lagging, was far from exhausted.
 
Long Expansion May Continue
Last month, the Government said retail sales for May and June were significantly stronger than first reported. Growth in the number of jobs has been consistently revised upward. These and other reports led the Commerce Department to revise its figure for economic growth in the second quarter to 2.7 percent, after factoring out inflation, from 1.7 percent.
Despite the overall strengthening, economists are not predicting that the economy is on the edge of a strong surge. Nor do they see an end soon to the expansion that has lasted six and a half years - the longest period since World War II.
A study of the index's components illustrates why growth is likely to be moderate. Of the 11 components, 5 rose in July, 5 fell and 1 remained stable.
The component that gained the most was the nation's money supply, which increased as the Federal Reserve Board loosened credit conditions in an attempt to push down interest rates and avoid a recession.
Other positive elements were a jump in consumer confidence, a rise in stock prices, an increase in plant and equipment orders and an increase in the backlog of unfilled manufacturing orders.
Of the five indicators that fell for the month, the biggest negative factor was a decline in the prices of raw materials. While this was interpreted positively in terms of being a drop of inflationary pressures, a trend of lower prices can also mean that demand for raw materials is weakening, indicating an overall slowdown.
Other negative elements were a drop in orders for consumer goods, an increase in weekly unemployment claims, a fall in building permits and slower deliveries of business items. No Change in Workweek The length of the workweek showed no change for the month.
''Though lackluster on the surface, these statistics actually suggest that the economy is continuing to undergo stable expansion,'' said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''The slow growth rates implied by these figures are in fact a key element prolonging growth.''
Mr. Ratajczak said: ''We're not solving any of our problems; we are just learning to live with them better. The trade balance is still terrible. The budget deficit still high. The underlying inflation rate is not vanishing.''
Mr. Ratajczak and others also noted that the index is not always the most reliable economic forecaster.
In particular, they point to the fact that from September through December 1987 the index turned negative, supposedly signaling a recession. But no recession occurred in 1988.
While the department's leading index rose modestly, the index of coincident indicators, which tracks current economic activity, increased five-tenths of a percent in July, while the lagging indicators that look at past economic activity fell four-tenths of a percent.
At the end of July, the leading indictors index stood at 144.0, based on 1982 equaling 100, up from 143.7 in June.

HEADLINE: Purchasers' Index Declines To Lowest Level Since '82

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The industrial side of the United States economy continued to weaken during August, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday, and an index based on a monthly survey of 250 corporate purchasing managers fell to 45.2 percent, from 46 percent in July.
That reading was the lowest since December 1982, the month after the beginning of the current economic expansion. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is in decline, while a reading above 50 percent indicates growth, the association says. 
Nevertheless, many economists discounted the possibility of recession, noting that inflation remained under control and that other economic indicators point to continued growth. For example, Norman Robertson, chief economist of the Mellon Bank, said that the economy is increasingly being dominated by the service sector, and that manufacturing is ceasing to be representative of economic direction.
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee, said all major indicators of the manufacturing sector pointed down in August.
A measure of production growth fell for the second consecutive month, to its lowest level in more than six and a half years. New orders also declined, but at a lesser rate than in July. Inventories fell for an eighth consecutive month, as purchasers adjusted to slowing production and new orders.
''The bright spot on the economic horizon continues to be relatively strong exports and sharply decreasing inflation,'' said Mr. Bretz, who is also director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
Of the 67 percent of the purchasing executives exporting, 23 percent reported better export orders, up from 22 percent who did so in July, according to the survey.
It also said prices fell in August, the third consecutive monthly decline, with purchasing executives finding 29 out of 38 selected commodities lower in price, up from 21 in July.
''All this says the economy is growing but it's slowing,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities Company International. ''The weakness in the manufacturing sector is very pronounced.''
Mr. Brusca said the Federal Reserve may soon be forced to ease its credit policies, by lowering interest rates a bit, to keep the economy moving. That sentiment helped push bond prices sharply higher yesterday, which in turn helped the stock market.
But other economists pointed to areas of strength.
''We may have a pocket of weakness in the manufacturing sector, but we've seen recent indications that show the consumer is alive and well and spending money,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, a money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''And that's keeping the economy going.''

HEADLINE: Revamped, British Air Looks Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
In a speech last year, Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways P.L.C., said, ''There has never been a global airline in the truest sense.''
If the agreement announced today to purchase 15 percent of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, goes through, Sir Colin and Lord King, British Airways' chairman, will have gone a lot further than any of their rivals toward achieving that goal. ''It would allow two of the world's best airlines to develop alongside each other as the most formidable international partnership in every part of the globe,'' Lord King said in a statement after the agreement was announced.
 
Would Preserve Valuable Links
Gaining such a stake in United, the second-largest domestic carrier in the United States, after American Airlines, would undoubtedly be a coup for British Air, by far the largest carrier in Europe. But it is also a defensive move aimed at preserving the valuable marketing alliance British Air has had with United since 1987. By owning 15 percent of United, British Air would effectively prevent a foreign rival from displacing it. Foreign carriers are not allowed to own more than 25 percent of a United States airline. 
''This is an opportunity of a lifetime, but it also preserves something they have,'' said Robert J. Joedicke, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
A stake in United would be only the most recent remarkable feat for Lord King and Sir Colin. In the early 1980's, the airline, then owned by the Government, was racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Service was so poor that the joke among passengers was that B.A. stood for ''bloody awful.'' But since the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher privatized the airline in 1987, it has earned a reputation for good service and has become one of the world's most profitable carriers.
 
'To Fly, To Serve'
Much of the credit goes to John King, who was installed as chairman in 1981 by Mrs. Thatcher, with the mission of turning British Air into an airline that could stand on its own as a private company. A Conservative Party loyalist who was later awarded a peerage, he shared Mrs. Thatcher's view that British industry needed a drastic overhaul.
It was Lord King who recruited Colin Marshall, a seasoned marketing executive who had previously worked at Avis Inc. Sir Colin, who was knighted in 1987, tightened management ranks and helped to improve employee morale and service with new uniforms, workshops and a new motto: ''To fly, to serve.''
British Airways formed the alliance with United in a bid to increase its lucrative trans-Atlantic business. It has coordinated its Atlantic flights with United's domestic schedule, and the two are integrated in United's powerful computer reservation system, in which British Airways has a stake. The two also share terminals and coordinate baggage handling in several large airports.
 
Profitable U.S. Service
The results have been telling: since the alliance, the number of United passengers who transfer to British Airways' trans-Atlantic flights has soared 40 percent, while those going from British Air to United has jumped 30 percent. British Airways' routes to the United States, which are much more profitable than its European routes, accounted for 34 percent of its traffic, 33 percent of its revenues and 53 percent of its operating profit of $523 million in the year that ended March 31.
British Airways is third in the North Atlantic market, behind Pan Am and T.W.A., according to Airline Economics, a Washington-based consulting firm. In its last fiscal year, the company had pretax income of $417 million on revenues of $6.63 billion.
A permanent link with United is especially important because several of British Air's European competitors have also been forging ties with United States carriers. S.A.S. owns just under 10 percent of Texas Air; KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was part of an investor group that bought Northwest, and more recently, Delta and Swissair agreed to buy 5 percent of each other's stock.
Amid this flurry of agreements, an equity position in United ''is especially important to assure the continuation of a powerful marketing agreement,'' said Lee R. Howard, executive vice president of Airline Economics, a consulting firm.
 
Looking at Other Deals
Lord King and Sir Colin, believing that size would also be crucial to surviving in a deregulated world, have made no secret of their ambitions to expand. In late 1987, British Airways bought British Caledonia, its only serious domestic competitor. British Airways and KLM are currently trying to negotiate a deal that would give each of them a 20 percent stake in Sabena World Airlines, the Belgian carrier. Such a deal might enable British Airways, which already dominates London's Heathrow Airport, to develop Brussels into a major hub.
With deregulation under way in Europe, competition is expected to intensify here, which would make a deal with United all the more important. In the last fiscal year, British Airways' trans-Atlantic business had a 13 percent gain in operating profits. That compared with 1.5 percent in Europe.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 14.82, to a Record 2,752.09

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose to another record yesterday, bolstered by lower interest rates in the credit markets, covering of short sales and a re-evaluation of several economic indicators.
In moderately heavy trading before the Labor Day weekend, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 14.82 points, to 2,752.09. Stocks that advanced outpaced those that declined by 897 to 498. 
New peaks were also achieved in the broader market. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.28 points, to 353.73, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 1.10, to 196.37.
Volume on the Big Board shrank to 133.3 million shares, from 143.4 million on Thursday.
 
Dow Up 19.73 for Week
For the week, the Dow rose 19.73 points. The average has now made gains for nine consecutive weeks, the longest string of advances since a 14-week stretch in 1965.
''This leaves it highly susceptible for some near-term reversals,'' said Harry S. Laubscher, an analyst at Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day. ''Historically, September has not been a happy month for investors.''
He added: ''Although the Dow industrials have been giving new buy signals lately, it should be kept in mind that from a seasonal viewpoint, the market is vulnerable to profit taking. Cyclical stocks, a key component of the Dow, are once again attracting buying attention.''
Boeing gained 1 5/8, to 56 3/8, and International Paper 5/8, to 58 3/4.
In the auto sector, General Motors rose a point, to 50, reaching another high for the year. It was the most active issue, with a volume of slightly more than two million shares. Elsewhere in the group, Chrysler added 3/8, to 27, and Ford rose 3/8, to 54 1/4. Encouraging Economic Reports In economic reports released yesterday, the Government said construction spending was virtually flat for July, that the leading economic indicators were up two-tenths of a percent in July, and that the civilian unemployment rate declined one-tenth of a percentage point in August. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 110,000 workers in August.
The data suggested that the economy is in a slow-growth pattern, which is positive for both stocks and bonds. By late yesterday, the 30-year Treasury issue had risen by about three-quarters of a point.
The Dow transportation average jumped 16.90 points, to 1,526.32. UAL rose 7 1/4, to 287. The pilots' union at UAL's United Airlines, along with management and British Airways, made a bid of $300 a share. This would top a $275-a-share bid by Marvin Davis, an investor in Beverly Hills, Calif. Utilities Are Active Among individual issues, Niagara Mohawk was the second-most-heavily traded issue on the Big Board. The utility, in an apparent dividend-capture play, edged up 1/8, to 12 3/4, on a volume of more than 1.9 million shares. Texas Utilities was also active, rising 1/8, to 32 1/8, on a volume of nearly 1.5 million shares.
Zenith Electronics fell a point, to 15 1/2, in response to the company's announcement that it expects a loss for the third quarter.
Records were also set on the American Stock Exchange, where the market-value index gained 1.77 points, to 383.96, and in over-the-counter trading, where the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.01 points, to 471.34.
In over-the-counter trading, Lyphomed rose 1 3/8, to 31 3/8. The company's board accepted a $31.87-a-share buyout offer from the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company. Fujisawa, which currently owns 30 percent of the pharmaceutical company, last week agreed to purchase the 14 percent of Lyphomed owned by its chairman, Dr. John N. Kapoor.

The dollar gained against all major foreign currencies yesterday after reports were issued with positive economic data, including statistics showing strength in the nation's job market in August.
Gold prices rose domestically after weakening overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $360.60 an ounce, up 70 cents from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late gold price of $359.25, up 65 cents. 
The dollar's ascent began after the Government reported that the August unemployment rate declined one-tenth of a percentage point, to 5.1 percent, with the creation of more than 200,000 new nonfarm jobs. The figure excluded the effect of the phone strikes.
The Government also reported that construction spending inched up two-hundredths of 1 percent in July and the index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent that month.
''The numbers were very positive in terms of showing economic strength,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior trader with the Irving Trust Company, ''and that indicates that rates will remain firm.''
Marek Stefanowicz, a senior dealer at Nomura Bank International P.L.C. in London, agreed, ''We're not likely to see interest rate cuts in the near-term.''
Higher rates support the dollar because they make dollar-denominated stocks and bonds more attractive to foreigners.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.17 yen to a closing 145.45 yen from Thursday's 144.28. It was later quoted at 145.23 yen in London, and at 145.60 yen in New York, up from 145.065. The dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.5565 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.5735 late Thursday. A pound cost $1.55775 in New York, down from $1.5650.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.9790 West German marks, up from 1.9675; 1.70725 Swiss francs, up from 1.7005; 6.6665 French francs, up from 6.6290; 1.1815 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17935; and 1,417.00 Italian lire, up from 1,411.00.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday, were: 1.9785 West German marks, up from 1.9580; 1.7085 Swiss francs, up from 1.6880; 2.2200 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2090; 6.6700 French francs, up from 6.6035; 1.1817 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1758; and 1,413.50 Italian lire, up from 1,406.90.

HEADLINE: Comparing Their Answers: Managing the City's Economy

SERIES: The Candidates on the Issues: Last of six articles

 BODY:
In separate interviews last month, The New York Times asked the six New York City mayoral candidates to discuss some of the major problems facing the city in 1989 and how they would deal with them. This is the last of six articles comparing their responses. Excerpts from the interviews appear [below].
Q. With the city's budget problems, how would you keep services at the current level? Raise taxes? Cut spending?
 
THE DEMOCRATS
DINKINS: We need to be mindful of our ability to produce some money through matching funds, as is the case with money for preventive services. A raising of taxes is an absolute last resort. 
GOLDIN: The size of budgetary deficits depends to a very large extent on the size of collective bargaining settlements. These deficits with which we're confronted that everybody assumes are inexorable may or may not be inexorable. I think we're going to need somebody who's prepared to be tough in negotiation in collective bargaining. I believe that the mayor's office is bloated. I believe many of these agencies are bloated. To me, a time of economic weakness is a ridiculous time to raise taxes.
KOCH: In balancing our budget there has to be a division between reductions in services and increases in taxes. Certain services have to be exempt. We've always exempted over the last years education, Special Services for Children, Health and Hospitals Corporation. I'm only prepared to say that I am always prepared to raise taxes rather than rely only on service cuts. And then when it comes to service cuts, you have to look at every agency.
RAVITCH: I'd raise taxes to produce these expenditures if I couldn't find the money from any other source. But there are a lot of variables; I don't know what the condition of the economy is going to be. I don't know what the attitude of the Congress of the United States is going to be. I don't know what the attitude of the state government's going to be.
 
THE REPUBLICANS
GIULIANI: You have got to work hard to do all the things you can do to produce additional revenues for this city that involve no raising of taxes. Because we're going to lose business if we raise taxes, and we're going to lose people. A parking violations bureau that was run honestly would produce $150 million more per year. No responsible mayor or governor can rule out the necessity of raising taxes. You try to avoid it. This city has to crack down very, very hard on the criminal and underground economy and try to realize a lot of revenue from the criminal and underground economy.
LAUDER: Enterprise zones are a very effective way of getting people, getting companies, to start thinking of expanding in areas that are very difficult areas to build businesses in. Services sometimes are not a function of just putting money in, it's a question of efficiency. I don't buy the fact that just because you have less money to spend, you have worse services.
Q. How would you seek to increase state and Federal aid?
 
THE DEMOCRATS
DINKINS: You just don't accept that some things can't change. If your cause is just and meritorious, you ought to try. It's only when you've got the whip hand can you demand something. Otherwise you must say, ''Come, let us reason together. Let me show you why it's in your interest.'' About five or six cities have 60 percent of the AIDS cases, you know. As mayor, I would get the mayors of those other jurisdictions, go to Washington and say, ''Look, this is the problem. This is larger than we can handle as municipalities and we need some help.''
GOLDIN: I would hope that within limited areas we would be able to achieve a certain rectification of inequity. For example, there are only two cities in this state in which the state police do not patrol arterial roads: one of them is Buffalo; the other is New York. There are only three locations in this state where the state does not conduct boiler inspections. There are lots of examples I could give you.
KOCH: I think I have a very good relationship in Albany and I have a very good relationship with the Speaker. I doubt that any of my opponents have dinner on a regular basis at their home with the Speaker. I believe that, contrary to saying that I've worn out my welcome, I do well, very well, in Albany. I may embarrass people. They may get mad at me for the moment, but they know I'm not asking for handouts for myself.
RAVITCH: I think a mayor with the right attitude, right strength, can accelerate the process. National and Federal Governments recognize that we can't continue the way we're going because of the problems that we have in this society.
 
THE REPUBLICANS
GIULIANI: I don't think we can expect a big pot of gold. However, on the other side of that, we've got a city that didn't know how to get Federal money that was there. I think what we're going to have to do is wake up to the modern era and look for the opportunities that are there, not cry over the old ones. And I think I'm in the best position to do that.
LAUDER: As a Republican, I have a working relationship with President Bush, Senator D'Amato and the Republican majority in the New York State Senate. I know that as mayor, I can work together with these elected officials to make sure that New York gets its fair share of state and Federal revenues.
Q. How would you perk up the New York City economy and create jobs?
 
THE DEMOCRATS
DINKINS: We need to diversify our economy. We need not to be at the mercy of an October in Wall Street. We need to assist the garment industry and graphic arts. We need to think of incubators, which would assist small businesses with the struggle to get started. You give them different kinds of assistance.
GOLDIN: I think the essential strategy in economic development in this city is to improve the quality of life. You've got to communicate to people who are investing in New York or expanding, potentially, their businesses or thinking of moving into the city or thinking about where to locate if they're already in the city that we are sensitive to the quality-of-life issues, to education and crime.
KOCH: We have a city that, while it has a lot of light-manufacturing jobs, we nevertheless have lost several hundred thousand jobs. But the country lost a million, too, in the same period of time. So manufacturing to a great degree has left America for Korea and Mexico and other places, regrettably. We have met that by new jobs in what they call the buyer sector: the financial, insurance, real estate, etc. So you have to understand that New York City is not alone. When you look at the national economy, we're worlds ahead of the national economy.
RAVITCH: Improve the quality of life. Businesses don't tell the truth as to their reasons for relocating. It's a hell of a lot less to do with taxes and a lot more to do with schools, crime and drugs.
 
THE REPUBLICANS
GIULIANI: What the city is going to have to do, it's going to have to show progress to business leaders here. We're going to have to show progress in rolling back the crime problem, rolling back the drug problem; the mayor taking charge of our school system and leading a radical reform of the system. You can't get that done in a year or two, but what we want business leaders in this city to see is hey, we're marching now in the right direction. The main problem is the crime, the drugs, a work force that seems to be deteriorating, and the quality of life, the inability to move around the city, the dirtiness of the city, the condition of the roads.
LAUDER: Enterprise zones are a very effective way of getting people, getting companies, to start thinking of expanding in areas that are very difficult areas to build businesses in. New York City has one of the best harbors, probably, in the world. It used to be a bustling place. Today, the harbor is all but empty with, I believe, two cargo docks left. And I believe -- and it's working very effectively in various European countries -- a free-trade zone, which will allow people to bring their cargo in and not have to pay taxes, would have a dramatic effect on our entire harbor.
Q. Would you continue the city's tax abatement program for developers?
 
THE DEMOCRATS
DINKINS: Yo'Uve got to be sure that it is effective for us. I mean, you can't just give it away. I might go as strong as, say, consider a moratorium. But I wouldn't say, flat, moratorium.
GOLDIN: I believe that tax forgiveness for residential housing in Manhattan south of 110th Street is absurd. The problem with government is that it operates on inertia. It is incapable of recognizing that when you target a program to deal with a problem, there comes a time when the continued addressing of the remedy is no longer relevant or appropriate.
KOCH: Definitely. As a result of that, the new buildings that have been built -- in basically Manhattan, but not exclusively -- will, over a 20-year period, provide $23 billion in new taxes at a cost of $1.5 billion in taxes that we're not collecting. That's 20 to 1 leverage. We think it's terrific. And we've expanded those programs in the other boroughs.
RAVITCH: The mayor has to have a lot of tools in his arsenal to keep businesses here in tough economic times. But ultimately the use of tax abatements is self-defeating. I would prefer tax deferments to tax abatements so the city ultimately recoups its revenue.
 
THE REPUBLICANS
GIULIANI: I'm not saying that tax abatements used wisely can't be helpful. What I'm saying is that the issues are much broader than just taxes and that if we don't focus on that, we can give all of the tax abatements in the world that we want. If you end up getting mugged three times, you want to move out of the city.
LAUDER: I have proposed cutting commercial rent taxes by one-third. And not just for big business, but for mom and pop establishments as well. The point is that we have to create a climate in New York City that lures business in, not drives it away. Across-the-board tax reduction is the best way to ensure economic growth.

HEADLINE: Connecticut's Condo Capital Deals With Boom Gone Bust

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRANFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
In the long housing boom of the 70's and 80's, this bustling town on Long Island Sound became known as the condominium capital of Connecticut. More than 3,200 town houses and apartments sprouted in fields and forests and along the rocky shore.
The condominiums brought badly needed housing and new business for Main Street; they helped keep property taxes among the lowest in the state. But they also brought more traffic and longer lines at grocery stores and 50 percent more people, changing a semi-rural area into a more urban place.
''When I was in high school, Branford was a small town where everyone knew each other,'' said Pam Poskus, a 40-year-old librarian. ''Now it seems like a town full of strangers.'' 
But now the boom is over. The sluggish economy in the Northeast has slowed all housing sales in the region, but the condominium market, already weakened by overbuilding, has been particularly affected.
And Branford residents are coping not only with the consequences of growth but also with the implications of the self-contained communities that often have little need or desire to interact with the town around them.
One response has been a revision in the zoning code to limit high-density building. Another is surging community support for environmental causes and land preservation.
Two decades after the first large condominium complexes emerged on the suburban landscape, hundreds of towns and villages across the New York metropolitan region are grappling with changes in appearance and character created by condominium housing.
Nationwide more than 30 million people live in multi-family complexes, ranging from attached town houses to low-rise condominium apartments. They are governed by homeowner associations that maintain buildings and grounds and set rules of conformity and standards in taste. These complexes have mushroomed in the last 20 years and now account for as much as 75 percent of the housing in some municipalities.
In the New York area, suburbs from Plainsboro, N.J., which reluctantly approved multi-family housing, to Ossining, N.Y., which encouraged condominium development to spur its economy, have recently moved to slow growth to help preserve their suburban character.
 
Building Boom Overwhelmed Zoning
 Nowhere have the pressures of condominium development been felt more acutely than here in Branford, a town of 30,000 people with a village green and distinct neighborhoods with bucolic-sounding names like Pine Orchard and Stony Creek. Settled by English farmers in 1644, Branford flourished in the 1800's as a summer resort for vacationers from Hartford and as a hub of metal-fabricating factories.
Most Branford residents work in the New Haven area. A postwar suburb of New Haven, in the 1970's Branford entered a building boom driven by aggressive developers and changing demographics. The high cost of land, the baby-boom demand for starter housing, and more elderly couples seeking to trade the family house for something smaller exerted pressure to build more units.
And build they did. Branford's 47 condominium complexes, with 3,253 units, represent about 30 percent of the town's total housing. Since 1979, however, 1,137 building permits have been approved for condominiums compared with 742 permits for detached single-family houses.
''Branford allowed the developers to take what they wanted, and now we've overbuilt,'' said Judy E. Gott, the First Selectwoman of Branford, who was first elected in 1983 largely on her pledge to slow the growth of higher-density condominiums.
Zoning codes require larger complexes to devote at least 10 percent of their total area to open space or places for recreation. Even so, many residents complain that the density of many developments does not fit in with their neighborhood.
''Sure, I'd do things differently now,'' said Gene Bontatibus, chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission from 1977 to 1981, when 849 condominiums units were approved, often over fierce community opposition. ''But back then so many developers were coming in with so many proposals there wasn't enough time to rewrite the regulations.''
The condominiums range from Wilcox Estates, a secluded seven-unit waterfront development, to the Greens, a sprawling 347-unit town house complex. The complexes are scattered throughout the town, but most are massed in a wooded area north of downtown, or on former farmland two miles west of Town Hall. ''Some are well designed, well landscaped and well integrated into the community,'' said Jeffrey C. Clark, president of the Branford Land Trust, a land preservation group. ''Others look more like barracks.''
 
Changing Attitudes As Pressures Rise
 Town officials said condominium growth is largely responsible for swelling Branford's population to about 30,000 people from 23,363 in 1980 and 20,444 in 1970. While the complexes maintain their own roads and collect their own refuse, town officials attribute the need for additional municipal services in part to the rising number of condominium dwellers. Officials point to several examples:
* Since 1984, the Branford Police Department has grown to 41 officers from 32.
* Three years ago, the town hired its first full-time planner, to replace a part-time employee.
* The Branford School District is planning to build additions to two elementary schools to help accommodate a 12 percent increase in elementary-school-age pupils since 1984.
''There's a definite feeling among townspeople and even among condo owners that enough is enough; 'condominium' has become an ugly word,'' said June Rifkin, a 54-year-old Branford Town Councilwoman who has lived in the Turtle Bay complex for nine years.
In response to the growth, the town revised its zoning code two years ago to limit condominium construction to a maximum of 6 per acre from a maximum of 18 per acre. And community support of environmental causes has reached an all-time high. The Branford Land Trust's campaign earlier this year to help buy and preserve a 69.5-acre wooded tract called Beacon Hill raised $110,000 in six months.
Even the sharpest critics of growth, like Mrs. Gott, acknowledge that condominiums have played an important role in addressing housing needs in Branford, where the median price of a condominium is $126,900 compared with $178,000 for a house. Hundreds of units are for sale here as part of a statewide glut so serious that the Connecticut State Housing Department is considering a program of buying unsold units for low- and moderate-income housing. Town house sales in Branford have slumped by 50 percent in the past two years, real-estate agents said, despite price reductions of 10 to 15 percent.
Condominium units that two years ago sold in a matter of days, now sit on the market for as long as a year.
Unlike the situation in Texas, however, where the oil bust devastated the economy and made ghost towns of many condominium complexes, the need for housing in the Northeast virtually guarantees that the town houses and apartments here will stay filled. About 20 percent of Branford's condominiums are rented, but in some complexes that share is higher, real-estate agents said.
 
Learning to Live In a Different World
 Condominium living has attracted a growing number of single adults, two-income families and older couples whose children have grown up. Many of these people seek the charms of suburban living without the time-consuming chores of mowing lawns, weeding gardens and shoveling snow.
''People thought it was going to be Camelot,'' said Maureen M. Jeppesen, president of the Branford Condominium Association, a group of 35 complexes here. ''All the promotional brochures said, 'Move in and someone else will assume all the responsibilities.' Well, it's not Camelot because you're not always master of your own destiny.''
To live in one of the 160 town houses with amenities like tennis courts, a swimming pool and a sauna, the Rifkins obey rules that govern such personal tastes as the color of their screen door (beige), the height of flowers on their deck (no taller than the railing), and the type of outdoor grill they use (gas, no charcoal). ''Once you've owned your own house, the rules are irritating,'' Mrs. Rifkin said. ''But they're a tradeoff for living so close to other people.''
That proximity - a bane to most suburban homeowners - is comforting to many condominium residents. ''When I'm out of town, it's great to know my neighbors are there if my daughter needs them,'' said Linda Elliott, a 36-year-old computer sales representative who lives in the Foxbridge Village complex with her 17-year-old daughter, Stacy. ''This is a lot different than what I grew up in,'' said Ms. Elliott, whose family lived in a house in Waterbury. ''But then so is my life style.''
Changing styles of living have attracted people like Arnold and Connie Cestari: older couples whose children have grown up and who now have more room than they want or need. ''I was tired of the responsibilities,'' said Mr. Cestari, a retired school principal who sold his lakefront house in North Branford and moved to Turtle Bay two years ago.
''You need different things at different times in life,'' Mrs. Rifkin said. ''I went through the American dream of a house and a plot of land, and this was an incredible alternative. It's like a country club.''
With built-in amenities and built-in services, many people in condominiums said they have few ties to the greater town. ''We moved here two years ago from East Haven, and I still haven't been to the center of Branford,'' said Eileen Albinger, a 56-year-old bank clerk who lives in Foxbridge Village.
A highly transient population in condominiums hinders their residents' participation in local government, school organizations and church activities, members of the clergy and town officials said. In local elections, 60 percent of Branford's registered voters typically vote, compared with 30 to 40 percent of the registered condominium residents, elected officials said.
Condominium associations here and elsewhere collect fees from homeowners to pay for garbage pickup, street cleaning and snow removal. But three years ago, condominium owners here complained that they were being taxed twice for the services when they paid their municipal property taxes. The homeowners eventually negotiated a deal with the town to refund the cost of garbage collection, $350,000 a year.
For many younger couples, town houses are but a comfortable stop en route to their dream home somewhere else. Said Judith Samuels, a 27-year-old physician who lives with her husband, Michael, and their 18-month-old son, Joshua, at Foxbridge Village: ''We can't wait to have our own home and not see neighbors for miles.''

HEADLINE: U.S. DRAFTS PLANS TO CURB ADMISSION OF SOVIET JEWS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The State Department and other Federal agencies have drafted plans that would make large numbers of Soviet Jews ineligible for admission to the United States as refugees. A likely effect of the plan would be to channel many of them to Israel, whose Government has long sought such a move.
In addition, the Bush Administration is vigorously opposing bills passed by both houses of Congress that would make it easier for Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians to come to this country as refugees. The State and Justice Departments say they oppose the legislation because it would create huge numbers of ''presumptive refugees'' whose resettlement would impose immense costs on the Government.
Confidential State Department documents show that the Administration is making elaborate plans to cope with a dramatic increase in emigration resulting from the relaxation of Soviet exit restrictions. 
 
Rise in Soviet Emigration
Soviet Jewish emigration leaped from 8,155 in 1987 to 18,965 last year and appears likely to exceed 48,000 this year, American officials say. Another big increase is expected next year. The preliminary figure for August was 6,756, the highest monthly figure in more than 20 years.
The Soviet relaxation is among the changes put into effect since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took power in 1985. Some American and Israeli officials say persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union has abated in the Gorbachev era, but many members of Congress and American Jewish groups say Mr. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, has allowed freer expression of virulent anti-Semitic sentiments by grass-roots organizations.
 
Difficulties Increase
For years, the United States has insisted that Soviet Jews should have complete freedom in choosing their destinations. But Administration officials say the United States can no longer accommodate all those who want to come here, for economic reasons as well as the increasing difficulty of proving that the Jews are political or religious refugees.
Most of the plan is subject to approval by President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in his capacity as supervisor of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It is not subject to approval by Congress, although Congress could pass legislation to block or revise it. A State Department document says the Administration hopes to ''avoid Congressional hearings and legislation'' on the issue. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, the President decides the number of refugees who may be admitted each year, and he is required to consult with Congress on the reasons for granting admission to refugees from various parts of the world.
The most significant change contemplated by the Administration would gradually end the use of Rome and Vienna as way stations for Jews leaving the Soviet Union. There would be a ''rapid increase'' in the staff of the American Embassy in Moscow, ''so a greatly increased volume of refugees and immigrants can be handled'' there by early 1990, according to a State Department planning document. The Administration has already endorsed adding staff in Moscow to clear a large backlog of applications and handle the many who would still apply. Relatives in the U.S. Under the State Department plan, Soviet Jews who have no relatives in or other ties to the United States would become ineligible for admission as refugees. At least half of Soviet Jewish applicants are in that category, known as ''priority 6,'' the lowest level in the United States Government ranking system.
State Department documents show that American officials hope there would be ''direct charter flights to Israel'' from Moscow for Soviet Jews who became ineligible for refugee status in the United States. Israeli officials said they welcomed the prospect that the United States would tighten restrictions on the admission of Soviet Jews, because that meant that more would go to Israel. Israeli officials contend that an influx of thousands of Soviet Jews would strengthen Israel.
The plan was developed secretly by an group composed of officials from the State Department, the immigration service, the F.B.I. and the Central Intelligence Agency.
The idea has caused soul-searching and debate among American Jewish groups. Some say that the United States has an obligation to admit Soviet Jews after demanding for more than 15 years that Moscow let them leave.
''We don't want to collaborate with the U.S. Government on a selection plan that bars Soviet Jews without close relatives in the United States, because that would disqualify some leaders of the Soviet emigration movement,'' said Pamela B. Cohen, president of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.
But David A. Harris, Washington representative of the American Jewish Committee, said, ''A growing number of American Jews are coming to believe that limits on refugee entry to the United States would not be so terrible if they result in greater voluntary migration to Israel.''
 
Request From Shamir
On a visit to Washington in 1987, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel asked President Ronald Reagan to deny refugee status to Soviet Jews so they would go to Israel.
Israeli officials say the United States insults Israel when it grants refugee status to Soviet Jews holding Israeli visas. Most Jews leaving the Soviet Union have done so on Israeli visas; until recently, there was no alternative for those wishing to leave.
Until September 1988, Soviet Jews were almost automatically assumed to be refugees. Lawyers at the State Department and the Justice Department concluded last year that such an assumption was improper. They insisted that each Soviet applicant be interviewed to see if he or she could demonstrate ''a well-founded fear of persecution.''
Since September 1988, the United States has denied refugee status to 5,430 Soviet Jews, or 19 percent of the 28,767 who applied. State Department officials acknowledge that the stricter policy was motivated, in part, by a desire to save money. Transportation and resettlement cost the Government an average of $7,000 for each refugee.
About 14,000 Jews who managed to get out of the Soviet Union are in limbo in Ladispoli, Italy, outside Rome. Many are waiting for the United States to rule on their refugee applications; some have already been turned down. The United States helps pay for their food and housing in Italy. The Federal Government would avoid such costs if it ruled on applications in Moscow instead of Rome.
 
Demonstration in Rome
On Friday, about 500 Soviet Jews demonstrated outside the American Embassy in Rome to underline their desire to enter the United States as refugees.
State Department documents show that the United States is considering the creation of ''a U.S. processing center in the New York City vicinity.'' Soviet refugees could go there for medical examinations, counseling and resettlement assistance. No site has been chosen.
The documents also show that the United States has experienced severe bureaucratic problems in trying to manage the flow of Soviet emigres. For example, the documents say, the American Embassy provides ''inadequate, untimely and confusing flight information'' on refugees leaving Moscow. The State Department ''does not want to expend the large amount of money needed'' to buy airplane tickets for Soviet refugees, and the United States Public Health Service is ''very concerned about the appalling level'' of additional work for doctors who must examine refugees, the documents say.
In Moscow, more than 30,000 Soviet citizens who have filed refugee applications are waiting to be interviewed at the American Embassy. Kathleen Thompson, senior refugee officer at the immigration service here, said there was ''an informal queue'' of another 30,000 Soviet citizens waiting to file applications.
The F.B.I. has expressed concern about the plan to send more immigration examiners and consular officers to Moscow to clear up the backlog. The Soviet Union would probably assert a reciprocal right to send additional personnel here, and Charles W. Steinmetz, a spokesman for the bureau, said the F.B.I. feared that some of the Soviet personnel would be spies.
 
Concern Over Spies
F.B.I. officials including the Director, William S. Sessions, also express concern that spies may be hidden among the many people coming to the United States as a result of more liberal Soviet emigration policies.
As the Administration tries to restrict admissions of Soviet refugees, Congress is moving in the opposite direction.
By a vote of 358 to 44, the House of Representatives passed a bill in July that would give Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians virtually automatic status as refugees in the coming year. The bill, sponsored by Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, would establish a legal presumption that such people were persecuted in the Soviet Union, eliminating the need to for them to present independent evidence of persecution.
Janet G. Mullins, an Assistant Secretary of State, denounced the bill, saying it implied ''a U.S. commitment to resettle'' thousands of Soviet refugees.
''The budgetary implications of such numbers are potentially staggering,'' she said in a letter to Mr. Morrison. Administration officials have been trying to persuade Jewish groups to reduce their support of the bill.
The Senate has unanimously approved legislation that would lower the standard of proof for Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians seeking refugee status. The State Department opposes this measure, proposed by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, on the ground that it would give preferential treatment to a small group of would-be immigrants.
House and Senate negotiators will try to resolve their differences when they meet to discuss the legislation later this year.

HEADLINE: Non-Superpowers Are Developing Their Own Spy Satellite Systems

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A growing number of nations are building spy satellites or advocating such action, threatening to end the East-West monopoly on espionage from outer space.
Today only the United States, the Soviet Union and China have spy satellites that orbit hundreds of miles above the Earth. Cameras in many of these craft take pictures of targets on the ground that are of military and economic interest. Their pictures are either beamed to earth on encrypted radio signals or are returned in small capsules that plunge through the atmosphere and are later retrieved for processing. Other spy satellites gather electronic signals like military and civilian communications.
Experts say several nations are now taking steps to develop both photographic and electronic spy satellites, including Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Israel, and possibly India and South Africa. Some of these nations openly advertise their efforts. In other cases, experts have deduced the existence of secret military programs. 
 
Altering the Diplomatic Equation
The proliferation of spy satellites could have the salutary effect of deterring surprise attacks, some experts say, or it could produce the opposite result, helping a malevolent nation to plan and carry out an attack on hard-to-find targets. The spread of space surveillance technology is also expected to alter the diplomatic equation, freeing many nations from reliance on the current space powers for data.
Analysts say many nations are already using civilian ''remote sensing'' spacecraft as makeshift spy satellites. These craft routinely photograph the Earth for scientific and commercial uses, like map making and forestry management. Although their images are far fuzzier than those of spy satellites, they offer some ability to view tanks, ships, missiles, aircraft, military sites and arms factories.
 
A Deterrent to War
Shedding the customary cloak of secrecy surrounding space espionage, some nations are openly calling for the spread of spy satellites as a deterrent to war. Both Canada and Sweden have proposed international peacekeeping satellites that could police East-West arms control treaties, checking, for instance, to see whether missiles had been dismantled as promised.
The Western European Union, a nine-nation security organization, has said Europe should find a way to verify American-Soviet treaties independently, arguing that Europeans can otherwise be ''manipulated politically.''
Private experts, meanwhile, offer mixed appraisals on the import of the technology's diffusion.
''These satellites have a dark side,'' Michael Krepon, a space reconnaissance expert, wrote recently in the journal Foreign Policy. ''They can assist countries in attacking neighboring and even distant states.'' On the positive side, he said, the satellites can help deter surprise attacks and monitor cease-fire and disengagement agreements.
Some analysts say the trend could upset old spheres of influence shaped by the fact that nations with spy satellites have often shared space photographs with allies to win loyalty and influence behavior.
''The proliferation of national observation satellites could indirectly affect the superpowers by reinforcing tendencies toward greater independence among the European states, thereby complicating alliance management,'' Hugh De Santis, a senior staff member of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., wrote in the summer issue of The Washington Quarterly.
Adm. Stansfield Turner, Director of Central Intelligence under President Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that America should lead the trend, not fight it.
''Openness in the world is going to be unavoidable,'' he said. ''We need to adapt before it arrives.'' He said one way would be for the United States to share some of its spy-satellite photographs through an ''open skies'' agency that would warn governments of attack, rapidly determine the extent of natural disasters and provide development support by measures like helping to chart roads in rugged terrain.
''We should take control of the situation,'' Admiral Turner said. ''Some control is better than none, and we're going to have none in another 10 years.''
Analysts say building spy satellites can be very expensive, a factor that has limited their proliferation to date.
 
Several Billion Dollars Needed
''An investment of several billion dollars is required to establish a launch site, build the launch vehicles, develop the satellite, construct a ground control station or network, purchase the necessary computers and imagery enhancement software, and maintain a staff of photointerpreters,'' Dr. Jeffrey T. Richelson, a Washington-based space reconnaissance expert, wrote in the September issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
Despite the high cost, several nations are said to be pursuing the goal, usually as an outgrowth of space programs that have already fired rockets and lofted other types of satellites.
The most open effort is led by France. Its program, Helios, is derived from its successful SPOT program, which began operation in 1986 and sells its photos on the open market. SPOT can detect objects on the ground as small as 30 feet in diameter. In contrast, the Helios military satellite will reportedly view objects as small as one foot in diameter. Some of the American military's own photographic spy satellites are said to be powerful enough to see numbers on a license plate.
French officials talk openly of the effort, though usually anonymously to the media. ''It's a matter of pride,'' said Ann M. Florini, a space reconnaissance expert at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''The French want to continue to assert themselves as space leaders in Europe.''
Helios is to cost more than $1 billion and be lofted in the early 1990's, French reports say. In addition to cameras, it will reportedly be equipped with antennas to gather electronic signals.
American experts say the Helios effort has been joined by Italy, which is paying 15 percent of the cost, and Spain, which is paying 5 percent. Both nations will have some access to the satellite's photos. Last year a group of Dutch military experts called on the Netherlands to participate in Helios's successor, for which plans are already laid.
 
Some Are Suspected of Building
In contrast to the declared efforts of France, Italy and Spain, other nations are not known to be building spy satellites but are suspected of doing so on the basis of clues gathered by reconnaissance experts and news organizations.
A nation that has already launched what may be a prototype spy satellite is Israel. Dr. Richelson said in his article in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that Israel's 343-pound Ofek 1 satellite, lofted last September, had an orbit and altitude that suggested ''it was a crucial step in the development of an Israeli photo-reconnaissance satellite.''
Officially, Israel has said the satellite, which re-entered the Earth's atmosphere in January, was a demonstration project meant to test space-based radio transmission and to collect information on the Earth's magnetic field. But Israeli officials have hinted that future satellites could have military uses. Ofek 2 and 3 are already being planned, although little is known of their mission.
Most experts assume that future Israeli satellites would spy on Arab territory. For instance, a satellite could peer into Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia, all of which are taking steps to acquire ballistic missiles, to warn of an impending attack.
Britain had a celebrated controversy over a spy-satellite program, code-named Zircon, when the Thatcher Government in early 1987 banned the broadcasting of a British Broadcasting Corporation program on the secret project. The documentary, later shown in the United States, said the satellite gathered electronic signals.
''It would give us a national capability'' to determine ''what was going on in an independent way,'' said Frank Cooper, a top civilian official in the British Defense Ministry from 1977 to 1982 who was interviewed in the documentary.
In August 1987, The Times of London said the Zircon project had been scrapped for a more advanced one.
Other nations thought by American experts to be building spy satellites or considering that step include those with serious worries about regional security, like South Africa and India. Dr. Richelson said India saw threats from China and Pakistan, especially in the Pakistani nuclear program, which is believed to be pursuing an atom bomb.
Dr. Peter D. Zimmerman, a reconnaissance expert who works as a private consultant in Washington, said commercial remote-sensing craft were regularly used for space espionage by many nations. He noted that areas covered frequently by SPOT include areas of confrontation like battlefields in the Iran-Iraq war and the Golan Heights, an area claimed by Syria and Israel.
Dr. Zimmerman also said West Germany recently admitted using SPOT to gather intelligence on a disputed chemical warfare plant in Libya. In a report released in February, West Germany's foreign intelligence service said it had relied on SPOT to confirm ''that the new industrial plant near Rabat is most likely the new warfare agents factory.''

HEADLINE: Retraining of New York Auto Workers Urged

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Workers who lack basic skills and companies that cannot keep up with changing times are hurting New York State's efforts to compete in the lucrative auto parts market, a state report released today concluded.
New York needs to spend more money to retrain workers, strengthen links with colleges to promote new technology and develop ways to get completed parts to auto manufacturers more quickly, said the report, which was commissioned by the Department of Economic Development.
''The procurement policies of the big three auto manufacturers are changing rapidly, posing new challenges to component makers across New York state,'' said Joshua Haimson, a doctoral student from Yale University who wrote the report. 
About 50,000 people work in the auto industry in New York State, 15,000 fewer than 10 years ago, said a spokesman for the economic development department, Bern Rotman. Except for the 1,100 workers at the General Motors plant in Tarrytown, all produce auto parts instead of complete automobiles.
Several auto parts companies in New York State have lost big contracts recently because of their relatively inferior quality levels, Mr. Haimson said in the report. Many employees lack basic math and literacy skills, he said.
 
Critical of BOCES Programs
''Many workers are unable to read simple quality-control instructions, write a note describing tool adjustments or derive the percentage of parts to be found defective in a sample,'' he said.
Mr. Haimson recommended that both the state and individual companies spend more money to teach their workers basic skills and train them to deal with new technology. The report criticized many community college and BOCES programs for employing teachers with little manufacturing experience.
Because of tighter production schedules, auto parts makers are being pressured to deliver finished products more often than in the past. It frequently forces them to send the material in trucks that are not full, Mr. Haimson said.
Auto suppliers were urged to combine their resources to build new distribution centers and upgrade communications technology to cope with the market disadvantages caused by faster delivery schedules.
The report also said there is a shortage of engineers and equipment in New York State to deal with one of auto manufacturers' greatest challenges -reducing the noise cars generate. The report advises setting up a Noise Analysis Center.
The report warns that G.M.'s Harrison Radiator Division in Lockport needs to develop an air-conditioning system that does not use chlorofluorocarbons to avoid losing substantial business to Japan. Mr. Rotman said the state is helping the company pay for improvements.
Among other large auto parts manufacturers in the state are G.M.'s products plant in Rochester, its C.P.C. Tonawanda Engine plant and its Fisher Guide Division in Syracuse. There is also Ford's body-part plant in Buffalo.

HEADLINE: NIAGARA MOHAWK AND STATE IN PACT

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS

 BODY:
In an effort to bring about some political and financial stability, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation has signed an agreement with New York State officials to freeze its electric rates, cut the salaries of its top management and suspend dividend payments to holders of common stock.
The troubled utility, New York's second largest, also agreed to an independent comprehensive management audit that will try to pinpoint the cause of Niagara Mohawk's problems. The utility also agreed to pay any additional costs it incurs in cleaning up a radioactive spill that occurred in 1981.
Niagara Mohawk's chairman, William J. Donlon, called the agreement, which was reached Thursday, a ''significant step'' toward turning the utility around. And Lisa Rosenblum, the chairwoman of a task force of state officials that negotiated the settlement, said the deal would also help Niagara Mohawk's 11.4 million customers in northern New York State. Among the cities the utility services are Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. 
 
Plant Still Closed
''It is our belief that it is in the best interests of the rate payer to have a well-run and well-managed utility,'' she said.
Niagara Mohawk is caught in a management and financial crisis arising from its inability to restart its Nine Mile Unit One nuclear power plant nearly two years after the plant was shut for what should have been a routine six- to eight-week closing for maintenance and refueling.
The utility negotiated with state regulators for more than two months to reach a comprehensive settlement. The agreement fell short of that goal because it did not resolve several issues, including a pending request from the utility for a rate increase. In addition, the utility still faces two state regulatory proceedings that will determine if it properly managed the construction and operation of its two nuclear plants, Unit One and Unit 2, in Scriba, N.Y.
As part of the settlement, Niagara Mohawk was allowed to begin passing along to its customers an additional $225,000 a day, its cost for fuel to replace the 600 megawatts of power that had been generated by the 20-year-old Unit One.
 
'Drastic Measures'
Reaction to the agreement and the utility's decision to suspend a dividend payment to the holders of its 136 million outstanding shares was mixed. Some Wall Street analysts said the company had given away too much while receiving few concessions from regulators.
Attorney General Robert Abrams signed the negotiated settlement, but he remained harshly critical of the utility. Saying that management problems ''continue to threaten the company and the economical delivery of power to rate payers,'' he left open the possibility of ''drastic measures, including a formal effort to remove the company's top management.''
In an interview, Mr. Abrams explained that while he did not want to see the company forced into bankruptcy, he remained dissatisfied with management. ''Obviously this company is in a lot of trouble, and it was brought to the brink as a result of poor management decisions and a lack of responsible leadership,'' he said. ''Management must understand that there is an absolute need for reform.''
As part of the agreement, the utility's chairman, Mr. Donlon, agreed to a 10 percent reduction in his $315,000 salary, dropping it to $283,500. The salary of the utility's president, John M. Endries, was also cut by 10 percent, to $193,500, from $215,000. All other management salaries were frozen and Niagara Mohawk agreed to a hiring freeze except in its nuclear division.
 
Skepticism on Wall Street
The utility also agreed to extend a two-year rate freeze for an additional six months, through December 1990. Last month the utility filed for a 13 percent rate increase to go into effect after the rate freeze expires.
The utility also agreed to suspend its dividend on common stock, which had been $1.20 a year per share, paid quarterly. It last paid a 30-cent quarterly dividend on June 30. The utility said it could not speculate when it would restore the dividend, but it agreed not to do so until it restarts the Unit One plant.
Wall Street greeted news of the agreement with skepticism. Even if the plant is restarted as scheduled in mid-November, it could still take the utility another year or more to restore a dividend, said Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Gregory B. Enholm, a utility analyst with Salomon Brothers, said the agreement ''essentially means the difference between continued deterioration in their financial status and stabilization.''
''It will require additional action to improve the condition,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Visitors Stream Back to Yellowstone After the Fires of 1988

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

 BODY:
A full year after the famous fires that devastated large parts of the nation's oldest national park, Yellowstone displays unmistakable signs of recovery, both on its natural and its human sides.
The number of park visitors through July was up more than 9 percent over last year as more than 1.5 million travelers entered the 2.2-million-acre park, curious to see the effects of the flames that burned more than a half-million acres. In July alone, attendance at the park in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana was 702,572, up from 641,752 in July 1988.
''The fires and the recovery process have added a whole new natural dimension to all the usual attractions of Yellowstone,'' said Marcia Karle, a park information officer. ''Instead of seeing just static natural displays, which are wonderful by themselves, people become more involved now in the natural dynamics.'' 
What they see are vast roadside panoramas of blackened trees standing starkly in carpets of lush green as the grass, shrubs and wildflowers, stimulated by the flames and the nitrogen freed in the ashes, blossom abundantly.
''It was the most beautiful spring and summer around here in years,'' said Greg Kroll, a park naturalist. ''We had a tremendous display of wildflowers. And many were just establishing themselves in new areas now open to the sun, so they'll be spreading for the next several years.''
 
Some Barren Slopes
Some of the steeper slopes, where wild fires burn hotter, remain bare. But in many others lodgepole pines, usually the first species to move back into an area because of their love of sun, are already two-inch tall twigs with two dozen needles. In a few more years they will be providing the shade the spruces and Douglas firs need to survive and to continue the cycle.
After decades of fire prevention and six years of scarce moisture, old brush, fallen branches, dead grasses and downed trees had accumulated, 10 tons an acre by some estimates, waiting for lightning and another dry summer.
Vivid films of the natural conflagration with towering flames roaring like jet engines were on the nightly news for weeks summer, prompting serious concern about this year's business in Yellowstone, an important hub for tourism in the northern Rockies. Some well-meaning Easterners even wrote park officials offering to donate trees.
 
Montana Tourism Increases
But the feared business drop did not materialize. Steve Shimek of Travel Montana said that despite the adverse news and rising gasoline prices, Montana experienced a 4 percent increase in visitors this summer, in part, perhaps, because of its centennial celebration. The state earns about $500 million a year from tourism.
Montana and Wyoming played to fire curiosity in their advertising last winter. And the Park Service set up special exhibits, reopened picnic grounds even in severely burned areas and had rangers give ''walks and talks'' through burned and non-burned areas to show nature's cleansing and rejuvenating process at work.
''You get mixed reactions from people,'' said Ms. Karle. ''Everything from, 'Oh, no, my favorite place is burned up,' to 'Gee, I saw all that fire on TV, but this isn't so bad.' '' Park concessions have noticed one development, however: except for campers, park visitors are spending noticeably less money this year.
Park officials are delighted with the crowds because they see the fires as a wonderful opportunity to educate the public about the natural cycle of a forest's life. No one hurts the park by looking at it, they said, The park has not had a major fire this summer. But it has a new fire policy. Whereas some of the early fires last June and July were allowed to burn unattended, as part of the Park Service's natural-management policy, all fires in the park are now being be fought with vigor from the outset. While naturalists, scientists and park officials agree that the fires of last summer were an economic disaster, they also say now that the fires have been an ecological boon by clearing the undergrowth.
 
Tough Winter for Wildlife
After seven straight mild winters, this past year's snows and cold that brought temperatures down to minus 70 degrees with the wind chill, caused a large number of older and weaker animals to perish. But as another part of the same cycle, the fire's stimulation and many spring and summer rains produced lush forage to help the 1989 crop of wildlife gain strength. ''This year the animals look unusually healthy,'' Mr. Kroll said.
With abundant food at higher altitudes, the larger animals seem a little slower to move down for the fall and winter. In the last week, though, around Mammoth at the park's northern entrance, residents heard the powerful bugling of male elk as the autumn courting season officially began.
But now another problem unrelated to fire has emerged: Old Faithful has become less so. In the first 100 years of records for the park, which opened in 1872, the average time between eruptions was 65 minutes. Last March the average was 79 minutes. One reason is believed to be accumulating sediment in subterranean channels. Another: more visitors seem to be sneaking up to the geyser to throw refuse down the hole.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL TERRAIN SEEN AS CHANGING

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Political scientists are coming to agree that there is a durable, changed political landscape characterized by Republican Presidential dominance, Democratic mastery of the House of Representatives and a nearly even split between adherents of the two parties nationally.
But as debates at the 85th annual meeting of the American Political Science Association here show clearly, the political scientists do not agree on whether the change fits their own classic theory of ''realignment'' or whether it will lead to a Republican majority or even a generation of Republican dominance like the Democratic power period that followed the New Deal.
They have almost no common ground when they offer explanations for the changes. The explanations include the decline in union strength in post-industrial America; comparisons of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan that favor Mr. Reagan, and fundamental shifts in national ideology. 
Byron E. Shafer, the Mellon Professor of American Government at Oxford University, said the Republican control of the Presidency was a logical consequence of growing conservatism on foreign affairs and cultural values, and Democratic power in the House was a result of enduring liberal views on social welfare.
 
New Inroads Are Doubted
Mr. Shafer said each party was unlikely to make further real inroads on the other without abandoning commitments on issues the parties take seriously.
Fred Steeper, a Republican poll taker, told a panel that the Democrats' enduring image as the ''party of the little people'' was a barrier to new surges in Republican strength.
Martin P. Wattenberg, associate professor of political science at the University of California at Irvine, presented one of the most skeptical views of the realignment issue. He said the change was real but fundamentally ''hollow'' because while more and more voters call themselves Republicans, fewer and fewer have any real opinions about political parties.
But Professor Wattenberg argued that one major consequence of the shift to weaker loyalties was shown in the vilification that characterized the 1988 Presidential campaign. While past campaigns found it most important to rally loyal partisans, he said, now the presence of huge numbers of swing voters means ''a strategy of personal attacks has more potential payoff.''
 
A Boost for Consultants
An associate professor of political science from the University of Missouri, Thad Brown, said the near-equilibrium between the parties had greatly enhanced the importance of political consultants and their ability to tip results by using trivial campaign tactics.
The increasing Republicanism of young voters was the basic thrust of the presentation that took the prospect of continuing G.O.P. gains most seriously. That paper, based on data from The New York Times/CBS News Polls, was presented by Helmut Norpoth, professor of political science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I., and Michael R. Kagay, director of news surveys at The Times.
They said there is ''a party realignment in slow motion, not the big bang it may have been at earlier historic moments.'' Ideology is not the cause, they said; rather, polls show that the major reason for the change was that for young voters, Jimmy Carter seemed a failure and Ronald Reagan a success.
And, looking at several Times/CBS News Polls in the first quarter of 1989, they reported that while 46 percent of the public identified with Democrats and 44 percent with Republicans, among the 18- to 29-year-olds the Republican Party had a margin of 52 to 38 percent.
Political scientists and Republican strategists have been talking about Republican realignment since Mr. Reagan was elected in 1980, along with a Republican Senate.
Republicans at first hoped to follow that triumph by capturing the House in 1982, or at least to be the first party in the White House since 1934 to avoid losing seats in an off-year election. But in the recession of 1982, they ended up losing 26 seats, and since then, divided control at all levels has been expected by politicians.
For political scientists, partisan realignment has customarily been tied to the idea of a single critical election that leads to a quick shift in party strength at all levels. Divided political control in the 1980's has made many reluctant to define recent changes as realignment.
Everett Carll Ladd, executive director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut, argued that a new political order had been clear for at least 15 years.
 
'Whopping, Largely Irreversible'
In a paper read for him Friday night because he was ill, Mr. Ladd said that whether or not anyone called it a realignment, there had been a ''whopping, highly consequential, largely irreversible change'' in American politics reflecting the post-industrial era and starting with the declining importance of unions to the Democrats.
''Realignment'' was used even by those who were skeptical of major change, like Merrill Shanks of the University of California at Berkeley and Warren E. Miller of Arizona State University. The two professors of political science wrote: ''Nineteen eighty-eight differs from all Presidential elections of the past half century. In 1988, for the first time, there was no appreciable Democratic advantage rooted in an initial plurality of Democratic rather than Republican identifications among those voting for President.''

HEADLINE: Old Dictator Looks Better To Guatemala

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, Aug. 26

 BODY:
When a civilian government took office here in 1986 after three decades of almost uninterrupted military rule, it appeared to close a bloody chapter in Guatemala's history.
But now, one of those associated with some of the worst brutality of that period, Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, is a leader in the race to succeed President Vinicio Cerezo in elections scheduled for November 1990.
The general, who took power in a coup in 1982 and was deposed 16 months later, has not declared his candidacy. But several polls show him leading in the capital and second over all. His political rejuvenation dramatically underscores the growing frustation with civilian government. 
Battered by rising crime and what is seen as spreading anarchy, the jubilation that greeted Mr. Cerezo has given way to skepticism and anger. Many Guatemalans are increasingly questioning the superiority of democracy.
 
Wave of Repression
''There are some countries that need a strong hand,'' said the owner of a men's clothing store in a working-class section of the capital. ''When the general was in charge, at least a working man had a chance. It was calm then. Now it's terrible and getting worse. Now it's hard to survive.'' A friend of the former leader who owns an electronics store offered a similar view. ''The general may have violated human rights, but it was only in an effort to protect the rights of working people,'' the friend said. ''He'll clean up the country.''
Their recollections are in contrast with a 1982 report by the New York-based human-rights organization Americas Watch, which portrayed a wave of repression under the general in which thousands were killed. Bullets were not wasted on women and children, the report said; soldiers choked them, smashed their skulls and hacked them with machetes and bayonets.
The recent resurgence of the general, who is officially retired from the military, coincides with one of the worst economic crises in the region in decades. Most people are living in worse conditions than a decade ago. Infant mortality, unemployment and inflation rates are rising. So is the disparity between the region's rich and poor, which has given rise to leftist insurgencies in three of the region's five countries.
 
Democratic Opening Narrows
''There's a growing perception that elected governments can't solve the problems they were elected to solve,'' a Western diplomat who travels throughout Central America said. ''People now feel the problems. Their lives are affected much more by the depression and the breakdown in law and order than they were by repression or the guerrillas.''
One result is a narrowing in the democratic opening and a move to the extremes in much of the region. But the swing to the extremes has perhaps been most rapid in Guatemala, diplomats say. After a nationwide strike by 50,000 teachers and public employees, emboldened right-wing extremists have mounted a violent campaign of intimidation and assassination aimed at destabilizing the Government, diplomats and Government officials say.
''We will kill you one by one,'' an unsigned letter recently delivered to the Association of University Students said. ''We will begin with your families. We know your movements.'' Mainstream politicians, who have traditionally been spared the brunt of the political violence, have apparently become targets. Danilo Barillas, a leader in the leftist wing of the ruling Christian Democratic Party and a close friend of the President, was killed recently. Several political leaders say they have received death threats. A few, including at least one of Mr. Barillas's associates, have fled into exile, as have several well-known labor leaders.
 
Rumors of Links to Drugs
''These actions are intended to create an atmosphere of terror among the population, an atmosphere of instability to justify the imposition of a strong-arm government in Guatemala,'' Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan said.
The sense of impending chaos, which is apparently helping General Rios Montt, is heightened by a bitter split among the long-dominant Christian Democrats. Alfonso Cabrera, who has a formidable political machine in rural areas, won the Christian Democratic presidential primary in August.
The party's general secretary and the President's closest friend, he is the favorite among the declared candidates to win the election. But Rene de Leon, a party founder and the runner-up in the fiercely contested primary, has asserted fraud and has threatened to bolt the Christian Democrats.
Critics also assert that the 45-year-old Mr. Cabrera, the son of a cobbler, lives more opulently than his $2,000-a-month salary as a Congressman would seem to permit. He has denied persistent rumors linking him to drug trafficking. And he is said to be detested by the army.
 
Nationalistic Appeals
That has opened the door to General Rios Montt. He does not have a party and may be constitutionally prohibited from running; a Constitution adopted after he left office barred a second term as President, but he contends it cannot be applied to him. In any case, his undeclared campaign, which intertwines nationalistic appeals with demands for law and order and morality sermons, has clearly struck a responsive chord.
As for his commitment to democracy, he told the Guatemalan magazine 7 Days, ''A government for the people, by the people is no more than a French idiocy that's never happened.''

HEADLINE: Iranian President Quits as Chief of Armed Forces

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, Sept. 2

 BODY:
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran has resigned as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, saying he is too busy with other matters, the Teheran radio reported today.
The resignation of Hojatolislam Ransanjani, 55 years old, as Iran's military chief indicates that he will focus attention on his policy of revitalizing Iran's economy and the huge task of postwar reconstruction.
Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who took over as the Islamic republic's spiritual leader after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died on June 3, will presumably now take over as Commander in Chief. Ayatollah Khamenei, 50, made it clear soon after he succeeded Ayatollah Khomeini that he intended to control military affairs. 
Hojatolislam Rafsanjani, the most prominent of Iranian leaders considered pragmatic on dealings with the West, resigned in a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei, the state-run radio said in a report monitored in Nicosia. Ayatollah Khamenei accepted the resignation, the radio said. It gave no other details.
Ayatollah Khomeini appointed Hojatolislam Rafsanjani Commander in Chief in June 1988 after Iranian forces were defeated by Iraq in a series of offensives in the Persian Gulf war. The commander's main task was to reorganize Iran's military, badly demoralized by the battlefield setbacks and nearly eight years of war.
The disarray in the fractious military, the shortage of weapons and growing war weariness among Iran's 50 million people after horrendous casualties led him instead to persuade Ayatollah Khomeini to unconditionally accept a 1987 United Nations Security Council cease-fire resolution, which took effect Aug. 20, 1988.
Despite his resignation, President Rafsanjani, with wide support in the 350,000-strong Revolutionary Guards, will retain considerable influence in military affairs.
During his tenure as Commander in Chief - he also served as Parliament Speaker at the time - he merged the command structure of the regular army and the Revolutionary Guards to eliminate parallel and often conflicting chains of command that seriously hampered military operations during the gulf war.
 
Defense Minister Stronger
Akbar Torkan, the Minister of Defense in the President's new Cabinet, will wield more control of military affairs than any of his predecessors because of the merger, which was approved by Parliament in July.
Mr. Torkan, a close Rafsanjani aide, was head of Iran's Defense Industries Organization during much of the war and was a driving force behind building it up to produce surface-to-surface missiles and other weapons to counter an American-led arms embargo. He will now try to expand the defense industry.
The new Interior Minister, Hojatolislam Abdullah Nouri, controls internal- security forces. He was Ayatollah Khomeini's representative at Revolutionary Guard headquarters, still wields considerable influence in the corps and is well placed to counter any challenge to Hojatolislam Rafsanjani from radical rivals.
The new President was elected on July 28 with a landslide vote to succeed Ayatollah Khamenei, who had been President since 1981.
He was given unprecedented executive powers through constitutional changes aimed at eliminating competing power centers. The changes were approved in a national referendum.

HEADLINE: PASTIMES: Stamps

BYLINE: By Barth Healey

 BODY:
History is the discovery of connections. Two postal items sat in a collector's file with other offbeat stuff for a year until research on one lead the researcher to fish out the other and connect them.
The first is an ordinary envelope mailed in Staples, Minn., on Feb. 5, 1934. What catches the eye is a white- on-green label at the left. The text reads: ''BUY U.S.A. and help American workers to secure regular employment at equitable rates. Don't forget those European war debt slackers!'' The credit line reads, ''Prepared by I. J. Courtright, Staples, Minn.'' 
Who were these debt slackers? France, mostly, but also Britain and Italy and the other nations to whom the United States had loaned money to fight World War I. Estimates of the war's cost ran over $200 billion in direct outlays and loss of property. In those far-off days when a billion dollars was real money, the United States had loaned $10.35 billion.
The debtors had counted on getting 132 billion real marks in war reparations from Germany. But there was no way Germany would be able to pay. And this is the connection to the second piece, a postcard mailed Oct. 29, 1923, from Konigstein, Germany, to a company in Spandau discussing delivery problems.
What catches the eye here are the stamps, two copies of Scott 272, paying 4 million marks. Given the rampant inflation in Germany, caused in large part by the sale of gold reserves to finance post-war rebuilding, 4 million marks was not real money.
This was just to mail a postcard, mind you. Later in 1923, as inflation accelerated, Germany issued 18 stamps whose values ranged from 500,000 marks to 50 billion; they have a catalogue value today of $1.98, which is about what they were worth in 1923, too.
Germany's inability to repay its enemies, and the inability, in turn, to repay the United States, led finally to agreements to write off most of the loans: Germany would make five annual repayments in gold, starting at 1 billion marks and rising to 2.5 billion. America's debtors were given similar reprieves; France's debt, for example, was reduced to $1.6 billion from $4 billion, payable over 62 years.
Long before France, Britain, Italy and others repaid even small fractions of their debts, the United States and the rest of the world had slipped into the Great Depression, further delaying repayments. No wonder I. J. Courtright was angry.
 
Issues From the U.N.
On Sept. 22 the United Nations will complete one of the longest series of stamps anywhere, 160 stamps issued over 10 years. Each pictures a flag of a member state, plus one stamp, the last, with the United Nations flag.
Sixteen random stamps have come out each September, starting with Turkey in 1980. The United States flag was in the 1981 series.
The World Federation of United Nations Associations will arrange for first-day covers. These will bear a cachet designed by Andreas Antis Ioannides of Cyprus.
The United Nations issued six stamps on Aug. 23 to mark the 10th anniversary of United Nations offices in Vienna. The first-day covers carry a cachet by the British sculptor Edwina Sandys.
For information on stamps and covers, and limited editions of signed prints of the two cachets, write W.F.U.N.A., DC1-1177, United Nations, N.Y. 10017.
 
. . . And From the U.S.
The pace of new issues is picking up, and those listed can be ordered now from the United States Postal Service. Orders for first-day covers within 30 days of issue will be honored. Dates are tentative.
Collectors wishing first-day cancels may supply their own stamped envelopes or postal stationery, sending the items to the postmasters in the first-day cities. There is no charge for such servicing.
Collectors may also send unstamped envelopes to the postmasters, who will affix stamps and cancel them. A check must be included to cover the cost of the stamps, and the postage on envelopes must cover the first-class rate of 25 cents.
Sitting Bull, in the Great Americans series, 28 cents, which pays the international post- card rate. Sept. 14, Rapid City, S.D. 57701.
Hull House, a 15-cent postal card in the Historic Preservation series. Sept. 18, Chicago, Ill. 60607.
Drafting of the Bill of Rights, in the Constitution series, 25 cents. Sept. 25, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104.
Cityscape - Philadelphia, a 15-cent postal card in the America the Beautiful series, part of a four-card series to mark the World Stamp Expo in Washington in November. Sept. 25, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104.

Arrive Early And Party Hard At Waterbust

DATELINE: PULLMAN, Wash.

 BODY:
The first partygoers started arriving around 7 A.M., and by the time the first band went onstage about noon, the festivities were in full swing. Jeffrey Spane, a junior business major at the University of Washington, said it was ''the biggest party I've ever been to.''
''It'' is Waterbust, an all-day blow-out that for the last decade has been held the Saturday before classes start at Washington State University. 
Since 1979 fun seekers and sun worshipers from the across the Pacific Northwest have trekked to the park 22 miles south of the Pullman campus to attend. Back then, it consisted of just a few fraternity brothers drinking beer. But over the years it has exploded into a festival that has attracted up to 12,000 people.
Like Sean Delaat, a Skagit Valley Community College student from the Seattle area, drove six hours and camped out at Boyer Park the night before. ''I've been hearing about Waterbust for years, but this is the first time I've made it,'' Mr. Delaat said.
Waterbust '89 featured five rock bands, several food stands within concert grounds, and a swimsuit competition involving 15 women from the crowd that nearly caused a riot when spectators grew irritated at the length of time it took to get the contestants on stage. More than 8,000 people attended, according to police estimates.
Phi Delta Theta, the fraternity that had sponsored Waterbust since 1979, decided to withdraw support for this year's celebration. Its leaders cited the increasing cost of insuring the event and pressure from W.S.U. administrators concerned about potential liability as the main reasons.
Two Pullman promoters, one of them a W.S.U. economics student, David Thompson, stepped in to organize the event. ''We wanted to see the tradition go on,'' said Mr. Thompson, who along with Todd Robbins, a Pullman business executive, received permission from Whitman County to rent Boyer Park and charge a $5 admission to Waterbust.
 
Airstrip Parking
Mr. Thompson and Mr. Robbins purchased $1 million in liability insurance for the party and made several changes to accommodate the partygoers. A shuttle bus service from Pullman was provided, and to alleviate the parking problems created in the past, they rented a nearby airstrip to handle overflow parking.
A dozen county law officers as well as about 50 crowd-control personnel were on hand.
Pullman police responded to 84 calls around W.S.U.'s campus during last year's Waterbust weekend. This year Pullman officers cited 25 minors for drinking and 10 people for driving while intoxicated.
The future of an organized Waterbust is also up in the air, though the promoters say they broke even on this year's party.
Typical of the many at the university who want it continued is Paul Krajicek, a sophomore, who said: ''This is a W.S.U. tradition. It's great to see it continue.''

Scholarship Winner in Iowa Finds That Homelessness Is No Barrier

DATELINE: IOWA CITY

 BODY:
Gerald Winterlin does not mind studying 80 hours a week to maintain his nearly perfect grade point average. The University of Iowa senior said he works hard because the three years he spent as a homeless person taught him never to quit.
This fall, Mr. Winterlin is among 82 Iowa college students who will receive the first Roy J. Carver Scholarships, awarded to people who have overcome extreme social or psychological barriers. His $3,000 scholarship will enable Mr. Winterlin, who says he is ''about 40 years old,'' to graduate in May with a degree in accounting. Without the money, he said, his struggle to learn a marketable skill would have been wasted. 
''This year was really a big if, and I didn't know what to do,'' he said.
All of the recipients of the Carver Scholarships have stories somewhat like Mr. Winterlin's. It was the late Mr. Carver's wish to reward perseverance and initiative, said Roger Hughes, the executive administrator of the Carver Trust.
 
'The American Dream'
''There were all sorts of people who were slipping through the cracks of student financial aid,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''We wanted to do something for people who were like Roy Carver. He really picked himself up by his bootstraps and lived the American Dream.''
Scholarship winners attending other schools in Iowa include a widowed mother of six in her early 40's, who is working for a degree in education; an 18-year-old who was anticipating college when his parents lost their farm in the rural crisis of the 1980's, and a 30-year-old who is hearing impaired and severely dyslexic and is studying mechanical engineering.
Mr. Carver wanted to attend medical school, but he grew up in a large family with little money during the Depression. He became an engineer instead, and founded Bandag, a successful tire-retreading company based in Muscatine, Iowa.
Mr. Carver's will provided for a charitable trust, which has a current market value of about $137 million.
 
Up to $6,000
''The Carver Scholarship program is really the first of our active initiatives,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''It probably represents the direction that we'll go in more in the future.'' Scholarship awards range from about $1,200 a year for community colleges to $6,000 a year for private colleges.
Mr. Winterlin blames his former homelessness on age discrimination and the bad farm economy of the 1980's. Employed for 10 years as a laborer at a farm-equipment plant, he lost his job in May, 1982. Nine months later, he lost his home and began sleeping in the back of his station wagon. When that broke down, Mr. Winterlin slept in abandoned homes.
With his hopes of finding a job dwindling, Mr. Winterlin read in a newspaper about a program that provided assistance to dislocated workers. He applied, took skills tests and, with a Federal Pell Grant, began attending junior college. Two years later he enrolled in the University of Iowa's accounting program.
Since then, Mr. Winterlin has received a variety of scholarships. He hopes his 3.996 grade point average will impress prospective employers. And he hopes that other homeless people can find the motivation and support to pull themselves out of adversity.
''There are at least a million Jerry Winterlins running around this country,'' he said. ''We are not bums. None of us are. We can't help what happened to us.''

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY AS ART;
Wide Open Spaces

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In response to Louis Torres's letter, permit me to note that art is not the process, but rather the result of a creative effort. Perhaps the best definition of art is Martin Heidegger's: ''The essence of art, on which both the art work and the artist depend, is the setting-itself-into-work of truth . . . . In the midst of what is, art breaks an open place, in whose openness everything is other than usual.'' 
Art pierces the cloud of perceptional bias, conventional categories, cultural conformities, to show that often what is, is not, and what is not, is - all within a reciprocal relationship. No art exists by or for itself. Art ''exists'' not in its form, but within its meaning, and that each must find for himself.
To claim, as Mr. Torres does, slate'' is to confuse the format with the process. All art comes from within the artist, through connecting traces - a texture woven from the social, historical, cultural, political, economic and religious fibers of being.
No artist selects and shapes every minute detail of the work; each ''creates'' within a structural discipline, whether it be a novel, painting, photograph, Zen rock garden or a single flower arrangement (shibumi).
To consider certain art forms ''primary,'' as Mr. Torres does, is to fall victim to selective emphasis of certain art categories, which ignores the diversity of arts, through which we may find the ''open space, the unconcealedness of what is.''

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Seeking the Roots Of Italy's Lustrous Majolica

BYLINE: By LISA HAMMEL; Lisa Hammel writes frequently on the visual arts for The Times.

 BODY:
So popular is the current exhibition of Italian majolica at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that when this large show closes on Oct. 1 it will be pared down somewhat (from 500 to 400 pieces) and then reopened on Nov. 2, to run well into the winter.
Confronted with an art that bloomed, however briefly, with genius and exuberance, one wonders where it came from. What was the model for this brilliant and highly decorated 16th-century Italian earthenware? What were the references for the patterning, geometric complexities, strong rhythms and daring juxtapositions that appeared on such once-homely items as bowls, plates and pitchers?
''There is a very strong relation between majolica and Islamic pottery,'' said Laurence Kenner, curator of the Metropolitan's Robert Lehman collection, from which all the majolica on exhbition is drawn. ''It seems that the major impetus in Italy for converting from workaday pottery to a higher art was the Islamic pottery.'' 
This work from the Middle East affected virtually every aspect of majolica. The shapes of the Italian ware were taken directly from the repertory of Islamic ceramics, metalwork and glass, Mr. Kenner pointed out, and the rich, faintly shimmering surface of lusterware eventually became a hallmark of majolica.
''Although majolica became completely Italianized,'' Mr. Kenner said, ''it's clear that the point of departure was the energy and vivacity of Islamic pottery.''
Islamic pottery began to flower in the Middle East in the ninth century. On first acquaintance, it presents itself as a gorgeous and confusing complexity of detail. One way to become familar with it is to focus on the coherent presentation in the Metropolitan's Nishapur gallery, which is filled with pottery that reflects the basic aspects of all Islamic ceramics.
Nishapur was a great provincial center in northeastern Iran at the time when Baghdad to the west was the capital of an Islamic empire that ranged from Spain to central Asia. Some scholars believe that this city, along with Samarkand in the nearby region of Transoxiana, made its major contribution to the Islamic arts through its pottery. The ceramics in this gallery are contemporary with Nishapur's palmy days of economic, artistic and intellectual growth.
The pottery of Islam did not become distinctively separate from what had gone before it until the ninth century, said Marilyn Jenkins, a curator of Islamic art at the museum.
At first, the conquering Moslems (Islam dates from A. D. 622) simply continued to make what was already being fabricated in the territories they captured. Then they began adapting, Ms. Jenkins said, changing certain elements to suit needs or tastes and building on a base of such older existing traditions as the Greco-Roman, with its use of geometric motifs, human and animal figures and decorative plant forms. Or they may have drawn on Sasanian (earlier Persian) influences in the flattening and stylization of these forms, Ms. Jenkins said. Or they may very likely have been imitating popular Tang Dynasty wares, which China was briskly exploiting.
When Islamic potters discovered more effective techniques for decorating their work, they were able to become more creative. They took existing design elements, like geometric patterns, and extended and compounded them. They transformed plant and flower forms into the intricate, flowing patterns of the Islamic arabesque. They flattened or stylized or idealized figural representation. And out of their own culture they invented something that had not existed before: calligraphy as the sole decoration on a surface, which they carried to inspired heights.
These four basic design types - geometric, arabesque, calligraphic and figural - contrast strongly with one another but have in common their concentration on surface decoration.
A style of calligraphic design that was peculiar to Nishapur and Samarkand involved bold Kusic script with its strong verticals and its elaborated tips circling the rim of a bowl or plate. Daniel Walker, the curator in charge of Islamic art at the museum, characterized these works as ''extraordinary abstractions,'' which may account for their appeal to the modern eye. Curiously, at the same time that these pieces are stylistically abstract, they are verbally concrete. They convey aphoristic and hopeful messages that reflected the values of the rising middle class of the time.
''Planning before work protects you from regret,'' says the inscription on one of the bowls. ''Knowledge is the most noble of noble qualities, and manly virtue is the most praiseworthy of pedigrees,'' says another.
The geometric designs on some early Nishapur pottery may look a little crude by contemporary standards. But the patterns contain intricacies and bold juxtapositions that clearly fed the High Renaissance Italian imagination and influenced the way we design today.
Another Islamic design, arabesques (a rabeschi, as the Italian majolica potters called the style), almost undoubtedly was developed out of an extension of Greco-Roman plant and flower motifs. Arabesques are patterns based on flowing, rhythmic and often interlaced alternations and oppositions of leaf, stem and blossom. So intriguing is this type of design that it has shown up over time and in many places on everything from ceramics to carpets to architectural detail.
Figural representation is not proscribed by the Koran as many people believe, Ms. Jenkins said. One particular style of figures found only in Nishapur pottery is an mystery. Distinctive depictions of people at various activities from fighting to drinking to sitting are bold and caricaturelike. In the crowded compositions, generally on a bright yellow background, birds and plants surround the figures, often in eccentric arrangements.
These pieces are so strange they are magnetic. Who made them? What do the figures represent? Who or what were they made for? And how did they reflect life and philosophy in the once-thriving, long-gone city of Nishapur, whose artistic inventions still echo in our own contemporary designs?
Auctions of Islamic pottery are held about twice a year at Sotheby's in New York. Most often coming up for sale is Persian (Iranian) pottery of the 9th to 14th centuries, but there is not much work from Syria, Egypt or Iraq.
Richard Keresey, head of the department of antiquities and Islamic art at Sotheby's, said that ''Islamic pottery is often in a highly repaired and restored condition, and people who collect it expect that.''
Prices usually range from about $500 to $3,000, Mr. Keresey said. A sale on June 23 at the auction house offered work of exceptional quality, and prices there ranged from $6,000 to $17,000. The record price for Islamic pottery at auction was $54,000, paid in 1974 for a mina'i Persian work, Mr. Keresey reported. Mina'i refers to a ware with a greatly extended color palette and, generally, finely painted figures.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
New Paths for Regional Theaters

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes frequently about the theater.

 BODY:
America's regional theaters, which established themselves as alternatives to New York's commercial theater a generation ago - and thus transformed the nation's cultural landscape - may once again be at a crossroads. More than 25 years after the not-for-profit regional movement began, the way these theaters - 320 of them across the country - bring drama to their audiences is being altered by their own evolution.
A new generation of artistic directors has begun to replace departing and retiring founders whose vision created these organizations. The boom of commercial success has, in some cases, brought with it the worldly challenges of power and commerce - as well as the chance to transfer to Broadway. For those regional theaters still struggling financially, the Federal and state purse is noticeably thinner, while corporate support is also declining.
The challenge for regional theater in the 1990's and beyond is clear: to maintain the impetus and ability to produce experimental, even avant-garde works - the seedlings of mature theater - as the not-for-profit and commercial branches grow closer and as more artists divide their time between regional theater and film and television. 
For a great many directors the theaters are no longer that refuge from commercial demands where art and craft are primary. Rather, they must walk a tightrope between their desire for artistic independence and the need to run a business-oriented venture where the requirements of individual artists, directors, playwrights and actors may at times be secondary.
What this will mean in the long run for regional theater and such second-generation artistic directors as Anne Bogart of the Trinity Repertory Theater in Providence, R. I., Robert Falls of Chicago's Goodman Theater and Garland Wright at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis is not yet known. There are many within this new generation - including Mr. Falls, Mr. Wright, Des McAnuff of California's La Jolla Playhouse and probably Ms. Bogart, who has just taken over at Trinity Rep - who still aim to present innovative work. But they have many tasks ahead. Major changes for a number of these theaters have come as a result of success and growth. No longer tiny pioneering stages, they are multimillion-dollar institutions with hefty subscriber lists, extensive boards of directors, large administrative staffs and huge budgets. Washington's Arena Stage, for instance, which operated on a few hundred dollars a week two decades ago, now spends around $9 million annually.
For other regional theaters, however, money is a major problem. The nonprofit theatrical alternative that was born of 60's idealism and fueled by Federal and foundation dollars is on a decidedly different financial footing today. Federal funds, which once accounted for 10 percent of the theaters' budgets, is now less than half that. At the same time, support at the state level has also become precarious, with many states having trimmed their budgets significantly. As an example, this year the Massachusetts Council on Arts and Humanities lost 37 percent of its $19.5 million budget.
Cutbacks have struck in the private sector as well, where mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts have broken corporate connections to local arts groups and flattened charitable giving. While private foundations have taken up some of the shortfall - there has been an 86 percent increase in donations from foundations to nonprofit theaters during the last five years - that portfolio-based largesse is seen as an erratic, market-driven phenomenon.
''It is not an encouraging field out there,'' says Mr. McAnuff. ''There are very strong signals being sent that art is not as important [today]. The increase in foundation support is covering up a very real funding crisis in the performing arts.''
Against this altered fiscal landscape artistic directors across the country have responded with a series of belt-tightening moves. Subscription seasons, which routinely included as many as eight full productions, have been scaled back by one or even two shows. Shared productions frequently fill the end-of-season slots. The size and scope of productions have been reduced. The number of resident companies has declined, while the use of individual name actors has increased.
Small two-hander plays, such as '' 'night, Mother'' and the currently popular ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' are standard. Conversely, large-cast musical and comedy revivals - ''Pal Joey,'' ''Animal Crackers'' ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' among others - are increasingly added (at times in critically acclaimed productions) at season's end for long, lucrative summer runs. Meanwhile, riskier new plays get fewer full productions and more workshops or staged readings.
Yet such nipping and tucking does not always work. According to the Theater Communications Group, the New York-based service organization for regional theater, some 30 theaters, or roughly 10 percent of the national total, have closed permanently.
 
Enter the Board Of Directors
 At a great many of the theaters that remain, artistic directors and their boards of directors increasingly construct their seasons with an eye to the bottom line. For some that means putting on more productions with a potential commercial afterlife. Ever since the Arena Stage sent ''The Great White Hope'' to Broadway in 1968, nonprofit theaters have been sending their wares to market, a seductive notion both economically and in terms of prestige.
''Boards and subscribers get very excited when we send something to New York or when Time magazine or The New York Times comes out to cover us,'' says Robert Falls of the Goodman Theater. ''It's tough to guard against that.''
While some transferred productions, such as August Wilson's ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' which began at the Yale Repertory Theater, never returned significant income to the originating theater, other Broadway transfers, such as ''A Chorus Line,'' ''Children of a Lesser God'' and ''Into the Woods,'' can generate hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of dollars for the producer and the originating theater.
Regional theaters have in fact become one of Broadway's most important allies. ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' even Neil Simon's latest, ''Rumors,'' are all past or present Broadway successes that had their start on regional stages. And in a first for a regional theater, the Yale Rep is mounting its own Broadway production of August Wilson's ''Piano Lesson'' next spring.
Other regional theaters are relying on an infusion of commercial money from New York producers - a major shift in backing for regional theater production. Three years ago, San Diego's Old Globe and the La Jolla Playhouse entered an alliance with Rocco Landesman, president of the Jujamcyn Organization, Broadway's third-largest producer, who began paying regional theaters as much as $250,000 to mount plays for possible future Broadway runs.
Both Steven Sondheim's latest musical, ''Into the Woods,'' and Snoo Wilson's Broadway-bound ''80 Days'' were first staged at the Old Globe and La Jolla Playhouse using Mr. Landesman's financing. Other producers began following suit, including the backers of Neil Simon's current Broadway comedy, ''Rumors,'' which had its premiere at the Old Globe last season.
 
The Law of Alliance And Demand
 What do arrangements like these do to the artistic life of regional theaters? There are several theories. One of the biggest supporters of the Landesman relationship is Jack O'Brien, the Old Globe's artistic director, who maintains that such alliances represent what regional theater audiences demand today. ''I'm not saying it's not a tricky arrangement. It is. But we are the producers of this theater, not [Broadway],'' says Mr. O'Brien. ''And our audiences have not said one word in complaint.''
Others criticize commercial ventures - nonprofit in name only - where the individual artists (the directors, playwrights and actors) may be secondary. ''We are the American theater now,'' says Adrian Hall, founder and former artistic director of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I. ''But what we failed to do entirely was impress on anybody that we [the artists] belong at the artistic center. What we are creating now is theater that is a business.''
Indeed, the business side may be rivaling the artistic. ''The regional theaters are now responsible for both the nonprofit theater and indirectly the health of the commercial theater,'' says Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance in Washington. ''That's a big shift, and the next generation of artistic directors simply does not have the freedom to deal with the same issues and purposes as the founders. Two of the biggest changes? This need for a national reputation as a means of survival and the growing influence of the theaters' boards of directors.''
Few behind-the-scenes changes have been as significant as the growth in power and size of the theaters' boards of directors and, in some instances, the role of the managing director. Originally established to fulfill the legal requirements of a nonprofit entity, boards have become increasingly instrumental to the theaters, both as fund-raisers and as official links to the community. If such a role does not necessarily make for an adversarial relationship - and several artistic directors publicly insist that it does not - many privately maintain that boards now exert significant control over their financial and artistic decisions.
 
Broadway-Bound Versus Avant-Garde
 ''My board wanted this theater to be in Time magazine,'' says Martin Platt, who resigned earlier this year after 15 years as artistic director of the Alabama Shakespeare Company. ''The only way I could guarantee that was to change my programming,'' which meant, he said, increasing the amount of commercial Broadway-bound work. Neither board members nor directors dispute the fact that the theaters' futures have by default become the province of the boards.
''Not a lot of us have dealt with the question of our own succession,'' says Lloyd Richards, artistic director of the Yale Rep and dean of the Yale University School of Drama. ''And we are finding it difficult to develop the next generation of artistic leadership. Originally the boards were brought in by the artistic director to help out. It's a different situation now. The boards consider themselves quite knowledgeable.''
Many of the nation's larger regional theaters have experienced relatively smooth transitions of artistic directors - for example, Minneapolis's Guthrie, Chicago's Goodman, San Diego's Old Globe and Providence's Trinity Rep. Other changes have led to battles between board and director, most notably the dismissal earlier this year of Mr. Hall as artistic director of the Dallas Theater Center. The reason given was differences with the board.
''Sit on your board,'' says Mr. Platt flatly. ''At least they can't make decisions about the theater behind your back.''
Today the artistic directors of about half of the nation's regional theaters are voting members of their boards. Some new appointees even make board membership a condition of their employment. Others, such as David Emmes and Martin Benson, founding directors of the South Coast Repertory company in Costa Mesa, Calif., permit no board member other than themselves to serve more than three consecutive years. ''It avoids any sense of proprietariness on their part,'' says Mr. Emmes.
 
Are the Challenges Too Much for Art?
 Will the financial and administrative challenges of regional theater prove insurmountable for the next generation of artistic leaders? Reactions among past and present artistic directors vary considerably.
''It is virtually impossible to be an artistic director in this country any more,'' says Peter Sellars, the former artistic director of the American National Theater and currently a freelance opera director as well as the head of the Los Angeles Festival, a biannual arts event. ''I was one of those people being groomed. But the landscape has changed too much and the financial stakes are too high.''
For others, such as Ms. Bogart, whose first season at Trinity Rep opens this fall, the challenges are just beginning. ''The older artistic directors [established their theaters] despite everything else. We have to continue them in concert with everything else,'' says Ms. Bogart, who is mounting an artistically rigorous inaugural season that will include productions of Maxim Gorky's ''Summerfolk,'' Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal'' and a Japanese Kabuki, ''Benten Kozo.'' ''I am totally fascinated with doing something as chaotic as theater in an institution and keeping them both going,'' she says.
Other of today's younger artistic directors are less sanguine. As one put it, ''You create a theater that is known for doing a particular kind of work, and when you reach the point that you want to change the formula of one Shakespeare, one Chekhov, one new drama and so on, you can't simply pick up the institution and shake it. We've become too responsible.''
For many second-generation artistic directors, acquiring a regional theater has meant tempering their individual artistic impulses. ''You start asking yourself when planning a season, 'Well, what worked last year?' '' says Mark Lamos, artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company. ''You have to fight against that.''
''I am finding a big transition in my own work,'' says Garland Wright of the Guthrie. Does that mean producing safer, less demanding work? ''That would be a possible take on it,'' Mr. Wright concedes, but, he adds, ''if one assumes that doing art and running an institution are antithetical, then you took the wrong job. Artists do tend to shrink in the face of institutions, but that doesn't have to be the rule.''
 
Introducing The Artist-Showman
 Robert Falls headed the small Wisdom Bridge Theater in Chicago before assuming the reins of the Goodman four years ago. ''Sure, it was easier to be an auteur director at a smaller theater,'' he says. ''And it has been hard - but not that hard. You have to sort of be a showman and an artist at the same time, but there's nothing wrong with that.''
Most artistic directors today admit they walk a tightrope between business and art, both on stage and behind the scenes. At the Hartford Stage, for instance, Mr. Lamos has earned a national reputation as a producer of innovative classical drama. At the Goodman, Mr. Falls has defused the administrative demands by creating an unusual triumvirate involving himself and two associate directors. Other directors have made fellow artists their cause celebre. Under Mr. Wright's tenure at the Guthrie, several hundred thousand dollars of the theater's $8 million annual budget were transferred from the administrative to the artistic side.
In California, the South Coast Repertory Company quietly awards playwrights' grants as aggressively as any theater in the country, annually commissioning half a dozen dramatists from the theater's $5 million annual budget. Despite such moves, artists' salaries in regional theaters nationally still average 25 percent of their annual budgets and the trend among theater artists and even administrators to leave regional theater for better-paying posts seems to be increasing.
Adrian Hall echoes a view held by some of the regional movement's founding directors. ''I wish we were leaving the landscape more stable and with more of our stamp on it,'' he says. ''I wish we had planted the artistic seed deeper.''
But others are optimistic. ''Being nonprofit doesn't describe us; our work describes us. We are still a part of commerce,'' says Zelda Fichandler, founder and producing director of Washington's Arena Stage. ''We made the revolution. We've pulled the wagon up the hill; our long 'Mother Courage' journey is over. The next generation will be about evolution. The theater is a living organism that must change. That is both encouraging and sad.''
 
WHERE THE MONEY IS
 For many of those working in regional theater, the last 25 years have meant real improvement in income for only one artist - the artistic director. Today at the nation's largest regional nonprofit theaters (those with annual budgets of $3 million and higher), artistic directors earn a median salary of $75,000 a year, with some commanding as much as $150,000, according to the Theater Communication Group, the service organization for nonprofit professional theater in this country.
Managing directors come in a close second, with a median salary of $65,000. Meanwhile, the average income of a freelance theater director is less than half that, according to the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, a discrepancy that angers many who are on the short end.
''There is something wrong when the annual salary paid to an artistic director is larger than the combined salaries of all the freelance directors [who work for the same theater],'' says Jeff Sweet, a playwright who is produced in nonprofit theaters and who estimates that, like many dramatists, he must earn 80 percent of his income from film and television work.
Another wrinkle in the nonprofit-versus-commercial question involves who owns the royalties when a play is transferred from a regional theater. Recently a divorce suit indirectly involved the royalties accruing to Daniel Sullivan, the director of the Broadway production of Wendy Wasserstein's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, ''The Heidi Chronicles.'' The production had originated at Mr. Sullivan's Seattle Repertory Theater, and the court ruled that the royalties - nearly $300,000 - belonged not to Mr. Sullivan but to the theater.
The decision is causing widespread concern among theater directors. Mr. Sullivan, it should be noted, voluntarily turns over his royalties to his theater and is called a ''moral hero'' by Robert Brustein, artistic director of the American Repertory Theater. But most artistic directors privately disagree with the ruling, insisting that it remains far from clear and is, in the words of the director Peter Sellars, ''a really ugly decision when a theater can say, 'You don't own your work; we do.' ''

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN BOWLING;
A Search for New Players as Leagues Shrink

BYLINE: By Jennifer Stoffel; Jennifer Stoffel is a writer based in Cleveland.

 BODY:
TODAY'S state-of-the-art bowling centers are trying to shake the image of smoke-filled haunts where pot-bellied characters like Ralph Cramden in ''The Honeymooners'' meet to drink some beer and bowl a few frames.
After all, when bowling season officially gets under way this week, the industry will face a nagging problem. Bowling is still the largest indoor participation sport in America, with 68 million people visiting the lanes at least once in 1987. And at an average cost of $1.60 a game, it is among the cheapest. But the game is losing players from its core. The increase in two-income and single-parent families has caused league play to wane. Since 1980, the pool of league bowlers has shrunk by 25 percent, to 7.2 million players in 1987, according to the American Bowling Congress, an association of men's bowling leagues. 
The $4.5 billion-a-year industry has sought Olympic status for bowling to legitimize it as a sport. Bowling was first an exhibition sport at last year's summer games in Seoul, South Korea. And the industry is pressing for medal status in 1992.
To appeal to the ubiquitous baby boomers and their children, the industry has resorted to promotional gimmicks, high-tech gadgetry and glitz. Shoes resembling jogging sneakers are replacing the traditional two-toned leather lace-ups. Last year, the Brunswick Corporation, the biggest name in bowling, introduced a line of lighter-weight balls for children in bright colors like yellow, pink and orange rather than drab black. And to attract the young set, the Young American Bowling Alliance, an association of youth leagues, started a national Pee-Wee league in 1987, which now includes more than 13,000 children, ages 3 to 7.
The alleys are becoming trendier, too. At least 2,000 of the nation's 7,800 bowling centers have received face lifts of some sort since 1985, according to the Bowling Proprietors Association of America, a trade group. Many now feature computerized scoring systems that enable newcomers to bowl without knowing the strange method for adding strikes to spares. New and bigger alleys are replacing smaller old ones. The 200 centers built in the last two years typically have 35 lanes or more rather than the usual 15 to 20. The new glitter has enabled centers to raise their prices and draw bigger crowds. Last year, the nation's alleys pulled in an average $23,000 per lane, not counting revenues from food, up from $17,000 in 1980. That has enabled the industry to keep pace with inflation. And centers ought to do even better if the pace of expansion continues.

HEADLINE: How Prodigies Perceive Business

BYLINE: By SANDRA SALMANS; Sandra Salmans is a writer based in Washington.

 BODY:
Thanks to the likes of Steven P. Jobs, the founder of Apple Computer Inc., and William Gates of the Microsoft Corporation, young computer prodigies are now considered potent drivers of the economy.
What will the next generation of whiz kids contribute? Will they start the next Silicon Valley - or lead the exodus from it?
The New York Times recently interviewed three members of that generation. All were teaching at the Center for the Advancement of Academically Talented Youth, known as C.T.Y., a program run by the Johns Hopkins University that, beginning in the seventh grade, seeks to identify and nurture some of the nation's brightest youths. It offers classes in math, computer science and literature at four college campuses in the United States and one in Geneva. 
Michael Wessler, 19, from Potomac, Md., is a sophomore majoring in cognitive science at Harvard University. Justin Boyan, also 19, from Columbia, Md., is a junior at the University of Chicago, where he is taking postgraduate courses in mathematics. Both Mr. Wessler and Mr. Boyan were students in the program. Francesmary Modugno, 23, from New York City, graduated from Cornell University and is working toward a Ph.D. in computer science at Carnegie-Mellon University.
All three have had close encounters of various kinds with business and have some fresh, even irreverent, thoughts for American industry. Mr. Boyan wrote a software program that PC Magazine called ''the most elegant and ingenious communications package you can buy.'' Ms. Modugno has worked in research for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation during her summer breaks. Mr. Wessler has made and sold videotapes of events like bar mitzvahs.
Sandra Salmans interviewed Mr. Wessler and Ms. Modugno at the center's program at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. Mr. Boyan, who is teaching at C.T.Y's Geneva program, participated by speaker phone.
Question: How did each of you get into business?
Mr. Boyan: My interest started when I was pretty young. There were computers in my middle school. I taught myself a fair amount through books, and then I took computer science at C.T.Y. When I was about 13 and teaching myself to program computers, I wrote a cute little investment program for my father. You could plug in all the stocks and bonds you held and it would calculate all sorts of things. When I got a modem for my computer, I didn't like any of the other communications modem programs out there, so I wrote my own. That was during my sophomore year in high school. I shared it with some people and they said, 'You should try to market it,' and I did.
Mr. Wessler: We had a video camera, and just for a favor, I videotaped an event for relatives. They recommended me to someone else, and that sort of snowballed.
Q. Who or what has influenced you? Is Steve Jobs your hero?
Mr. Wessler: I have a MacIntosh, but that's as close as I get to Steve Jobs.
I had wonderful schooling - some teachers who were absolutely wonderful. In my elementary school, there was a news production program; we had cameras, and every week we'd make a news show. That was probably where I first got interested in film and video. Later, creativity was brought out in an English class I took in high school.
My parents really helped me. When you're only 14, it's intimidating to take the first step. My uncle has been a great influence in showing me you can do 17 things at one time. He's a lawyer by profession, and he paints, and he has a screenplay he's trying to get produced. He's been able to do it, so why can't I?
Ms. Modugno: I went to an all-girls Catholic high school. It limited the amount of free thinking you were allowed to do. On the other hand, Cornell was a very positive influence. My adviser and another professor encouraged me to explore whatever I wanted; I still keep in touch with them. They're the people whose opinions I respect the most. In computer science it's hard to find women role models. I've also had advisers at Bell and Digital who are my mentors.
Mr. Boyan: My biggest heroes would have to be my parents. Dad's a professor, mom teaches elementary school. They encouraged me, gave me opportunities without pressure. When I got deeply involved in perfecting a computer program and marketing it, they encouraged me. Of course they didn't really have any idea of what I was doing, or believe that I'd be paying for college with it.
Q. What are your career plans?
Mr. Wessler: I hope that I can somehow combine film making and computer science - or just keep them separate and do both. I'm pretty sure I'll always be doing films on the side, maybe computer animation.
Ms. Modugno: I'd like to go to a university that stresses teaching and research equally. I enjoy teaching. Since I've had these ties with industry, I could go into research in industry - because all the companies I've worked for encourage their researchers to teach and to take on summer interns. One of my little pipe dreams is to be administrator of an alternative education program, stressing learning through very different means than in traditional classrooms.
Mr. Boyan: I'm planning to get a Ph.D., probably in math, and become a professor. I see my dad; he's a political science professor. My understanding is, there's a certain amount of freedom in academia to work on the things you're interested in that I'm not sure you can get very easily in the business world.
Q. Even with your own company?
Mr. Boyan: When I was writing the program, it was almost an academic interest; I was doing it for fun. Since I started marketing it, I've spent at least half my time on the project answering mail, giving people support on the program, doing marketing and selling and advertising - that whole side of running your own business. That's fun, but I don't think it would be as interesting a way to spend my time.
Q. Obviously, academia isn't going to be as lucrative as business. Do you want to make lots of money?
Mr. Boyan: I guess the very good professors make plenty. My goals don't really include making huge sums of money at the moment.
Mr. Wessler: No. I want to have fun at what I'm doing. There are probably other summer jobs I could take that pay more than C.T.Y., but I enjoy teaching. I'm thinking about becoming a teacher.
Sitting and programming all day is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. But I think I'd rather be tinkering with something than directing people who tinker for me.
Ms. Modugno Everybody says computer scientists make a lot of money, but those are the hackers who work for these start-up companies and spend 60 to 70 hours a week hacking, which is not what I do at all. It would be very boring. It's very Yuppie-ish, very affluent and very ostentatious.
The bigger companies obviously are out to make money, too. But they're doing so in a way that is allowing science to be developed by the scientists. The companies let their researchers go off and do things and hope something beneficial happens, as opposed to saying, 'Sit here and write this program that does exactly this because we're going to capitalize on it and on your skills.'
Q. Over all, what do you think of American business?
Mr. Wessler: The first thing I think of is Japan and how America is just sort of a service organization. Japan makes the products and Americans form the companies that you send the products to. I'd like to see Americans actually building the stuff. I've seen too many examples of how an American comes up with an idea and offers it to American companies, and they'll say, 'That's interesting, but we can't really fit this in right now.' And so the person goes over to a Japanese company, which says, 'Oh, yeah, neat,' and works with it.
My dad is in telecommunications, and he needed a special kind of copier for an idea he had. He went to Canon, a Japanese company, which now makes the product with him.
Ms. Modugno: Whenever I go out to buy a product, I specifically buy a Japanese product, like a Japanese car. And if I had my own product to market, I would probably go to a Japanese company first. The Japanese are very successful at marketing their products because of the way their society is structured and their emphasis on discipline and organization, but I don't think you'll ever see any great products come out of Japan that were actually invented there. I don't think their environment fosters creativity. The United States allows this creative thought and allows the development of all these different products. Unfortunately, we don't have our society structured now to market them.
Q. What should be done to encourage American business?
Mr. Boyan: At times I wish I'd had a little more help on my project, especially with respect to the business end of it. There isn't one source you can continually go to for in-depth advice. There's no handy reference manual around, or a place to go for general questions about copyrights, accounting, incorporation, taxes, help with the programming side of it, how to make the program itself better, how to market it to larger companies. Of all the copies I sold - almost 2,000 - hardly any have been sales of multiple copies to large companies. I know it's the kind of program that large companies could use in large numbers, but I don't have a clue on how to introduce it to them. They could copy it without paying for it at all and I wouldn't have any clue as to what my rights would be.
Q. That raises the issue of ethics in business. How do you feel about insider trading?
Mr. Wessler: I wouldn't do it, but I'm not shocked by it. You become numb to this kind of thing after a while. It's almost like everybody's doing it. To me, shoplifting is infinitely worse, although insider trading hurts a lot more. It's just that shoplifting comes home to me more because with insider trading, you're dealing with these huge numbers.
Ms. Modugno: My view is that all that illegal activity comes with the job, and the point of your job is to be good enough not to get caught.
Q. How would you rank an insider trader with, say, Robert Morris Jr., who wrote a computer virus that invaded a Pentagon computer network.
Ms. Modugno: I don't put them on the same level. Insider traders are worse. For now, nobody has written a virus that has caused as much harm. That's not to say that tomorrow somebody won't. The people who create viruses that harm disks just want to exert control over other people, they are not inherently evil.
Mr. Wessler: To me, a guy who writes a virus is like a John Hinckley Jr. Morris's virus wasn't meant to do what it did, so in his case I see less of a threat. Somebody who writes a virus that copies itself onto other disks and then erases files is like a crazy assassin, a guy who's going out and, for the hell of it, killing people, except instead he's erasing disks.
Q. Finally, are there any new products - not necessarily high-tech - that you like?
Mr. Wessler: The Koosh.
Ms. Modugno: Oh, yeah, those are the neatest little things. I'm sure the inventor is making a lot of money because all they are is pompoms made out of rubber bands.

Confessions of a 'Fed Watcher'

BYLINE: By FRANCIS H. SCHOTT; Francis H. Schott is senior vice president and chief economist of the Equitable Financial Companies and a former officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

 BODY:
THE world of private financial institutions is permeated by people who got their professional start at the Federal Reserve - the Board of Governors in Washington or one of the 12 District Federal Reserve Banks. Occasionally, these high-class technicians become top executives or entrepreneurs, but more typically they continue as professionals - chief economists and senior advisers to top management, or key participants in day-to-day securities trading and asset/liability management. Collectively these people are inelegantly dubbed ''Fed watchers'' - a term that somewhat denigrates their frequently active role within private companies but does describe accurately an important part of their input to decision-making.
Actually, the basic qualification of these professionals is twofold. First, they are, for the financial community, the best available ''bridge'' between occasionally esoteric academic economics and the practical world of finance. Second, the analytical skills learned in graduate school are deliberately developed at the Fed. 
But with these reasonable and expectable qualifications comes the frequent and incorrect assumption that Fed watchers can actually divine Federal Reserve moves ahead of the event, permitting market participants a measure of one-upmanship in their operations. No such luck.
In the first place, central banking remains an art only leavened by science. Despite the importunings of monetarists, the Fed, and the country, is not ready to turn monetary policy into the execution of a few mathematical formulas. This is true even if the formulas pretend to plot the relationship between the money supply and economic activity. These formulas simply are not complete enough, which is why Federal Reserve policy is based on the composite appraisal of hundreds of factors, carefully compiled and dissected by a small army of analysts.
Furthermore, the relative weight given to those factors varies over time and especially with the composition of the Fed's decision-making entities - the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee. Thus, outsiders may come close to naming most of the crucial inputs to Federal Reserve decisions, but the weighing of these factors would require a duplication of the judgment supplied by top Fed officials - an impossibility.
Finally, there is the well-known fact that the Fed is ''independent'' within the Government. The subtle interplay that must and does exist between the Fed on one hand and the Administration and Congress on the other requires the Fed watcher's attention but leaves him guessing, much like the press or the general corporate community, especially when important players change.
Thus, Fed watching is also an art, not just a science. Yet, this art is valued highly and like other artists, Fed watchers are paid well. Why then are we employed? Our answer is that the Fed is the only institution directly responsible for price stability. Inflation has to be escalating rapidly to become a direct concern of politicians and the electorate. Avoidance of such a situation is the Fed's job. Anyone thoroughly familiar with inflationary indicators can penetrate the Federal Reserve's veil somewhat, albeit with effort and then only imperfectly.
Difficulties still abound. Say that inflation is high and still getting worse, but business activity is already weakening under the impact of previous Federal Reserve restraint. Such was the picture in late spring, and it presented a dilemma. The Fed had the choice only of evils. It could back off, hoping to avert a recession by a timely easing of interest rates, but risk a further worsening of inflation. Alternatively, restraint could continue so as to make sure inflation was beaten back, but the Fed would be taking a chance of creating a recession. This dilemma resulted in a very close call in May and early June, on which opinion varied widely within the Fed. Naturally, internal split opinions are likely to be echoed among the Fed watchers. Furthermore, the outsider cannot just try to count the inside votes as political observers do. Because of a premium on collegiality within the Fed, a great deal of compromising typically occurs until the last moment before a vote. This induces humility in the Fed watcher.
NOW, in early September, we know the outcome of the spring dilemma: the Fed began in early June to backpedal from the progressive squeeze of the preceding 15 months. However, because of the continuing inflation danger, the move toward monetary ease will be slower and more gradual than most money and bond market operators seem to assume. Therefore, I would bet on at least a temporary bond market weakness this fall.
The ever increasing importance of international factors puts a premium on Fed experience. We know that the Middle West's industrial Rust Belt of the early 1980's, associated with an appreciating dollar, caused disruptions serious enough to make a lower dollar a priority of Fed policy by the mid-80's. Thus, a degree of international alignment of monetary policy can be put into your calculation of likely Federal Reserve moves. Leading central banks sought to resist the strengthening of the dollar that occurred in the spring of 1989. Thus, it was predictable that joint intervention - official dollar-setting - would occur and that foreign central banks would seek to reduce the interest differential in favor of the United States by raising their rates. The recent ''early easing'' by the Fed also becomes more understandable in the light of international considerations.
Next, even the political factor can be rationally evaluated, although not calculated by basis points of interest-rate moves. For example, in a two-way interaction, the Fed can exert pressure on the other Washington players toward improved fiscal performance even while taking a flogging from politicians - Fed watchers can tell when this is happening.
Finally, the Fed needs friendly interpreters, as does any institution subject to change by democracy's rules. Departure from the temple for most Fed watchers is not associated with apostasy. Steady economic growth with price stability remains their public policy concern, even mission. Thus, Fed watchers may serve a good purpose even when attempting to outguess the oracle.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: CHALLENGING THE BULLET TRAIN;
High-Speed Rail Can't Pay for Itself

BYLINE: By ERIC W. BESHERS; Eric W. Beshers is a consultant and writer. He was deputy director of the office of economics of the Department of Transportation.

 BODY:
ANYONE who is a transportation expert has heard, time and again, from people who have ridden on the fast Japanese Shinkansen or the faster French Train a Grande Vitesse, called the T.G.V. ''Why can't we have that in America?'' they ask. My answer is: Because it's an outrageous boondoggle. With one possible exception, no high-speed rail system in this country could pay for itself, and the claimed external benefits - cleaner air, energy saved, eased pressure on airports - are nonexistent.''
The top speed from Paris to Lyons on the T.G.V. is 170 miles per hour; on the Tokyo-Osaka-Hakata corridor it is 131 m.p.h. It is very costly to achieve these speeds. The line must be electrified, and the track must be almost straight and almost flat. Other than the New York-Washington line, on which electric Metroliners now run at 120 to 125 m.p.h. top, there is no track - at least no track serving a populous corridor - that meets the curve and grade standards for high-speed rail. With that exception, new, electrified right of way is an absolute prerequisite for high-speed rail. 
In a recent article in ''Technology Review,'' Louis Thompson, formerly in charge of rail passenger service at the Department of Transportation, observed that any investment estimate of less than $10 million to $20 million per mile for a new high-speed rail system is not credible. Jane Holt, a tranportation analyst, has concluded that a high-speed rail system in the United States would need 25 million riders a year to pay a 10 percent return on capital invested.
So far, there are only two-high speed rail systems in the world with enough revenue to cover operating and capital cost: the Tokyo-Osaka-Hakata Shinkansen and the Paris-Lyons T.G.V. Annual ridership on Tokyo-Hakata is around 150 million. For Paris-Lyons it is about 17 million a year. The most heavily traveled inter-city corridor in America is New York-Washington, with a combined total of airline and Metroliner passengers of only 4.3 million a year.
Cleaner air and energy savings are the external benefits most often cited for subsidizing high-speed rail. Let us look at them. First, electric trains, unless they draw from nuclear or hydroelectric power plants, burn fossil fuels. They burn less of it per seat-mile than cars or airplanes do, but the question is whether high-speed rail results in enough fewer cars or airplanes moving around to make a difference. Even heavy patronage of a high-speed rail system can increase fossil fuel use, if its effect is increased total travel without reducing car or air travel. Further, any effect would be very small, because the proportion of total travel that could take place on trains is tiny. In 1984, cars accounted for 91 percent of travel, planes for 8 percent and trains (including commuting) for just 0.2 percent.
Two other points that are often mentioned as pluses for high-speed rail are airport congestion and inner-city revival. The latter stems from the notion that a new train station downtown with lots of travelers coming and going will do a lot for a run-down neighborhood. Perhaps it will, but there are a lot of true stories of downtown comebacks in this country that happened without a few billion dollars being thrown at a public works project out in the countryside.
Realistically, the only airports that could be affected by high-speed rail are La Guardia in New York and Washington National. Since travel between these two cannot account for a very large percentage of total operations at either airport, the impact of high-speed rail might not be very great even if you eliminated all La Guardia-National flights. Further, as long as small planes with a few people on board are using airspace that could be used by big planes with a lot of people on board, and that is the case today, those airports are not being used to maximum efficiency. If they were being so used, and if the demand for landing rights drove short-haul air fares higher, then there might be a market for high-speed rail on the New York-Washington line.
USING Ms. Holt's method of analysis on the New York-Washington corridor provides for interesting results. If the one-way train fare were $150 - 50 percent higher than the cost of Pan Am's air shuttle - high-speed rail is feasible with a yearly ridership of 5.8 million people. But 5.8 million people is a one-third increase over the current number of both Metroliner riders and air travelers. So if almost all New York-Washington air travelers switched to high-speed rail and there were growth in the market, this level of ridership might be attained. And if those conditions were met, maybe the economics would work. If people have a high-speed rail project somewhere else in the country and they think they can recover its costs and offer a decent return on capital, let them raise the money for it. But if they say a little help from government is needed, beware. Someone is reaching for your wallet.

'America Is Still a Primative'

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. BLANCHETTE; Robert W. Blanchette is counsel to Verner, Clipfort, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, a law firm in Washington. He served as Federal Railroad Administrator and is chairman emeritus of the International High Speed Rail Association.

 BODY:
SECRETARY of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner recently launched an ambitious program to develop a well-articulated national transportation policy. His effort will be appraised in no small measure by his ability to find the right role for high-speed rail in some of the nation's saturated corridors.
For many of our industrialized trading partners this exciting technology is already an essential element of their transportation infrastructure. For example, the high-speed French Train a Grande Vitesse, call the T.G.V., has operated regularly in the Paris-Lyon corridor at 168 miles per hour since 1981. The T.G.V. passed its 100 million passenger mark this spring, and it makes money. This fall, a second-generation T.G.V. will be inaugurated to the Atlantic coast of France, with cruising speeds in excess of 185 m.p.h. 
By the early part of the next decade, T.G.V. electrified service will link the continent to Britain, and a strong European high-speed rail network will be in place. With improvements in technology, cruising speeds well over 200 m.p.h. will be attainable.
By contrast, the United States is a comparative primitive. Our closest contender is Amtrak's New York-Washington Metroliner service, operating at speeds up to 125 m.p.h. Excellent service by our standards, but not at the cutting edge.
Can the United States have a ''Starlight Express'' in the real world, or are we confined to Broadway musicals?
The answer, so far, must be put in the conditional tense. The technology exists, and the need exists. The uncertainty lies in the area of political will.
Any analysis must begin with a heavy dose of realism. High-speed rail (150 m.p.h.) is not functional over short distances. It is not a commuter-oriented mass-transit system. Nor does high-speed rail belong on very long routes, Chicago and Los Angeles, for instance. In any rational transportation system, the long-distance market goes to jet aircraft.
On the other hand, high-speed rail is just the thing for certain corridors between 250 and 400 miles where environmental and economic factors militate against the more conventional options.
Medium-distance candidate corridors are characterized by heavy travel densities and the present or easily foreseeable saturation of the existing infrastructure. In some cases, the creation of a high-speed rail spine in the corridor also becomes an invaluable instrument of growth management.
An excellent example of the first characteristic is the New York-Washington corridor. No rational projection for the future can include another turnpike, or more runways. Simulations already show that elapsed times of just over two hours for the route are attainable with only modest improvements to Amtrak's right of way. Even with relatively conventional technology, Amtrak has shown that people want and need this service. We should aim at state-of-the-art technology for this route.
THE Miami-Orlando-Tampa corridor shows how high-speed rail fits the bill for growth management as well as transportation needs. Explosive growth is on a collision course with an already overburdened infrastructure. Because Florida's environment is so perilously fragile, clean and energy-efficient high-speed rail along existing rights of way is the answer. Further, by clustering development along the corridor, high-speed service can curtail the helter-skelter urban sprawl that so threatens that state.
Tempering this promise is the fact that political will is as important as demonstrable need. Even though they are cost effective, high-speed rail systems are vast projects and can come into being only as the result of a strong commitment by public authorities.
That commitment may take a variety of forms. For example, the French national railroad, floated bonds in the private sector to build the Paris-Lyon line. Those bonds will be paid off ahead of schedule, but the bond issue probably would have failed had the French Government not guaranteed it.
In the same fashion, private capital can be attracted to high-speed rail projects. But private investment alone will not create these systems any more than private investment alone created our highway and airway networks. Investors must view the body politic as a friend of high-speed rail, and not as a competitor.
We Americans are not going to abandon our automobiles or board up the windows of our control towers. No country where high-speed rail exists has. But, like them, we should look at all the options and invest in new technologies wherever they offer the highest return. For that reason, high-speed rail should not be dismissed.

HEADLINE: A Week On the Beat Of the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE dealing room at Chase Manhattan Bank is open and noisy. As I began my first day as a trader, I quickly discovered that when the dollar is moving rapidly, the rhythm in the room echoes the movement in the market. But it took precious time to learn the beat.
The dominant sound was of prices - 70-80, 40-50 - coming from dealers and brokers through the squawk boxes. They only call out the bid, which is the price to buy dollars, and the offer, which is the price to sell. The brokers drop the 138 or 1.93 that would precede the yen or the mark price. Paid, paid, paid, is heard when the dollar is bought and rising; given, given, given when the dollar is sold and falling.
For one week, I experienced firsthand the anxiety and exhilaration of working as a trader in the $400 billion, 24-hour foreign exchange market. I made money, buying on dips after the Federal Reserve intervened to sell dollars. I took my share of losses when I misread the market. And I experienced the agony of an ''overnight'' when I went home with $10 million on the line while trading continued thousands of miles away. Being a trader is easier than it seems, but harder than it looks. 
As the currency markets have expanded, and corporations have become global, trading has become a split-second game where a day's profit or loss - often reaching $500,000 - can be made in minutes. The traders, generally young, often have a horizon of several hours, sometimes several minutes or less. They sometimes act on little or no information and read only headlines. Brash when they are right, these young traders gleefully face down central banks and policy makers in the United States and its chief industrial allies.
The traders I worked with are not the big names, but are those who toil in the trenches. For them, an annual salary and bonus can reach $200,000. Skill is important, but so is luck, especially on hectic days that can turn against you while you are getting your coffee of having your shoes shined.
''None of us are superstars,'' said John Lidyard, 27, a trader from Britain now working here. ''If I was a superstar, I'd be in a Chicago pit doing it myself and putting my own money up.''
My boss at Chase was Jack A. Kessler, the senior vice president for foreign exchange. I was given normal restrictions on my trading authority, limiting me to an exposure of $50 million during the day and $25 million overnight. My loss limit was $250,000. ''If you're down $250,000, we talk,'' said Mr. Kessler.
To trade, I used prices that came from the brokers over the squawk boxes or asked market makers at Chase. My trades would not be executed under a prior arrangement. But I kept track of them as other dealers in the room did and operated in the same market and with the same choice of prices.
Mr. Kessler, 40, a 19-year year Chase veteran who has traded here and in Europe, said the most important thing I had to learn was the discipline to stay with a position - even it it turned against me - if I expected the dollar to turn around.
But at the same time, I had to have the discipline to accept a loss. ''Don't think the market is wrong and you are right,'' he said. ''Never marry a position. You can sleep with it a few nights but never marry it.''
 
A Sense of Speed
I prepared for the trading room with an intensive three-day session conducted by ACF Consultants Ltd., who use a computer simulation called Global Trader that compresses trading days into 25 minutes. You get an immediate sense of the speed of the market and the difficulty of reaching your goals. I learned quickly what it was like to be just one step behind the market, and losing as I wearily tried to keep up.
So, when I got to the Chase trading room at 7 A.M. Monday on a hot August day, I was ready to go. But it took me more than 45 minutes to put my toe in the market.
The bids and offers were just noise. I had no idea where the dollar was going and was only reassured when some traders said they were in the same boat. If I thought the dollar would fall, I would want to go short, or sell, dollars. If I thought the dollar would rise, I'd do the opposite and go long, or buy.
My first trade was not auspicious. But I did it. Ryosuke Tsuji, 32, the head yen dealer and one of the growing number of Japanese traders here, gave me a price and I sold $5 million against the yen at 139.76. It was official, and I put it on my trader's position blotter. At first, as the dollar fell a little, it looked like the right move. But an hour later, while I was chatting with Mr. Lidyard of Chase, the dollar rose. My ears, however, were not yet attuned to the room and I did not hear the dollar go up against the yen. By the time I had bought the $5 million back at 139.77, I had lost $357.73 or one pip - the basic unit that measures profit or loss on a trade.
On this first day (and again on Tuesday and Wednesday), the market for both the mark and the yen drifted up and down in search of a direction. There was no major economic news or event to give it a one-way impetus. ''This type of market is not good for our style of trading'' at Chase, said John Gaines, 45, the chief dealer and one of the oldest in the room.
So what a trader does is look for something to give him a clue. One crutch is the chart, which plots the course of the dollar and shows if it is likely to move up or down. Technical analysts do this regularly and the market is paying more attention to them. When the dollar nears a critical chart point, it often bounces off, then, like a battering ram on a door, takes another run until it finally breaks through or gives up.
Another aid is information from customers who buy or sell dollars through the bank or from traders at other banks who know of large dollar buys and sells. You can, if you have a customer selling a lot of dollars, ''jump on the back'' and ride by following his sale with your own.
But this is also hit and miss. Anthony Scamardella, 32, the head mark trader, said that a very saavy Japanese customer had sold dollars Monday morning and was buying dollars in the afternoon. But the usually reliable customer was wrong in the morning. Should he follow him again? Anthony asked John M. Donnelly, 24, a mark trader. He did. This time the customer was right.
On Monday, after my one-pip loss, I improved. On my first mark trade, of $5 million, I made a profit of 16 pips or $4,193. As the market continued to move up and down that day, I spent a lot of energy cutting losing positions and quickly reversing them in the hope of recouping the losses. This defensive money-making is called digging out.
I did this because I was bullied by the market; I was unwilling to hold a position for too long. There is a lot of pressure as the dollar is rising against you and the numbers are shouted - 75, 80, 90, 95. I found that a nifty trick one hour can swamp you the next.
It wasn't long before I wiped out my Monday early profit. I did this by selling $5 million against the mark. But the dollar began to rise, which meant I was losing money. I then bought $10 million against the mark, hoping to make up for my loss. But, the dollar turned again and fell.
So I took my first bold move and sold $25 million against the mark as the dollar fell more. This one transaction took me out of the long dollar position and increased the size of the new short dollar position, so a small move in my favor could wipe out my previous losses. It was a big risk and if I was wrong I would lose even more.
Then I waited. That's the worst, the waiting. Its futile to root for the market to go your way, but I did. But the brokers' calls were understandable now. I could distinguish between the mark and the yen and the repetitions gave me a feel for the market. It was like beginning to understand a new language.
The dollar slipped lower against the mark from the 1.9070 I had sold at and was near 1.9030, which put me ahead. But the dollar didn't move lower - this was a chart point - and climbed higher. I waited. Sometimes it takes several tries to move through such a level. But no, not then. So I quickly bought $25 million at 1.9055, making close to $20,000.
After lunch - two bananas - I did well again. I felt the dollar would fall just because of the way it had been bouncing about; so I sold $15 million against the mark and then bought it back, making about $22,000. So, why not do it again. Bang.
I sold another $15 million. But the dollar rose and by the time I got out - I had my shoes shined while I listened to the bad news on the squawk boxes - I had lost nearly $16,000. Burned.
So where was I?
For the day, I was up $24,553 and went home with a $5 million long position against the mark. Going home, however, is not a relief from tension for traders who still have positions. Veterans like Mr. Scamardella, the head mark trader, would prefer to avoid the overnight agony and go home square, which means no dollars bought or sold. But with trading going on 24 hours a day, more and more traders work at night.
 
Falling Two Big Figures
On Monday's overnight trading in Asia and Europe, the dollar fell against the mark, as they say, two big figures, or 200 pips, from the Monday close in New York. I had put in a stop loss order to sell my $5 million position if the dollar dropped against the mark to 1.9075 - 95 pips below where it ended Monday. I didn't expect this to happen.
Yet when I came in Tuesday at 7 A.M., I found my position had been sold as a result of the stop loss order and I was already $24,901 in the hole. It was cold comfort that the traders there were just as puzzled as I was about why the dollar fell. The day continued downhill. I managed to dig out of some losses against the mark and ring up profits by doing more quick reversals as the dollar seesawed.
But, with the dollar down to 1.8970 against the mark, I decided to buy a lousy $2 million. I was sure the dollar would pop up again, following the pattern of the day. But the dollar continued to fall against the mark and wiped out all the profit I had that day.
I was in even worse trouble against the yen. I had taken a $10 million long position, betting that the dollar would rise. But the dollar was dropping against the yen throughout the day and by the time I went home that night, I had set up an overnight that would keep me up while the dollar was down.
That night, which I started facing a loss of nearly $40,000, gave me the real feel of a foreign exchange trader, the gnawing ache as a loss grows and grows. With a Metriplex Global 24, a hand-held quote machine, borrowed from James P. Borden, a Chase senior vice president, I was able to watch trading in Tokyo and then in Europe from home. The dollar was above 138.70 against the yen when trading opened in Tokyo and I sat down to dinner, with the Metriplex on the table.
As the dollar fell later in the evening in Tokyo to below the level at which I had originally decided to sell - my loss had now grown to $55,000 - I did what I should not have done: I gambled and remained with the dollar rather than taking a disciplined loss.
By morning, after waking and checking the Metriplex by the bed several times during the night - Oh, what relief. The dollar was up over 138.70 against the yen and, by the time I got to work, it was at 139.00.
I was exhausted. I sat there listening as the dollar creeped up and, by 8:22 A.M. I was out, selling $10 million dollars at 139.25, and avoiding a loss.
For three days of trading in a tough market, I had taken some big losses and made a few bad mistakes. By staying in and scrambling, I had still made money. I was ahead $12,234 and looking forward to Friday.
Friday began with an unexpected rise in the dollar in overnight trading in Asia and Europe. It was now 1.93 against the mark, up more than two big figures. Even Mr. Scamardella, who earlier had said he thought the dollar would soon rise to 1.94 marks, was shaking his head for not following his own forecast. ''Why don't my ears listen when my mouth talks,'' he wondered.
Friday was the kind of day that can be a trader's dream. Two important economic reports were due - retail sales figures and the Producer Price Index for finished goods, both for July. After a trendless week, this data could start a move that traders could jump on and make money.
In the fifteen minutes following the release of the economic data, the trading room became a frantic, noisy scramble for dollars. The decline in the price index and increase in retail sales appeared on the screens and were shouted out. The price index showed lower inflation and the retail sales figure showed the economy was not as weak as expected. Both were positive for the dollar.
 
An Easy Day, At Last
Once I saw the dollar would continue up, it was easy. Buy dollars and then sell them at a profit. I made over $76,000 in half an hour. Soon, I was more than $155,000 in the black.
And when the Federal Reserve and other central banks sold dollars to slow the rally, I saw intervention first hand. But it didn't make a difference. It just pushed the dollar lower and then traders, including me, would swoop in and buy the cheaper dollars, making a little extra profit as it rose again. How did I do? A $167,686 profit for the week.
Mr. Kessler, who would not be specific about earnings, said I fared well. But he said I should have made more money on Friday. I was not aggressive enough in buying the dollar when it was rising.
A new job? No thanks. It's too up and down. I know now why it's a young man's game and I'm not John Gaines, Chase's gray eminence, at 45. ''I guess its a young man's game, but there are a few dinosaurs around,'' he said. Not me.

HEADLINE: How the Little Guy Is Playing the Market

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
AS the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through to record highs last month, Stephen A. Swets, a 38-year-old manager with a Chicago housing firm, switched some of his savings out of a Fidelity Investments bond fund and into one of the firm's stock mutual funds. Mr. Swets said he made the switch because he is ''optimistic'' about the current bullish stock market's long-term prospects, but he cautioned, ''This is not the time to be fully invested in stocks.''
Indeed, many individuals share his view. The Dow and other measures of the bull market set records in recent weeks largely without the help of the individual investor. Daring souls like Mr. Swets are venturing back into stocks, but stock market experts now are questioning whether individual investors will ever return to the market in large numbers. ''It certainly isn't higher stock prices that will encourage the individual to come back in,'' said Steven G. Einhorn, chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''The best we can hope for is that they slow their liquidations down.'' 
In the view of many market analysts, what is happening is nothing less than a redistribution of the individual investors' assets away from stocks and into a variety of other investments, a trend that began 20 years ago but has accelerated since the October 1987 stock market crash and shows few signs of ceasing. While many brokers are optimistically predicting the inevitable return of the individual investor to the current bull market, some analysts disagree. They suggest that there will be no new influx because the individual investor is already in the market through mutual funds, pension plans, employee stock ownership and savings plans.
If individual investors are not coming back to the stock market - or if they do, but only to stick a toe into an equity mutual fund, as Mr. Swets did - the portents for the stock markets and the nation's brokerage firms are immensely significant. It means the markets will be increasingly dominated by institutional investors and that programmed trading techniques will expand as the large investors seek to maximize their returns. This could lead to more volatility in the markets.
The retail brokerage business, which already has undergone great change since the crash, will be altered even more. Firms like Merrill Lynch & Company or PaineWebber Inc., whose foundations are built on the retail business, will likely undergo upheavals as they struggle to lure individuals with more services, but at the same time court institutional clients. Others, who traditionally have served institutional clients may find the going easier.
The corporate world will also increasingly feel the effect. Institutional investors are generally more focused on financial performance quarter by quarter. In the last year or so, some of them, like pension fund managers, have been challenging corporate boards of directors and demanding a voice in how a company is run.
The retreat by individual investors already has affected corporate takeovers, and will continue to do so. Individuals have traditionally voted with management in proxy battles. But institutional investors are frequently willing to throw their weight behind a hostile takeover if they are disenchanted with management.
Whether or not the long-term predictions come true, for the moment individual investors continue to flee. In 1989, while the markets reached record highs, individuals, who own $3.6 trillion worth of equities, continued as net sellers, liquidating 3.5 million shares of stock a day, according to the Securities Industry Association, a New York trade group.
At the same time, mutual funds were undergoing a boom. Just this past week, the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund industry group, reported that Americans are putting more cash into mutual funds than at any time since the crash. Sales of stock funds, minus redemptions, hit a post-crash high of $1.09 billion in July, up 81 percent from June.
The organizations that offer a variety of funds are receiving much of the new cash. In July, the assets at Fidelity Investments passed $100 billion, up from $78 billion at the end of 1987, said Michael J. Hines, vice president of marketing.
And Vanguard Group, the mutual fund organization in Valley Forge, Pa., is enjoying its best year ever. The total value of net contributions to its stock mutual funds is $2 billion through July, more than double the $971 million for all of 1987, Vanguard's previous best year. Almost $1 billion was directed into its successful Windsor Fund. Telephone inquiries in July and August are up more than 50 percent over last summer, according to a Vanguard spokesman.
But brokerage firms have yet to see a similar interest in stocks. ''Individuals are coming in moderately, but certainly there is no big trend into stocks,'' said Donald Marron, chairman of PaineWebber. While its new accounts have increased by 10 to 20 percent since the beginning of the year, he said, ''money is coming into savings instruments, as opposed to investments.''
THE same phenomenon is occurring at some of the regional brokerage firms. In the first quarter of this year, one out of every three client dollars directed to Edward D. Jones & Company, the St. Louis brokerage firm, was earmarked for certificates of deposit. While its customers have increased their stock purchases in recent weeks, they have also stepped up their liquidations, said John W. Bachmann, managing principal of the firm and former chairman of the Securities Industry Association.
This redistribution of individuals' stock holdings to indirect ownership means that in order to generate new business, brokerage firms must offermore and more financial services, like insurance, mutual funds, certificates of deposit and annuities. Many already do, but they likely will have to expand their offerings.
The trend has made it more difficult for retail brokers to maintain their incomes, because stock commissions are higher than those for other products. For 1989, only 55 percent of the average stockbroker's commission revenue is generated from stock transactions by individuals, down from 60 percent in 1983, according to Michael Goldstein, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
For some brokerage firms, the figure is even lower. At Edward D. Jones, which has 1,452 offices around the country, stock commissions from retail accounts represent only 15 percent of the average broker's commissions. The balance is from C.D.'s, mutual fund sales and other non-stock instruments.
Many market analysts believe the most immediate effect of increases in mutual fund sales and continued liquidation of individual stock holdings will be greater market volatility. Without the broad-based support of individual investors - serving as a sort of a check on the institutional investor - the stock market will become more volatile as the performance-driven institutions force their trading on a market originally designed for smaller investors.
''I think it's clear that the fewer players you have, there is a probability of some sort of instability,'' said Michael A. Petrino, president of Matrix Capital Management, a Stamford, Conn.-based investment firm with $1 billion under management. This shows up as short-term swings - like the Dow's increase of 41.54 points on Aug. 7 and its fall of 40.97 points two weeks later - which occur when the release of economic data generates computerized buy and sell programs for stock and stock index futures. It is the large institutional investors and Wall street firms that run these programs.
And computerized trading - with its resultant short-term price moves - is what most concerns investors, according to a recent survey of its customers by the Prudential-Bache Securities Corporation. ''Volatility is a key issue,'' said Richard Sichenzio, president of the retail group at Prudential-Bache.
Other individuals worry that the market is dominated by professional investors and institutions that are more informed about what is going on in the markets or who may engage in unethical or illegal conduct.
''I have less ability to know what's going to happen,'' said Mr. Swets, who invests most of his and his wife's retirement and savings in shares of mutual funds. ''I feel a little timid about what could blindside me.''
The individual's perception that the markets favor insiders or those who are highly capitalized is undoubtedly reinforced by some recent market changes. For example, the New York Stock Exchange is developing a new product that will allow investors to trade in a so-called ''basket'' security, which will be comprised of many individual stocks bundled together. However, the minimum investment is $5 million, which will put such an investment out of reach of almost all individual investors.
And the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed that corporations be allowed to offer unregistered private placement securities to large institutional investors. Under the proposed Rule 144 (A) - the reference is to the Federal securities law authorizing their use - these securities likely will be available only to institutional investors with at least $100 million under management.
ALTHOUGH many brokers are optimistic that individual investors will return, they may not once they find alternative ways to maintain a stake in equities. For instance, some financial experts believe that individuals may not feel compelled to buy stocks because they own stock through their retirement funds. Changes in the past decade have added many new investment vehicles that include stocks to the traditional retirement package of Social Security and a company pension plan. Almost 45 million corporate and union workers are represented in pension funds that hold $1 trillion in assets. Almost one-half of this is invested in the stock market, according to most studies.
Ownership of stock in their own companies may be another reason why many individuals do not feel compelled to enter the stock markets. For instance, at the end of 1986, 15.6 million employees participated in pre-tax savings plans known as 401(K) plans, so named for the section of the Federal tax code that authorized them. Employees are given discretion over the investment of these assets. And they have directed almost one-third of them into company stock, according to a report by the General Accounting Office.
THIS year, employees' participation in corporate stock plans has exploded in the form of employee stock ownership plans, or ESOP's, which allocate stock to employees without involving the traditional retail distribution system. Since 1974, these plans, covering 10 million workers, have bought almost $50 billion of company stock, according to the National Center for Employee Ownership, a research group in Oakland, Calif.
Since January, 85 companies, including Brunswick, Exxon and Procter & Gamble, have establised new ESOP's or amended existing plans covering two million workers, and have announced plans to purchase $20 billion in company stock.
Moreover, many individuals now hold stock or stock mutual funds in their individual retirement accounts. But out of the total $414 billion in these accounts, they have invested only $68 billion in stock brokerage accounts, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a research organization in Washington.
No one is certain whether this redistribution of individual stockholdings is complete. But if stock prices continue to rise over the next few months, individual investing patterns should indicate whether the liquidation trend away from stocks will slow, say brokers. The return of the individual investor may not materialize, said Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst who follows the brokerage industry for Prudential-Bache in San Francisco. ''If we don't start to bring in people now, maybe they won't come in this time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
The Fine Art of Delaying the Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
TWO and a half years ago, when New York State leaders announced agreement on a four-year plan to cut taxes, state politicians described the idea as if it heralded a new era. It was, they said, a tremendous step, sending a ''strong signal'' to the state's businesses, and, in the words of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, it was ''good for the people'' of New York.
But now, as the Governor and other politicians consider delaying the last phase of the income tax cut, scheduled for next year, one would think it really didn't make much difference to New Yorkers whether their tax rate dropped or not. In one of those shifts of rhetoric that usually presage a reversal of policy, what was, in good economic times, hailed as a remarkable accomplishment is now, in harder times, being described by many politicians as a matter of no great moment. 
Consider a recent exchange between Mr. Cuomo and the audience at a community forum in Brooklyn.
''Want to see something funny about this tax cut?'' the Governor asked the audience. ''Watch this. How many people here, please be honest, know what the New York State income tax rate is that you pay now?'' Shouts from the audience. A few are close, but none on the mark.
''My point is that nobody really knows what they're getting,'' Mr. Cuomo continued. ''So how important can it be? Nobody even knows what the tax rate is.''
Indeed, nobody does seem to know what the rate is, not even Mr. Cuomo. ''Right now the rate is 7.865,'' Mr. Cuomo told the audience. But, in fact, according to the Department of Taxation and Finance, the top tax rate this year is 7.875 percent.
 
Lowered Rates
In this year's phase of the tax cut, the top rate will drop from 8 percent to 7.5 percent this fall, yielding the annual rate of 7.875 percent. If the fourth and last phase of the tax cut goes into effect as scheduled, it would bring the top tax rate down to 7 percent in late 1990, for an annualized rate of 7.375 percent.
The last phase of the tax cut would cost the state about $400 million in the fiscal year that begins next April, just about what the state budget office has predicted New York will need at that time to close a projected budget gap, and about $1 billion in the following year. Since 1990 is an election year, both for the Governor and for all 211 members of the Legislature, deferring the tax cut is likely to be considered preferable to drastic budget cuts.
The notion that delaying the tax cut could save money for the state began to surface last spring. Like most political trial balloons, it started out as a light, filmy suggestion to test the currents of public opinion. But the Governor repeated it so often that it began to take on the weight of a bad debt. It finally took on real substance two weeks ago, when the Governor, in response to questions about the next phase of the tax cut, said: ''What I would suggest? Put it off for a year. Defer it.''
The remarks, advisers to Mr. Cuomo said, were not substantially different from his previous comments, when he suggested that deferring the cut should at least be considered. But the shift in tone was enough to prompt politicians across the state to begin lining up for what promises to be a heated debate.
The Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat who has advocated a ''stretching out'' of the tax cut ever since the state began to experience fiscal problems last year, aligned himself with Mr. Cuomo.
 
'Small Amount'
''What's it worth to Joe Blow?'' said Mr. Miller, who, at the time the tax cut was enacted, was one of its chief advocates. ''The truth is that for the majority of taxpayers, it's a very small amount of money.'' In addition, he said, ''the tax cut is not real if local governments have to raise real estate taxes because there's not enough state school aid.''
But the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican who has consistently opposed deferring the tax cut, called delay unacceptable.
''People look to government to keep its promise,'' he said. ''This is a promise we made, and we should be trying to keep it at all costs.'' The final cut, he insisted, ''comes to a substantial amount per taxpayer.''
One of the state's most powerful lobbying organizations, the Business Council, also came out against deferral and sought to counter the Governor's assertion that the average taxpayer would not notice the tax cut.
''An interruption of the tax cut would have an especially significant impact on single heads of households in middle-income brackets,'' the council said, and on two-earner married couples with incomes of $35,000 or more. Both groups, the council said, are sizable. The Business Council said that the last phase of the tax cut would bring the annual state income tax liability for a single parent with an income of $25,000 down to $661 from the current $714, and for a two-earner family with an income of $35,000 down to $1,001 from $1,056.
Whether this difference is enough to be noticed by the ''average taxpayer'' - and to be fought for - is a question destined to preoccupy the Governor and legislators long before the Legislature convenes in January.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Once Again, Racism Proves to Be Fatal In New York City

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
EARLY this summer, when Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' opened, some commentators, white ones, mostly, nervously predicted that the film's portrayal of racial divisions in Brooklyn might provoke riots by blacks. It didn't.
Instead, the scene played out two months later to a horrifying finale on New York City's streets was the one in which Pino, the pizzeria owner's son, says to his father, Sal: ''We should stay in Bensonhurst and the niggers should stay in their neighborhood.''
On Aug. 23, a black teen-ager who ventured into Bensonhurst, Yusuf K. Hawkins, was gunned down by a group of whites - perhaps as a result of mistaken identity, but targeted, nonetheless, solely because he was black.
Was what happened in Bensonhurst an aberration? Or was it, rather, the latest violent manifestation of the underlying suspicion and fear with which many whites and blacks still seem to view one another even as many are striving for racial harmony? That American dilemma, described by Gunnar Myrdal nearly 50 years ago, was belatedly addressed through civil rights legislation. But neither group has really acknowledged the causes and scope of racism. 
For years, New York City has held itself up as more tolerant of race than other cities, albeit hypocritically at times. The racial concerns are often suppressed by more acceptable civic ones. In the 1960's, debate over school decentralization was couched as a controversy over community control, though it was mostly white teachers concerned about being controlled by black communities. In the 1970's, the watershed confrontation over low-income housing in Forest Hills was putatively a class struggle, except that most residents of the middle-class Queens community were white and most prospective low-income tenants were black.
New York was never a melting pot. Each immigrant group enforced its own geographical and cultural boundaries that, at least until the newcomers achieved economic and political power, bred an insularity that still pervades enclaves like the blocks of Bensonhurst dominated by Italian immigrant families. Some members of virtually every immigrant group sought to elevate their own self-image by denigrating somebody else.
Blacks will always be singled out by their skin color. They are reflexively identified in some neighborhoods as outsiders. In those same neighborhoods, when they are young or casually dressed, many are perceived as potential criminals.
That was true of Yusuf Hawkins, who ventured into Bensonhurst to answer an advertisement for a used car and was mistaken for a friend of a young white woman from the neighborhood, and of Michael Griffith, chased to his death in Howard Beach after the car in which he was riding had broken down. It was also true of Hilton B. Clark, the City Councilman, trying unsuccessfully to get a taxi to Harlem; and of Richard R. Green, the late New York schools chancellor and an avid golfer, attempting to decide in which predominantly white country club he would be least likely mistaken for a caddy.
Street crime is more often than not committed by poor people who, nowadays, also happen to be mostly black or Hispanic. But so are most crime victims. Shortly after the subway shootings of four black teen-agers by Bernhard H. Goetz, a New York Times/CBS News survey asked black New Yorkers whether they would feel unsafe if they saw several loud teen-age white boys on their subway car. Yes, said 39 percent. What if the teen-agers were black? Yes, said 51 percent.
Such racial analyses feed stereotypes, which become self perpetuating. But ignoring possible racial factors may hamper the already frustrating search for responses to why too many American blacks continue to be relegated to poverty while many Caribbean blacks and newer immigrants from Asia and Latin America scramble up economic and social ladders.
''You can't keep things cool at the expense of ignoring injustice,'' said Roscoe C. Brown Jr., the Bronx Community College president. Nor can you without being introspective.
The black community's outrage over what happened in Bensonhurst, said Andrew Hacker, a political science professor at Queens College, ''is part of a deep-seated fear that black people have - they're outnumbered in this country.''
Mayor Edward I. Koch has boasted that there have been no race riots during his tenure. But despite gains in employment and a growing middle class, life for many black and Hispanic New Yorkers remains a daily riot of poverty and discrimination.
''We don't know whether things are getting better or worse, but the number of visible incidents is rising,'' said Herbert J. Gans, Robert S. Lynd professor of sociology at Columbia University. ''I'm not sure that there's an iceberg under the tip. One consequence of the fact that this is a pretty liberal city is that blacks feel free about going into Bensonhurst. And 20 years ago, if an Italian girl had been going out with a black or Hispanic she would have been beaten up by her father or a priest or by her peers. That tells you something about the improvement in race relations, I suppose.''
Another barometer of race relations may be how David N. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, fares in his quest to be the city's first black mayor. ''If Dinkins wins,'' Dr. Gans said, ''people will say, 'That solves the problem and we won't have to think about race relations for a while.' ''
One measure of New Yorkers' concern is the number of people leaning to Mr. Dinkins primarily because of the potential for healing that his candidacy represents.
''I think we're in for some difficult times, which means the Mayor and the Governor are going to have to ask people who depend on government the most to accept some sacrifices,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who is undecided. ''You really can't deal with the city's economy or make any long-term policy decisions without first having a stable social base. That base has to rely on a sense of community and people of different races and levels of wealth and backgrounds being able to function together. Those problems have obviously gotten greater in light of what happened last month.''
Race relations in New York are likely to be defined less by what happened in Bensonhurst, or even what happens in the Democratic mayoral primary, than by the candor with which racism is addressed.
''We are farther ahead than most countries in dealing with race relations in that we can talk about it without fear of reprisal and we can demonstrate to show our discontent,'' said Dr. Betty Shabazz, the director of communication at Medgar Evers College. ''I know a lot of people really don't want to deal with it, but if we can talk about everything else - sex, family planning, divorce, religion, and politics - we certanly must deal with race relations too.''
Last week, after black demonstrators showing their discontent were taunted by some bystanders in Bensonhurst, Spike Lee talked to young residents of the white community where Yusuf Hawkins was killed. ''They did not see me as a nigger,'' Mr. Lee said afterward. ''They saw me as a film star and a movie maker - the same people who were holding up a watermelon the day before. To them, there are two types of black people: entertainers and niggers.
''What you're talking about is the way people think,'' he said. ''You cannot change that overnight.''
Nor can talk of change be heard over shooting and shouting.

One Hope for AIDS Patients Is Hostage to the Market

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
WHERE AIDS is concerned, even good news often comes wrapped in bitterness. The recently announced indications that AZT can postpone the onset of AIDS and slow the early stages of the disease have brought hope for hundreds of thousands of people infected with the virus. But the developments have also fueled the debate over access to AZT, or azidothymidine, the only approved drug for treating the disease. Last week, 16 AIDS advocacy groups demanded a reduction in the price of the drug, which can cost up to $8,000 a year and is one of the most expensive drugs on the market.
The groups urged the British-owned manufacturer of AZT, the Burroughs Wellcome Company, to act before Congress takes up bills this month to renew the $30 million Federal subsidy for the treatment of uninsured AIDS patients. The program expires Sept. 30. 
The developments have raised questions about the pricing of all drugs, leading some critics of the medical establishment to challenge the prerogatives of the pharmaceutical industry. ''In a monopolistic situation, the grounds are created for a public review of the pricing mechanism,'' said Ronald Bayer, a professor of public health at Columbia University.
The drug companies say high drug prices are often justified because they must recover research and development costs and turn a profit before competitive products appear. Burroughs Wellcome says AZT is expensive to produce and the costs have been spread among only 20,000 patients throughout the world.
As with most drugs, the ingredients of AZT cost only a few cents per capsule. Burroughs declines to state its costs, but Joanna Walton, an analyst in London with Shearson Lehman Hutton, estimates that AZT ingredients cost $300 a kilogram and that manufacturing adds $3,000 to $5,000. That would be 33 cents to 53 cents for a 100 milligram capsule, which Burroughs sells wholesale for $1.50. Drug analysts said patented drugs often sell for 10 to 20 times the cost of making them.
Jonathan S. Gelles, a securities analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York, said Burroughs spent at least $180 million developing AZT, including $90 million in the two years it has been on the market. After subtracting for research and production costs, he said, Burroughs, a $2 billion company, will earn about $23 million from AZT this year, a total that should rise dramatically in the next few years. Some industry analysts believe Burroughs may lower the price as demand and production increase. Because they may take lower dosages than those with outright AIDS, infected people without symptoms may pay about $3,600 a year at current prices.
''We periodically review the prices of all our medications with respect to market conditions,'' said Kathy Bartlett, a Burroughs spokeswoman, repeating what the company has said since late 1987 when it cut its original AZT price by 20 percent. She said much of the money from AZT goes for research on AIDS and other diseases. Profits go to Burroughs's owner, the Wellcome Foundation in Britain, which supports scientific education.
 
Exclusive Rights
Burroughs Wellcome took AZT, a rejected cancer drug, off the shelf in 1984 when the Government put out a call for potential AIDS drugs. The company denies the contention of some critics that AZT research was largely financed by the Government, which tested the drug in the laboratory, verified its safety for the first time in humans, and provided ingredients to Burroughs Wellcome for further research. Under the Food and Drug Administration's orphan drug program, which encourages development of drugs for which the potential demand seems small, Burroughs was given exclusive rights to AZT for seven years with no pricing conditions. ''It was difficult to convince the pharmaceutical manufacturers that it was worth it for them to assume all the physical and economic risks of getting into AIDS research,'' said the director of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Samuel Broder, who strongly promoted the development of AZT. ''Now that has changed,'' he said. ''I feel the scientists at Burroughs Wellcome are brilliant and feel confident that they will figure out a way to reduce the cost.''
 
Promising Alternatives
Competition from new drugs may help solve the problem. Dr. Broder said promising candidates include two Government-owned drugs: DDI, or dideoxyinosine, licensed to the Bristol-Myers Company, and DDC, or dideoxycytidine, licensed to Hoffmann-La Roche. Encouraging results have also been shown recently by probenecid, which enhances the effectiveness of a number of drugs, including AZT. If testing shows that the drugs are effective, they could be approved as early as 1990.
Ms. Walton of Shearson Lehman Hutton said ''the competing drugs are likely to be cheaper because they appear to be easier to make.'' Under the 1986 Technology Transfer Act, which was passed for unrelated reasons after the AZT deal was made, the licensees for the new drugs would be obligated to sell them for an unspecified ''reasonable'' cost and pay the Government a royalty.
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of health research for Public Citizen, a consumer group in Washington, thinks the Government should grant nonexclusive licenses for AIDS drugs or buy them at quantity discounts and give them away.
Richard Dunne, executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, said AZT's high price ''could damage the reputation'' of other Burroughs products. ''A boycott is a weapon that hasn't been used yet,'' he said. Late last week, Burroughs Wellcome said it was considering meeting with gay advocacy groups this week.

Lesson in the Baltics: Gorbachev's Tolerance Only Goes So Far

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A NEW debate between Congress and the Bush Administration over whether to impose additional sanctions on the Chinese Government is ready to bubble to the surface. When Congress reconvenes this week, the Senate and House are scheduled to try to work out a package of sanctions for presentation to the President.
With that prospect clearly in mind, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger rekindled what is bound to be an incendiary discussion with an article appealing to Congress to resist the temptation of writing new penalties into law. ''China remains too important for America's national security to risk the relationship on the emotions of the moment,'' he wrote in his syndicated newspaper column. 
While most senior Administration officials quietly share Mr. Kissinger's argument, they have not made it with such explicitness. Publicly, in fact, both Congress and the Administration agree on the basic logic of sanctions against China to punish it for the mass killings with which its army suppressed demonstrations for democracy in Beijing on June 4. The fight will be over who - Congress or the President - can impose those restrictions and therefore who will have the right to determine when China's behavior merits their being lifted.
Both the Administration and Congress believe that in the short run the Chinese leaders will do whatever they have to do to survive, no matter what the world does to inhibit them. The common hope in Washington is that once the Chinese leaders consolidate their rule, or are replaced by a younger generation, the moderates among them will be able to point to effective American sanctions as proof that China cannot have both economic modernization and political authoritarianism and that what the West thinks will affect China's development. Therefore, this theory goes, Beijing must eventually make concessions to democratic forces. On June 5, President Bush suspended all arms shipments to, and exchanges with, the Chinese military. Roughly $600 million worth of equipment had been on order, mostly avionics to modernize China's F-8 bombers. On June 20, under pressure from Congress to do more, the Administration added a ban on all high-level diplomatic exchanges with China, forcing Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher to postpone a visit to Beijing scheduled for July. The United States also used its leverage to effectively defer roughly $1 billion in loan requests by China before the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. That action is already causing foreign exchange problems for Beijing at a time when it is losing both tourism and trade. White House officials say they have also suspended efforts to persuade the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Strategic Exports to ease restrictions on the transfer of high-technology exports to China that could have military as well as civilian uses. In addition, the Administration has halted the issue of credit guarantees through the United States Export-Import Bank.
As Administration officials see it, the actions are firm but also flexible, in that they would not produce a breach in relations or shackle President Bush from responding to improvements in Beijing.
By insisting that these sanctions are best imposed by executive order rather than by legislative act, the Administration is seeking to preserve its own freedom of action. ''The President needs as much flexibility as possible to respond to changed circumstances,'' said Richard L. Williams, acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs.
Most members of Congress say that they do not want to deprive the President of flexibility, but that the sanctions should have the force of law. Unless the sanctions are enacted, these members of Congress say, pressure from business and from influential strategic thinkers like Mr. Kissinger to do business with China, irrespective of its human rights record, will slowly whittle away the punitive measures now in place. Moreover, there is an underlying mistrust, particularly among Democrats, of the President's own basic instincts on China. That mistrust was fed by the very understated manner with which the President responded rhetorically to the events in and around Tiananmen Square.
Both the House and Senate amendments, which were passed 418 to 0 and 82 to 10 respectively before the summer recess and must now be melded together in conference, essentially duplicate most measures adopted by the Administration. The House bill allows the President a waiver for reasons of ''national security,'' or in the event of a clear improvement of China's human rights record; the Senate bill has the same language on human rights but offers a waiver for ''national interest.'' The Administration prefers neither approach, but probably can live with the Senate version, which, as one State Department official put it, ''you can definitely drive a Boeing 757 through.''
Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee on Asia, says that ''if you look at our amendments you can see that we built in plenty of flexibility for the Administration.''
''What is driving the Administration's opposition,'' Mr. Solarz said, ''is not their desire for flexibility, but rather the fact that the President considers himself the desk officer for China and more knowledgeable about it than anyone else in town - not to mention the Congress. It is an offense to his pride as President, and as a former ambassador there, not to be able to determine policy totally unfettered by Congress.''

A French Presence in Lebanon, A Lebanese Presence in France

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
FOR months, French television viewers have watched scenes of Lebanese cowering in basements, bleeding in hospitals or lying dead amid the ruins of East Beirut under the firepower of Syrian and Muslim militias. Even though the victims are not French, the intensity of French news coverage of the civil war resembles the American obsession a decade ago with the Iranian takeover of the United States Embassy in Teheran.
The news coverage has tended to favor Lebanese Christians, partly because Catholic France feels a kinship with them, but also because Syria is widely believed here to have participated in anti-French terrorist plots, including the murder of a French ambassador to Lebanon a few years ago.
This emotional commitment drove France to send an armada of warships near the shores of Lebanon last month when Syrian troops and their Muslim militia proxies threatened to overrun Christian East Beirut. The warships remain, and France may yet take economic, and perhaps military, action against Syria. 
The French have argued that the purpose of their fleet's presence was to evacuate the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 French citizens still in Lebanon, most of whom are Lebanese with dual citizenship. But the real aim is widely believed to be the intimidation of Syria and its allies. France wants to draw a ''red line'' against any attempt to invade the Christian enclave, senior French and Arab officials say privately. The ambiguity of the mission has added to its deterrent effect.
The strong feelings of the French, who in public opinion polls have overwhelmingly expressed condemnation of Syrian aggression, are a result of what the French and Lebanese agree is a special relationship that goes back to the last century. Long after the United States and Italy abandoned all efforts to make a difference in Lebanon, France has remained the only Western power still willing to maintain a civilian presence there. While France's formidable naval force cruises some 100 miles off the shores of Lebanon, French politicians of the right and left have pushed their Government to cajole, intimidate and if necessary threaten Syria to pull its 40,000 soldiers out of the country.
Francois Leotard, who as president of the French Republican Party is a leader of the conservative opposition, has called for a far more vigorous role in open support of the 600,000 or so Christians - the use of force to keep Lebanon's Christian ports open despite the Syrian barrages. ''I regret that the rest of the Western world has not joined us,'' Mr. Leotard said. ''We are talking about a million human beings held hostage by Syria, a recognized terrorist nation.''
 
An Implicit Threat
For the moment, France appears allied with the Christian forces of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, commander of the Lebanese Army, but French policy makers say their purpose is not so much to impose a Christian faction over others, but to deny Syria a free hand and by doing so encourage a settlement among the Lebanese themselves. The implicit threat posed by France's armada appears to have given the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, an additional reason not to try to overwhelm General Aoun's forces.
France first went into Lebanon to protect Maronite Catholics from attacks by the Druse in the latter half of the 19th century. After the First World War, France occupied the Levant, split it into Syria and Lebanon and created a republic in Lebanon with a power-sharing arrangement in which the Maronites had an edge.
Ever since, the strong bond of religion has helped push the French further than other colonial powers in support of the Christians of Lebanon, who are committed francophiles. Since the civil war began in 1976, as many as 120,000 Lebanese have moved to Paris and many of them carry dual citizenship. French remains Lebanon's second language.
There are other reasons for the French involvement in Lebanon's latest crisis. France, in its bicentennial year, has undertaken several international initiatives, from organizing the Cambodian peace talks, which failed last week, to the summit meeting of Western industrial nations and conferences on human rights and chemical warfare. Above all, some French analysts say, President Francois Mitterrand may have judged that this is the right time to challenge Syria, because it is weaker and more isolated than it has been in recent years.
The Soviet Union, Syria's principal patron, appears to have reduced its support for third-world troublemakers like Syria, Libya and Cuba. Earlier this year, the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, joined President Mitterrand in suggesting that Lebanon be allowed to regain its sovereign status through the withdrawal of foreign troops.
But after 13 years of involvement in Lebanon, Syria has found many interests in remaining there, including profits from illegal smuggling and the spread of its political influence. It can convincingly argue that half of Lebanon's people, primarily the Muslims, want it there and that its forces were invited in the first place as peacekeepers, paradoxically by the Christians, who have since said Syria should leave.
Many here believe that the French would be better off urging the United States and European nations to back a continuing Arab effort to persuade Syria to let Lebanon alone. Otherwise, the French could find themselves embroiled alone in a land where no other Western nation is willing to give them a hand and where many who have become involved have ended up frustrated, or worse.

A War on Drugs Is a Necessary Risk for Bush

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH will deliver his first prime-time televised address this week, and the nation's state of mind has given him a politically irresistible topic: a strategy for battling drugs.
The timing could hardly be better. Americans are outraged by murderous drug barons in Colombia. They are sickened by the record homicide rates caused in part by turf battles over crack dealing in American cities, and the warm months have only brought the ravages of addiction into clearer view on the streets. Opinion polls show that more and more people consider drug abuse the nation's most pressing problem. 
The answer, as described in drafts of the Bush Administration's drug strategy, is a combination of approaches that stresses tough law-enforcement measures, like more police officers and prison cells and stiffer penalties for even casual drug users. Yet critics contend that it lacks imaginative new ideas, and many doubt that anything short of a vastly increased preventive effort will work.
But millions are likely to tune in Tuesday evening to hear what Mr. Bush thinks he can accomplish. The drug issue has a vast constituency, touching foreign policy, social welfare, crime, economics and public health. It also plays well: who would protest a war on drugs?
No wonder that William J. Bennett, the national drug policy director and the main architect of the plan, consulted not only scores of narcotics experts but also poll-takers and Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
And in rallying support for the plan, Mr. Bennett took the unusual step of calling a news conference at the White House last month to announce the findings of a Gallup Poll: a record 27 percent of adults questioned said the most important problem facing the nation was drugs -eclipsing poverty, the economy, the environment and fear of war.
 
Taking the Initiative
Some advisers sought to convince Mr. Bush that he should not be so vocal on an issue for which there are no clear remedies. Instead, they urged the President to save his first big address to tout the coming education summit or environmental programs. But it was finally decided that Mr. Bush needed to appear to be taking the initiative against drugs.
In some critical areas, the Bush plan shifts from current drug policy. It substantially increases aid to cocaine-producing countries. It also aims at the middle-level figures in drug networks, like pilots and money handlers, rather than trying to capture kingpins, on the one hand, or low-level drug runners, on the other.
Federal wars on drugs are nothing new. Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter gave priority to traffickers rather than users. President Reagan tilted further to law enforcement and border interdiction. Never has a President proposed a strategy involving more than a dozen Federal agencies. But Mr. Bush cannot take the credit; the drug plan was mandated by the comprehensive drug bill that Congress passed last year over Mr. Reagan's initial opposition.
The President is expected to propose spending $7.8 billion on anti-drug programs in the 1990 fiscal year, a $2 billion increase from his initial budget proposal and nearly $3 billion more than was authorized for this year. While that would be a notable increase from the $1.1 billion spent to fight drugs in President Reagan's first year in office, it would hardly dent the overall budget. The Pentagon has proposed to spend $8 billion a year on the B-2 bomber program alone.
There is an underlying concern among experts that no matter how intelligent the policy, no matter how many interagency turf wars are resolved, no matter if Mr. Bush backs up the oratory with billions of dollars that he does not now have, the Federal Government's ability to attack the drug epidemic is limited.
Perhaps seeking to dampen expectations, Mr. Bennett is quick to acknowledge this. ''There is a lot that's left to state and local governments and private individuals,'' he said in an interview last week. ''In the end, it's going to depend on others to get things done. If states don't toughen their laws and build prisons, we're not going to succeed.''
Working with finite resources, authors of the Bush strategy sought to address popular concerns. Americans seem in a punitive mood, and the strategy reflects that.
Robert Newman, president of the Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, praised Mr. Bennett for recommending more spending on treatment, but said it was ''an extraordinary and incomprehensible omission'' that the draft he read did not emphasize treatment on demand. He said that one chapter urges the use of court orders to force addicts into treatment programs, but says little about the thousands who want but cannot get treatment. ''Possibly, Bennett is concerned with the political reaction to what would be perceived as a soft approach to addicts,'' Dr. Newman said.
Mr. Bennett said he had had ''no pressure to be tough.''
''No one at the White House told me how to write this,'' he said. ''It's clear that this proposal has to be, and be perceived to be, not the product of a political imagination or stemming from political motivation.'' But drafts of Mr. Bennett's strategy are already the object of partisan warfare, which will certainly intensify when Congress begins hearings on the plan this week.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who last year championed the comprehensive drug bill, has been supportive of Mr. Bennett for months. But last week, he complained that in maintaining the current spending proportions of roughly 70 percent for law enforcement and 30 percent for treatment and education, the plan was out of kilter. ''I think it should be much closer to a 50-50 ratio,'' he said.
Meanwhile, White House officials were concentrating on refining Mr. Bush's speech. Sometimes, it seems, Presidents are better at talking out problems with the people than they are at solving them, and this is Mr. Bush's opportunity to talk.
As a White House official said: ''We don't want another Chamber of Commerce speech. We really want to talk through the drug problem as the fundamental issue of our time and a fundamental threat to maintaining a decent society.''

HEADLINE: Maine's Secluded Island Inns

BYLINE: By NANCY HARMON JENKINS; NANCY HARMON JENKINS is the editor of the Journal of Gastronomy and is working on a book on American ethnic food.

 BODY:
AFTER a late afternoon rain shower the sky cleared just enough to make a radiant spectacle of sunset over the distant Camden Hills. From the rock ledges at Robinson Point on Isle au Haut, we could see across Penobscot Bay to Vinalhaven and North Haven Islands in the foreground and the dark blue humps of Mount Megunticook and Ragged Mountain on the luminous horizon. As evening fell, first one, then two and three lights began to blink across the water in steady, comforting rhythm, signals from Saddleback Ledge, Green Island and another light we failed to locate on the Coast and Geodetic Survey chart of Penobscot Bay and Approaches. When the Isle au Haut light at Robinson Point next to the Keeper's House, added its pink revolving flash, it seemed another link in a connecting chain, threads of light that stretched in both directions, tying together the islands off the coast of Maine.
There are, according to current surveys, some 3,000 of these islands, from rocky shoals just barely uncovered at high tide to big, populated communities, connected to the mainland by bridges and causeways, places like Beal's off Jonesport, or Bailey's Island in Casco Bay where some residents actually commute to jobs in Portland. 
Most Maine islands, however, are not inhabited by commuters. An island's population, when it has one, usually consists of fishermen, yachtsmen, summer people and nesting birds. Tranquil refuges from the late 20th century, often without electricity or telephones or more than a few old pickup trucks by way of land transportation, these islands, when you can reach them, are havens in which to unwind. There you pursue no more demanding activity than watching the sun set over the Camden Hills, or the fog creep in, caressing a spruce-clad headland, or lobster boats move across a placid cove at first light.
Walking; reading; bathing in the sea if you can stand it, in an abandoned quarry if you can't; meditating; cogitating; mushrooming (chanterelles and boletus are often plentiful in the fall); jigging for mackerel or other schooling fish - these are other activities of choice on a Maine island where, even as the days grow shorter, the climate stays just a little balmier than it does on the mainland, by virtue of all that hydrothermal activity around you.
The early weeks of fall, during September and well into October, are a splendid time in Maine. The tourists for the most part have gone home, and the air is clear and radiant, with a brilliance that is lacking during the more humid summer months. Be prepared for chilly nights, but days can be warm enough for light T-shirts. Always carry some kind of rain gear.
Few Maine islands are accessible by ferry, fewer still have accommodations for off-islanders to spend the night, much less get a meal. It is just as well, say many islanders, who are anxious to keep it that way. Places to stay, whether boarding houses or full-scale hotels, are hard to find. But fortunately, there are several jewels that would be delightful anywhere and are made more so by their presence on an island in Maine.
Isle au Haut (pronounced AISLE-a-hoe by islanders), has managed so far to avoid crowds, largely because the southern half of the island belongs to Acadia National Park and the Park Service is vigilant about keeping the number of visitors down. Except for five lean-tos at the park campsite at Duck Harbor, the only place to stay is the Keeper's House, a sturdy stone cottage that once housed the keeper of the Robinson Point light. In 1986, Jeff and Judy Burke bought the cottage and began restoring it as an inn. The cottage holds four large bedrooms and two baths (guests share), along with the dining room, living room and kitchen, where Judy Burke prepares generous and delicious meals. The Oil House is a separate, tiny accommodation for one or two, with its own outdoor shower and ''backhouse,'' and the advantage of even further seclusion. With the exception of the little Oil House, rooms are spacious, furnished with an airy, old-fashioned simplicity and comfort that seems both pleasant and appropriate to the setting.
Mrs. Burke's food is stylish without being mannered and as fresh as can be (salads come from an island garden, fish and shellfish as much as possible from local fishermen). No red meat is served and special diet requests are handled with grace. Guests bring their own wine; a modest selection is sold at the island's one store.
Guests usually arrive on the afternoon mail boat from Stonington, a fishing port at the southern tip of Deer Isle. The 45-minute passage out, past Crotch Island, where granite quarries flourished a hundred years ago, and through Merchant Row, a chain of exquisite, tiny islands, is a relaxing prerequisite to the total wind-down on Isle au Haut.
There is no electricity at the Keeper's House, so dinner is by candlelight and bedtime is early. This is all to the good since the main daytime occupation is walking the miles of well-maintained trails that criss-cross the island, leading to remote coves and cobblestone beaches, past ferny inland marshes, through dense forests of spruce and redolent balsam, over low island mountains (the highest is about 450 feet) and along granite ledges pounded by surf. There are deer and rabbits in abundance, along with common and rare varieties of coastal and water birds - herring and black-backed gulls, cormorants (their wings akimbo as they dry in the sun), bufflehead and elder ducks, as well as ospreys, blue herons and guillemots. The lucky may get a glimpse of a majestic bald eagle.
For a slightly more cosmopolitan environment, Islesboro, on the western shore of Penobscot Bay, three miles by car ferry from Lincolnville Beach, may be just the ticket. Island residents will be puzzled to hear tranquil Islesboro called cosmopolitan, but it has two communities, Pripet at one end and Dark Harbor at the other, and three inns, the Islesboro Inn, the Dark Harbor House and the Moss Inn, as well as half a dozen places to eat.
Dining on Islesboro ranges from the informality of Sandi's Pizza, an unmarked mobile home on the Dark Harbor road, where you can buy delicious crabmeat rolls, to the elegance and sophistication of Dark Harbor House, where a Jamaican cook, Karine Spence, prepares dishes with a Caribbean accent and inspiration. One is a dessert of meringue topped with ice cream and mango slices macerated in rum, brown sugar and fragrant Jamaican allspice. The wine list is short but well selected.
The Dark Harbor House, a refurbished 1896 summer ''cottage,'' built for a Philadelphia banker in the Georgian revival style of the period, has seven spacious, handsomely furnished rooms, all with private bath and many with added attractions - a working fireplace, a porch or a balcony. Breakfast, included in the room rate, is often served on the sun porch adjoining the dining room.
The Islesboro Inn was also built as a summer cottage, but don't be misled by the term, which in this case means a grand but comfortable 1916 mansion. It has terraced and landscaped lawns (perfect for croquet) cascading down to Gilkey Harbor, a reach of water between Islesboro and neighboring Seven Hundred Acre Island. There are 16 rooms, and those in front, looking over the lawns and Gilkey, are prized for their views and fireplaces. (Most also have private baths.) The inn has its own rowboats and a sailboat for an early morning cruise. A tennis court on the grounds and, as at the Dark Harbor House, bicycles available for a spin on the island's easy roads provide additional entertainment. Because of construction work, dinner is served on Monday night only, although the innkeeper, Kathleen Waterman, plans to have the kitchen in operation again by the summer of 1990. For now, guests are encouraged to take their meals at the Dark Harbor House or the nearby Blue Heron Restaurant.
The character of the island of North Haven, also in Penobscot Bay, is somewhere between that of Islesboro, with its long tradition as a fashionable if reclusive summer resort for wealthy Philadelphians and Bostonians, and Isle au Haut, where the atmosphere evokes the Maine coast of a century or more ago.
North Haven, 12 1/2 miles off Rockland, still has a year-round resident population based on an economy of lobstering, scallop dragging and other types of fishing. It is also still a favored summer enclave for the rusticating rich, especially the old-fashioned, discreet kind who take pleasure in being confused with the local fishermen.
The Pulpit Harbor Inn, about two miles from the ferry dock, is the only place to stay on the island, but total lack of competition does not diminish its appeal. An expanded Cape Cod-style farmhouse was turned into an inn five years ago by Christie and Barney Hallowell; a flock of seven sheep graze in a pasture that stretches almost up to the door. The six rooms are small but comfortable (two of them share a bath), and guests wander about the house like - well, like house guests (this is the kind of place where, after you've left, you feel you ought to send a bread-and-butter note). As in a private house, there are plenty of books along with sheltered corners, and there are bicycles to borrow. Best of all, there is Christie Hallowell's cooking, available at breakfast and dinner, when the inn is open to the public. (On Monday, the dining room is closed and guests go to the Coal Wharf, a restaurant near the ferry landing.) It is often possible to rent boats from the Y Knot Boatyard and it is sometimes possible to hire a captain.
Beyond boats, books and bicycles, however, North Haven, like the rest of these islands, offers little by way of excitement; the discovery of a colony of seals basking on the rocks, perhaps, or of a bald eagle or an osprey riding high on thermal currents; the fragrance of balsam, rock roses and the beach at low tide; the sight of a cluster of apricot-yellow chanterelle mushrooms hidden in a woodland grove, or the scarlet flash of swamp maples in autumn. For those who cherish a quiet, meditative sort of holiday, it will be enough.
 
Ferries, mail boats, rooms and meals
 
Getting There
Traffic on the coastal route, U.S. 1, east of Brunswick can be very heavy and slow even outside the peak travel season. Avoid it by continuing on Interstate 95 to Augusta and take either State Route 3 to Belfast or State Route 17 to Rockland.
Isle au Haut is reached by mail boat (207-367-5193) from Stonington, at the tip of Deer Isle on the east side of Penobscot Bay. The boat leaves at 4:30 P.M. (5 P.M. after Sept. 9), except Sunday and national holidays, and the fare is $7 a person each way. From Belfast, take U.S. 1 east to Orland and State Route 15 south to Stonington.
Islesboro is reached by car ferry (207-789-5611) from Lincolnville Beach. The round-trip fare is $1.75 a person round trip, $6.25 for car and driver. From Sept. 11 through Oct. 29 the ferry makes seven trips daily between Lincolnville Beach and Grindel Point on Islesboro, starting at 7:30 A.M. The last boat leaves Lincolnville at 5 P.M.; after Oct. 29, the last boat leaves at 4:30 P.M. From Belfast take U.S. 1 south to Lincolnville or from Rockland, take U.S. 1 north.
North Haven is reached by car ferry (207-596-2202) that leaves Rockland at 9:30 A.M., 1:30 and 4:20 P.M. Monday to Saturday and 9:30 A.M. and 5:45 P.M. on Sunday. The fare is $5.75 round trip; $23.50 round trip for a car and driver. Car space is not always available on every ferry trip. Check with the ferry service as to the likelihood of being able to get on a particular boat.

HEADLINE: Recollections of Learning Japanese

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; STEVE LOHR, a former correspondent in the Tokyo bureau of the Times, is now based in London.

 BODY:
DECIDING to spend a few weeks of summer vacation at a Japanese language camp in Kanazawa instead of, say, lounging and reading in Hawaii or Bali is the sort of judgment that seemingly qualifies a person for membership in Masochists Anonymous.
Still, it seemed like a reasonable thing to do in the summer of 1983, all things considered. My wife and I had been sent to Tokyo on short notice two years earlier and had been taking language lessons two mornings a week. The camp offered a chance to make some solid, intensive progress against our everyday nemesis - the Japanese language.
The Kanazawa program looked ideal. It accepted about three dozen people, all foreigners, from all sorts of countries, at every level of ability. After some cajoling to let us take the course after the date for registration had passed, my wife and I were admitted. We then headed by train to the west coast of Honshu, the main Japanese island, and to Kanazawa, known for its cultural wealth and for its heavy snowfalls. The school operates basically along the same lines today. 
If you want gourmet meals, elegant accommodations or relaxed surroundings, there are vacations I could recommend, but not the Gaikokujin eno Nihongo oyobi Nihon Bunka Koza (the Japanese Language and Cultural Program for Foreigners). That said, it turned out to be one of the most memorable vacations I've spent, more for the people and the experience than any great linguistic gains, given the difficulties of the language.
The language training was excellent, administered by local instructors with characteristic Japanese rigor. Classes were conducted in small groups, with students grouped by language proficiency. The classes lasted throughout the day, and nearly all of us spent the evenings studying the next day's lessons. Anyone unwilling to use a bit of head muscle is advised not to apply. Learning any language is essentially an exercise in brute memorization, and Japanese requires more than most. There were a few in the program who bailed out before the end.
Our group turned out to be an extraordinary and agreeable collection of people, whose motivations could scarcely have been more diverse. There was a Canadian economist in his 60's, an American actress who had married a famous Japanese musician, and a Polish emigre who learned languages as a hobby. Japanese would be his sixth, saving the linguistic Everest for late in the game, I reckoned. Canada had also contributed a young Japanese-language scholar and his wife; he had lived in Japan for a couple of years on a fellowship from the Education Ministry and was fluent.
Two Hong Kong university students stuck together. A young West German banker looked like a slim-line version of Boris Becker; he was fond of his motorcycle, which he had brought along, and increasingly fond of a blond Dutchwoman, also a student, who was often sighted on the back of the bike in the waning days of the program. There was a 17-year-old from New Zealand who was half Japanese; he couldn't stand the food. And there was a woman from Phoenix in her late 60's who spoke not a word of Japanese when she arrived.
The program has been fine-tuned since we were there, making it less like boot-camp, but during our year 10 days of the program were spent in a Buddhist monastery in the countryside outside Kanazawa. The monastery stay has since been discontinued. The men all slept on the tatami-matted floor of one room, while the women slept in a similar big room nearby. The food tended toward dried fish-and-rice bentos, or boxed meals. During that period the German banker's motorcycle was often heard roaring off in the night, speeding off to pick up something to eat at the nearest fast-food place.
For my money - precious litle of it, since the program is a subsidized bargain - one highpoint was staying in Japanese homes for a few days, which we did at the end of the program. My wife and I stayed at two homes, for a few days each.
One was the home of a Japanese farm family outside town, reasonably well off. I couldn't help but notice that the television always seemed to be on and the son in second grade ate a breakfast of soft drinks and buns before heading for the school bus.
The second family we stayed with, in Kanazawa, also had a son in the second grade. His father and grandfather were both wealthy dentists. A gardener trimmed the shrubs in the backyard and a Mercedes-Benz sedan stood in the driveway. The little boy's bedroom was filled with books. If he was allowed any soft drinks it was certainly not for breakfast. Japan is probably as egalitarian a society as any - a fact the Japanese often point out to foreigners with pride. Still it was clear that the dentist's son had a huge head start in many ways over the farmer's son. It provided a little glimpse of the Japanese class system, an indication that perhaps Japan isn't so different after all.
Perhaps the most amusing and ultimately rewarding evening was spent at a festival celebration in a farm town. We all dressed up in yukatas, which are glorified cotton bathrobes, and tried some folk dancing with the local people at the community hall. It seemed to be a Japanese version of square dancing.
The kids would come over in between dances and stare, mouths agape, at the foreigners. There is no real way to convey to the citizens of a diverse society, particularly Americans, just how homogeneous Japan is. Any foreign traveler, especially a tall fair-haired one who ventures outside Japan's major cities knows the feeling. And the children, as always, are the most honest about it; you might as well be a Martian. Some foreigners dislike this about Japan, but I've always found it oddly satisfying. My mere presence provided education for the youth of Japan.
The kids at the festival wanted to stare from close up, but they also wanted a bit more as well. The yukatas covered one up, but left an opening across the chest for the adventurous. Under the guise of coming over to talk to me, those with real chutzpah would creep closer and gingerly pat my chest hair, turn to their pals and titter maniacally. It was like being an animal in a petting zoo. Those familiar with Japanese literature of the early Meiji period, when Japan was forcibly opened to the West and ''hairy barbarian'' was a synonym for foreigner, might have found the experience insulting, but I figured it was harmless. Besides, there was a payoff for me as well. Most of the uninhibited youngsters were aged 6, 7 and 8 or thereabouts. I had finally found a group of Japanese for whom my level of language competence was just about adequate.
 
Classes for foreigners in Kanazawa
 
A Major Center
Kanazawa is becoming something of a center for the study of Japanese by foreigners. One group, the Society to Introduce Kanazawa to the World, offers a full range of language and cultural classes. Another group, the Zurich-based Eurozentrum, is organizing a program that will begin Oct. 16.
 
Schedule and Tuition
The Society to Introduce Kanazawa to the World offers summer seminars and individual classes the rest of the year. The seminars, held each July and August, are limited to 40 students, with classes made up of four or five students. Summer classes are held three hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Students are introduced to aspects of Japanese culture, including the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, Japanese dance, Noh plays and Aikido, a martial art.
An excursion is also part of each summer seminar. This year students were taken on an overnight trip to a mountain village and to local festivals.
Seminars are less expensive than individual sessions, because the summer programs are subsidized by the Ishikawa Prefecture. Cost of the summer courses, including tuition and accommodations at a Japanese-style inn or Western-style hotel, is $929, calculated at a rate of 140 yen to the dollar. Meals are extra. The rates at other times of the year for an individual student sent by a business organization are $17.85 an hour plus $35.70 a day for accommodation in an inn or hotel or $28.50 a day at a private home with two meals. Rates for a private student at other times of the year are $10.70 an hour for tuition and $28.50 a day for accommodation in a hotel or inn and $21.40 at a private home with two meals.
More information: The Society to Introduce Kanazawa to the World, 2-15 Hondamachi 3-chome, Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture 920, Japan; telephone 0762-22-7332.
The National Registration Center for Study Abroad is accepting preliminary registration for a course in Kanazawa organized by Eurozentrum. The three-week course will cost $1,722, including tuition and accommodations, usually with local families. Air fares are extra.

HEADLINE: MISUSE OF THE I.R.S.: THE ABUSE OF POWER

BYLINE: By David Burnham; David Burnham is a former New York Times reporter. This article is adapted from his book ''The I.R.S.: A Law Unto Itself,'' to be published next January by Random House. Copyright c 1989 by David Burnham.

 BODY:
PETER K. BROS - CHIEF OF THE RULINGS section No. 2, exempt organization technical branch of the Internal Revenue Service, in Washington - was responding to an application for tax-exempt status. Some months earlier, the Minnesota Association for the Improvement of Science Education had applied for such status, including in its statement of purpose the desire to encourage the continued ''teaching of evolution in the public schools as the only recognized scientific theory of the origin of life on earth.''
In his Oct. 23, 1981, letter, Bros seemed personally affronted by the request. ''When you advocate that 'evolution' should be taught in the schools, state specifically what you mean by 'evolution' or what 'theory of evolution' should be taught,'' Bros wrote. ''What gives you the standing or the prerogative to deem certain version[s] of the origin of life on earth as pseudo-scientific? Why are you opposed to permitting the granting of equal time in school curricula to the teaching of the theory of creationism?''
Sister Lucy Knoll, a science teacher in the Roman Catholic school system of Minneapolis who was also the association's secretary, understood the power of the I.R.S. and its individual bureaucrats. Within two weeks, she dispatched a low-keyed, six-page response to Bros's questions. 
''The pseudo-scientific versions of the origin of life on earth,'' she in-formed the tax man, ''are those that are derived from other than scientific data. Pseudo-scientific versions are put forward by numerous groups in our society, especially by religious fundamentalists whose views of what the Bible teaches are contrary to those of modern science.''
Sister Knoll's formal response to Bros was dispassionate. But the complaint she wrote to Roscoe L. Egger Jr., I.R.S. Commissioner during most of the Reagan Administration, had a different tone. ''The letter from Mr. Bros is partisan in the extreme and expresses his hostility toward the scientific view of the origin of life on earth,'' she informed Egger. ''The questions he asks are those one might expect from a totalitarian regime.''
Sister Knoll demanded the association's request for tax exemption be assigned to another official. She and the association's board members also shot off angry letters to their Congressmen, who contacted the I.R.S. A few months later, the association was granted tax-exempt status.
In the grand tradition of great bureaucracies, the I.R.S. blandly insisted that it had all been a misunderstanding. Bros's original response, the agency said, was merely intended to make sure that the association was presenting a ''full and fair exposition of the facts'' of the case.
Although Sister Knoll and her colleagues won, in many cases the personal views of I.R.S. officials have determined how the tax agency interpreted tax laws. The result: The I.R.S., which regularly intrudes on the lives of more Americans than any other Federal agency, has arguably become the single most powerful instrument of social control in the United States, deciding on a wide range of matters that are far removed from the collection of taxes.
The power of the I.R.S. is based on a number of factors: O Size. With 123,000 employees, the I.R.S. is the largest Federal law-enforcement agency. It is generally acknowledged as the greatest tax-collection system in the world, bringing to the United States Treasury an annual $1 trillion from 200 million taxpayers. O Information. It is a truism that the institution with the most information usually has the most power, and the I.R.S. has a computerized national data base unmatched by any other Federal agency. Today, with the help of high-speed computers, information presented by taxpayers on their income tax returns is compared with the billions of bits of data given the I.R.S. by the nation's employers, banks, corporations, universities, car dealers, state tax agencies, real-estate agents and other assorted record keepers. To collect the information it deems necessary, the I.R.S. has the power to order - without a warrant - banks, employers and other institutions to provide data about a taxpayer. (All other Federal, state and local police forces are required to obtain a warrant to get such information.) O Legal authority. One unique I.R.S. weapon is its independent authority to impose civil penalties. If a taxpayer feels the penalty is not justified, he can challenge it, but because of the special nature of civil tax law, the legal burden of proving his innocence almost always rests with him. This contrasts with criminal cases, in which the burden of proving the suspect's guilt rests with the government. The I.R.S. can grant or refuse tax-exempt status to various kinds of educational and charitable organizations, which means the agency's decisions can affect a broad range of social activities, including the practice of religion, the role of private schools, the availability of birth-control counseling, and the right of various groups to present their sometimes unpopular views.
Furthermore, the I.R.S. is empowered to make a ''jeopardy assessment'' - that is, without prior approval of a judge, to seize the assets of any taxpayer who, it believes, might be contemplating flight. In fact, a Federal law makes it extremely difficult for Federal judges to enjoin the agency from making such a seizure. O Complexity and ambiguity of tax laws. The Revenue Code of the United States, the law that is passed by Congress, is printed on some 2,200 pages. The I.R.S. regulations interpreting the law require an additional 7,600 pages.
Last year, Money magazine asked 50 tax preparers to complete the tax return of a hypothetical couple with three children who earned a combined salary of $100,000. The make-believe family's investments included stocks, mutual funds and corporate and municipal bonds, as well as a second home that was occasionally rented out.
The 50 tax pros came up with 50 different tax bills. When the magazine conducted the same survey with 50 other tax preparers this year, the confusion was even greater.
The confusion extends to I.R.S. agents as well. A 1987 study - conducted by the I.R.S. and the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress - of nearly 1,000 I.R.S. employees assigned to answer taxpayer questions, found that more than one-third of the answers were incorrect or incomplete.
The result is a Kafkaesque world in which neither the enforcers nor the citizens understand the law. This gives I.R.S. agents a free hand to pick and choose their targets. O Nothing must stop the collection of taxes. Federal cash payments - to the nation's highway builders, welfare and Social Security recipients, defense contractors, and public and private institutions that provide an assortment of services vital to the well-being of American citizens - are the lifeblood of Congressional politics. To guarantee their re-election, incumbent members of Congress must deliver the goods to their constituents, but Congress cannot give away money unless the Treasury is continually replenished.
This political imperative of not messing with the I.R.S. comes close to being a law of nature almost as unbending as the force of gravity. The I.R.S. is, therefore, rarely examined by Congress, which has the major responsibility of insuring that the agency is working fairly and effectively.
Throughout the history of the tax agency (which began as a continuing organization during the Civil War), very few commissioners - who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate - remained in office long enough to understand and lead the agency. This prevented the tax agency from becoming the personal kingdom of one man, but it also meant that only a few commissioners gained sufficient knowledge of the agency to be fairly held accountable for either its successes or(Continued on Page 50) its failures. The rapid turnover at the top has guaranteed that the agency is run by a small cadre of senior civil servants who have spent their entire careers slowly inching up the promotion ladder. Not surprisingly, most of them are cautious men who have adopted the I.R.S.'s generally conservative view of the world.
Largely left to their own devices, I.R.S. agents have, on many occasions, abused their authority for private or political ends. This summer, a House subcommittee disclosed that some high officials at the Internal Revenue Service had, from the early 1980's through last year, engaged in questionable and unethical practices. Furthermore, said the House panel, the tax agency's anticorruption unit had lost a great deal of its effectiveness.
Abusive and arbitrary acts by I.R.S. agents are nothing new, and charges of corruption among agents in such cities as Los Angeles, Cleveland, New York and Chicago have been regularly investigated. But more serious, perhaps, than such corruption (given the agency's size, most employees appear to be doing an honorable job) is the misuse of the agency when it comes to political or ideological issues. The history of the I.R.S. is riddled with repeated instances of agents acting out of self-interest or pursuing their own ideological agenda, as well as examples of Presidents, White House staff and Cabinet officials pressuring the tax agency to take political actions.
O CCASIONALLY, THE actions that the I.R.S. fails to take have as much significance as those it takes. In 1981, an umbrella group of organizations favoring abortion rights filed a Federal suit against the Roman Catholic Church, the I.R.S. and the agency's boss, the Treasury Secretary. The suit accused the church of using tax-exempt contributions for improper political purposes. It also charged that the I.R.S. and the Treasury Secretary had ''consistently overlooked these violations and failed and refused to perform their statutory duty to enforce the [Tax] Code and the Constitution.''
As one instance of what it viewed as a violation of the church's tax-exempt status, the abortion-rights group cited ''A Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities'' that the United States Catholic Conference and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops had adopted in 1975. One section of this plan called for the creation of Congressional pro-life action groups that would ''work for qualified candidates who will vote for a constitutional amendment and other pro-life issues.''
By failing to withdraw the church's tax-exempt status because of these activities, the pro-choice group contended, the I.R.S. in effect provided the church with a substantial illegal subsidy for its political campaigns.
The I.R.S. has yet to take any public action against the Catholic Church, and the suit is still pending in Federal court. For the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration, say its critics, the inaction of the I.R.S. strengthened the hand of the Administration's strongest political ally on the abortion issue.
Over the years, the actions the I.R.S. has taken against ''unpopular'' groups and movements have assumed various forms. The agency has brought tax-evasion charges, taken away or denied tax-exempt status, or resorted to the annual audit. Often, the targeted organizations will exhaust themselves mentally and financially defending against these actions.
For many years, civil rights activities were a major agency concern. In 1954, the liberal Mississippi publisher Hodding Carter took the then-daring step for a Southern newspaper of endorsing the Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision. Almost immediately, Carter's newspaper, The Delta Democrat-Times, became the subject of a long series of annual I.R.S. audits. Like many who are selected for intense I.R.S. attention, the Carter family has never been able to uncover documents that would support their belief that the audits were politically motivated.
The Carters were not the only I.R.S. targets as the South moved into this difficult period of social change. In the late 1950's, the I.R.S. began auditing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Years later, several of his lawyers and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference were audited as well. After the auditors raised questions about some deductions he was unable to document, King settled, paying the I.R.S. $500 in back taxes. He settled as well with the state of Alabama, which had also brought civil tax charges against him.
Then Alabama had second thoughts. King became the first person ever prosecuted by the state on criminal tax charges. The civil rights leader and his lawyers were forced to expend a great deal of time and money on refuting those charges. Just before the case went to trial, King's lawyers discovered that he had kept a personal diary that had detailed contemporaneous notes disproving the charges. The notes were so persuasive, in fact, that on May 28, 1960, an Alabama jury defied the prejudices of those times and acquited King.
O N MANY OCCA-sions, the pressure to use the agency as an instrument to curb dissent came from the White House. John F. Kennedy mobilized the I.R.S. against the right-wing, fundamentalist Christian ministers who had been so critical of his religion during his Presidential campaign and his first months in office.
The first warning was in a speech by Kennedy on Nov. 18, 1961. The subject: the cold war. The President called on the nation to ignore the voices of fear and suspicion: ''Let our patriotism be reflected in the creation of confidence in one another, rather than crusades of suspicion.''
A week later, the President suggested how this new enemy should be dealt with. At a news conference, a reporter sought his views on the legality of campaign contributions supporting ''right-wing extremist groups.''
''As long as they meet the requirements of the tax law,'' Kennedy responded, ''I don't think that the Federal Government can interfere or should interfere with the right of any individual to take any position he wants. The only thing we should be concerned about is that it does not represent a diversion of funds which might be taxable to - for nontaxable purposes. But that is another question, and I am sure the Internal Revenue system examines that.''
Several days later, the tax agency began an audit of 22 ''extremist organizations.'' Subsequently, several of the targeted groups lost their tax-exempt status.
During the Johnson and Nixon Administrations, the focus of the I.R.S.'s effort at political control was individuals and organizations demonstrating for civil rights and against the American presence in Vietnam. (Publicly, Lyndon B. Johnson worked hard for welfare legislation and signed the 1964 civil rights bill.) On June 16, 1969, Randolph W. Thrower, I.R.S. Commissioner during the Nixon Administration, wrote a memorandum for the record about a meeting he had had that day with Arthur F. Burns, then counselor to the President. According to Thrower, Burns said that Richard M. Nixon was concerned ''over the fact that tax-exempt funds may be supporting activist groups engaged in stimulating riots both on the campus and within our inner cities.''
In late July, Donald Bacon, assistant commissioner for compliance, sent the other I.R.S. assistant commissioners and the agency's chief counsel a confidential statement about the formation of a group to coordinate all I.R.S. monitoring of ''ideological, militant, subversive, radical and similar type organizations.'' This unit was soon officially named the Special Service Staff (S.S.S.).
I.R.S. opposition extended as well to a handful of lawyers who sought to use the Federal courts as a forum where important questions of social equity could be decided. The I.R.S. was initially baffled by these groups, which challenged the performance of both business and government regulatory agencies. Some requests for tax-exempt status were stalled, some were granted and others were denied.
One such public-interest group was the Project on Corporate Responsibility, which first filed its application for tax-exempt status on Sept. 3, 1970. Over the next two years, the I.R.S. asked time and again for additional information, and lawyers for the project kept asking the I.R.S. for a decision. Finally, on May 2, 1973, the group filed a suit asking a Federal court to order the I.R.S. to rule one way or the other. Two weeks later, the project was denied tax-exempt status.
The lead lawyer for the group - now the Center on Corporate Responsibility -was Thomas A. Troyer. With court approval, Troyer began discovery proceedings in the files of the I.R.S. and the White House. He soon found clear indications of political intervention. The center's application had, in fact, been approved within the I.R.S. That decision was reversed, however, after it was referred to Roger V. Barth, a former Nixon operative who had recently been appointed the tax agency's assistant to the Commissioner.
On Dec. 12, 1973, Federal Judge Charles R. Richey handed down his decision, one of the rare instances the agency has been formally reprimanded for engaging in political manipulations.
''A showing of political influence renders the Service's ruling null and void,'' Judge Richey wrote. ''It is outside the law. The court is concerned not only with direct political intervention, but also with the creation of a political atmosphere generated by the White House in the Internal Revenue Service which may have affected the objectivity of those participating in the ruling in the plaintiff's case.''
The following year, the group won tax-exempt status.
A LTHOUGH NIXON WAS notorious for treating the I.R.S. as though it were his private domain, the records show that Franklin Delano Roosevelt may have set the stage for the use of the tax agency for political purposes by most subsequent Presidents.
One of the most brazen instances of a political vendetta during a Presidency was the Roosevelt Administration's attack on Andrew Mellon. No historian has been able to determine why Mellon so enraged F.D.R., but there is speculation that the New Deal President saw the millionaire who served as Republican Treasury Secretary from 1921 to 1932 - a time of Wall Street excesses followed by the Great Depression - as the symbolic enemy. Nor has a document emerged that directly links Roosevelt to the decision to go after Mellon.
Elmer L. Irey, head of the criminal division of the Treasury's tax enforcement branch in Washington from 1919 to 1946, acknowledged in his 1948 autobiography that Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. ordered him to develop tax charges against Mellon even though he, Irey, knew that the former Treasury Secretary was innocent.
A Justice Department memo written about the case in early 1934 shared Irey's sentiment: the charges against Mellon were either invalid or could not be proved. Nonetheless, on March 11, 1934, the Roosevelt Administration announced it would seek criminal tax-evasion charges against Mellon. According to the Justice Department, he owed the Government additional taxes for 1931 of about $1.3 million, plus a 50 percent fraud penalty. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, as the tax agency was then known, subsequently upped Mellon's alleged tax debt to more than $3 million.
The Roosevelt Administration then suffered one rebuff after another. In Pittsburgh, Mellon's hometown, a Federal grand jury (comprising five laborers, two mechanics, two farmers, two clerks, two engineers, a carpenter, plumber, writer, lumber dealer and one banker) refused to indict Mellon on any charge.
The case moved to a new battleground - the Board of Tax Appeals, in Washington. At the time, the tax board, theoretically an independent agency, was housed within the executive branch, and board members tended to side with the Government. But after weeks of hearings and after reading voluminous legal briefs, the board on Dec. 7, 1937, issued a ruling that rejected the most significant aspects of the charges. Mellon was found to owe $485,809 - about one-sixth of the tax agency's claim - but the board dismissed all the criminal and civil fraud penalties.
On another occasion, President Roosevelt himself, using his influence over the tax agency, came to the aid of a favored member of the Democratic Party.
In July 1942, the tax agency began a routine examination of the books of Brown & Root, a Texas defense contractor. What had caught the attention of the local agents were some company ''bonuses'' and ''attorney's fees'' that the recipients were hard-pressed to explain. The year before, Lyndon Baines Johnson, an ambitious young Texas Congressman with close ties to the company, had run for the Senate. I.R.S. auditors had an informed hunch that the bonuses and fees, which the company had deducted as business expenses, were actually campaign contributions, which, of course, were not deductible.
The agent in charge of the investigation was Elmer C. Werner. During the next 18 months, Johnson and his allies made repeated efforts to persuade the White House to order the I.R.S. to drop the inquiry. Johnson convinced James H. Rowe Jr., then a White House staff member, that the investigation had been inspired by enemies of the New Deal in Texas. Rowe sent Roosevelt a memo urging that the investigation be halted.
For a while, I.R.S. investigators refused to be deflected. By January 1944, Werner and his colleagues calculated that Brown & Root owed more than $1 million in back taxes, plus a 50 percent fraud penalty.
On Jan. 13, 1944, Johnson met with Roosevelt in the White House. A few hours later, Elmer Irey, Werner's boss, telephoned the investigating agent in Texas. Irey said he had just been ordered to brief the President on the Brown & Root inquiry the next morning. Irey asked Werner to send him ''detailed information on political payments made by Brown & Root Inc. to the Lyndon Johnson 1941 Senatorial campaign.''
Three days after Irey's meeting with Roosevelt, an I.R.S. agent dispatched from Atlanta to look over Werner's material found the evidence insufficient for criminal prosecution. All Brown & Root was re-(Continued on Page 58) quired to do was pay $372,000 in back taxes in a civil proceeding that, by law, was confidential.
Johnson, with the President's help, had avoided a public scandal that almost certainly would have ended his political career.
F EW CONGRESSMEN doubt the I.R.S. will strike back if sufficiently provoked. The fear of the tax agency is so great that many would prefer to give it a wide berth. Among the cases in which the I.R.S. used its power to squelch or threaten its Congressional critics are two in which information leaked by the I.R.S. short-circuited the careers of Senators heading committees that had dared to criticize the agency.
On Aug. 6, 1968, William Lambert, an associate editor of Life magazine and an investigative reporter, received a phone call from Sheldon S. Cohen, then I.R.S. Commissioner. Lambert remembers that Cohen was ecstatic. ''He just wanted to offer me the I.R.S.'s congratulations.''
The occasion of the call, says Lambert, was the defeat in a Democratic primary of Senator Edward V. Long, a noisy and difficult critic of the I.R.S. It was an article written by Lambert linking the Missouri Senator to the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James R. Hoffa, that had led to Long's defeat.
Long, a wealthy banker and lawyer, had been Missouri's Lieutenant Governor when he was appointed United States Senator on Sept. 23, 1960, after the death of the incumbent Thomas Hennings. Three years later, Long was named chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, a post his predecessor had held.
The broad mandate of the subcommittee allowed it to investigate almost any subject. Long and the subcommittee's chief counsel, Bernard Fensterwald Jr., decided to hold hearings on how several Federal enforcement agencies were improperly invading the privacy of American citizens.
Long's hearings during the mid- to late 1960's on the improper use of wiretaps and bugging devices by some agencies, including the I.R.S., were given considerable coverage in the press. In February 1967, Long published ''The Intruders,'' a book that described how Federal agents had been routinely ignoring Government rules in their secret surveillance.
I.R.S. and Justice Department bureaucrats involved in ordering the buggings were outraged by Long's hearings. Although most of the improper surveillance had taken place during the Kennedy Administration, it fell upon Sheldon Cohen, appointed Commissioner by President Johnson, to defend the I.R.S.
In late 1966, according to Lambert, an official in the Justice Department who worked closely with the I.R.S. and who was an old friend, provided him with a juicy lead about Long. The official told Lambert he should investigate the connections between Long and Jimmy Hoffa. The link, the informant said, was Morris A. Shenker, a well-known Missouri criminal lawyer with ties to the teamsters' union.
''I went to St. Louis, met Shenker and did a lot of other reporting,'' Lambert recalls. ''Then I came back to Washington and began pumping people I knew in the Justice Department.'' That was when Lambert was given the final tip that quickly led to the publication of his story: during 1963-64, Shenker had paid Long a $48,000 fee (the circumstances of this payment was to become a subject of controversy).
Lambert says that, although this second bit of information also came from ''someone in Justice,'' the original source had to be the I.R.S. Lambert was confident of his source because the tax agency and Justice Department were then conducting a joint investigation of the teamsters. He emphasizes, (Continued on Page 61) however, that he was not actually shown a copy of the tax returns of either Long or Shenker. (There was one later case, says Lambert, when the I.R.S. actually provided him with the tax return of a member of the House.) Lambert's article ran in the May 26, 1967, issue of Life. There were several charges: Senator Long was strongly influenced to take up the investigation of Federal snooping by his friends in the teamsters' union. His hearings on the I.R.S.'s improper wiretapping had blunted the Government's war against organized crime. He could have accepted an illegal payoff.
Long denied any impropriety. He said that Morris Shenker was a distinguished Missouri criminal lawyer with many clients, that the $48,000 payment was a legal finder's fee, and that the I.R.S. had previously not found fault with it. The Senator also noted that innuendos were raised about his business and legal associations only after he had exposed unlawful activities on the part of Government agencies.
The Senate's Select Committee on Standards and Conduct investigated Lambert's charges against Long and found no impropriety. Long had been an open booster of Hoffa, whom he once described as a dynamic and fighting union president, a man he was proud to support. And though Morris Shenker did have close connections with the teamsters' union, he was also a longtime political figure in the state's Democratic Party.
The Life magazine article, however, had a devastating effect on Long's career. Fifteen months after its publication, an ambitious young politician named Thomas Eagleton defeated Long in the 1968 Democratic primary and went on to win the general election. Long retired to his 1,600-acre farm and died in 1972.
Another Senator who incurred the wrath of the I.R.S. was Joseph M. Montoya, the amiable old-line Democratic politician who had begun his career as a state legislator in the 1930's. In December 1972, the director of the I.R.S. district in New Mexico began a search of the agency's files for information about him.
The search was begun shortly after Montoya, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that approved I.R.S.'s funds, announced that he planned to hold hearings on the agency's performance.
For an agency that had largely escaped regular Congressional oversight, Montoya's announced plan may well have sounded like an open declaration of war. And it was, in fact, one of the most difficult moments in the history of the I.R.S. The Montoya subcommittee had lined up a number of powerful witnesses who were prepared to present evidence that the agency managers were inept. In addition, the first stories about how the Nixon Administration had misused the I.R.S. were beginning to surface.
By the time the Montoya hearings got under way in Washington, in February 1973, the I.R.S. investigation of the Senator was rolling along. At one point, Donald C. Alexander, the new I.R.S. Commissioner, was reported by the Southwest regional commissioner as being delighted by the search of the agency files on Montoya. In the summer of 1973, however, Alexander ordered the Southwest regional commissioner to drop the investigation.
In October 1975, The Washington Post ran a front-page story by its investigative reporter Bob Woodward, in which several officials of the I.R.S. accused Alexander of improperly halting the investigation. The article quoted agency officials as saying they believed Alexander had halted the audit of Montoya because of the Senator's influence over the I.R.S.
Woodward reported the story had been leaked by I.R.S. agents. To this day, it is unclear whether the target was Alexander or Montoya or both. Alexander himself says a key motive was the hostility some I.R.S. supervisors in the Southwest felt toward the Senator, a leading Hispanic politician. (Because of the high sensitivity of the late Nixon years to all questions of secret deals, and because Montoya had been a member of the Senate Watergate committee, Alexander's decision was then examined by both the Treasury and the Justice Departments. The verdict: Alexander had violated no laws, but his handling of the case left much to be desired.) In a speech on the Senate floor on Nov. 20, 1975, Montoya insisted that his hearings on the I.R.S. were fair. ''I do not consider myself to be an enemy of the I.R.S. and I do not believe that the subcommittee has given any I.R.S. employee reason to be fearful of our power.'' But some I.R.S. employees were fearful, he suggested, and it appeared that they had decided to strike.
Although Woodward's story had noted that there was no evidence that Montoya had illegally evaded taxes or was aware of or sought special treatment from the I.R.S., the mere existence of a preliminary tax investigation was politically damaging. One year later, Harrison H. Schmitt, a conservative Republican and former astronaut, unseated the two-term Senator.
Since Montoya's departure from Washington, the Senate appropriations subcommittee has not held extensive oversight hearings on the tax agency.
A T THIS SUMMER'S House hearings on corruption within the I.R.S., the former head of the agency's criminal investigations division in Los Angeles was, among other charges, accused of harassing a blue-jeans company at the instigation of a rival that had offered him a job; a Washington official was cited for routing many of his trips through Atlanta to visit a girlfriend; a Chicago supervisor was charged with accepting gratuities from a delinquent taxpayer.
Two years ago, a study of I.R.S. managers by the agency itself found that they saw organizational policy as ''too authoritarian . . . too conservative and too demanding of conformity.'' As for taxpayers, a 1987 Louis Harris and Associates survey for the I.R.S. showed that about one out of five Americans viewed I.R.S. employees as dishonest or not knowledgeable.
On July 5, Fred T. Goldberg Jr., a tax lawyer, became the new Commissioner of the I.R.S. Whether he can successfully build on the work of his 41 predecessors remains to be seen. But he and Congress could do much worse than to carry out the suggestions of the great 18th-century economist Adam Smith.
''The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain, and not arbitrary,'' he wrote. ''The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every other person, so that the tax payer is not put in the power of the tax gatherer.''

HEADLINE: WHAT A CHILD IS GIVEN

BYLINE: By Deborah Franklin; Deborah Franklin, who lives in San Francisco, is a staff writer at Hippocrates magazine.

 BODY:
ON THE AUGUST MORNING IN 1971 when Marietta Spencer first met the birth family of her adopted son, Paul, she was prepared to be nervous. In the four years that she had worked as a social worker for the Children's Home Society of Minnesota, in St. Paul, Spencer had arranged and guided many such meetings. She had seen firsthand the fears and confusion stirred up when strangers, joined at the heart by adoption, examine the potent ties among them. But what Spencer wasn't prepared for, as she and Paul and the rest of the family spent a day swapping stories with a score of her son's birth relatives in their home in northern Germany, was how familiar all these strangers would seem.
It was more than physical appearance, she decided, though Paul's tall, slight build, blue eyes and narrow smile were echoed throughout the birth family, who had not seen the boy since they had arranged for his adoption 17 years earlier. It had more to do with the way one of the birth mother's brothers tossed a pillow up atop a bookcase to punctuate a joke, and with the jokes themselves - no slapstick here, only very dry, occasional one-liners. The conversational tone was familiar, too - mostly quiet and spare of excess emotion. 
Like Paul, a gifted pianist, they reserved their passion for music; three of the birth mother's brothers had played for years in the local orchestra. In this German family of the woman who had died soon after giving birth to Paul, Spencer saw striking reflections of her son's personality.
''I felt such a tremendous sense of relief, as I realized, of course, this is Paul, here are the roots of who he is,'' she recalls.
For Paul, the encounter sparked a friendship that he pursued, returning again to visit the family on his own. For Spencer, it hammered home a lesson that scientific studies of the last 20 years have validated: A newborn child is not a formless bit of clay waiting to be shaped by parents or anybody else.
Rather, the core of many behaviors and most personality traits - the determinants of whether we're shy or extroverted, even the kinds of jokes we find funny and the kinds of people we like -seem largely embedded in the coils of chromosomes that our parents pass to us at conception. The question today is no longer whether genetics influence personality, but rather how much, and in what ways?
The answers, emerging in the last few years primarily from long-term studies of twins and adopted children, bring increasing clarity to the nature/nurture debate: While environmental forces can help shape temperament, it is apparently equally true that genes can dictate an individual's response to those environmental forces.
The cumulative evidence also suggests that it's not full-blown personality traits that are inherited, but rather predilections. And, in an interesting turnabout, that information has already begun to change the process of adoption itself. At many adoption agencies, a child is no longer passed from one family to another like a closely held secret. Instead, birth parents fill out lengthy questionnaires that probe not only their medical histories, but also their interests, talents and goals; that information is presented to the adoptive parents as a part of the child's birthright. Spencer is unsentimental about the value of this information. ''A genetic history - psychological as well as medical - is something like a child's washing instructions,'' she says. ''When you buy a sweater, you want to know all about its fabric content. How much more important is it to know everything you can about the care and feeding of the child you are about to nurture?''
Not long ago, such views were scandalous. James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded a 1962 Nobel Prize for puzzling out the structure of the human genetic code, and the medical discoveries that their work has spawned - genetic clues to Tay-Sachs disease, sickle-cell anemia and hemophilia, for example -have been universally heralded. But the notion that psychological traits and behavioral disorders may also be genetically rooted has had more difficulty escaping the pall of Nazi experiments in eugenics during World War II.
Irving Gottesman, a psychologist at the University of Virginia, has studied genetic influences in intelligence, criminality and mental illness for 30 years and has some chilling memories. ''At one point, I was invited to speak at the University of Texas,'' he says.
''When I arrived, there were flyers all over campus with the title of my talk and a large swastika, implying that my work was somehow fascist.''
Gottesman, who is Jewish and lost several members of his family in the Holocaust, was both unnerved and outraged.
''That was the moment I first realized that it's important to say not only what I believe but what I don't believe,'' he says, ''and to explain not only what the results of my studies mean, but also what they don't mean.''
Many political activists of the 1960's and 70's, wary that genetic theories might ultimately be used to justify social inequality, attacked anyone who suggested that it wasn't within the DNA of each person to be a mathematical genius, a concert pianist or a gifted statesman.
''Potential'' was the buzzword; any mention of limits was deemed reactionary. It was all right to talk to your veterinarian about a sweet-tempered pup, but heaven forbid you should suggest that your child had an inherent nature. Still, even then, in a few psychology departments scattered around the world, researchers were stubbornly chipping away at the idea that every aspect of personality is learned.
It is within the family that the alchemy of nurture and nature works its strongest magic, and it is by studying families - of twins and adopted children - that behavioral geneticists have best succeeded in untangling those forces. Thomas J. Bouchard at the University of Minnesota heads one of the most dramatic of such studies.
Since 1979, Bouchard has specialized in the examination of adult identical and fraternal twins who were separated soon after their birth and reared in separate families, separate worlds. To date, he has found about 100 twin pairs - 60 of them identical - and has brought each to his laboratory for a week of tests.
These days, when newspapers carry stories every other week of scientists closing in on the gene that causes one or another illness, such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease, it is tempting to think 41,0, 29,6.6,12,0,12,6.6>of all genetic research in terms of test tubes and bits of chopped-up DNA. But those aren't a behavioral geneticist's tools. Bouchard does take many physical measurements - of heart rhythms, brain-wave patterns and motor skills, for example - but most of his tests are done with pencil and paper.
He finds that identical twins reared in completely different families and communities answer the 15,000 questions he asks in remarkably similar ways. In fact, in questions that reveal traits as diverse as leadership ability, traditionalism or irritability, for example, they respond just as identical twins would who grew up in the same family. When measuring traditionalism - a composite trait that includes showing respect for authority, endorsing strict child-rearing practices and valuing the esteem of the community - the similarities between twins reared in different families were striking.
What elevates these findings above the level of what Mark Twain, borrowing from Disraeli, disparaged as ''lies, damned lies, and statistics,'' is that these are very well-controlled statistics. By focusing on identical twins reared apart, Bouchard has found individuals who have all of their genes - and perhaps only their genes - in common. The clincher is that he and his colleagues run the same battery of tests on three other types of twins: identical pairs raised in the same families, fraternal twins reared together and fraternal twins reared apart.
Remember that identical twins arise from the fertilization of a single egg that splits in half shortly after conception, while fraternal twins are the product of two fertilized eggs. Identical twins have in common all their genes; fraternal twins, on average, half. By comparing the degree of similarity among twins in each of these four categories, Bouchard is able to look trait by trait and see how much each is influenced by genetics. In measuring I.Q., for example, Bouchard found that identical twins reared apart were more similar than fraternal twins reared together.
Internationally, there are two other major, ongoing studies of identical twins reared apart - one in Sweden, the other in Finland - encompassing more than 7,000 pairs of twins all told. Together with earlier, smaller studies, this research has allowed behavioral geneticists to begin to speak confidently about the influence of genes on a number of human characteristics.
Though the debate over the value of intelligence quotient tests continues, for example, there is ample evidence that whatever it is they measure is in large part inherited. Studies of some 100,000 children and adults internationally suggest that genes are 50 percent to 70 percent responsible for an individual's I.Q. ''That's not to say that you can't reduce anybody's I.Q. to zero if you hit them over the head hard enough,'' says John C. Loehlin, a behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas at Austin. Physical or psychological abuse, malnutrition or even a lack of intellectual stimulation can act as environmental bludgeons to native intelligence. However, Loehlin adds, ''The idea that, if raised in the same environment, we would all have the same I.Q. has pretty much been laid to rest.''
The findings are trickiest to understand where what we call personality is concerned. Research of the last decade shows that genetics are as influential as environment on characteristics as varied as extraversion, motivation for achievement, leadership, conscientiousness and conservatism. But whether some traits are more genetically controlled than others is much harder to tease apart. Like Bouchard and others, Robert Plomin, a developmental psychologist at Pennsylvania State University, is trying to do just that in a study of nearly 700 pairs of Swedish twins.
''The interesting question today,'' says Plomin, ''is, 'Are there any traits that aren't significantly affected by genetics?' '' He thinks he has found one: agreeableness, or as he calls it, ''niceness'' - whether a person is more trusting, sympathetic and cooperative, or cynical, callous and antagonistic. ''We found that where a person tends to fall on that scale is much more influenced by environment - mostly early environment - than by genes,'' Plomin says, ''and as a parent, I find that very reassuring.''
The same studies continue to shed light on behavioral disorders such as alcoholism - a particularly complicated area of inquiry, since research shows that ''situational'' alcoholism caused by environmental factors such as war and unemployment skews the findings.
Men appear to be much more susceptible to the disorder than women; an alcoholic father is a strong indicator of a possible problem in a son.
Conventional wisdom holds that about 25 percent of the male relatives of alcoholics are problem drinkers themselves, as compared with less than 5 percent of the general population. Perhaps the best evidence for a genetic link comes from a 1987 adoption study in Sweden, which found that the adopted sons of alcoholic birth fathers were four times more likely to grow up to be alcoholic than were members of a control group. A smaller study of adopted daughters of alcoholic birth mothers found they were three times more likely to have the disorder.
Recent adoption and twin studies also suggest that there's a genetic link to most - but not all - forms of schizophrenia. The likelihood that a child or sibling of someone with schizophrenia will develop the disorder is about 12 percent - 12 times higher than the risk for everyone else - and if one identical twin has schizophrenia, the other has a 50 percent chance of developing the illness. Researchers suspect that a constellation of genes, working in combination with environmental forces, triggers the disease.
Both adoptive and twin studies confirm that clinical depression, particularly the bipolar manic-depressive variety, has a strong genetic component. According to one of the largest studies, in Denmark in 1977, if one identical twin suffers from bipolar manic depression, the other has a 79 percent likelihood of having the same disorder. Among fraternal twins, that correlation is only 19 percent.
The genetic study of crimininality has replaced the study of I.Q. as the most controversial area of behavioral genetics. It is also one of the most speculative. In the mid-1960's, a theory was put forward, based on several studies of felons, that men with an extra Y chromosome were more aggressive than the average male. But further research disproved the finding. More recent adoption and twin studies, says Gottesman, indicate that if there is a genetic component to criminal behavior, it is slight. MARIETTA SPENCER'S SECOND-FLOOR OF-fice at the Children's Home Society overlooks a shaded avenue on the residential fringe of St. Paul. On her way upstairs after lunch one afternoon last spring, she walked through the examining room, where a nurse gently prodded and poked a line-up of infants, waiting for adoption, who had been brought to the society by their foster mothers for routine check-ups. Spencer paused to play with a strikingly serious 3-month-old girl. After getting a smile from the child, she moved on.
''Even at this age, children have such obviously different temperaments,'' Spencer said. ''Every child comes into the world with a genetic history. You can't expect them to let go of that, like so much baggage, just because they've been adopted into a new family.''
These views were confirmed in the mid-1970's, Spencer said, when ''people who had been adopted as children were coming back to us for more information. Some wanted to meet their birth parents, but many just wanted to know more about them, as a way of knowing more about themselves.'' Even if sympathetic, most adoption workers at the time had little information to offer. Disorders like depression, schizophrenia and alcoholism carried a much stronger social stigma then, and were commonly thought to be either failures of character or environmentally induced. Rather, the emphasis was on integrating the child into the new family as quickly as possible, and for some families that even meant denying the child was adopted.
To help the adopted learn more about their backgrounds, Spencer assembled a team of social workers whose main job was and continues to be detective work; they've answered 1,600 requests for information since 1977. They locate birth parents wherever possible, discreetly contact them and - if and when the individuals are willing - fill in the history of the adopted child.
''Anything that might be even partially inherited, and provide useful information for the adopted person, we'll ask about,'' Spencer says. She steps into her office and pulls open a file drawer filled with folders detailing the lives of her clients. One particularly thick file belongs to Robert Morse. He and his family weren't much interested in questions of personality when they sought Spencer's help eight years ago; they were afraid for the boy's life. Though apparently healthy when adopted soon after birth, Morse, now 21, nearly died at age 5 from a bout with Crohn's disease, an intestinal disorder that kept him from absorbing nutrients from food. He recovered, but went on to develop arthritis at 12. The pain was so intense that at times he couldn't walk.
''I was starting to feel like a time bomb,'' Morse remembers, ''wondering what was going to happen to me next.'' While hospitalized, he had plenty to wonder about. Without any medical history to work from, doctors were forced to perform painful test after painful test to come up with a definitive diagnosis of juvenile chronic arthritis, which has sometimes been associated with Crohn's disease.
''They asked if we had any illness like this in the family,'' Morse recalls. ''All we knew from my records was that my birth mother was of Swedish extraction and allergic to hollyhocks.''
Spencer, whose agency had arranged the adoption, had more information, which eventually led her to Sally Boyum, a 39-year-old whose avocation is acting. In 1967, on the day of her fiance's funeral - he had drowned in a boating accident -Boyum had discovered she was pregnant. Grief-stricken, she arranged for an adoption. Though she didn't think to mention it at the time of the adoption - ''Both Jim and I had always been so healthy'' - there was a history of Crohn's disease and intestinal illness in her family. Several of her close relatives, Boyum would later learn, had bone abnormalities and the same type of arthritis as Morse.
''At first I didn't want to meet with Sally, and she didn't push it,'' Morse says. ''I had the medical information, and that was enough.'' But after a few weeks of gentle encouragement from his parents, he changed his mind.
Their conversation, tentative at first, soon stretched back over lost years, and Morse learned a few things he hadn't anticipated.
''Apparently Jim - my birth father - was a terrible tease, and so am I,'' Morse says. ''Both my folks have a good sense of humor, but teasing - calling up on the phone and pretending to be someone else, for example - that's a kind of joking that I do, but they don't.'' The list goes on. ''At school, or in the fraternity, I've always been a coalition-builder - it's one of the things I do best,'' says Morse, ''and that's a role that Sally plays too.'' Then there's acting - a love of playing to the crowd that for Sally Boyum is also a passion.
One piece of information, Morse says, has changed his life: Many members of both sides of the family struggled with alcoholism. ''Like a lot of kids in college, I used to go out and drink a lot on the weekends,'' he says. ''Now I know that's a danger for me, and I've stopped.''
MARY ANNE MAISER, WHO SUPERVISES social workers at the Children's Home Society, works in an office dotted with photographs of her three daughters, the oldest of whom, Laura, is adopted. ''At the time my husband and I adopted Laura, social workers were taught - and taught clients - that each baby is a tabula rasa,'' Maiser says.
''But by the time Laura was a year old, I knew something was wrong.'' She was an extremely difficult child, even alienated.
Over the years, the family sought help from a therapist. It wasn't until age 17 that Laura was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or manic-depressive illness. Around that time, after two years of trying, Maiser was able to get more information about Laura's birth family; she had been adopted through a different agency in another state. The agency revealed that within months of Laura's adoption, her biological father had been hospitalized. ''You can guess the diagnosis,'' Maiser says. ''Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.'' If she had been given the information earlier, would it have made a difference? Maiser's voice gets tight and her mouth forms a resolute line. ''Laura had so much pain and went undiagnosed for so long,'' she says. ''She didn't just need family therapy, she needed lithium.''
Despite such testimonials, some people still argue that wrapping an adopted child in genetic history does more damage than good. Laura had only about a 15 percent chance of inheriting her biological father's illness. If the disorder had never appeared, might not the label itself have twisted her life?
Marietta Spencer dismisses such objections: ''Everyone I have ever worked with has said it is always better to know the history than not to know. Because, believe me, it's the parents who don't know who imagine the worst if they have a child who seems to be troubled.''
For his part, Plomin thinks it's at least as important to tell adoptive parents that the birth father was an alcoholic as to alert them to their child's tiny risk of inheriting a rare disease. ''Even if you have a genetic vulnerability,'' he points out, ''you don't become an alcoholic unless you drink a lot over a long period. If you have the genetic history ahead of time, and you see the symptoms developing, you may be more likely to get help early.''
If adoption agencies are going to do everything they can to maximize the chances of harmony (Continued on Page 49) in a family, should they perhaps go one step further and take temperamental factors into account when ''matching'' a child to new parents?
Spencer, while stressing that genetic history isn't the only factor to consider in an adoption, thinks it shouldn't be ignored. ''Adoption, like marriage, is a process of family building, and empathy is very important,'' she says.
While Spencer might have a point, Plomin says, accurately predicting whether family members will be sympathetic or antagonistic to each other - in essence, predicting the chemistry of relationships - is much more difficult than she imagines. And even if adoption workers could give long, detailed personality tests to both sets of parents, they would still be a long way from predicting the baby's temperament.
Moreover, Plomin cautions, the current infatuation with genetic influences has obscured the very real importance of environment in human development. ''More and more, I find myself standing up before funding committees and the public to say, 'Hey, wait a minute everybody, hold on. It's not all genetic.''
In fact, Plomin's most recent research suggests that the influences of genes and the environment may be intractably intertwined. He asked participants in the Swedish twin study, who were an average of 59 years old, to fill out questionnaires about their parents, siblings and childhood experiences. The questions were phrased so as to get at the respondents' perceptions of their families - how cohesive, or emotionally demonstrative the families were, for example, or how much stress parents had placed on achievement, organization, discipline or culture.
The results were striking: identical twins reared in different families described their early childhood environments as remarkably similar - almost as similar as if they had been raised in the same family. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, even when raised in the same family, described that family very differently.
''You can interpret the findings in one of two ways,'' Plomin says. ''Maybe, because of their identical genes, identical twins perceive their environment in a quite similar way - sort of like looking at the world through the same shade of gray- or rose-colored glasses. But it is also possible - and we think quite likely - that their parents and others respond to them similarly because of genetically influenced quirks of personality that they share.''
Bouchard is finding much the same thing in his study; he believes that each of us shapes his or her environment in ways that may be partly genetically influenced. He cites the example of one pair of identical twins from Britain, now middle-aged, who were separated soon after birth. One was adopted by a working-class family with little time or money for books. The other grew up exposed to a rich library as the daughter of a university professor. ''From early childhood, both women loved to read,'' Bouchard says. ''One had only to walk out into the living room and pull books off the shelf. The other went every week to the library and came home with a huge stack. Though one had to work a little harder at it than the other, they both ended up creating functionally similar environments.''
However, ''If one of those women had been raised in a family with no access to libraries, she would have been dramatically different from her sister,'' he explains. ''The trait develops via the environment.''
If the behavioral geneticists are right, then those who fear the tyranny of biological determinism can rest a little easier. Genes aren't the sole ingredient of the personality soup, they are merely the well-seasoned stock. That message should be liberating for all parents - and children.

HOW WAR CAME
The Immediate Origins of the
Second World War, 1938-1939.
By Donald Cameron Watt.
Illustrated. 736 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $29.95.
Was there a last-minute chance to prevent World War II and, by implication, much of the tragedy that has afflicted mankind in the last half-century? ''How War Came,'' a masterly study of European diplomacy during the 11 hellish months between the 1938 Munich conference and Hitler's detonation of war through the invasion of Poland just 50 years ago, offers a formidably documented and somber answer: no. Given Hitler's poisonous personality and intentions, the general misalignment of nations after Munich, and the stupid or otherwise crippled leaders opposing Germany, war was virtually inevitable. There is little here to nourish fantasies of might-have-been, but much to be learned about folly. 
The story begins in October 1938. Although Hitler had been given a slice of Czechoslovakia at Munich, the nadir of appeasement, he felt cheated out of a military triumph and was resentful of the peacekeeping role of the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. Within months, Hitler consumed the rest of Czechoslovakia and whipped up his lust for war with Poland and humiliation of Great Britain. The word ''appeasement'' became a curse, and Chamberlain's Government sought to deter Hitler with a system of alliances. Most of the book describes in almost hourly detail how British hesitation and economic weakness, French ambiguity, Soviet suspicions and blindness to Russia's real interests, Italian vanity and gullibility, American noninvolvement and fecklessness, and the slippery particularism of the small states of Eastern Europe thwarted the containment effort, producing ''less a dam against aggression than the architecture of Stonehenge.'' In August 1939, Stalin agreed to a nonaggression pact with Hitler in preference to an alliance with the West. Hitler soon attacked Poland. The British and French hesitated ingloriously, but declared war on Germany in fulfillment of a promise that was of no use in saving Poland.
By starting the war Hitler sealed his ultimate fate. But in the short run he read Stalin correctly and had good reason to ignore the United States as a power. President Franklin D. Roosevelt abhorred Nazism, deeply and publicly, but he seemed powerless before an isolationist Congress and was given to feeble gestures that earned Hitler's contempt. Perhaps there is a touch of more recent times in Donald Cameron Watt's comment: ''It does not bode well for the peace of the world when the President of the United States allows himself to be maneuvered into appearing as an inept and ignorant fool.''
''How War Came'' is a demonstration that diplomatic history in the grand style - with its assiduous compilation of documents from every government involved and meticulous concern for the personal qualities and flaws of diplomats and their superiors - is alive, well, worth reading. The author, who teaches international history at the University of London, has devoted four decades to writing the history of the 20th century and editing diplomatic documents. He affirms that people count in history as individuals and are not puppets jerked around by vague impersonal forces. Thus we are given sharp portraits of every politician and diplomat of any significance at all, not only Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini and Stalin, but also ambassadors (in 1939 they still carried on real business), kings, prime ministers, foreign ministers, generals, well-meaning amateurs - all men, every one.
And what a poor lot. The book is a veritable biographical dictionary of blind prejudice, delusion, ignorance, venality, narrow selfishness and moral corruption, relieved only by some compliments for resolute Turks and Finns. Although Mr. Watt's assumptions are those of the classical realist, he advances moral admonitions in favor of professional competence, courage, hard work, critical intelligence and personal integrity. Old-fashioned values, perhaps, but rare in the Europe of 1939. Those in positions of responsibility make a difference, this sorry tale tells us, and society has a responsibility for choosing them well.
Mr. Watt ridicules several once fashionable theories about how and why war came. For example, he has no use for the idea that the British and French carried a burden of guilt for dictating the unfair Versailles settlement after World War I, and that Hitler and World War II were somehow their punishment. The issue in the 1930's was the threat Hitler's Germany posed, not a matter of ''wallowing in the guilt in which only the wealthy, the contented and the satisfied can indulge.''
Nor does Mr. Watt believe that Hitler blundered into a war he did not want because of the ineptitude of the democracies. Inept they were, but Hitler, the author writes, ''did not fall into war; nor was he pushed. He leapt into war, past the warnings of his more cautious advisers, past the efforts to appeal to his love of peace, past the clear statements from the British and French Governments, and despite the appeals from the Pope.'' And Mr. Watt is impatient with the argument, heard sometimes from the left (at least before the advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev), that Western capitalist-imperialists tried to set Germany on the Soviet Union, leaving Stalin no choice but to seek what safety he could in a nonaggression pact. Although the Western approach to Moscow was unsteady, the Soviets were more to blame than the democracies for the failure to form an alliance against Hitler. And they paid a heavy price.
Although ''How War Came'' has moments of subtle wit, it is not light reading, no flashy survey suitable for a television documentary. It is well-written history of the most serious sort, proceeding from the conviction that what was happening in small countries, as well as in the large ones, is necessary for an understanding of Europe's stumble toward suicide. It is excellent on personalities and the complicated rivalries and prejudices within governments. The focus throughout is resolutely on those at the top, on the telegraphed reports of conversations, on the high-level memorandums, on the often fumbling effort of men to see through the fog.
And always there is Hitler - brutal, ignorant, shrewd, bullying, listening only to egregious sycophants, on the edge of madness, malign beyond ordinary measure. Mr. Watt demonstrates how the Europeans of 1939 lacked the courage, intelligence and realism necessary to cope with such a dictator. But he also shows the evil of Hitler's personality, unique to that man in that time and place. Not the least of Hitler's legacy was the way in which his image seared itself on the consciousness of those who ultimately fought him, and how that image lingered long after he was gone, leading a new generation of adversaries to see one another as latter-day Fuhrers. Hitler alive willed war in 1939; dead, he helped bring on the cold war.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
S.M.U.'s Mustangs Gallop To Nowhere in Comeback

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Years before a succession of parties this weekend welcomed tonight's return of football to Southern Methodist University after a two-year void brought on by scandal and disgrace, Ownby Stadium, a storied piece of the southeast corner of the S.M.U. campus, stood as a symbol of a university's attitude toward the game.
In 1981, the year the Mustangs won a conference championship within the professional glitter of Texas Stadium - and the year the program was placed on National Collegiate Athletic Association probation for the fifth time - the old campus stadium was condemned.
Behind the bricked portals of the west stands, a ''huge mountain of concrete and steel'' it was called after the 1926 completion, the building was declared structurally unsound. Six years later, in February 1987, the program was condemned by the temporary abolition of the N.C.A.A.'s so-called ''death penalty.'' 
And while the stadium and the team came back to life, the fans endured a painful rebirth. The program that once established traditions of success and corruption was forced to suffer one more indignity: a one-sided loss to Rice.
The new Mustangs were defeated, 35-6, by a school that had lost its 18 previous games, had two or fewer victories in 10 of the prior 15 seasons, had not defeated S.M.U. since 1976, had not beaten the Mustangs in Dallas since 1964, and had gone without a winning season in 26 years, a bowl appearance in 28 years and a Southwest Conference championship in 32 years.
A Mustang team composed of 79 freshmen and sophomores and 48 non-scholarship players on a roster of 89 led just once. A fumble recovery of the opening kickoff at the Rice 15-yard line led to a 23-yard field goal by Matt Lomenick.
After that, the near-capacity crowd of 23,733, which included fans more than old enough to have yearned for an unofficial national championship earlier in this decade, cheered Owl punts, S.M.U. first downs, the Mustang Band, and Peruna VII, the stallion that led the team back to competition.
For one night, 41 years after ambition led the Mustangs from the campus field to the spaciousness of the Cotton Bowl during Doak Walker's Heisman Trophy season, the followers seemed to understand that even a loss to Rice was better than no game at all.
In the stands, T-shirts provided reminders of good times and bad:
On the front: ''SMU We're Not Snobs.'' And on the back: ''We're just better than you.'' From probation days: ''Ponies. Polos. Porsches. Probation.'' And from more recent times: ''Football Returns To The Hilltop. Let's Get Bombed.''
After years of stories involving scandal and shame, the weekend edition of The Daily Campus declared: ''SMU FOOTBALL IS SQUEAKY CLEAN.''
After weeks of the logistical nightmare of refurbishing and reopening a once-forgotten facility, Doug Single, the athletic director, said: ''It's amazing we're going to have a game here.''
And after more than 19 months of preparation for his first game as a college coach, Forrest Gregg, an S.M.U. co-captain in 1955, could focus his attention on the challenge of a game.
''How good are we?'' Gregg had said in a conference room outside his office the day before the game. ''Can our quarterback function? Can we pass protect? Can we rush the passer?'' By the end of the evening there were the lessons to be gained from a first half in which the Mustangs were outscored, 28-3, and allowed an average of 7.6 yards per running play. Donald Hollas, the Rice junior quarterback, finished the night with 82 rushing yards and two touchdowns, and 16 of 32 passes for 222 yards and two more scores.
But there was also the positive reinforcement of a second half in which the Mustang defense held the Owls to one touchdown, and a series of standing ovations for modest achievements in a setting that seemed closer to a Friday night Texas high school game than the major-college big-time.
 
Different Approach
While the campus surroundings serve to represent a more modest approach to the game, Ownby's small size has created the possibility for a different marketing approach. To ease the financial demands, Single's department established a five-year season ticket called the Cornerstone V.I.P. Sports Package.
The best locations cost $625 a seat for the five seasons, plus an added donation of up to $7,500 a year for a midfield location. Virtually one-third of the seats, 7,992 out of a capacity of 24,576, will be behind the end zones. Single said that reality produced some leverage in selling an inexperienced team to a group of alumni and fans with high expectations.
''Here, you can look up there and think, 'Where am I going to sit?' '' Single said.
Despite the success of the first half of the 1980's, the average home attendance did not exceed 41,000 at Texas Stadium, the 65,000-seat home of the Dallas Cowboys. Single said that the season-ticket base of 5,600 for the 1986 season has been more than doubled this year.
But even as the music played and the cheers returned, there remained the question of whether an institution that has historically been obsessed with winning at any cost can operate within rules and remain satisfied with the results on autumn Saturdays.
 
Economic Realities
It feels so much longer than a few years ago when people here smiled at the mention of the economy, when Dallas was booming and the Mustangs were winning and any limitations appeared somewhere beyond the horizon. Now, Single jokes: ''I'm not worried so much about boosters paying anybody, because they can't afford it. The economy is so down.''
The weekend the band played again, Single understood the future is not a laughing matter. ''This is the last opportunity for S.M.U. to have intercollegiate football,'' Single said, ''if we don't run it right.''

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
The Selling of Steinbrenner's Yankees

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
Yankee fans are mad at George Steinbrenner, again. Or still. Or more than ever.
They believe he has succeeded not only in making mush of the Yankees, but in bringing football to baseball - bringing his football mentality, as it were - and even hockey to baseball, with fans resorting to that old ice-rink trick of sailing paper airplanes to demonstrate displeasure. 
They believe he has turned the sacrosanct grounds of Yankee Stadium into a zoo, a madhouse, and a slammer, depending on his mood.
The fans boo him in his own ball park, and chant, ''George Must Go.'' Fans flutter signs with nasty comments about him, which are soon ripped up by his imperial guards.
But George Steinbrenner goes about business with their anger banging off his psyche as rubber arrows off a suit of armor. And he just waves goodbye and flies home to Tampa.
What many people don't understand is, George Steinbrenner is the happiest man in the world. Whoever heard of George Steinbrenner before 1973, when he became the owner of the Yankees? Few, besides his immediate family and the employees of a ship-building company that he inherited from his father and grandfather.
Now he is the most famous sports-team owner in history. Name another. Maybe Gene Autry, but for another reason. Steinbrenner has made his name without ever having to sing ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' in public.
Beyond that, everyone including the baseball-card collectors understands that baseball is a business. And Steinbrenner has been a stupendous success at it.
Sure, Yankee attendance is a little down from last year, perhaps because of a foundering team, but last season, the Yankees set their all-time home attendance record with 2.6 million fans, and finished fifth. And this year's team will improve. It can hardly get worse.
Last winter, Steinbrenner signed a $500 million cable-television contract for his team. And just the other day, a man in New Jersey said he had offered to buy the Yankees for $500 million. He was turned down. And not just turned down, but ignored. He reportedly never even received a reply.
No baseball team has ever sold for more than $100 million (that top figure was for the Mets in 1986), but it is said that the Yankees, Mets and Dodgers, because of their market and TV contracts, might be worth $200 million today. Some think an offer of $500 million for the Yankees is therefore unbelievable, but some people thought the cable deal was, too.
There are numerous theories about why George Steinbrenner behaves the way he does, such as firing people with the impatience of a man with a hotfoot. Observers wonder, is he a sadist, is he bananas, is he the most wildly egomaniacial person on the face of the earth, or is he dumb as a fox?
I say fox. Not only that, I nominate George Steinbrenner for the Nobel Prize for Economics. He has demonstrated one of the most enterprising ways to make a buck since Gresham announced that bad money will drive out good money (or was it the other way around?).
Take that offer of $500 million, for example. When Steinbrenner and several partners bought the club in 1973, they paid $10 million for it, with Steinbrenner putting up the largest share, about $3.5 million. After his buyouts over the years, it is estimated he now owns more than half the club.
While the Yankees have multiplied in value beyond imagination, it is believed that his shipbuilding company - like the industry -has experienced some rocky times, and none of the horses he owns has won the Triple Crown yet. So the Yankees represent the jewel of his investments.
The Yankees, to be sure, have been fairly well known for a number of years. Mostly for winning. Which has been in some measure a reason for their value. The Yankees continue to be widely known, but not for winning. It's for Steinbrenner. Once, the Yankees were Babe or Joe or Mickey, or even Reggie. Now ask someone to name a Yankee, and the answer is usually George.
George gets publicity. Nothing sells the way noise does, and George has perfected the pitch.
Look at the latest firing of a manager: George's 17th change in his 17 seasons. First George second-guesses Dallas Green in public. Then Green retaliates. Then George says no boss can tolerate such disrespect, and fires the man. Then George says the man fired himself. This doesn't make sense.
Then he brings in a rookie manager who falls on his face and George later says the man wasn't ready to assume a major league job. Then why hire him, when there are so many experienced ex-managers around, including in George's own office? It doesn't make sense.
Then George in fact fires his new general manager for not supporting his decision to fire Green. Yet George says he doesn't want yes-men around him. It doesn't make sense.
Or does it? It's hot air. It's publicity. It's profits.
Fans ask: How do we get rid of the man? The answer is: Only he will get rid of himself. And he'll do that when he determines when the getting is good. He is surely aware, as a ship person, that there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, when taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; omitted - well, kerplunk!
The sooner he sees that tide, the happier will be Yankee fans.
The fear is, he may not see it, which would make him fortune's fool.
Either way, though, one day he sells, for a bundle or a song.
One day. Maybe.

HEADLINE: Assessing New York's Charter Change

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
THE proposed overhaul of New York City's charter would bring sweeping changes in the way planning and land-use decisions are made, but experts say they do not expect the revision to quicken the pace of development or dramatically shift the balance of power among City Hall, neighborhood advocates and New York's economically potent real estate industry.
''Most of the tensions that have been in the system will remain in the system,'' said Frederick A. O. Schwarz, chairman of a 15-member New York City Charter Revision Commission, which adopted its referendum proposal last month.
The proposed charter would create ways for many more elected officials and neighborhood residents to involve themselves in the consideration of development proposals, through both an enlarged City Council and procedures to draw community boards more closely into the land-use-review process.
Whether that means greater democracy or more delays in a development process that already is thought by builders to be too cumbersome depends on one's point of view.
''The commission has put 22 hands on the same steering wheel,'' said Kent Barwick, executive director of the Municipal Art Society, one of dozens of groups that testified on the charter proposal at hearings earlier this year. ''The revisions won't make things worse,'' Mr. Barwick said. ''They simply fail to make them better.'' 
Others, including representatives of minorities and the poor, said the land-use-review process should incorporate an even larger role for neighborhood groups.
Because it would eliminate the powerful Board of Estimate, which sits in final judgment over budgets, contracts, franchises, zoning changes, the disposition of city-owned land, the placement of city facilities and other essential elements of municipal policy, the charter revision proposal is being compared to a new constitution for the city.
The revisions, now under study by the Federal Department of Justice, are scheduled to be put to a vote in a Nov. 7 referendum. They are intended to satisfy the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in March that the city's Board of Estimate violates the Constitution's one-man, one-vote principal and that its form of governance must be changed.
The plan is drawing fire on many fronts. But it is the provisions for land use and planning that have drawn the most widespread public debate, reflecting the widely divergent visions of New York's future among developers, business groups, planners, environmentalists, representatives of the poor and other special interests.
Developers, unhappy with many aspects of the proposal, say they are disappointed by the way it would change the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure - the city's method of reviewing many development proposals -which they had hoped to see shortened.
IN some cases it will be shorter, but the process, which now takes a maximum of 215 days, could take as many as 230 days if all appeals, vetoes and legislative overrides are explored.
''We are just retarding a land-use procedure that is already too slow,'' said Ronald Shelp, president of both the New York Chamber of Commerce and the New York City Partnership, a major builder of moderate- and middle-income housing.
But most experts, even some of the plan's severest critics, acknowledge that its faults are distributed in something close to equal measure, creating a complex new system of checks and balances. As a result, no one can be certain that the host of developments proposed for the city - from hospices for AIDS patients to a 150-story condominium Donald Trump envisions over the bank of the Hudson River - stands a better or worse chance of approval if the charter referendum passes.
''What the Charter Revision Commission is proposing is technical changes that really replicate the same system,'' said Marla Simpson, an attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a research and advocacy group. ''The beauty of it - perhaps the problem - is that nobody knows what will happen.''
The plan is to transfer most of the land-use and planning powers of the eight-member Board of Estimate to a newly constituted City Council, whose membership, currently 35, would be enlarged in a citywide redistricting to 51.
Many decisions, ranging from the placement of shelters for the homeless to the approval of special permits for highrise office buildings, would fall under the jurisdiction of a newly empowered Planning Commission, with a majority of its 13 members appointed by the Mayor. The current commission has seven members, all mayoral appointees, and all its actions are subject to approval by the Board of Estimate.
As a check on the powers of the new Planning Commission, some of its actions could be appealed to the City Council. If both the Borough President and the community board in the neighborhood affected by a land-use proposal are opposed to it, the matter would be ''called up'' from the Planning Commission to the City Council. Similarly, the Council itself, through a simple majority, could call up and override an affirmative vote by the Planning Commission.
As a democratic exercise, the charter revision proposal appears to have passed one critical test: Dozens of widely divergent groups and special interests have been involved in its creation, and virtually no one is entirely happy with the result.
Developers and others in the real estate industry, who had been lobbying for changes that would speed the review process, also hoped to see greater discretion given to the Planning Commission in approving development proposals.
''We had hoped charter revision would provide an opportunty to improve the development process, but this just adds more risk,'' said Debra Beck, vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents developers. The group had hoped the newly enlarged City Council would have less opportuntity to review, modify and delay development proposals.
SOME neighborhood advocates said just the opposite: that every land-use and planning decision should be handled by the City Council because it would represent the broadest constituency.
''In critical areas the City Council will have no vote at all,'' said Richard Rivera, a lawyer with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, one of several groups representing minorities and poor New Yorkers that have threatened suits if the referendum is passed.
He added that one unnecessary limit on the Council's powers is that it could overrule the Planning Commission only on land-use proposals that are approved, not on proposals denied.
While experts said the opposing interests could have been anticipated, the lines of demarcation are often blurred or nonexistent, offering many reminders of the political complexity of New York City land-use decisions.
Neighborhood and environmental groups, even those that had been allied in the past, found themselves in conflict over how much power the City Council should exercise. Some said they feared that the larger Council, with a majority of its members representing the other boroughs, might gang up on Manhattan, supporting massive, out-of-scale developments in congested midtown or downtown areas because these would generate tax revenue for the entire city.
On another issue, developers found themselves allied with some of the same neighborhood groups that have for years been fighting their development plans. The alliance came over a charter provision that would allow representatives of community boards to attend ''scoping sessions'' with developers, and give the boards access to development plans and environmental-impact submissions even before they are certified as complete by the city's Planning Department. ''This was a curious alliance,'' said Mr. Schwarz. Neighborhood groups said they like the idea because it would give them more time to review development plans, while developers support the plan because it would enable them to anticipate neighborhood concerns, sometimes avoiding suits in the process.
One key question is how the city's political institutions will respond to the new rules. Many people wonder if the City Council, heretofore a timid stepchild of the Board of Estimate whose agenda has been devoted largely to mundane matters like street name changes, will have the capacity and inclination to deal effectively with land-use and planning questions.
''The reality now is that the City Council is a door mat,'' said Eugene Russianoff, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, an environmental and consumer organization. He added that unless the proposed City Council is more assertive, the Mayor - because he would appoint a majority of the Planning Commission - ''would exercise more power than the Wizard of Oz.''
However the new Council approaches land use, some changes are assured if the referendum passes.
ONE provision, labeled a ''fair share plan,'' would require the Planning Commission to prepare a citywide plan for the distribution of city-owned facilities and the disposition of city-owned land.
Each year, the Mayor would have to issue a ''statement of needs'' for the following two years, which, in effect, would be a short-term outline for implementing the overall plan. Another provision would require the Planning Commission to issue a comprehensive ''zoning and planning report'' for the city every four years.
''We have planted the seeds for a shift away from ad hoc, individual disputes toward general land-use standards,'' said Mr. Schwarz, adding that he considered the provisions for planning to be the most important policy changes in the revised charter. But some would have taken things a step further. ''They have given us part of a loaf,'' said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group that studies planning, transportation and land use in the New York City region. The group had sought a more detailed, longer-term approach to planning that would have plotted land use and budgeted money years in advance.
Another policy change, establishing a new commission to review applications for historic-landmark recommendations, has prompted harsh criticism from preservationists. The change was recommended after the Charter Revision Commission heard testimony from many representatives of churches and other religious institutions who said that the city's ability to confer landmark status on their buildings put them under unfair economic hardship.
THE provision would separate the Landmarks Preservation Commission from the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, of which it is now a part.
It also would require the Mayor to appoint a five-member panel to hear appeals from nonprofit institutions, including churches, that object to the landmarking of their buildings.
Although the city plans to have the charter revision referendum on the Nov. 7 ballot, the vote would have to be postponed if Justice Department lawyers do not meet a deadline of Oct. 10 to review a small truckload of documents, including testimony presented to the Charter Revision Commission. The lawyers, who have told New York officials they expect to meet the deadline, must determine whether the proposal conforms to the Federal Voting Rights Act and does not dilute the political strength of minorities.
Even if the deadlines are met, the referendum is held on Nov. 7 and it is approved, the changes that it mandates cannot begin immediately because of the complex changes in the composition of the City Council and Planning Commission. As a result, the Charter Revision Commission has proposed a timetable for phasing in the changes that experts say could result in a rush of development proposals entering the land-use-review procedure between Nov. 8 and the end of January.
The reasoning is that most developers would prefer to have their plans reviewed by the Board of Estimate because they are familiar with the current system. But experts say most would also prefer to wait until they see who wins the Nov. 7 mayoral election before committing themselves to the review process.
Under the timetable for charter revision, the Board of Estimate would remain in business until Aug. 30, 1990, presiding over land-use proposals that enter the review process before the end of January 1990. The new planning commission, meanwhile, would begin ruling on land-use matters and making its recommendations to the City Council on July 1, 1990, two months before the Board of Estimate is eliminated.
Appointments to the commission would be announced by March 1, with the Mayor appointing the commission's chairperson and six other members, the President of the City Council appointing one member and each of the five Borough Presidents appointing one member each.
Meanwhile, the plan gives the city two years to complete the job of redistricting and conducting its first election of a 51-member City Council. That election would be on Nov. 7, 1991.
 
HOW THE TWO SYSTEMS COMPARE
THE proposed revision of the New York City charter would require many changes in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, the process used to review zoning map changes, special permits and other land-use proposals not automatically allowable under established zoning rules.
Proponents say that the new system would speed the process in most cases because the newly empowered Planning Commission would take over the job of ruling on a wide range of proposals. But where proposals must be dealt with by the City Council, mayoral vetos and override votes could make the process more lengthy.
Following are the current and proposed procedures.
Under the current process:
1. Development proposals and environmental-impact statements are submitted to the Planning Department and are eventually certified as complete by the Planning Commission. The community board must be informed of the application, and is sometimes given access to environmental-impact information before it is complete. But there are no guarantees of such access, and no legal limits on how long this pre-certification or first step may take.
2. When the application is certified, the Planning Department refers it to the affected community board. The community board then holds hearings and recommends to the Planning Commission approval, disapproval or modifications. Time allowed: 65 days.
3. In cases where developments affect more than one community board, an intermediate step is provided for. The Borough Board, chaired by the Borough President, reviews the community boards' recommendations and advises the Planning Commission. Time allowed: 30 days.
4. The Planning Commission conducts hearings and issues a report to the Board of Estimate recommending approval or disapproval. Time allowed: 60 days.
5. The Board of Estimate holds a hearing and rules on the proposal. Time allowed: 60 days.
Total time allowed after certification: 215 days.
Under the new system:
1. Applications to the Planning Department must be accessible to Community Boards. When an environmental-impact report is filed, the boards are invited to ''scoping sessions'' with developers. The Planning Department must certify applications as complete within six months, or appeals by the Borough President or the developer can demand certification by the Planning Commission.
2. The community board conducts hearings and advises the Planning Commission. Time allowed: 60 days.
3. The Borough President makes a recommendation to the Planning Commission. At the same time, if more than one community board is affected, the Borough Board makes its recommendation. Time allowed: 30 days.
4. The Planning Commission has 60 days to hold hearings and act on applications. For many proposals, that ends the process no more than 150 days after certification. However, zoning changes, urban renewal plans and some other proposals are automatically referred to the City Council. And all approvals by the Planning Commission can be appealed if they are opposed by both the affected community board and Borough President or by a majority vote of the City Council.
5. The City Council holds hearings of its own and approves, modifies or disapproves. Time allowed: 50 days.
6. The Mayor can veto the City Council action. The Council can override in a two-thirds vote or modify the proposal. Time allowed: 30 days.
Total time allowed after certification: 230 days.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Party Wall
Question: What is the definition of a party wall? What are the restrictions as far as construction or reconstruction are concerned? . . . M.B., Brooklyn
Answer: A party wall is an exterior wall that is shared by two buildings that have adjoining lot lines. These common walls, which are usually 8 to 12 inches thick, are most often used in brick, masonry or concrete construction projects, although New York City's building code also allows party walls to be used in certain types of semi-detached frame construction.
According to Vahe Tiryakian, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, no matter what the construction material, these walls must be fireproof barriers. 
''Party walls are much more common in residential construction than in commercial construction,'' said Mr. Tiryakian, who added that the party wall is a cost- saving technique. ''In most cases,'' he said, ''this type of construction is done by an owner of several ajoining lots or several property owners who arrange to build at the same time. You see them a lot in rowhouse construction.'' Mr. Tiryakian said that when it comes to construction or reconstruction projects involving a party wall, the same basic regulations apply that apply to the construction or reconstruction of standard exterior walls. A building owner would be allowed to extend a party wall, for example, if an addition was to be made to a building with this type of construction, as long as any changes did not affect the integrity of the other side of the party wall.
 
Lease Renewals and Pets
Question: I have lived in a rent-stabilized apartment for 20 years. Pets, especially dogs, have been welcome. In fact, I had a dog for 18 years. But now the management seems to be trying to restrict pets. In my renewal lease there was a rider I was supposed to sign which said, in effect, that I did not have a dog and would not get one during the lease. I didn't sign it. Was this rider legal, and if I were to get a dog would my landlord have grounds for an eviction? . . . P. A., Manhattan
Answer: No on both questions. It does not matter if the issue concerns pets, a service or a penalty, like a charge for late rent; a landlord can not change the terms of a stabilized lease by adding a rider or clauses to a renewal lease.
''This does not mean that a landlord has carte blanche on vacancy leases either,'' said Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency that has jurisdiction over rent-regulated apartments. ''In general, the same rules must apply to all tenants, just as all tenants are entitled to the same level of service.''
 
Rent Overcharge
Question: I signed a lease for a rent-stabilized apartment effective Oct. 1, 1981. Since then I have read references to the fact that there was some sort of court ruling relating to leases signed about that time. If I understand these reports correctly, I could be entitled to a rent reduction. Is this true in my case? . . . R.F., Manhattan
Answer: No. The case you are asking about is Stein v. the Rent Guidelines Board, in which it was charged that the Guidelines Board improperly allowed landlords to add a fuel surcharge and a 15 percent vacancy allowance for leases signed between July 1 and Sept. 30, 1981. Your lease would not be involved because it did not take effect until Oct. 1 of that year. But in any case, the matter was settled in the city's favor in April 1987 when the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court overturned a lower court's decision that had ruled against the Guidelines Board.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Office Brokerage Fees;
Fuzzy Rules and High Stakes Make a Litigious Climate

BYLINE: By MARK McCAIN

 BODY:
THE stakes are so high and the rules so fuzzy, it's no wonder that brokers of office space in Manhattan clash over who should collect the brokerage commissions. And when a jilted broker decides to pursue a commission he believes was snatched away unfairly, the office tenant involved is often dragged into the fray.
''It's the most prevalent problem in real estate brokerage,'' said Edward Jaffe, a Manhattan lawyer who believes that vague legal guidelines aggravate disputes over commissions. ''It's inherently risky for brokers, and there ought to be more legal clarity. These kinds of cases I can do without.'' 
The typical dispute involves a broker who contends he introduced a tenant to office space in a building, only to later see the tenant lease the space through a competing broker. The money involved can be substantial: On a 10-year lease, a standard commission, equal to 30 percent of the first year's rent, may exceed $1 million for 100,000 square feet of space.
''Commission disputes are the reason why the industry has a reputation for being so litigious in Manhattan,'' said Alan Ginsberg, president of the Ginsberg Organization, a real estate brokerage in Manhattan. ''When one broker is dealing with one executive in a company that's planning a move, three or four other executives may be working with other brokers. That kind of duplication leads to lots of bad will - and very unpleasant situations.''
In other instances, a tenant and broker fall into legal warfare over contractual disagreements. For nearly a decade Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, a Manhattan law firm, has been battling with Kenneth D. Laub & Company, a leasing brokerage in Manhattan. The prolonged litigation - which has become more a matter of principle than economics for the two sides - stems from a lease the law firm signed nine years ago for 45,000 square feet in 101 Park Avenue, a 49-story building at 40th Street.
Laub & Company contends that Dewey, Ballantine breached a brokerage agreement by negotiating its lease directly with the building's landlord. But Dewey, Ballantine says it retained Laub only to obtain competing rent quotations before the law firm negotiated a renewal for its 150,000-square-foot headquarters at 140 Broadway in downtown Manhattan.
In 1983, the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of Laub & Company, which is fighting for a payment of $118,000, plus interest. Upon appeal, the state Appellate Division ruled against awarding the money, but left the matter open for further depositions. Several weeks ago the Supreme Court dismissed the action, and now Clarence S. Barasch, attorney for Laub, has appealed to the Appellate Division.
But the cost of litigation - in time, money and energy - tends to discourage most brokers from chasing commissions through the courts, although some disputes are not settled until after depositions, or even after selecting a jury.
''Many brokers in this town use litigation as a ploy, knowing that nobody wants to go to court over a commission,'' said Stephen F. Anderson, a vice president of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services, a brokerage in Manhattan.
''I have heard of cases,'' he said, ''where a broker will give a tenant a windshield tour - in other words, drive by a building and say, 'There's 20,000 square feet available on the fifth floor.' Three months later the tenant signs a lease for that space, negotiated by another broker, and the first broker turns around with a lawsuit.''
That sort of nuisance suit would never survive in court, but a broker who did more than just a windshield tour might have a case.
In New York State, and more than a dozen other states, a binding contract between a tenant and a broker need not be in writing. An oral agreement is sufficient. So when a company engages several brokers in its search for office space, overlapping efforts can create overlapping claims for the commission.
Legally, a broker must be the ''procuring cause'' of a lease to collect the commission. And if two brokers have shown the same space to a tenant, both may have a valid claim on the commission.
''We've seen situations where a company looks at space with one broker, then hires another broker to complete the deal,'' Mr. Ginsberg said. ''Or the company decides it can cut a better deal by going directly to the landlord.''
When a broker feels squeezed out of a commission, the logical person to pursue is the landlord, who is responsible for paying commissions. But usually the broker and tenant in a lease transaction agree to indemnify the landlord against any unforeseen claims by other brokers. So the liability is passed down to the tenant and the procuring broker. ''Landlords don't want to get hung out to dry by being liable for two commissions,'' said Stephen DeNardo, a partner of First Winthrop Corporation, which owns 15 office buildings in New York City. ''I've been in situations where we've pulled a tenant aside with his broker and said, 'Wait a second. Two months ago you were here with XYZ broker and now you've come with ABC broker to make a deal. We need to work this problem out.' ''
A company leasing office quarters runs the risk of a suit when it snubs a broker who played a significant role in matching up the company with its chosen block of space. But usually, if the company has switched allegiances, the second broker will evaluate how strong a case the first broker has, and perhaps offer to share the commission.
''Some brokers have reputations for chasing commissions that they don't deserve,'' said Morton A. Smith, a senior partner of Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent & Friedman, a Manhattan law firm with an active real estate department.
''Once when we leased space ourselves, a broker attempted to make a claim because he talked to one of our partners at a social event,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But we straightened that one out very quickly.''
LAW firms and other professional partnerships are especially prone to brokerage disputes because partners are tempted to conduct their own independent searches as their firm approaches the end of an existing lease.
''At that point, every partner in a firm starts getting calls from brokers,'' Mr. Smith said.
''But in our firm, we've given out very clear instructions to everyone: When you get a call from broker, just explain that we're dealing with one broker on an exclusive basis. If anyone strays from that party line, it only creates trouble and confusion.''

HEADLINE: New Medicaid Plan To Protect Aged's Assets

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
ELDERLY people will be able to obtain Medicare coverage for health care while also protecting their assets under a new program that will begin in Connecticut.
Through the program, which still needs Congressional approval, Connecticut would become the first state to make long-term health care insurance benefits available to elderly residents by combining private insurance coverage and Medicaid benefits.
About 50,000 of the state's 400,000 elderly residents could be enrolled in the program within six years, officials said last week. 
The program is being financed with a $1.8 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
 
Value of Assets
The program would allow elderly people to protect assets equal in value to the amount of long-term health care insurance they buy.
For example, a person with assets of $150,000 could protect $100,000 in assets by buying $100,000 of insurance coverage for long-term health care. When that coverage was exhausted, the person would pay the next $50,000 in health-care costs and would become eligible for Medicaid coverage for future costs.
Current regulations require that people sell their assets and exhaust all their resources except $1,600 before they are eligible for Medicaid.
The new program would provide the most benefit to middle-income people - those who could accumulate a moderate degree of wealth during their lives but who would not be wealthy enough to pay for years of expensive care in nursing homes, said More Control for the Elderly Kevin Mahoney, director of the new program at the State Office of Policy and Management. Mr. Mahoney said it would give elderly residents more control over their own destinies.
The program will not be able to start until the necessary Federal legislation is passed because insurance policies cannot be offered through it, Mr. Mahoney said.
A Senate version of the bill is expected to pass, but the House bill faces opposition from United States Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
The program also would provide other benefits to elderly people, Mr. Mahoney said.
 
Toll-Free Number
For example, he said, the grant will finance creation of a consumer-service office with a toll-free telephone line in the State Department on Aging.
A number of conditions would be imposed on insurance companies issuing policies through the program. Policies certified under the program would have to offer inflation proctection, would cover home-based health care services and could not require three days of hospitalization before a person became eligible for nursing home care, as some policies now require, Mr. Mahoney said.
In addition, insurance companies would have to keep the records of those health care payments that count toward asset protection.

DINOSAUR MAGIC
The Sands Point Preserve on Middle Neck Road is presenting a special show today. Entitled ''The Magic of Dinosaurs,'' it is designed for children 4 through 10 and features Bruce Laird, who will do magic tricks, show slides and draw pictures all related to, you guessed it, dinosaurs. The program will be offered at 1 and 2:30 P.M. and admission is $1. Admission to ''Dinosaurs-Live,'' the robotic exhibition that ends its run at the preserve on Wednesday, costs $4 ($2 for children 3 to 12), but admission to the adjacent Dino-Den, with its hands-on exhibits, scientific information and playroom, is free. The Den will remain at the preserve through mid-December. Information: 883-1612.
 
ECONOMIC CONFERENCE
Almost by way of preparing East Enders for the real world, to which many will be returning after tomorrow, the Southampton campus of Long Island University is holding a major conference on ''The State of the U.S. Economy'' today. 
With Sander Vanocur, the ABC-TV newsman as moderator, a panel of financial, economic and communications leaders will tell those who want to be in the know everything about subjects like the durability of the present cycle of prosperity, the impact of the impending economic unification of Europe and the massive infusion of narco-dollars.
The conference will take place at 3 P.M. at the Fine Arts Center, and the panelists include Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's chief economic advisor; Rand Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer of I.T.T; Robin Chandler Duke, a director of American Home Products and Rockwell International; David Mahoney, former chairman of Norton Simon Inc.; George Soros, president of Soros Fund Management, and Martin Cantor, director of Suffolk County's Office of Economic Development.
After the program, which costs $10 to attend, there will be the annual Chancellor's Gala to benefit the school's Scholarship Fund.
Reservations: 283-4000, Ext. 310.
 
VARIATIONS ON THEMES
For its final outing this year, the East Hampton Music Festival, featuring the American Chamber Orchestra, has chosen a promising way to tie a diverse program together tonight. The common denominator is the composer Arnold Schoenberg, who figures in three of the five works on tap: his versions of Strauss waltzes, Debussy's ''Afternoon of a Faun'' and Mahler's ''Songs of a Wayfarer.''
In addition, there will be the New York premiere of Joan Tower's ''Island Prelude'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espangnol'' arranged by Blackwood.
With Cynthia Rose, mezzo-soprano, as soloist in the Mahler and the oboist John Ferrillo in the Tower work, the concert will take place at 8:30 P.M. at St. Luke's Episcopal Church on James Lane.
Information: 329-0990.
 
ON THE RUN
Those who like labor for fun on Labor Day can choose between two road races tomorrow.
In Long Beach, it's the 10th annual Labor Day Five-Mile Run. The race, along the Boardwalk and through suburban streets, begins at 8:30 A.M. on the Boardwalk between Riverside and Edwards Boulevards, but registration ($10) starts at 7 A.M. Information 431-3890. In the Springs hamlet of East Hampton, the Great Bonac Foot Race, a 10-K (6.2-mile) run starts at 9 A.M. at Ashawagh Hall on Fireplace Road. Registration is $12. Information: 324-4572. On Saturday, there is the traditional Babylon Lakeside Run, a 5-K race that begins at 9 A.M. at Phelps Lane Park on North Babylon and then wends its way to Belmont Lake State Park and back again. The entry fee is $6 in advance or $8 on Saturday.
Information: 422-7206.
 
'FLIGHT OF FANCY'
Although Mike Machet, president of the American Society of Aviation Artists, concedes that aviation art had ''its roots in the technical and commercial fields following World War II,'' lately, he insists, the specialty has begun knocking on the door of acceptance as a ''fine-art genre.''
And so ''Flight of Fancy: Long Island's Aerospace Heritage through Art,'' which opens Tuesday at Nassau Community College's Firehouse Gallery, comes by its art gallery showcase honestly.
Drawn from the Nassau County Museum and Grumman Corporation collections, the 90 works illustrate Long Island's role in air and space-craft design.
Among the artists whose works are included are Eric Sloane, Keith Ferris, Wayne Davis, Mike Gavigan and Mr. Machet himself. There also will be hand-carved prototypes and wind tunnel models to capture the three-dimensional aspect of the subject.
Accompanied by special programming like talks by Mr. Machet and Mr. Ferris on Sept. 16, the exhibition will be on display through Oct. 8 at the gallery on the Garden City campus.
Information: 222-7165.
 
STAGE SETTLING IN
Long Island Stage, the Island's only all-Actors Equity company, opens its 15th season Tuesday with ''Pump Boys and Dinettes,'' a musical with a country-western twang that was nominated for a Tony during its Broadway run and recently finished a four-year stay in Chicago.
After ''Pump Boys,'' which continues through Sept. 24, the season settles down to its usual ''One from Column A and two from Column B'' demeanor.
There will be a still-to-be-chosen farce or mystery next, followed by Sartre's 'No Exit,'' Ibsen's ''Hedda Gabler,'' Shaw's ''Getting Married'' and the world premiere of ''The Zoo of Tranquillity.'' The last is billed as a ''tour-de-farce'' by Avner Eisenberg, the noted clown.
Long Island Stage appears at the Hays Theater on the Rockville Centre campus of Molloy College.
Ticket and/or subscription information: 546-4600.
 
FORGOTTEN FILM FEST
Apparently, there is an insatiable appetite for vintage films on Long Island, particularly those of the science-fiction, fantasy and/or horror movie persuasion.
At least, there is enough interest for the Dowling Film Society to keep rolling along. On Wednesday, the society begins another ''Festival of Fine Forgotten Films,'' interspersing relics like ''Moonrise,'' a 1948 Dane Clark drama, and ''Forgotten Commandments,'' a 1932 Communism vs. Christianity opus, with ''Fire Maidens From Outer Space'' and ''The Vampire's Coffin.''
On a tamer note, proceedings start with a double bill: ''Under Age,'' a 1941 Edward Dmytryk tale about reform school female graduates working for mobsters, and ''Unwritten Code,'' a 1944 thriller about a doomed couple.
The free screenings are at 8 P.M. at the Media Center on Dowling College's Oakdale campus. For a complete schedule, call 244-3243.
 
WINE MAKING-TASTING
First, you make the wine and then you taste it (if not what you made, then at least a reasonable facsimile thereof). This is the philosophy followed by the Cornell Cooperative Extension at the Suffolk County Farm and Education Center in Yaphank.
So on Saturday, the extension agent Jim Whitely will teach a winemaking class, and then the people from Pindar Vineyards in Peconic will give the new winemakers some tastes of what they could produce.
The class, to which visitors are urged to bring a bag lunch, is at 10 A.M. and costs $15.

HEADLINE: What the Island's Landfill Law Specifies

 BODY:
The effort by the Long Island Weekly (Aug. 6) to summarize the status of the Long Island landfill ''deadline'' is commendable, but I believe the article left some gaps that should be filled.
The so-called deadline for closure of Long Island landfills results from the 1983 Long Island Landfill Law that was passed by the State Legislature with the overwhelming approval of the Long Island state legislators.
The rationale for this law was the designation by the Environmental Protection Agency of Long Island as the first sole-source aquifer area in New York State.
What this means is that Long Island is dependent solely on its underground aquifers for its drinking water. It follows that anything we do above these aquifers will affect the quality of our drinking water. 
Accordingly, dumping garbage into landfills in areas over aquifers should be banned, and this is what the Landfill Law did. It banned the use of landfills for garbage in the so-called deep recharge areas of the Island by Dec. 18, 1990.
Some town supervisors have been critical that the state mandates laws, but does not supply the funds to implement these laws. The facts are that the ''state'' that promulgates these laws are our representatives and that the ''state'' has supplied funds to help municipalities meet their obligations under these laws.
The 1972 Bond Act supplied $250 million to New York municipalities to build solid-waste facilities as substitutes for landfills. Long Island municipalities have been allocated $56.5 million, or 21 percent, of these funds.
The towns that have received or will be receiving these funds (assuming they meet the necessary criteria) are:
Hempstead $2,000,000
Oyster Bay 5,000,000
North Hempstead 4,000,000
Islip 7,500,000
Smithtown 2,700,000
Huntington 14,000,000
Babylon 14,000,000
Brookhaven 8,000,000
Most of these towns made requests for these funds when the 1972 Bond Act was passed. There is no record that the East End towns made any request for these funds. Perhaps this is why they have not received any.
In addition to the above funds, for the last three years Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has offered to the Legislature a bill that would result in towns or counties receiving large sums of money annually for solid-waste purposes. This bill, the ''unclaimed nickels bill,'' has not been passed by the Legislature, nor has it come up with a substitute bill that would provide these monies.
In addition to the above-listed funds, the state has allocated to Long Island towns $1,638,625 to be used for recycling operations.
It is difficult, therefore, to understand why the Long Island Supervisors have been saying that they get no financial help from the state.
To suggest that the towns have not been receiving much guidance is also misleading. New York State has a Solid Waste Management Program that sets a hierarchy for waste disposal. Each municipality is required to develop its own solid-waste plan, basing it on its own particular needs.
The New York State recommended hierarchy calls for waste reduction, recycling, waste-to-energy and landfilling in that order.
Waste reduction will require state implementation of laws that give incentives and disincentives to industry to reduce packaging. It also will require changing some of our living habits. Landfilling is not an option on most parts of Long Island because of the Long Island Landfilling Law.
Accordingly, Long Island towns really only have two options: recycling (including composting) and waste-to-energy facilities.
It has always seemed to me that the best way to solve Long Island's waste-disposal problems would be with a regional approach. Rural areas like the East End might be able to handle their garbage differently than the urban areas on the West End.
While the East End might be able to recycle and compost much of its garbage, it may not be able to handle all its garbage in this manner. Arrangements with West End towns to burn some of their waste might make sense in these cases.
The waste-to-energy facilities built in Hempstead, Babylon and Islip, and being planned for several other towns, are equipped with emission controls that minimize emissions.
They are the most-regulated factories in our state and produce a significant amount of energy, thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuel. At the same time, these facilities reduce the volume of the waste stream by 90 percent.
The recent concern about markets for source-separated paper is not a new one. Decisions to bury or burn paper, however, should be made on ''true'' economic facts. Landfill or incinerator capacity is selling at prices varying from $50 to $100 a ton.
When local towns refuse to pay to get rid of their paper at the cost to the town of $25 a ton and decide to bury it, they are losing $25 to $75 of landfill space. They will argue that their constituents will not allow them to take garbage from other towns and therefore they cannot sell their landfill or burn capacity.
It has taken, and will continue to take, a major effort to get Long Islanders to source-separate recyclables. Announcements that it is not economical to recycle paper will only play into the hands of the cynics who are saying that Americans will not recycle. Why should anybody source-separate their garbage when they learn it will be buried or burned anyway?
The answer may be to convince Long Island citizens that we are all in the same boat (we are all on the same island), and that the best way to solve our problems is by working together. Bad ground water does not know political boundaries.
Partial attempts at regionalization are occurring. Smithtown and Huntington are planning to use each other's facilities. The East End towns are planning a regional recycling program.
Perhaps, belatedly, we are coming to our senses.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINNION;
Reducing the Labor Shortage

BYLINE: By Frank R. Lautenberg; Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat, is in his second term as United States Senator from New Jersey.

 BODY:
AMERICA'S economy and certainly New Jersey's economy are built on the foundation of a quality work force. That's why a severe and growing shortage of qualified workers threatens New Jersey's continued economic growth.
Hamburger restaurants that used to ask ''Where's the beef?'' now ask ''Where's the staff?'' Yet the labor shortage extends far beyond fast-food workers, to include nurses, electronic technicians, retail clerks and many other occupations. Just how serious is the shortage? One survey reported that more than 80 percent of New Jersey businesses last year had trouble finding skilled labor, 55 percent couldn't locate clerical help and almost 50 percent couldn't find unskilled labor. 
New Jersey isn't alone. According to the nation's personnel administrators, 43 percent of all businesses across the country are having problems finding qualified executives. Two out of three are having trouble finding technical help.
Whether it be the Census Bureau trying to set up for the 1990 Census, retailers in small strip shopping centers, hospitals trying to recruit nurses and medical technicians, or well-established companies like Gallup Polling and Spencer Gifts that have closed New Jersey operations because of lack of labor, shortages are beginning to limit and even reverse our economic growth.
Along with that troubling portrait is a picture of opportunity. Our cities are full of people looking for work. One can go into Newark and find neighborhoods with 50 percent youth unemployment. In the midst of our worst labor shortage in memory, we should seize the opportunity to enlist these unemployed to help meet the shortage of qualified personnel.
For years, our concern with the labor market was unemployment and how to put America back to work. Now we have to switch gears and deal with a labor shortage. Why?
First, seven years of economic expansion has resulted in our outgrowing available human resources. Over the last year, three million additional jobs were filled nationwide. Yet the population of working-age people grew by only two million.
Second, between now and the year 2000, our work force will be slow-growing, older and more disadvantaged. In fact, our work force is growing at a slower rate than at any time since the 1930's.
Third, rapidly advancing technology is making the skills of many workers obsolete and overtaxing recent graduates. It's produced the nation's much publicized ''skills gap.''
The labor shortages of today can be the bottlenecks of tomorrow. In fact, they are already limiting our growth, increasing inflation and damaging American competitiveness.
The problem warrants attention. Government can help the private sector and our future workers by highlighting the mismatch between the work force and available jobs. The Labor Shortage Reduction Act Of 1989 legislation that I introduced and that passed in the Senate in July and is pending in the House of Representatives - would take the first steps toward reducing growing shortages.
It would require the Department of Labor to prepare an annual list of national labor shortages by occupation. Before we can reduce our labor shortage, we need to know the occupations and skills affected.
The bill also calls on the department to develop an annual plan to reduce the shortages identified. The plan would include measures to increase education, training, counseling, recruitment, and job redesign.
Lastly, the bill requires the department to conduct research to improve the accuracy of these projections and to seek ways to spot shortages at the regional, state and local levels.
We need to get a handle on our labor shortages and address them. It's in labor's interest, business's interest and the interest of every student and job seeker looking for the right career. It is supported by the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O., the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. But we need to do more. This labor shortage presents us with an opportunity we must not miss. Many cities are not sharing in the nation's economic prosperity. Their young people still suffer from high unemployment and dropout rates. These people want a chance. They want a chance to help reduce the labor shortage.
In a democratic society, we have a moral obligation to see that the disadvantaged among us get that chance. A chance to be well educated, skilled and employed. And given America's labor shortage, this isn't just a moral obligation, it's an economic necessity.
In order to prepare students and the unemployed for shortage occupations, we need information. We need to know the occupations which lack workers and the skills that employers require, and we must plan to prepare our people to fill the open jobs.
But the problem of inner-city education is much larger. It demands our attention and our resources, or we'll seal the fate of our educational underclass. I have just introduced legislation that deals directly with the education problems of inner-city youth. I propose the creation of model high schools, or what I call Community Education Employment Centers. These centers will have the resources to deal effectively with the barriers to urban education.
We cannot delay in meeting the challenge of growing labor shortages and developing an educated and skilled inner-city work force. Only if we all work together can we heed the warning of America's labor shortage and give our urban poor the chance they have been waiting for.

HEADLINE: 4th-Generation Hotelier Faces Challenge of Filling Huge Casino

BYLINE: By DONALD JANSON

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
WHEN the billion-dollar Taj Mahal casino hotel opens next year, Mark Grossinger Etess will be the man responsible for filling it with patrons.
That will be no small task. The Taj will be a behemoth. The casino alone will be longer than three football fields.
With 120,000 square feet of floor space, it will be the world's largest casino, Mr. Etess said. The biggest one in Atlantic City now, the TropWorld, has 87,760 square feet. 
The hotel portion of the Taj complex is no midget. The 1,250 guest rooms and suites will make it the biggest casino hotel here and one of the world's largest casino hotels. The rooms are in a 42-story tower, which will make the Taj Mahal New Jersey's tallest building.
Marvin Roffman, casino analyst for the investment banking and brokerage house of Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said the Taj, the most expensive casino resort ever built all at one time, would have to take in $1 million a day to break even. ''The Taj is going to be a very expensive property to operate,'' he said, ''with a $95 million annual debt service and an annual payroll of $125 million.''
''It will also have the highest overhead per room of any casino hotel in the world,'' he added. ''Its casino will have to win more money per year than any casino in the world in order to operate in the black.
''Adding to our concern is the possible state of the economy in mid-to late 1990. A recession could be a big short-term negative for so leveraged a property. Because this is a single-use structure, holders of its $675 million in first mortgage bonds have little to fall back on should the Taj not work.''
If all this is intimidating to Mr. Etess (pronounced ET-is), the 37-year-old president and chief operating officer of the Taj, he does not show it. ''There is no question in my mind that the Taj will be the industry leader in revenues from the day we open the door,'' he said.
He said the door would open in the spring, perhaps as early as April. It will be the city's 12th casino and the third for the Trump Organization.
Mr. Etess, a fourth-generation hotelier, has had a meteoric rise in the business. He grew up in the resort world as a member of the Grossinger family that owned Grossinger's Hotel and Country Club in the Catskills till they sold it in 1985.
After a degree in economics from Columbia University and graduate work at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration, Mr. Etess, a New York City native, became vice president and general manager of Grossinger's.
He spent a lot of time in Las Vegas, he said, because ''I was always infatuated with the casino industry; I just loved the energy, excitement and activity.''
He became a consultant to the Claridge Hotel and Casino here in 1982 while still at Grossinger's, then moved here in 1983 as director of marketing at the Golden Nugget.
He was vice president for marketing when the Trump Plaza hired him as executive vice president in 1986. Using his contacts with Michael Spinks and others he had known in the boxing world who used Grossinger's as a training camp, he was instrumental in bringing major heavyweight bouts to Atlantic City's Convention Center. Since the convention hall is attached to the Trump Plaza and many high rollers are attracted to boxing, this marketing tool paid off handsomely on the casino floor.
Mr. Etess's efforts led to bookings of some of the biggest Mike Tyson heavyweight championship fights. There is an oil painting by LeRoy Neiman of the Tyson-Spinks fight on the wall of Mr. Etess's office across the street from the 17-acre Taj Mahal construction site.
From childhood on, Mr. Etess has been equally familiar with showroom entertainers, now an important staple of casino marketing. ''Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme spent their honeymoon at my house on the grounds at Grossinger's,'' he said. ''Eddie Fisher married Debbie Reynolds in my living room.''
His marketing acumen was a key factor in lifting the Trump Plaza from the middle of the pack in earnings to the level of the top performers. He became president of the Plaza in May 1988, and under his direction the Plaza joined Caesars casino hotel last year as the first and only casinos here to exceed $300 million in annual gross revenues.
''This has to be attributed directly to Mark's effectiveness,'' said Stephen F. Hyde, chief executive officer of the Trump casino properties. ''He is one of the brightest, finest executives you will find in any industry. He has assimilated enough about the casino hotel industry in five years to make him more capable in it than most executives with 20 years' experience. He is truly a superstar.''
After his showing at the Plaza, Mr. Etess was made president and chief executive officer of the Taj Mahal on Jan. 1. He said it was a joint decision by Mr. Hyde and Donald J. Trump, president of the Trump Organization.
''This was the big new store in Atlantic City, and I was flattered that they wanted to deal me this hand,'' he said.
He said his marketing team had already lined up $40 million in in-house convention business. He said the Taj would have little competition for that segment of the casino hotel market because it would have by far the most space to offer. The Taj will have 175,000 square feet of meeting and exhibition space, compared with 80,000 at what will be the next largest casino hotel here, the TropWorld.
''We are very impressed with the thoughtful planning and quality going into this project,'' Mr. Roffman, the analyst, said. ''From the standpoint of amenities, this is the kind of property Atlantic City needs for the 1990's. That's when we think the city will be hosting a big convention business and its hotels beginning to reach out beyond their traditional 250-mile radius for customers.''
''From the standpoint of the building itself, we think the Taj makes such a strong statement that it will have a blockbuster opening,'' he added.
But while he called Mr. Etess ''an outstanding operator'' and said ''Donald picked the right person'' to market the Taj, he said it might nevertheless be a monumental job because ''the gaming market in Atlantic City has come to a very substantial slowdown'' this year.
Growth in revenue has been 4.9 percent for the first six months of 1989, as against more than 9 percent annually most years.
''Adjusted for inflation, that is no growth for this year,'' he said.
If the Taj is to be profitable under these circumstances, he said, it will mean taking $200 million in revenue from other casinos, including the other Trump casinos. Such siphoning off of revenue, he said, might cause two or three of the others to fail, as the Atlantis did recently.
''The Taj will be a bigger operational nightmare than the others here,'' said Roger Wagner, president of the Claridge. ''The Taj is a monster. But Mark Etess is one of the premier marketing guys in the city, and marketing is the name of the game. I think they will do all right. The Taj will be a must-see for people coming to Atlantic City.''
He was alluding to its size, opulence, colorful minarets and onion-shaped domes, 8-foot-high gold and bejeweled elephant statues at the entrances and lavish interior appointments and decor. The hotel tower is finished; construction is continuing on the casino and other public space.
Mr. Etess said the Taj Mahal would be able to set higher room rates than anywhere else in town because patrons appreciate ''quality.''
He said the Trump Organization would help solve the problem of inadequate commercial air service to Atlantic City by scheduling stops with planes Mr. Trump acquired when he bought the Eastern Air Lines shuttle for $365 million in June.
Resorts International broke ground for the Taj in 1983 and invested a reported $325 million in it. Construction languished when Resorts ran out of money. Mr. Trump bought Resorts and sold it to Merv Griffin; then Mr. Griffin sold the Taj segment of the Resorts property back to the Trump Organization for $273 million.
Full-scale construction resumed in December. Mr. Etess said the final cost to the Trump Organization would be ''in excess of $1 billion.''
But he is not awed by the prospect of making this big investment pay off. ''It is my biggest challenge so far professionally,'' he said, ''but you meet it with hard work. It is not my biggest challenge over all. That is trying to be a good husband and father.''
He lives in the suburb of Margate with his wife, Lauren, and their children, Rachel and Scott. When he can manage the time, he plays golf, shooting in the 70's. He would like to stay here, even though he expects the Trump Organization to expand to casinos in Nevada eventually.
''I love the East Coast, and I think my best use to my employer is on the East Coast,'' he said.

Project Opens In Overtown

BYLINE: By TIM O'REILEY

 BODY:
BUYERS will soon start to move into a 12-unit condominium building in the long-depressed Overtown area here, completing the first step of an ambitious 30-acre downtown redevelopment plan. The building is only a few blocks from where riots took place in January.
All the units have now been sold, and construction of three more low-rise buildings, with a total of 52 units, is about to begin. The final phase of the project, called Poinciana Village, will be a 12-story building with about 90 units. 
Two other projects in the redevelopment will soon open. Arena Towers, about a block from Poinciana Village, has 352 rental apartments in two buildings and will begin accepting tenants in October.
Biscayne View, which will split 463 rental units between a 31-story tower and a low-rise building, will open by the end of 1990. A third apartment building, called Odessa, may be redesigned as a condominium project.
The director of Miami's Downtown Development Authority, Matthew Schwartz, called Poinciana Village ''the first private investment in Overtown in more than 30 years.'' Overtown is a mostly black area of Miami with a history of poverty.
When all the work in the Overtown plan is completed in about four years, 2,000 new apartments and condominiums and 250,000 square feet of commercial space will surround Miami Arena, along the southern edge of Overtown.
The local and Federal governments have poured about $50 million into the area since planning began in 1983. The money is being used to buy land for leasing to developers on 99-year terms, and to pay for utilities, a new stop for the people-mover train, mortgage and rent subsidies, and two pedestrian malls.
The initial building in Poinciana Village was financed by the developer, Indian River Investments of Miami Inc. ''We had problems getting outside financing because there is a condo glut in Miami,'' said the sales director, David Abrams. The next phases will have conventional bank loans, he said.
Despite the city's financial aid in land acquisition and mortgages, Mr. Abrams said, prices are at market levels. Two-bedroom units with 975 square feet range from $63,000 to $65,800 and three-bedroom units with 1,300 square feet run from $76,000 to $79,800. Mr. Abrams said that potential buyers only ''asked rhetorically'' about safety. ''People had already come to grips with all the negatives and baggage of this being Overtown,'' he said.

From Retreat To Condo Villas

BYLINE: By JACK LAIL

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Billy Hicks and her husband found a rural retreat at Thimble Farms, a brick farmhouse on 100 acres. Her husband died soon after and her children are now grown. Mrs. Hicks still has the house and five acres, but 95 acres, which she sold in December 1987 for $1.6 million, are being developed into River Sound - 43 condominium villas and 125 lots for larger houses.
The quiet area the Hickses chose turned out to be the most bustling real estate market in the metropolitan Knoxville area, which has a population of 610,000. River Sound, on a small peninsula on the north shore of Fort Loudoun Lake - an impoundment created by one of many dams on the Tennessee River - is one of several expected to benefit from a four-lane highway linking West Knoxville and neighboring Oak Ridge, on the north, to Knoxville's airport, south of the lake. 
Construction of the highway has begun and will be completed by the mid-1990's. River Sound lies 2.5 miles west of its intersection with Northshore Drive, which has become a corridor of residential development.
West Knoxville was a strong residential market even before plans took shape for the parkway. Last year, two-thirds of Knox County's 1,846 single-family housing permits were in West Knoxville.
One attraction of River Sound, on which development began a year and a half ago, is its riverside location, a rarity in West Knoxville because most lakefront is in public hands or too rocky for subdivisions. It has a clubhouse with indoor and outdoor pools, two tennis courts, private boat slips for each villa and night security.
The detached two-story villas, each with a basement and two-car garage, range from 2,600 to 3,100 square feet and are priced from $225,000 to $300,000. Lots for larger houses sell from $39,000 to $160,000, depending on the site. Homes are being built in the $300,000 to $600,000 range, the upper end for Knoxville, where the average price of new and resale homes is $89,308.
Builders and real estate agents characterize the Knoxville market as one of stability stemming from high government and government-related employment, despite layoffs in the last year of 1,946 workers - including engineers and other high-paid professionals -by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
The T.V.A., a Federal power and economic development agency, currently employs 2,553 workers in Knoxville. Textile mill closings and layoffs by a large boat manufacturer have also hurt, but housing sales in Knox County for the first half of this year were up slightly over last year, at 2,141 homes.

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: DONORA, PA.;
Glassmaker Plans a Plant

BYLINE: By RICK TEAFF

 BODY:
A DETROIT businessman is working with officials of the Middle Monongahela Industrial Development Association to buy land in an industrial park to establish a 400,000-square-foot glass-production plant.
The factory would represent the first major construction of a heavy-industry plant in many years in an area where economic decline followed mill closings by a once-dominant steel industry. Donora, with a population of 8,000, lies south of Pittsburgh. The businessman, Dean Wiley, formerly an executive with Guardian Industries Inc., glassmakers, established the U.S. Glass Company and plans to produce flat glass. 
The proposed site, in the Donora Industrial Park, is one that the U.S. Steel Corporation left in 1966 when it closed a large mill. Mr. Wiley hopes to break ground in March and start production about 18 months later. He estimates that the $70 million plant will employ 600 workers, including outside contractors.
Thousands of jobs were lost in the valleys surrounding Pittsburgh in the 1980's, when steel makers closed plants to cut costs and reduce capacity.
The tough times triggered a swell of development effort. The Donora Industrial Park, for instance, was bought through community and business donations.
Now Corning Inc. in neighboring Charleroi has committed to a major expansion, and Polycom Huntsman Corporation, a chemical maker, plans to expand its Donora Industrial Park operation. An old warehouse is being renovated in the park to attract smaller concerns.
Robert Watson, general manager of the Middle Monongahela Industrial Development Association, said that once the glass company site was taken, only 40 more acres would remain available in the industrial park. About 212 acres have been put back to use since U.S. Steel left the 272-acre park. The stumbling block to the U.S. Glass project is getting state and Federal officials to agree on an air-quality program, Mr. Wiley said. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, Betsy Mallison, said that Mr. Wiley recently submitted a draft air-pollution permit application that could take six months to approve. But the state is supporting the project. It offered Mr. Wiley $11 million in loans to woo him away from a Cleveland site he was considering, and pushed through a long-awaited $17 million highway connection between the Donora-Monessen Bridge and Interstate 70.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Eastport, Me.;
Waterfront Renovations

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

 BODY:
A 102-YEAR-OLD three-story building that originally housed a candy store has found new life on this city's waterfront, where half the buildings have been or are being renovated.
Dick McGoldrick, a yacht dealer from Portland, Me., bought the structure, called the Beckett Building, for $70,000 a year ago and spent $90,000 on repairs. He retained its ornate hand-carved wood shelving and added a wood stove and a pew from a nearby church. He opened a bookstore on the ground floor and built and rented two apartments on the second. The third floor will be an apartment and an office. 
To residents here, the renovation is a symbol of what has happened to their city in a short period. Eastport was once seen as the Appalachia of the Northeast, with unemployment as high as 40 percent and low real estate values. Now it is attracting investment from developers, businesses and individuals. The 10.6 percent unemployment rate is still much higher than Maine's average of 3.8 percent, but city leaders say the rate is dropping.
Of the state's ports, only Portland, the largest city, has a larger cargo port than Eastport, and several companies and individuals have started aquaculture ventures, raising Atlantic salmon off Eastport's shore. In addition, the construction on Water Street, which is the heart of the downtown, has created dozens of jobs.
Mr. McGoldrick said for the bookstore, an ice cream shop, a restaurant and a gift shop he has opened in three restored buildings on Water Street, he has hired at least 30 people, a boon to a city of 2,100. Most of the buildings in the downtown, which has been designated a historic district, were built of brick in the late 1880's after a devastating fire.
Eastport, the easternmost city in the United States, is on Moose Island, connected to the mainland by a bridge. Cobscook Bay is on one side and Passamaquoddy Bay on the other.
''A lot of locals are concerned about how Eastport is being revitalized, concerned about real estate prices,'' said Edward French, managing editor of the local newspaper, The Quoddy Tides. He cited a house that sold for $9,000 one day and $20,000 the next. ''The downtown is the most visible manifestation of what is happening in Eastport and the whole coast, for that matter,'' Mr. French said.
Mr. McGoldrick said he hopes the projects under way will increase tourism, and he envisions people cruising the coast in pleasure boats. An Eastport native, James Segien Jr., opened a marina on the south side of the island this summer, to provide fuel for pleasure boats. Also this summer, a cruise ship for the first time made seven stops in Eastport.

HEADLINE: Towns Seek Limits on Plastic Use

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AFTER the General Assembly failed to act this year to ban the use of plastic foam food packaging, more than a dozen communities have started to take the matter into their own hands.
''Everybody was going to wait for state action,'' said Jean Blue, an assistant to the Mayor of Hamden, John L. Carusone. ''But people are ready for this now. This is an idea whose time has come.''
Last month Hamden became the first community in the state to impose such a ban. Under the Hamden ordinance, food wrappings made of polystyrene will be banned beginning March 1. Violators will be subject to fines of $100 a day and jail terms of up to three months. 
Polystyrene, the material used in throwaway hot-drink cups, fast-food containers and supermarket meat trays, has drawn the ire of groups concerned with the growing problem of solid-waste disposal. It accounts for only a small percentage of all solid waste, but polystyrene's critics have attacked it because it is used for only a short time and then thrown away and because it is not readily degradable and persists in the environment for a long time.
 
Limits on State Purchases
The General Assembly's Environment Committee discussed banning foam containers last session, but the measure never reached the full Assembly. But the Assembly did enact a law prohibiting the state government from buying, after Jan. 1, 1991, products packaged in plastic foam made with chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals some scientists say are responsible for destroying the earth's ozone layer.
This week, Stamford and New Haven will consider ordinances to ban plastic foam food packaging made from polystyrene, and New Britain, Southbury, New Milford and Cheshire have begun drafting their own measures.
Eleven other communities, including Danbury, New Fairfield, Hartford and Wallingford, have requested copies of the Hamden ordinance as the first step in adopting their own, Ms. Blue said.
Officials in Stamford are considering a ban on polystyrene food packaging used by fast-food restaurants, company and institutional cafeterias, and supermarkets. On Thursday, the health committee of the Representative Town Meeting will consider evidence for and against such a ban at a public meeting at 7:30 P.M. at the Government Center, 888 Washington Boulevard.
 
'Our Biggest Worry'
''The stuff going into our waste stream is the least of our concern,'' said the committee's chairwoman, Ruth H. Power. ''It's the coffee container that gets thrown into Long Island Sound or that gets tossed in the street and washes down a grate and helps clog a storm drain that's our biggest worry.''
''You don't like to go around banning this and banning that,'' Ms. Powers added, ''but it doesn't seem industry is responding terribly quickly to the problem.''
''This is only a small step,'' she said of the proposal. ''But if we don't start working now to save the environment, we may be too late.''
In New Haven on Tuesday, two members of the City Council, Steven G. Mednick and Elizabeth McCormack, will formally propose a ban on polystyrene food packaging for that city.
''We'd combat the image of America as a disposable society,'' Mr. Mednick said. He said that while plastic foam makes up about 5 percent of the waste in New Haven, it is disproportionately represented in litter because it does not break down. As Mr. Mednick walked a city street recently explaining his proposal to a local businessman, he was able to impress his point as the two kicked foam hamburger containers out of the way.
Explaining the timetable for his proposal, Mr. Mednick said it would probably take four to six weeks before a draft would be finalized and several more weeks for it to go through public hearings. But he said that there was widespread support and that he expected such an ordinance to be on the books by November. If so, he added, the ban would be phased in over six months.
 
Business and Plastic
''We don't want to give industry too much of a jolt,'' he said. ''We realize business has been using plastics for a long time, and we need to give them time to switch to biodegradable products.''
Some businesses are also joining the movement and are switching from polystyrene coffee cups, plates and containers to paper.
Aetna Life & Casualty in Hartford and the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton are phasing out the use of foam containers in their cafeterias and coffee shops. And Alvaro da Silva, the president of Silva Associates of Ansonia, which operates eight Burger King franchises in southwestern Connecticut, said his restaurants were switching from plastic to paper coffee cups.
Together, the companies use several million cups each year, as well as uncounted other disposable products, their spokesmen said. They have made the switch even though paper costs more than three times as much as plastic.
''As environmental issues go, this is really just a very small thing,'' said A. Steven Perelman, a spokesman for Aetna, which estimates it uses 3.5 million plastic foam coffee cups a year. ''But we've all got to start doing something about the problem.''
John T. Kirkland, the environmental manager for Electric Boat, said, ''We share the concern of the city that, as the landfill is filling up, we should be reducing what is going into it.'' Paper cups are biodegradable and can be used in a composting operation, Mr. Kirkland added.
Mr. da Silva said he had received no complaints from his Burger King customers about the paper cups, although they have less insulation than the polystyrene ones, which makes them more likely to burn a customer's hand and causes the coffee to cool off quicker.
''Where we have already changed, we haven't seen any drop in sales,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''People realize what we're trying to do and they support it.''
Representatives of the plastics industry have challenged an ordinance similar to Hamden's in Suffolk County, L.I., where it is law. The Suffolk law is awaiting a court-ordered environmental impact statement, but since it was approved in March 1988, it has served as a national model for such measures and prodded the development of plastics recycling centers.
Harvey R. Schatten, the general manager of Eastern Paper of New England in Stamford, which distributes both plastic and paper disposable products, says the environmental efforts are misguided.
''A lot of the paper coffee cups are plastic coated, and they're just as nonbiodegradable as plastic,'' Mr. Schatten said.
He also said there was no reason to switch to paper, because it was feasible to recycle plastic and he cited plastic recycling operations in New York and Massachusetts as proof.
Mr. Schatten said that a year ago 90 percent of his sales were for plastic foam and 10 percent for paper. Now, he said, the ratio is nearly 50-50.
''All they're doing is creating a tremendous shortage of paper,'' Mr. Schatten said, ''If everyone switches over, they're won't be enough paper to go around.''
But environmentalists cite a number of reasons to ban plastic foam. They point out that it is made from petroleum, a nonrenewable and largely imported resource, while paper is made from trees, which can be replanted.
 
Costly and Bulky
While the plastic foam can be recycled, it is so light and bulky it is impractical to transport to a recycling center, they say, because of the space it takes up and the resulting high cost per pound.
Environmentalists also want to reduce reliance on plastic foam because the state is switching from landfills to trash-to-energy incinerators, and plastics, when burned, give off more pollutants than paper.
Thomas J. Turick, the environmental manager for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said he knew of no Connecticut-based companies, besides Aetna and Electric Boat, that were phasing out the use of plastic foam.
''To say we should ban plastic is not a great idea until we know what we're going to replace it with,'' Mr. Turick said. ''Whatever we replace it with might not be as easy to recycle.''
 
The Price of Foam
But Anne R. Gobin, a senior environmental analyst with the State Department of Environmental Protection's recycling section, said plastic foam is not easy to recycle. ''You have to look at the economic viability of recycling, and it's very costly to collect plastic foam and deliver it to a recycling center,'' Ms. Gobin said.
She said the best change she had seen was at school kitchens in Cromwell, which switched from plastic foam food containers to ceramic dishware. ''Now there is no waste generated at all, because the plates and cups are washed and reused.''
Kathleen Provencher, a spokeswoman for William W. Backus Hospital in Norwich, said her hospital's switch to paper cups in the cafeteria meant a big jump in price. The cups are more expensive - 3.2 cents each instead of 0.8 cents - and employees have been using two cups at a time for coffee so they do not burn their hands, she said. That practice dropped after the employee newsletter suggested wrapping a napkin around the cup, she added.
Kelly A. Anthony, a spokesman at Lawrence and Memorial Hospitals in New London, said the hospital cafeteria switched to paper for infrequent customers and began selling ceramic cups to regulars, with a coupon good for five free refills.
Mr. Anthony said the hospital was also considering using cloth diapers in its maternity ward, instead of disposable ones.

HEADLINE: Steel City Still Needs Help Despite Big Steel's Comeback

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARY, Ind. Aug. 31

 BODY:
Plumes of smoke and steam billow again from the stacks of the USX Corporation's Gary Works, signaling the dramatic revival of big steel along the southern shore of Lake Michigan.
But in the streets of downtown Gary, where the roiling clouds from the mill once meant money in the pockets of local merchants and steelworkers, there is cruel irony in the industrial rebound.
The steel mills are booming again, but Gary is not.
Like other manufacturing centers in the Midwest, where single large employers sustained the local economy for decades, Gary and its workers are victims of the new industrial reality: factories are making a comeback, but often the price of the recovery is fewer jobs and paychecks.
 
Steel's Success Is City's Pain
At USX's giant Gary Works, which looms over the city and the lakefront, the investment of hundreds of mbillions of dollars in new technology and automation now allows the company to produce nearly the same amount of steel it did a decade ago with one-third the work force. 
''It's a great success story for the company, but it has been a painful experience for us,'' said Thomas V. Barnes, the Mayor of Gary, a shabby, faded city of about 140,000. ''The fact is, a business that once employed 21,000 people now employs about 7,500, and that number is probably never going to go any higher.''
 
A Search for New Anchors
Even Labor Day here is not the holiday it once was. From 1908 until the 1970's, the day was often marked with parades and celebrations, but this year as in the recent past, the only celebrations planned are picnics by union locals and other groups.
Proclaimed the ''City of the Century'' when it was founded as a steel-company town in 1906, and named after Judge Elbert H. Gary, who was then chairman of USX's predecessor, U.S. Steel, Gary has been forced to embark on a difficult, even desperate, search for other anchors for its drifting economy. There are plans to lure tourists by allowing legalizing gambling casinos along Lake Michigan and by dredging lakefront marinas in the shadows of the huge steel plants.
David Allardice, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, says Gary is in much the same situation as many small Midwestern cities that have had to rely on a single heavy industry.
''Until recently, whenever there was any kind of recovery from an economic slump, in steel or autos, both the industry and community would often snap back at a new high,'' said Mr. Allardice. ''But because of modernization and automation, you just don't have the big snapback in blue-collar employment like you used to.''
 
'A Lot of Whiskers'
Last month the company announced that it was investing $230 million to add a third caster to roll steel at the Gary Works, which it describes as the flagship of the USX empire. But while the new equipment is expected to increase efficiency and production, it will also result in the permanent reduction of 400 jobs over the next two years. The company says no layoffs will be necessary; the payroll will be reduced as workers leave and retire.
Nationally, manufacturing employment has rebounded slightly in recent years, to about 19.7 million workers. But it remains below its peak of 21 million in 1979.
And the power of once-mighty industrial trade unions has declined steadily even though the work force has grown. Fewer than 17 percent of the nation's workers are now union members, down from 24 percent in 1979. Membership in locals of the United Steel Workers of America has fallen even faster, to about 700,000 from a peak of 1.4 million in the late 1970's, said Greg LeRoy, research director for the Midwest Center for Labor Research, a worker advocacy group.
In the steel mills, these changes have altered the profile of the labor force, reducing opportunities for younger workers. The average age of a steelworker here is now over 40. ''To work in the mills now, you need a lot of whiskers, at least a dozen years' seniority for the lowest-rung jobs,'' said Mr. LeRoy.
Unionists also complain that much of the maintenance and general labor in the mills is now done by contract employees, who work for service companies that are largely nonunion and pay lower wages.
 
'Poor Blacks Are Out of Luck'
James B. Lane, a historian at Indiana University Northwest here who has written a history of Gary, says the new industrial reality hit this city particularly hard because it has so many poorly educated, unskilled laborers.
''That means a lot of poor blacks are out of luck, as far as trying to get a job in steel,'' he said.
The reductions began with layoffs during the recession of the early 1980's, when steel production reeled from the competition of foreign producers. Unemployment in Gary topped 20 percent four years in a row, beginning in 1982, and thousands of people moved away. Since then, nearly 30,000 high-paying steel jobs have been lost among five steel producers along the 20-mile crescent of shoreline around Gary: USX, Bethlehem Steel in Chesterton, the Midwest Division of National Steel in Portage, and Inland Steel and LTV in East Chicago.
Even so, no mills closed, and over the last two years the resurgence in steel profits and production has improved the broader economy of northwestern Indiana. Edward H. Bowles, director of area development for the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, an electric utility, said that home sales and school enrollment are up in some Gary suburbs and that 12,000 jobs have been added since the local labor market bottomed out in 1985. Most are in construction, retail stores and other services.
Even Gary has added almost 1,000 manufacturing jobs, mostly in small factories that serve the steel industry, said Mayor Barnes. Nearly half of the workers at USX still live in the city, and USX accounts for about 40 percent of Gary's property tax base.
 
Unemployment: Over 11%
But unemployment in Gary still hovers over 11 percent - twice what it is in the suburbs, Mayor Barnes said. The city has been unable to draw merchants back to a downtown that began to decline in the 1970's, when merchants followed the flight of white residents to the suburbs.
Gary was about 55 percent black in 1970, when the population was about 175,000. Now the figures are estimated at 85 percent and fewer than 140,000. A few neighborhoods are tree-lined and well-kept, but downtown is a desert of boarded-up storefronts and abandoned buildings. The shell of a 300-room high-rise hotel, which opened in 1969 as a Holiday Inn and closed six years later, towers over City Hall.
A $16 million downtown convention center has been mostly idle since it opened in 1981, and even the new $1 million terminal at the Gary Municipal Airport remains locked and empty because regular commuter airline service has never materialized.
But Mayor Barnes believes that Gary's location, on the lake and just 40 minutes from Chicago, will lead to new growth eventually. Among other things, he and other local boosters are promoting Gary as the site of a major airport to relieve congestion at O'Hare International and Midway.
''We have got to diversify,'' the Mayor said in a recent interview. When he was elected in 1987, defeating Richard Hatcher, who had been Mayor for 20 years, it was on a platform of replacing Mr. Hatcher's style of confrontation with one of cooperation with local businesses, including USX.
 
An Uneasy Relationship
Over the years, relations between Gary and the company that created it have been strained. Even now, some critics say USX is dragging its feet on a promise to sell the city 325 acres of lakefront for a new marina even though the city approved new tax abatements for the company.
But in early August, the city and the company did join in giving a conference for suppliers and other steel industry vendors on the advantages of moving to Gary. More than 300 companies attended, and at least one executive said his company was now seriously considering such a move.
It is a measure of Gary's downtrodden situation that the city had no hotel of its own to host the promotion. So the big caviar and filet mignon dinner to woo the visiting executives was served at the Star Plaza in nearby Merrillville.

HEADLINE: The Post-Industrial Era Is Over

BYLINE: By LESTER C. THUROW; Lester C. Thurow is dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The sun is about to set on the post-industrial era.
No one should mourn its passing.
In the post-industrial era, service jobs were supposed to replace the manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition, much as manufacturing employment once replaced the farm jobs lost to higher agricultural productivity. To theorists of the 1950's, this meant a transition from an economy based on dirty heavy industry to one based on clean, well-lit offices. No more Pittsburghs. 
This scenario always had problems. While services have created most new jobs - 88 percent of all new jobs in the past 10 years - average service wages have been well below average manufacturing wages and productivity has suffered mightily.
In the decade ahead, however, demand for services will slow down. Wages will rise and, as a result, productivity in the service sector will grow more rapidly while many fewer service jobs will be created. There are several reasons for this.
Most of the growth in service employment (91 percent) in the past 10 years is traceable to three rapidly growing industries: health care (17 percent), retail trade (29 percent) and producers services (45 percent). If output in these industries were to grow more slowly or productivity were to start rising, the rapid expansion of the service sector would come to a halt. Both are about to happen.
The demand for health care has risen because of the interactions between an aging population, the development of expensive new technologies to treat the ailments of old age and expanding health insurance coverage for the elderly. These factors will continue but the rising expenditure trends cannot. Moves are now under way to limit spending on health care. When these efforts are successful, and ultimately they must be successful, health care employment will stop rising.
The rapid expansion of the retail sector is the product primarily of the explosive growth in the numbers of working women. The result is fewer meals eaten at home and the new convenience of shopping 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In both cases, there are natural limits to expansion that we are not far from reaching.
The growth in financial services (a major component of producers services) is easily explained by the telecommunication-computer revolution and the abolition of Government capital controls. Together they produced a world capital market with a wide array of new financial instruments.
But the expansion in financial services is essentially a one-shot adjustment to these changes. When that adjustment is completed, and most of it is now behind us, employment growth automatically will slow down.
 
Lacking strong and e
Lacking strong and effective unions, U.S. service workers have never been paid as well as their foreign counterparts. Private service workers in the U.S. earn only 67 percent as much as those in manufacturing. In Japan. they earn 93 percent as much and in West Germany 85 percent as much.
Low service wages have had two effects. First, they have allowed an enormous expansion of jobs, as people did the work in the U.S. that was being done by machines abroad. Parking lot attendants are unknown in Sweden, where they have been replaced by plastic cards. With automatic ticket-selling machines, automatic ticket checking and unattended lift loadings, Swiss ski resorts use few workers. Unattended machines sell gasoline at night in Europe.
Second, low service wages dragged down productivity growth rates, creating a productivity crisis that is still the focus of public policy debate. grown at the rate of West Germany's, the U.S. would have added only 3.5 million service jobs between 1972 and 1983, compared with the 14.2 million jobs that were actually created.
The reason productivity growth lagged was that U.S. companies invested relatively little capital per worker compared with other advanced nations. In Japan or West Germany, for example, capital investment per worker in the service sector is much higher and growing twice as fast. If service wages were to rise, American companies would be forced to use those same higher productivity technologies.
And service wages are about to rise. The reason? The U.S will one day have to balance its trade deficit. To achieve a trade balance, America must either export more manufactured goods or replace imports with domestically made alternatives. There is no other way. The green revolution has eliminated most American agricultural export markets and the amount of services that can be exported is limited; most services simply have to be produced where they are used.
To produce the goods needed to balance the trade accounts, American manufacturers will need to hire 4 million to 5 million new workers. With the baby boom generation fully employed and the subsequent ''baby bust'' generation reaching working age, the labor pool will be shrinking. Thus, most of these workers will have to be attracted from the service sector. This will lead to a shortage of workers, rising service wages and, as a result, greater investment in labor-saving technologies. Productivity will rise sharply and many fewer people will be needed.
The combination of slowing demand and accelerating productivity growth in services should spell the end of the post-industrial era. What is replacing it is old-fashioned manufacturing with a modern, robotics face. The only question is whether the manufacturing will be done by American companies or foreign.

HEADLINE: Myth of Methanol

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Murky Choices on Methanol'' (Economic Scene, Aug. 2) raises some important questions about the efficacy and costs of methanol as an alternative to gasoline, yet fails to address them fully.
For example, you mention methanol's toxicity as being only a claim by the American Petroleum Institute. But Dr. Toby Litovitz of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington found methanol to be 25 times as deadly as gasoline. According to Dr. Litovitz, ''the acute hazard posed by conversion to methanol-based fuels is unacceptable due to the predicted increases in fatalities, blindness and permanent neurologic disability.''
Dr. James Cannon of the environmental group Inform notes that because of methanol's toxicity and solubility through the skin, ''self-service gas stations could be a thing of the past with this fuel.'' Aside from detailing the fuel's potentially lethal effects, Dr. Cannon points out that it could easily contaminate water supplies, because ''removal of methanol from water is virtually impossible.''
You discuss methanol's high cost as if it were merely a possibility dependent on natural gas demand. This ignores a report by the United States Office of Technology Assessment that rated methanol fuel as the most expensive means, among 11 methods studied, of reducing volatile organic compounds (ozone precursors). The O.T.A. estimates that methanol costs a mean of $30,000 to reduce a ton of volatile organic compounds, compared with an average cost of about $2,135 per ton for the other methods. These other methods include simpler suggestions for reducing air pollution like enhanced inspection and maintenance programs and tighter gasoline volatility standards.
The American public cannot afford to buy into the myth that methanol is a cheap and clean fuel. Methanol is expensive, dirty and deadly.

HEADLINE: Must U.S. Free Trade Include Jobs Export?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Dr. Feelgood's prescriptions, accurately identified by Anthony Lewis on the drug issues (column, Aug. 13), also apply to other issues, and there is a link between the two insofar as the ultimate outcome is concerned.
On trade policy, our Dr. Feelgood has been the approach of the traditional free traders who, for a variety of reasons, have carried out a policy of surrendering major labor-intensive industries to foreign producers working out of low-wage and low-living-standard economies. These surrenders, over the last 30 years, have brought a serious reduction in the availability of lower-skilled jobs at the manufacturing level. 
These are the entry-level jobs to which the generation of drug sellers identified by Mr. Lewis would have been directed in earlier years. These are the jobs that would have permitted development of skills, the furthering of useful education, and the maintenance of a sense of worth now so sorely missed. New York's garment industry is but a shadow of its former self. The rural textile towns in the South whose companies and plants have been decimated are now coming face to face with crack dealers, and they are overwhelmed by the experience. There will be more.
In the rush to help third-world countries develop their sorely stressed economies, we have overlooked the third world in our midst. We continue to give jobs and incentives to the Caribbean while the Caribbean's emigres and exiles suffer in our own inner cities and while the leadership of the countries we seek to help so often remains mired in corruption and incompetence.
Far more sensible would have been the preservation of some ''inefficient'' but real jobs than seeking to put domestic manufacturing through the wringer of global competition based on cheap labor. Footwear, consumer electronics, apparel, textiles, steel, automobiles, fasteners, machine tools, photographic equipment and most recently data processing -the long and still-lengthening lists testify to lost opportunities. The increased ''efficiencies'' of the few survivors in those industries need to be balanced against the inefficiencies to our economy that Mr. Lewis describes. Those are costs, just as solid and economic in impact as the allegedly higher cost of goods that consumers might have to pay to keep their countrymen gainfully employed.
American international policy, whether it focuses on trade or political relationships, needs to be directed by first reference to America's domestic interests. We continue to make concessions to the People's Republic of China in order to maintain listening posts on the Soviet Union, while few believe the Russians to be tomorrow's threat - much less today's. The threats to our system that matter most are internal. New York City, whose citizens are increasingly confronting deteriorating conditions every day while at home and en route to work, is a classic example of this failure of vision. These problems tie together. Until the linkage is made, we will deal piecemeal and without success with the problems they spawn, from drugs and homelessness to an uneducated work force with no incentive to educate itself.
Enterprise zones and business stimulation programs are fine, but for what businesses? Who will survive the evolving competition between American-based American companies, and American companies producing overseas with cheap labor and selling into their ''home'' market? Mr. Lewis notes that ''Leadership could do something about our national hypocrisy on drugs.'' It also could do something about our hypocrisy on trade and other issues, where Dr. Feelgood assurances are granted and disbelieving corporations move jobs overseas as quickly as their dollars and jet planes will take them.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Fly Now, Pay Never

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Leona Helmsley's conviction for tax evasion evoked much schadenfreude, pleasure at her misfortune. People remembered what her former housekeeper testified she had said: ''We don't pay taxes. Little people pay taxes.''
But Mrs. Helmsley symbolizes something more important than the abuses of the rich. She is an extreme case of a general condition afflicting American society. That is the philosophy of entitlement: the belief, held by millions without regard to income or class, that we are entitled to the benefits provided by civilized government without paying for them. 
The current debate about catastrophic medical coverage for the elderly provides an interesting example. Last year Congress extended Medicare to provide such coverage, to be financed by a supplementary tax on about 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Organizations of the elderly are resisting the tax as too high.
At a protest meeting in Chicago last month, the president of the Illinois State Council of Senior Citizens, Jerry Prete, said the beneficiaries should not have to pay for the new program at all. They should get it free.
There are legitimate arguments about the best ways to finance catastrophic health care for the elderly. But abandoning the Social Security-Medicare principle of insurance paid for by special taxes would not make the program ''free.'' It would just mean that a large group of Americans - the elderly, regardless of need - would get money from general tax revenues.
But of course there are no general tax revenues to pay for that program or for a dozen others that could be called urgent. The Federal Government is spending vastly more than it takes in. It has been for years, and there is no chance whatever of balancing the budget at current levels of taxation.
There's the rub: taxes. Low taxes are grist for political demagogues. What politician is going to talk responsibly about budgets and taxes when his or her opponent can so easily appeal to the American belief that we can have something for nothing?
Here in Massachusetts an organization called Citizens for Limited Taxation has succeeded over the last decade in limiting property taxes and cutting the state income tax. Its director, Barbara Anderson, is a highly skilled lobbyist and public organizer. She has the support of a demagogic and influential radio talk show host, Jerry Williams.
The message hammered home so successfully by Ms. Anderson and Mr. Williams is that taxes are bad. They never talk about the public programs that must be abandoned as the state's revenues shrink.
Massachusetts is now in a severe fiscal crisis. Gov. Michael Dukakis, politically weakened at home by his poor showing as a Presidential candidate last year, has had little success with calls for restoring tax revenues. As a result, state spending will have to be savagely cut.
When the cuts are made, the public is angry. Cities and towns are threatening to sue because Governor Dukakis reduced state aid to them. Schools that should have more money are getting less. The system of health care for those in desperate need is threatened.
People in this state want better schools and the other things government pays for. They probably understand, most of them, that the striking economic progress of Massachusetts in recent years has been built in part on superior education. But they also want low taxes. And they do not connect one with the other.
The disconnected state of mind is just as striking on the national scene. It was the special province of Ronald Reagan.
We didn't really believe President Reagan when he told us that lower taxes would bring in more revenue. But we didn't agree with his plans to cut Federal programs either. The result: a crippled Federal tax base and an unending deficit. Or as Mr. Micawber put it, misery.
So we go on depriving ourselves of the things a country must have to prosper, certainly to lead: decent schools, a rational system of medical care, a healthy environment. And so it will continue, until sooner or later a political leader talks sense to the American people instead of demagoguery - until someone makes us understand, as Justice Holmes said, that taxes are the price of civilization.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK: Policy

BYLINE: By Clyde H. Farnsworth Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
It started in 1898 when the Republic was scratching for revenue to fight the Spanish-American War. Congress levied a ''temporary'' tax of 1 cent on each telephone call valued at 15 cents or more.
Although the tax was allowed to expire three years later, Congress returned to it in 1914 when World War I broke out in Europe. And for most of the last 75 years, the ''temporary'' telephone excise tax has been an integral part of the American tax code. 
Now at 3 percent of the charges on all telephone calls, this tax yields $2.6 billion a year for the Federal Government, a small but important contribution to a $1.2 trillion budget.
Someday, perhaps when Voyager 2 reaches the ''dog star'' Sirius, the telephone tax will expire. But because the Government is more strapped for cash than ever, chances are slim that this will happen anytime soon.
But whether the tax is officially labeled ''permanent'' or ''temporary,'' is a matter of contention between the House and Senate, illustrating anew that in Washington, form can never be divorced from substance.
The political issue arises because the tax is regressive, an economists' term meaning unfair to the poor because a flat tax on telephone calls takes a larger share of income from the poor than from the rich.
Back in the last century, telephones were still a luxury, and the levy was sold as a luxury tax. But telephonic communication today is a staple of individual and commercial life, touching both the rich and the poor.
''If we were not already enjoying the revenues, we would not now be levying a telephone tax,'' said John E. Chapoton, a Washington tax lawyer who is a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for tax policy. ''It's no more logical to tax phone calls than it is to put a tax on letters or any other form of communication.''
A bill that the Senate passed last spring would end the fiction of a temporary tax by making it permanent. For the first time in the history of the telephone tax, no expiration clause would be written into the law. The Bush Administration supports the bill, which designates the tax receipts for expanded child care services.
But Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, sees things differently. The Chicago Democrat, who has not completed work on the House tax bill, wants to continue treating the telephone tax as temporary, with an expiration date of 1991.
House members, subject to re-election every two years, tend to be more sensitive to the issue of regressive taxes than do Senators, with their more insulated six-year terms.
As it now stands, the telephone tax is due to expire at the end of 1990. In 1965 when the rate was 10 percent (it got as high as 25 percent in World War II), the tax was to be eliminated in stages over three years. But there were repeated changes that stretched out the life of the tax.
By 1981 the rate had fallen to 1 percent, but the final step, total elimination, was deferred. Then in 1982 Congress raised the tax to 3 percent, where it was remained.
Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research organization, calls the tax a ''political freebie.'' Because the tax has been around so long, he says, politicians take no heat in extending it.
Yet as an excise tax, he contends, it is really an anomaly, since no one pretends that taxes on other commodities, like gasoline and alcoholic beverages, will ever expire.
Recognizing political reality, that once a tax gets on the books it is practically impossible to take it off, the telephone companies have long stopped fighting the measure.
''Sure, we'd like to see it go,'' said A. J. Linnen, director of media relations for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. ''It doesn't seem to be enlightened public policy to have consumers paying a tax for something as basic as communication services.
''But we're pragmatic. At a time of budget constraints and trying to hold down taxes, we recognize that keeping this tax on the books is an easy way out.''

HEADLINE: MOST JOBHOLDERS CONTENT, POLL SAYS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
Most full-time workers in the United States say they are satisfied with their jobs at least to some degree, but workers born since World War II, who entered the work force since 1960, are much less satisfied than older workers, a Gallup Poll says.
Overall, 28 percent of the full-time workers interviewed said they were ''completely satisfied'' with their job, while 60 percent said they were ''mostly satisfied,'' 9 percent said they were ''mostly dissatisfied'' and 3 percent said they were ''completely dissatisfied.'' Surveys often show this bent toward satisfaction, since unhappy workers are often able to change jobs. 
But when it came to specifics, significant minorities - 20 to 30 percent of the full-time workers in the poll - said they were dissatisfied with some aspects of their jobs, including the amount of money they earned, their chances for promotion, the amount of pressure from their job, and their health insurance and other benefits.
 
Not Related to Income, Poll Says
The overall level of job satisfaction was not related to income, and the generation gap in job satisfaction was not a consequence of any differences in income or seniority between older and younger workers, according to analysts at the Gallup organization.
The division was between workers over and under 50 years of age. Most of the older workers were children in the Depression and entered the work force in the 1940's or 1950's. Most of the younger workers, born since World War II, entered the work force in the 1960's, 1970's or 1980's, and for the most part they have known only economic expansion.
The national poll, conducted by telephone and based on 697 adults employed full-time, was conducted July 18-21 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was prepared to be made public on Labor Day.
Of full-time workers over 50, 44 percent said they were completely satisfied with their job. This was almost twice the level expressed by younger generations of workers. Among workers 30 to 49 years old, 25 percent said they were completely satisfied, while among workers 18 to 29 years old just 24 percent said they were completely satisfied.
 
Of Attitudes Toward Work
Regarding a different attitude toward work, the survey also found that 58 percent of all full-time workers said they got ''a sense of identity'' from their job, while 39 percent said their job was just what they ''do for a living.''
This sense of personal identification with one's work was in turn linked to job satisfaction. Workers who said they derived a sense of identity from their work were almost twice as likely to be completely satisfied with their job; 34 percent of them said they were completely satisfied. Of those who said their job was just an economic necessity, only 19 percent were completely satisfied.
Among full-time workers there was a similar proportion of members of each age group saying they gained identity from their job.

HEADLINE: U.S. Job Death Rate Still Relatively High

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 3

 BODY:
More workers are killed on the job in the United States than in most other major industrialized countries, according to a report that says the deaths cost the nation's economy at least $15 billion each year.
Workers in this country are 36 times more likely to be killed than are Swedish workers, and 9 times more likely to be killed than the British, the National Safe Workplace Institute found in its annual Labor Day weekend report. 
''The evidence indicates that the United States is slipping in its efforts to reduce job injuries,'' Joseph A. Kinney, the group's executive director, said in the report, made public Saturday. The National Safe Workplace Institute is an independent group based in Chicago that studies job safety issues.

HEADLINE: Few Gains for Qaddafi In Drive to End Isolation

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Sept. 3

 BODY:
With fireworks in the night and the spectacle of the visiting Nicaraguan President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, riding an Arabian horse in a beachfront race, the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, today wound up a celebration of 20 years of what the official press agency called ''the greatest revolution ever waged.''
But the three days of razzmatazz, with a cost that has been estimated at $300 million, registered no apparent major new gains for what diplomats call a drive by Colonel Qaddafi to end years of isolation.
The 47-year-old leader, who took power in a coup on Sept. 1, 1969, has moved recently to befriend neighbors and seek bridges to the West, particularly in Europe. But the celebrations revealed uncertain relations with King Hassan of Morocco that could jeopardize the newly created Arab Maghreb Union. They also revealed ambiguous European attitudes toward the Libyan leader and a continued and chilly distance between him and the mainstream of Arab diplomacy. 
According to some Palestinian and Western officials, Colonel Qaddafi has moved to greatly reduce, if not sever, his support for Damascus-based Palestinian movements, including followers of Ahmed Jabril suspected of involvement in downing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last December. But many Western governments, including the United States, remain wary of the depth of his commitment to withdraw support from terror groups and thus maintain embargoes and sanctions imposed years ago.
 
Sponsored Many Groups
In the past, Colonel Qaddafi sponsored many groups regarded in the West as terrorists, including the West German Red Army Faction, the Irish Republican Army and dissident Palestinian groups such as those led by Abu Nidal - the nom de guerre of Sabry al-Banna - and Mr. Jabril, both suspected or accused of major acts of terror.
In 1986 West European governments imposed sanctions on Libya after the bombing of a discotheque used by American personnel in West Berlin. Britain had broken relations with Colonel Qaddafi's Government after the shooting of a British policewoman in London outside the Libyan mission in 1984.
European attitudes remain ambiguous, fractured by competing perceptions of national interest. France and Italy, with strong economic interests here, have eased the restrictions, which include avoding high-level visits to Libya. But Britain and the Netherlands say they have seen no hard evidence that Colonel Qaddafi has changed his policies.
In an effort to assuage the British, Colonel Qaddafi has sent messages to his missions abroad saying that Libya does not support violence by the I.R.A. in Northern Ireland, Western diplomats said, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher remains unconvinced. She did not reply to an invitation to the weekend's celebrations, diplomats said. At the same time, Western diplomats said, Colonel Qaddafi has withdrawn support for West German guerrillas.
Last month, Western diplomats said, Colonel Qaddafi summoned representatives of what one envoy called ''70 so-called liberation movements'' and ''told them they had to close up shop here and if they wanted financial assistance it would be provided through official channels outside Libya.''
 
Will Still Support Some
The identity of those movements remained unclear, and Colonel Qaddafi said in a speech on Friday that he would continue support for groups in several countries, including South Africa and the Israeli-occupied territories.
Diplomats and Palestinian officials said that three months ago, Colonel Qaddafi told groups led by Mr. Jabril and Col. Saed Musa, both opposed to Mr. Arafat, that direct funding to them would be reduced or ended. They were also urged to close their offices here.
Libya has reportedly told those groups that all aid to Palestinians will be channeled through the Palestine Liberation Organization office here, but other reports suggest that the Libyan leader has reserved the overwhelming bulk of financial support to Palestinians for the underground leadership of the uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Some diplomats and analysts here trace Colonel Qaddafi's decision to lessen his isolation to the United States bombing raid on Tripoli in April, 1986, which one Western diplomat said ''showed his vulnerability.''
''The raid misfired in one way because the people rallied to Qaddafi,'' the diplomat, who requested anonymity, said, ''but it also showed him that expansionist policies had a personal price tag for him. And he realized his army could not protect him. The psychological impact was deep.''
 
Oil Prices and Chad Defeat
At the same time, however, Libya's four million people were registering increased discontent as the bounties of high oil prices disappeared and the store shelves became bare. Colonel Qaddafi's army, meanwhile, remained bogged down and facing defeat in an unpopular war in Chad that left few families untouched and his isolation near-total.
''His ideology is not so dominant that he cannot see that things have gone wrong,'' the diplomat said.
Colonel Qaddafi shifted course and restored ties with neighboring Tunisia and Algeria. Opening the border with Tunisia, his neighbor to the west, residents said, he simply took the expedient step of clambering aboard a bulldozer and flattening the customs and immigrations posts so that now there is no formal frontier on the Libyan side.
In February he joined Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Morocco in forming the Maghreb Union, which is supposed to create an economic group, in part to respond to the prospect of a single European market in 1992. But there other motives, too.
''The Tunisians and Algerians have an interest in trying to lock Qaddafi into the grouping rather than leave him isolated outside of it, where he might cause trouble,'' an Arab diplomat in the region said. ''And they want some of Libya's money, too.''
 
Meeting With Mubarak
Then, in June, Col. Qaddafi met with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to launch a reconciliation with Egypt after a decade of hostility. On Friday, Libya signed a peace treaty with Chad. And despite his aversion to the avowed moderation of the P.L.O., he seated its Chairman, Yasir Arafat, prominently at the celebrations here this weekend.
But his initiatives seem blocked by personal and ideological differences with other Arabs, including King Hassan and Mr. Arafat.
''The situation is now very critical, because Qaddafi has not decided which way to go - in favor of Arafat or in favor of Arafat's opponents,'' an Arab official said. The debate touches the core of Western Europe's ambiguous approach to Colonel Qaddafi, too.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Some Luster Is Lost For Spanish Tourism

BYLINE: By ISABEL SOTO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The thousands of vacationers lured this summer to the island of Mallorca by rock-bottom hotel prices have benefited from the slump in Spain's leading industry, tourism.
The bargain-basement prices in Mallorca, less than $20 for full board and lodging, were both a symptom and an aggravating element in the situation. Amid fears that rooms would remain empty, the hotels started a price war.
Although Spain is still the world's second-most-popular tourist destination, after the United States, statistics show a pointed slowing of growth. Official figures released last week showed arrivals in July were down by 2.6 percent from July 1988. For the first seven months of the year, arrivals rose only three-tenths of 1 percent. 
Last year, this measure of tourism increased 7 percent, to a record 54.1 million visitors in a country of 39 million people.
 
Gloomy Outlook Confirmed
Tourism revenues confirm the gloomy outlook. Revenues in dollars were down by 6.3 percent in June. For the first half of 1989, revenues dropped 2.6 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier.
For the first time, tourism revenues will not be able to cover the yawning current account deficit, which is expected to reach $11 billion, or 3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, in December.
''Such ridiculous prices may create a dangerous spiral,'' said Julio Rodriguez Aramberri, director general of the state-run Turespana ''It's not bad for there to be accommodations for everyone, but I think it's dangerous if more affluent persons start to feel uncomfortable.''
Some experts say the stagnation that led to the price cutting in the industry has resulted in part because tourist officials have encouraged mass tourism since the days of the Franco dictatorship.
 
Quantity Over Quality
''Quantity was encouraged over quality, and this is the legacy we have received,'' said Mercedes Truyols, head of Mallorca's Tourism Office.
This long-standing policy helped to transform the idyllic Spanish Mediterranean coast into an often nightmarish urban wall of big, unattractive hotels and apartment blocks, often with scant attention to environmental basics like clean beaches.
The building boom that has been a driving force in Spain's economy has increased the available accommodations in vacation apartments and hotels by 20 percent to 25 percent this year. But occupancy levels declined at the same rate.
Hotel operators say the situation was not helped by Spain's reputation for poor airports, roads and telecommunications, the rising crime rate and the strength of the peseta against foreign currencies.
 
Caviar and Champagne
''Even if hotels offered French champagne and Russian caviar at breakfast, the tourist would always risk being robbed,'' said Luis Callejon, president of Zontur, a group that represents resort hotels.
Public officials suggest that radical changes are needed in the tourism industry, which represents around 9 percent of gross domestic product.
The proposals include improving quality, especially at seaside resorts, and promoting the cities and the largely unknown interior regions.
''Certain types of tourism - cultural, sporting, health and rural - can be developed,'' said the Tourism Secretary General, Ingnacio Fuejo Lago.
 
American Tourists
Although relatively few in numbers, American tourists are important because they spend more for better accommodations. The number of Americans increased 31.4 percent in June and is up 6.4 percent for the first half of 1989.
Spain is looking forward to 1992 when the Olympic Games in Barcelona and a World's Fair in Seville will almost inevitably add to the influx, while Madrid is being promoted as a European cultural capital. As a result, tourism experts believe Spain will attract 1.5 million additional visitors in 1992.
But Spanish unions worry that the free circulation of labor in the European Community, which also begins in 1992, will create greater competition in the already precarious seasonal job market. They fear that tourist industry workers in other parts of Europe tend to be better qualified and speak more languages than their Spanish counterparts.
European Community rules requiring people from developing nations to obtain visas in 1992 may also damage tourism.
 
Helping Themselves
But some experts believe that Spaniards themselves may be the salvation of their own tourist industry.
Since the death of General Franco in 1975, restrictions have been eliminated and Spaniards have begun to travel more. This year, Spanish vacation spending has risen sharply.
Spain's economy, meanwhile, has flourished, with inflation reduced to single digits and growth at 4 percent to 5 percent annually, the European Community's highest rate. That has led Spain's regional and local governments to scramble to attract Spanish tourists.
''Spaniards discovered the rest of the world in the late 70's,'' said a tourism analyst who declined to be named. ''They are now discovering their own country. The economic impact may be greater even than international tourism.''

HEADLINE: Bid for UAL Seen Passing U.S. Scrutiny

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Although the Government has indicated that it is prepared to take a harder line against leveraged buyouts of airlines, it is unlikely to reject outright a $6.75 billion bid for the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, analysts said over the weekend.
The bid, for $300 a share, was presented to UAL's board on Friday after the stock market closed. Marvin Davis, who offered $275 a share for UAL, said in a letter to the board that he might top the bid made by a group led by the pilots' union and UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf. UAL's stock rose $7.25 a share on Friday, closing at $287. 
After Mr. Davis, a Beverly Hills, Calif., billionaire, made his initial bid of $240 a share on Aug. 7, a senior Transportation Department official said, ''We would look at Mr. Davis or any other bidder very carefully.''
The Transportation Department has become especially concerned about leveraged buyouts since a group led by Alfred Checchi, the Los Angeles financier, acquired NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, for $3.6 billion earlier this year. The deal involved considerable debt.
Although airlines have reported record profits lately, the industry is still one of the most cyclical and is easily buffeted by changing economic trends. The Government is concerned that during a recession, a heavily leveraged airline might be forced to sell off assets, like airplanes or routes, or that it might be tempted to skimp on maintenance.
''The trend is very disturbing,'' Senator Wendell H. Ford, the chairman of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, said at hearings earlier this year. ''Given the tenuous nature of discretionary travel, an airline laden with debt will likely face a very bumpy ride.''
Mr. Ford, a Kentucky Democrat, has ordered a study by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
Samuel K. Skinner, the Transportation Secretary, is expected to devise a policy on leveraged buyouts by next month.
Among the items that the Government will be considering in its ''fitness review'' of a UAL deal are how the buyout would affect the airline's safety standards and its ability to buy new airplanes; whether it will be forced to sell critical routes or equipment, and how well the restructured airline could weather an economic downturn and a resulting drop in passengers.
Under its broad mandate, the Transportation Department can revoke United's operating certificate, should it deem it financially unfit. But such a drastic move, which would ground the airline, is unlikely, the analysts said, since it would put thousands of employees out of work and would conflict with the Government's other mandate - to enhance airline competition.
 
More Likely Approach
''They'd be hard pressed to do that,'' said Ed Greenslet, an analyst with ESG Aviation Services, a consulting firm based in Jacksonville, Fla. ''That's tantamount to putting the company out of business.''
It is more likely that the Government would ask the winning bidder to meet certain financial criteria. ''They can use their power to force the owners to meet a more stringent standard of equity or to beef up the board of directors,'' Mr. Greenslet said.
The analysts said the Transportation Department might be more likely to look favorably upon the labor-management bid than the one from Mr. Davis. Mr. Wolf, United's chairman, is a respected manager who, before joining the carrier in late 1987, gained a reputation as a turnaround artist at Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines.
Another concern the department might have about the latest bid is its provision for British Airways P.L.C.'s to have a 15 percent stake in UAL. Under United States law, foreign airlines are limited to owning 25 percent of American carriers and are prohibited from having a controlling interest. But the department's officials, concerned about the growing trend of foreign ownership, have said that they may review the policy.
Lately, airlines have been forming global links that cross national borders. The Scandinavian Airlines System, based in Stockholm, owns just under 10 percent of the Texas Air Corporation. And in the recent NWA buyout, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines of the Netherlands, acquired nearly 20 percent of the American carrier.

HEADLINE: Steel Prices Are Lowest In 2 Years

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Reflecting softer demand from automobile producers and appliance makers, steel prices have declined to their lowest point in nearly two years. And industry analysts said prices would remain weak or decline further the rest of this year.
At the same time, the operating rates for the nation's steel mills have tumbled, to 76 percent at the end of August. That figure, the lowest weekly operating rate this year, compares with 89.5 percent in the comparable period last year and a high of 93.9 percent at the end of March. 
Prices for flat-rolled steel, used in making automobiles and appliances, averaged $375 a ton in August. That was the lowest since the third quarter of 1987, when the price averaged $370 a ton, according to the AUS Group, a Philadelphia economic forecasting firm. Flat-rolled steel prices reached $430 a ton in the fourth quarter of last year.
 
Impact on Consumer Prices
For steel makers, who have had two profitable years, earnings will be lower this year. For steel customers, the declining prices will enable them to better control costs and to hold down the prices they charge consumers for automobiles and household appliances.
The large auto companies and appliance makers buy steel on contract and are not immediately affected by fluctuations in steel prices. But in the next few months, many appliance companies, like the General Electric Company, White Consolidated Industries and the Maytag Corporation, will negotiate with steel companies on establishing prices for next year's contracts.
''Even though our steel prices are fixed for some time, we see this as something beneficial for us over the long term,'' said the purchasing director of a major appliance manufacturer, who asked not to be identified. ''But this will certainly help us when it comes time for our negotiations for the next round of price contracts.''
 
Specialty Manufacturers
Steel service centers, the industry intermediaries who buy steel and cut and shape it to customers' specifications, are already seeing the lower prices because they buy largely on a spot or short-term contract basis. Service centers represent 25 to 30 percent of the nation's steel customers, and they produce everything from flat-rolled and plate steels to specialty products.
''Our members are always concerned about weakening in business conditions because they carry sizable inventories,'' said Andrew Sharkey, president of the Steel Service Center Institute, a trade group based in Cleveland. ''But our reading of consumption is that it's still fairly strong. What's happening is people trying to get their supply in line with slightly lower demand.''
The downward pressure on steel prices is the result of several economic factors. While there has historically been a seasonal decline in manufacturing in the third quarter, the steel situation was aggravated this summer by slowdowns in auto production, which, analysts said, had caused parts suppliers to reduce their steel purchases.
Many steel customers also accumulated large inventories early in the summer, when it was thought that labor disputes might disrupt supply. But the five companies with contract talks this year settled, and steel supplies have not been interrupted. ''Right now, there is still a little too much steel chasing too few buyers,'' John Jacobson, an economist with AUS said.
The decline in prices has spread beyond flat-rolled steel, which accounts for 60 percent of the industry's production. The more expensive grades of steel, like stainless steel, have also seen weaker pricing. Stainless steel prices are down slightly from their level of a year ago, largely as a result of the lower price of nickel, which is used in the production process.
Prices have not declined for all steel products, however. Several steel companies have increased prices 5 to 8 percent on tin mill products, the thin sheet steel used to make cans.
Mr. Jacobson said the lower prices would help producers over the long term because they make competing materials less attractive. ''When steel prices escalated over the last two years, there was great concern over the attractiveness of steel as a commodity to be used in future products,'' he said. ''But lower prices will keep steel competitive in the eyes of manufacturers.''
The large steel producers have already responded by cutting production slightly. Last year's production of 90.8 million metric tons will probably be off about 2 to 5 percent for the year, analysts said.
One senior executive of a major steel company, who asked not to be identified, stressed that the declining prices had not affected all products and that overall steel consumption had dropped only slightly. ''Prices are only slipping in some product areas, but we're seeing continued strength in plate prices and structurals,'' he said, referring to products used in construction.

HEADLINE: For Hispanic Paper, a Rising Market

BYLINE: By ALBERT SCARDINO

 BODY:
El Diario/La Prensa, the Spanish-language daily newspaper in New York City, is the latest media organization to realign its ownership and management in an effort to capture the attention of a booming Hispanic market.
The sale of the paper last week was not a large transaction. Neither the Gannett Company, the seller, nor El Diario Associates, the management-led group that bought it, would disclose the price, but several analysts said the figure barely exceeded $20 million. Media deals 10 times that size are now commonplace, and several transactions have reached into the billions of dollars. 
What makes the sale of El Diario noteworthy is that it reflects a striking change in the makeup and distribution of New York's - and America's - Spanish-reading population since 1980. In the last 18 months, the ownership and focus of several large Spanish-language television organizations have changed as well, as publishers and broadcasters rush to capture a share of advertising expenditures growing at more than 20 percent a year, according to Hispanic Business magazine.
 
New Owners Seek Growth
At El Diario, the new owners hope that by moving out from under the umbrella of the nation's largest newspaper company, they may be able to maneuver more freely to recapture the position the paper held through the 1960's as the leading Spanish publication in the United States.
''In an organization the size of Gannett, you have tremendous resources, but it can take a long time to tap into them,'' said Carlos Ramirez, the publisher of El Diario since 1985 and a partner in the buyout. ''When you have a relatively small operation like this one, particularly one in a development mode, the bureaucracy can stifle your growth.''
Mr. Ramirez said El Diario would conduct its first market and readership survey. ''Our audience has changed dramatically since the 1970's, and we are not sure what our current readers want from us.''
With luck, the new owners said last week, they will regain the top position among Spanish newspapers just as the Hispanic population is emerging as the nation's largest ethnic minority group - and perhaps as the largest single population group in New York City.
El Diario now ranks third among Spanish newspapers, behind dailies in Los Angeles and Miami. The paper had an average daily circulation of 54,800 at the end of 1988.
Likewise, New York City ranks third as a Hispanic population center, according to recent demographic surveys by private marketing organizations.
New York, though, is the nation's communications capital, giving a publication like El Diario more opportunity to persuade advertisers and opinion leaders to pay attention to the emerging Hispanic market.
Gannett had similar ideas when it acquired the newspaper eight years ago. Circulation had plummeted from more than 100,000 in the late 1960's to less than 40,000. Its political influence, at least in New York City, had fallen with it.
Also, a new Spanish daily, Noticias del Mundo, supported by a branch of the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, had moved into the market, although it failed to displace El Diario.
Company officials said at the time that Gannett wanted to create a national Spanish newspaper. Implementing that concept proved difficult. For one thing, internal management conflicts disrupted the plan, Mr. Ramirez said. In addition, Gannett had not anticipated the difficulty of adding a single foreign language publication to its lineup of more than 100 English language newspapers.
''El Diario became something of a stepchild at Gannett,'' said Peter W. Davidson, an investment banker who resigned from Morgan Stanley & Company's media department to become president of El Diario.
Mr. Davidson said Gannett was successful in streamlining operations and controlling costs. ''What was missing was promotion, marketing and revenue growth,,'' he said, ''partly because Gannett could not easily judge how well it was doing when few people in the parent company spoke the language of either the staff or the audience.''
 
Language Lessons
Mr. Davidson has had a similar problem in the days since he became a part-owner. He said he would begin language lessons this month.
El Diario's revenues reached about $15 million last year, and with stringent cost controls, the paper has been able to show a small profit since 1987, but not the annual returns of 20 percent or more of sales that Gannett has come to expect from its papers.
Because Gannett did not own the press that printed El Diario, the paper did not benefit from the advances in production technology, quality control and graphic innovation made by most other Gannett newspapers after the introduction of its national newspaper, USA Today, in 1982.
At the same time, New York City was falling behind Los Angeles and Miami as a center of Hispanic life. A rise in Mexican immigration to Southern California and in Cuban immigration to South Florida gave those areas larger numbers of Hispanic residents.
 
Diverse Population
New York's Hispanic population also became much more diverse. Until the 1980's, migrants from Puerto Rico who settled in New York represented the dominant Hispanic community on the mainland of the United States.
''Hundreds of thousands of people from the Dominican Republic found their way to New York in the last decade, many of them through Puerto Rico,'' said Vernon M. Briggs, a professor of human resource economics at Cornell University. ''Then there was an influx of Ecuadorians, giving New York half of all the immigrants from that country. That was followed by a wave of Colombians.''
The New York metropolitan region is now home to some 2.5 million Hispanic people, according to Mr. Davidson. The number of Colombians and Ecuadorians combined now almost equals the number of Puerto Ricans, which is about one million, he said.
''The only thing they seem to have in common sometimes is Spanish,'' Mr. Davidson said. ''But then when you look more closely, you find common concerns about education, jobs, local politics, all the issues you would expect.''
The size of the Hispanic community in the United States has been increasing rapidly, Mr. Briggs said. It has the highest birth rate and the youngest median age of any ethnic group in the nation, he added.
Census bureau surveys suggest that the poverty rate among Hispanic families is increasing, but so is the number of families achieving affluence. So there is a peculiar mix of advertisers in the Hispanic media.
According to Hispanic Business magazine, both the United States Army and the Immigration and Naturalization Service are among the top 25 advertisers, along with Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble.
With more promotion and marketing effort, the new owners expect to increase El Diario's dominance of the Spanish-language classified market. By switching to a new printer in November, the newspaper will also be able to carry preprinted circulars for the first time.
''At some point, we might be able to produce an El Diario for the other Hispanic communities in the East,'' Mr. Davidson said. ''But then Gannett thought it could do something broader, too. For the time being, we plan to concentrate on New York.''

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Aim at Economic Habits

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The United States has in recent years let the dollar collapse in value while its trade negotiators have denounced, cajoled and pleaded to get Japan to import more American products. But despite some progress, the trade deficit with Japan remains about what it was in 1985.
Thus a great deal of attention is being paid in economic circles to negotiations opening here Monday in which the Bush Administration will try yet another approach.
The talks, which received fresh support on Friday from President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Washington, are aimed at identifying and perhaps altering deeply ingrained economic practices in both countries considered by many to be the biggest factor in the trade deficit, which annuallly totals $50 billion or more.
 
Impediments to Trade
Negotiators call these practices ''structural impediments'' to trade, and they have to do with how each country manages its economy, organizes its businesses and indeed sets basic priorities for its people. 
''Washington clearly expects something dramatic from these talks,'' said Joseph A. Grimes Jr., a former president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo. ''It may happen if there is a friendly effort by both sides. The problem is, it's always easier to solve someone else's problem than your own.''
Among the impediments cited by Washington are Japan's complex and inefficient retail distribution system, powerful business cartels and interlocking relations among supposed competitors and the condoned practices of bid-rigging by contractors.
Another target for criticism is Japan's high savings rate, coupled with the increasing Japanese tendency to invest, not in roads, housing or improvements that might aid consumers, but in companies and real estate in the United States.
The United States contends that these and other practices raise prices and generally stack the deck against business newcomers and importers.
Japan has responded with its own list of structural impediments in the United States that it blames for America's poor export performance. Among these are the budget deficit, the low savings and investment rate and the failure to support research and development, and education.
 
Squandering the Future
In Japan's view, these practices have led America to squander its future. It sees American corporations worshiping at the idols of quick profits and leveraged buyouts rather than investing in the production of goods and services for quality-conscious Japanese consumers.
The talks on these and other structural issues are to include top officials from the State Department, the Treasury and the Office of the United States Trade Representative and top Japanese officials from the ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance and International Trade and Industry.
''We've had a dialogue about these structural problems in the past,'' an American official said of the talks, which are to last about a year. ''The difference is that this time, the effort is action oriented.''
 
Trade Policy Phases
In effect, the talks mark a third phase in American trade policy toward Japan as it has evolved over the last decade. In the first phase, the United States negotiated sector by sector, in areas like textiles, semiconductors, beef and citrus products.
Some of these talks are regarded as successful. After Japan agreed two years ago to open its markets to American beef and citrus products, exports of both soared. But in semiconductors, telecommunications and other areas, Washington has had to resort to threats or retaliation.
Some Japanese, in fact, complain that President Bush's decision this summer to invoke the ''Super 301'' clause of the American trade law, in which Washington threatened to put up its own barriers if Japan did not accept more American products, has poisoned the atmosphere.
In the second phase, the United States agreed with other Western industrial democracies in 1985 to let the dollar fall against the yen to make American products cheaper in Japan and Japanese products more expensive in the United States.
 
Buying U.S. Assets
Many trade experts argue that while the strategy has worked to some degree, it has also simply forced Japan to make itself more competitive and led Japanese investors to buy American assets.
Trade specialists agree that the talks are potentially explosive because they will force each country to look at the other's vested interests and cultural predilections.
''It could be a big mistake for the United States to press us too hard,'' said a Japanese official, asking not to be identified.
In Japan, one of the most contentious issues has to do with a Japanese retail system dominated by 1.6 million mom-and-pop stores whose owners are protected from competition.
 
Neighbors' Opinions
For example, if a small store wants to expand beyond 500 square meters, it must win approval from the Government, which takes its cue from the opinion of neighboring stores.
Japanese officials defend the law as protecting the consumer from confusion in the market, while critics say it is a corrupt system kept alive because small shopkeepers support the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Americans want Japan to abolish its retail store laws and move toward a system of larger stores that, in their view, would be big enough to take risks and buy imported goods directly from importers.
But many Japanese like their smaller stores and feel they give neighborhoods intimacy, safety and convenience.
 
Much Higher Prices
American visitors to Japan are often stunned by prices that are much higher than in the United States, even for products made in Japan.
Last year, Japan's Economic Planning Agency found that compact cars cost 64 percent more in Tokyo than in New York, and color televisions 100 percent more.
Some critics say Japan is deliberately dumping products in America below cost, in violation of international regulations. Others say the problem is more subtle and complex.
For example, the average item sold in Japan goes through four four wholesale distributors before reaching the retailer; while the comparable average number in the United States is less than two. The result is that prices increase at each transaction in Japan.
 
Appearance of Monopoly
Added to this situation is the vertical interlocking relationship between wholesalers and retailers that Americans view as monopolistic.
American officials involved in the talks acknowledge that it will be extremely hard to get the Japanese to change these practices.
Likewise, they agree that it will be difficult to put an end to high land prices, which are believed to make it harder to establish new stores, or to abolish business combines and cartels that lead companies to purchase goods from each other, and not from importers, no matter what the price or quality.
But the main difficulty the new talks face may lie in the fact that Tokyo has prepared its impediments list with perhaps even greater care than the United States.
 
Theme of Decline
In recent months and years, Japanese executives have picked up the theme of America in decline from American books and articles, asserting that the United States has lost its competitive edge because of its low savings and investment rates.
''It's like you are telling us to save less and consume more,'' a Japanese official said. ''The real problem is that the United States should save more and consume less.''
Japan is also recommending that the United States adopt the metric system and ''make more efforts'' - a favorite phrase - to develop products for Japanese consumers, like smaller refrigerators or cars with right-hand steering wheels.
Asked what the United States might commit itself to doing if Japan offers to tackle some of its structural problems, an American official involved in the talks had no ready answer. ''We'll have to do something in order to show that we're sincere,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Security Pacific's Asian Strategy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The word ''Pacific'' stands out in the name Security Pacific Corporation these days.
Looking to profit from its relative proximity to Asia and Asian money, the bank holding company is forging close ties with Mitsui Bank Ltd., the banking arm of the Japanese financial and industrial giant.
Security Pacific hopes the relationship with Mitsui will bring new Japanese banking customers to Security Pacific in the United States.
The ties between Security Pacific, the nation's fifth-largest bank holding company, with more than $85 billion in assets, and Mitsui Bank, Japan's seventh-largest, with $220 billion in assets, include these:
* In June, Security Pacific agreed to sell 5 percent of its consumer and commercial credit finance subsidiary to Mitsui for $100 million. Mitsui has the right to buy another 5 percent stake for the same price. 
* In July, Security Pacific agreed to pay $38 million for 20 percent of Mitsui Manufacturers Bank, a small California subsidiary of Mitsui Bank Ltd. A Security Pacific executive is to become president of Mitsui Manufacturers, and Mitsui is to offer guidance to Security Pacific's Tokyo branch.
* Two years ago, Security Pacific sold half its Japanese consumer and commercial lending operation to Mitsui after a disappointing effort to build the business on its own. The institutions also jointly offer private banking services to their customers in each other's countries.
In addition the two companies have had an understanding to refer business to each other when possible.
Security Pacific's chairman, Richard J. Flamson 3d, envisions far greater possibilities, including teaming up with Mitsui, or another Japanese company, on joint venture deals in the Pacific Rim or in Europe. Security Pacific already has a number of smaller joint ventures in Japan with Japanese banks.
Mitsui also has expansion plans. It and Taiyo Kobe, Japan's eighth-largest bank, announced last week that they would merge to form Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank next year, becoming Japan's second-largest bank after Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. Security Pacific said it did not expect that the merger would affect its relationship with Mitsui.
Assuming their ties remain close, Mr. Flamson even suggests that Security Pacific might eventually be bought by Mitsui or another Japanese company.
Security Pacific makes no projections about the earnings potential or the eventual scope of its relationship with Mitsui, which encompasses only a fraction of Security Pacific's total operations. But Mr. Flamson said in an interview, ''We have an intuitive feeling that it will be very important to the shareholders over time.''
Analysts, too, find the deals interesting, although they see no quick payoff.
 
No Quick Gains
''There are certain things the two can do together, but I don't think you are going to see any visible impact on earnings soon,'' said Dan Williams, an analyst with Sutro & Company. ''It's going to take a while.'' Mr. Flamson, a blunt-talking international banker who has spent more than 20 years cultivating business relationships with Japanese banking executives, said the idea of pursuing joint ventures and transactions with a Japanese bank occurred to him about five years ago, as the most logical way to prevent Security Pacific from being boxed out of growth.
Mitsui was a natural partner because Mr. Flamson considers Kenichi Kamiya, Mitsui Bank's chairman, a personal friend.
Referring to the importance of Japan as a global economic power and to the mutual needs of Japan and the United States, Mr. Flamson said, ''A strong business relationship with a Japanese company or companies is going to be necessary if you are going to have long-term success in the Pacific basin.''
 
An Inside Track
Mr. Flamson's sale of 5 percent of a financial services subsidiary to Mitsui is more important to Security Pacific's business in the United States than across the Pacific. It gives the bank an inside track to the increasing number of Japanese companies doing business in America.
By tradition, Japanese companies have close ties to their banks, which often hold large ownership stakes in their customers' businesses. As an equity partner with Security Pacific, the Japanese bank is willing to channel some Japanese clients to Security Pacific for services like leasing, factoring, accounts receivable financing and inventory financing. Security Pacific also pays Mitsui for referrals.
''Even companies as big and worldwide as Mitsui don't have that kind of capacity in the United States,'' Mr. Flamson said. ''So if their Japanese customers migrate to the United States, they have to find some way to service them or they will lose control.''
 
Proof of Value
The sale to Mitsui was significant for another reason. For years, Security Pacific has considered itself an undervalued financial conglomerate. Selling a tiny piece to the Japanese for 15 times earnings was a quick and prudent way to prove its worth.
Security Pacific's purchase of 20 percent of Mitsui Manufacturers represents a similar reciprocal arrangement. Small business that Security Pacific routinely refers to other banks can now be funneled to Mitsui. In return, Mitsui is supplying Security Pacific's Tokyo branch with business. Also, working together in California, the two can better compete against other banks in vying for the business of midsized companies.
''The logic is we want a profitable business in Japan and they want a profitable business in California,'' Mr. Flamson said. ''Mr. Kamiya and I have been very good friends for many years. We can agree. But it's much more difficult to get that translated down through our staffs.''
 
More Deals Seem Likely
More deals with Mitsui seem likely, but Mr. Flamson will not disclose details of what the two companies are discussing, and he insists other Japanese companies could become involved in Security Pacific's Asian expansion.
Masaru Kakutani, an analyst with Moody's Investor Service who just returned from meeting senior executives of Mitsui Bank in Tokyo, said Mitsui was willing to look at new deals with Security Pacific but had no sweeping long-term plan at present.
''They see it as the beginning of a possibility,'' Mr. Kakutani said. ''More joint operations will have to be things that support each other's weaknesses or enhance their strengths.''
Security Pacific, which earned $638.9 million last year, is an extremely profitable and well-managed company, analysts say. But Mr. Flamson says it could benefit from Japanese help in international securities and merchant banking. Security Pacific has faced some tough going in that area since the stock market crash of 1987.
 
Need for Japanese Partner
''We have not really been successful in penetrating the Japanese securities market in any way,'' he said. ''What that tells you is that it's important for us, if we are going to have a representative securities business in major countries in the world, to have a Japanese partner.''
One focal point for Mr. Flamson is the growing capital markets of Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, where stock markets are vigorous, and merger and acquisition activity is dawning.
The Security Pacific Asian Bank is already active there with a network of 33 branches, some of which were acquired when Security Pacific bought the Rainier Bancorporation of Washington in 1987. The Asian bank, with $3.1 billion in assets, provides private and commercial banking, trade financing and merchant banking.
 
Help in Europe
Mr. Flamson may also look to the Japanese for help in Europe, where Security Pacific's London-based Hoare Govett Ltd. securities trading operation has faced tough times since the stock market crash. It pared back operations last year.
But the most provocative question surrounding Security Pacific's tight relationship with Mitsui, remains California, home to the institution's largest and most profitable operation, its 550-branch retail bank.
But unlike some bankers and business leaders who want to protect their turf, Mr. Flamson said that if an offer for Security Pacific were generous enough, the company would not hesitate to sell.
''We are not committed to the survival of Security Pacific,'' he said. ''We are committed to the best return possible for our shareholders.''
When interstate banking comes into being in 1991, one or two financial institutions will be bought by somebody, he said. ''It could be a New York bank or a foreign financial institution, and the ones in the best shape to do that are the Japanese.''

HEADLINE: Developing Nations Benefit As Service Exports Grow

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Tens of millions of television viewers in more than 100 countries have followed the adventures of a sultry 19th-century Brazilian slave named Isaura who endures all sorts of adversity after falling in love with her master's son but eventually triumphs.
''It's outsold 'Dallas,' '' said Jorge Adib, managing director of Globo International, producer of the series ''Slave Isaura.'' Globo earned $15 million from sales of this and other ''tele novelas'' last year, and expects to earn $20 million this year, he said.
Brazil, which has other ''tele novela'' exporters besides Globo, is among the growing number of developing countries that are finding gold in the export of services, a trend that is likely to have significiant implications for the world trading system. 
The third world's increasing stake in nonmanufacturing activities - like data processing, engineering, and construction, computer software, advertising and tourism, as well as entertainment - is giving impetus to world trade liberalization, many trade officials say.
Developed countries, led by the United States, have long pressed for such liberalization, but until now developing countries had resisted. Curbing barriers in services trade is one of the main goals of the 106-nation Uruguay Round of trade negotiations scheduled to wind up next year.
Third-world service exports have grown to a point where, some private estimates contend, they account for a quarter of the $500 billion-a-year service trade volume. As a result, many developing countries have a rising interest in knocking down barriers to encourage exports.
''We now have coalitions of interest cutting across the old dividing lines between north and south,'' said Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the global trade organization sponsoring the Uruguay Round.
Interviewed at a recent Aspen Institute Forum on the United States and the World Economy, Mr. Dunkel predicted that a ''substantial agreement'' would be reached next year, reflecting the ''happy coincidence'' of the greater reliance on market forces in developing countries and the services bonanza.
India, for instance, turns out nearly twice as many feature films as Hollywood and earns what is estimated to be more than $100 million a year exporting many of them, especially to the Middle East.
Travelers report Indian film posters plastered in cities like Casablanca, Amman, Cairo and Damascus. Arab taxi drivers even hum Indian film tunes. The sharing of some customs between Indian and Islamic societies and similarities in beat and tonality between Indian and Middle East music are among factors cited for India's market penetration.
 
Software Exporters
India and the Philippines are among the leading exporters of computer software. Indian software companies like Tata Consultancy Services of Bombay, with an office in New York, are making inroads in both the United States and Europe.
Arthur Andersen & Company, the large American accounting firm, has a Manila affiliate employing 400 employees who help organizations in the United States and Europe develop computer systems.
''If a client needs specialized software for whatever functions, we can develop that software in Manila and transmit it,'' said Charles P. Heeter, principal at the accounting firm. Although their pay is high by the standards of the Philippines, Filipino programmers earn about a quarter of the pay of American programmers.
Developing countries like the Philippines benefit from the ability to move large amounts of information cheaply and efficiently over long distances. ''The information revolution has made many more information-based services tradeable,'' says Geza Feketekuty, a services trade expert in the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
In Manila, Jamaica, South Korea and Taiwan, for instance, workers code and convert information into machine-readable form for many multinational companies based in the United States.
 
Few Restrictions
In some parts of the third world, particularly the newly industrialized countries of Asia, the services sector is actually growing more rapidly than manufacturing.
Unlike goods, trade in services is not covered by international rules of fair play. Thus, at their discretion, countries can block services imports unilaterally without risk of international reaction.
India and Malaysia bar foreign insurance companies, for example. Indonesia excludes foreign law firms. South Korea has severe limitations on imports of legal, financial and other professional services, as well as advertising, maritime, transportation and telecommunications.
Under the Uruguay Round, services for the first time would fall under the fair-trade rules of the GATT, a 40-year-old charter that is monitored by a Geneva-based organization. Up until now, the GATT has covered only trade in goods.
 
Other Subjects at the Talks
Services liberalization is only one element of the talks, which also focus on getting rid of barriers to trade in farm products; improving protection for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property; improving third-world access to markets in steel, textiles and other manufactured items, and easing investment barriers.
Although many officials are predicting a successful conclusion of the services negotiations by the end of next year, trade negotiators warn it will not be easy.
Despite their progress on exports, many developing countries still argue that they are at a technological disadvantage against the developed countries, especially in finance, and fear that liberalization would only deepen that disadvantage.
So in the trade talks they are insisting on maintaining regulatory sovereignty and phasing in obligations over a longer period of time. They are also demanding transfers of technology.
 
How Technology Is Transferred
Joan E. Spero, senior vice president and treasurer of the American Express Company, said that while her company objected to forced technology transfers, it was providing technology anyway by training employees in other countries.
''In banking and financial services, it frequently happens that local employees are trained by foreign firms, only to move to domestic firms, taking their knowledge and networks of contacts with them,'' she said.
American trade negotiators are trying to convince developing countries that while they all want to export services, those countries have more to gain than to lose in importing services that will help them run their economies more efficiently.
Still, there is great resistance, said Richard B. Self, an assistant trade representative who is one of the top American negotiators.
 
'Afraid of Being Colonized'
''Developing countries are preoccupied with the domination of the multinationals,'' he said. ''They're afraid of being colonized.''
Mr. Self predicted that ''getting down to a common denominator will be awfully tough.''
But the incentives are high. The International Monetary Fund's balance of payments statistics placed the private services trade in 1987 at $504 billion, nearly a tenfold increase from $64 billion in 1970. In the information revolution, future growth could be even faster.

THE ECONOMY
 
Steel prices have fallen to their lowest point in nearly two years, reflecting softer demand from automobile producers and appliance makers. Analysts said prices would remain weak or decline further the rest of this year. At the same time, the operating rates for the nation's steel mills have tumbled, to 76 percent at the end of August, from 89.5 percent in the comparable period last year and a high of 93.9 percent at the end of March. [Page 33.]
 
INTERNATIONAL REPORT
 
Trade talks are set to open in Tokyo today in a new phase of the U.S.-Japan effort to curb the American trade deficit. The talks are aimed at identifying and perhaps altering ''structural impediments'' to trade, which have to do with how each country manages its economy, organizes its businesses and sets basic priorities for its people. The negotiations are expected to last a year, and the going looks like it could be rough. [33.] 
 
Developing countries are finding gold in the export of services. The trend is likely to have significiant implications for the world trading system. The third world's increasing stake in other nonmanufacturing activities that economists generally lump together as services is giving impetus to world trade liberalization, many trade officials believe. [33.]
 
Mallorca's rock-bottom hotel prices have benefited thousands of vacationers lured there this summer during the slump in Spain's leading industry, tourism. Amid fears that rooms would remain empty, the hotels started a price war. [37.]
 
THE MEDIA BUSINESS
 
The sale of El Diario/La Prensa makes it the latest media organization to realign its ownership and management to capture the attention of a booming Hispanic market. What is noteworthy about the sale of El Diario, the Spanish-language daily newspaper in New York City, is that it reflects a striking change in the makeup and distribution of New York's - and America's - Spanish-reading population since 1980. [33.]
 
American City Business Journals Inc. has scaled back considerably from its peak of two years ago as it tries to recover from its rapid expansion. The company has a new chairman and controlling shareholder. His predecessor told employees two years ago that he would never sell his interest for less than $80 a share. In June, though, he settled for $22.75. [38.]
 
Was the Hollywood writers strike worth it? A year after the five-month walkout, a CBS official says the networks permanently lost 2 percent of their viewers, and a guild leader acknowledges that the strike sharply reduced the work for writers. [38.]
 
Yet another battle has flared in the Dallas newspaper war as a result of the attempt by The Dallas Morning News to strip its archrival, The Dallas Times Herald, of such syndicated treasures as ''Doonesbury,'' ''Dear Abby'' and ''Erma Bombeck.'' Press. [38.]
 
COMPANIES
 
Security Pacific is forging close ties with Mitsui Bank, the banking arm of the Japanese financial and industrial giant, hoping that the relationship will bring new Japanese banking customers to Security Pacific in the United States. Greater possibilities are envisioned, including teaming up with Mitsui, or another Japanese company, on deals in the Pacific Rim or in Europe. [33.]
 
The U.S. will study carefully the $6.75 billion bid for UAL. Although the Government has indicated that it is prepared to take a harder line against leveraged buyouts of airlines, it is unlikely to reject the labor-management offer outright, analysts said. The bid, which offers $300 a share to shareholders, was presented to the UAL board on Friday after the stock exchange closed. [33.]
 
Lee A. Iacocca said he has all but decided to leave the chief executive's post at Chrysler at the end of 1991, when his four-year contract expires. [35.]
 
Bloomingdale's has had talks with Soviet officials about opening two shops in Moscow, said its chairman, who is confident that a deal could be completed soon. [34.]
 
TODAY'S COLUMN
 
The I.R.S. has taken action against owners of small businesses who pay themselves what it views as too much or too little. But there are acceptable practices that owners can use to keep from running afoul of the I.R.S. Tax Watch. [34.]

HEADLINE: Hatred and Social Isolation May Spur Acts of Racial Violence, Experts Say

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
A volatile mixture of deep-seated racial animosities, starkly segregated environments and fear of economic change may have fostered the murder of a 16-year-old black youth in Bensonhurst last month, say social scientists who have studied race relations in large cities like New York.
According to police accounts of the killing, Yusuf K. Hawkins was fatally shot after a gang of white youths armed with baseball bats and at least one gun set upon him and three friends who were looking for a used car in the largely Italian-American Brooklyn neighborhood.
Mr. Hawkins's death adds to a list of racially motivated attacks against blacks in the 1980's in communities located on the city's southern fringe in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, where near-homogenous white neighborhoods abound.
Sociologists who have studied the shifting movements and interactions of New York City's ethnic groups say that these largely white enclaves were formed as second- and third-generation families of European immigrants moved out of their former Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens during the last 30 years, distancing themselves from waves of black and Hispanic emigrants arriving from the South, the Caribbean and Latin America.
 
Clinging to Stereotypes
By gravitating to the city's farthest reaches, experts say, the shifting white populations have sought to, and in places like Bensonhurst, succeeded in recreating much of the communal fabric of their old neighborhoods and their ancestral homelands. 
''They see blacks and Puerto Ricans as having invaded their old neighborhoods, and fear the same for their new communities,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, who teaches urban politics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ''There is an anger that the old world they struggled for and made is now passing and that they are just not a powerful force anymore.''
Mr. Mollenkopf and other experts said that because they lack meaningful contact with blacks, many residents of these segregated working-class neighborhoods unquestioningly cling to society's harshest stereotypes of blacks.
Acts of violence against blacks who enter such segregated working-class neighborhoods in New York City fit ''a familiar pattern that has existed for a very long time'' throughout urban centers in America, said Robin M. Williams Jr., Henry Scarborough professor emeritus of social science at Cornell University.
 
'Pressing in on Their Turf'
Dr. Williams, who has studied and written on racial violence since the 1940's, said such killings typically occur when ''young lower middle-class men who are themselves struggling to find a place in the world begin to feel that other groups are pressing in on their prerogatives or turf.''
For many socially isolated people living in all-white areas, Dr. Williams added, ''stereotypes and cultural precepts act to define young black men as dangerous, and therefore, somehow legitimate victims of assault.''
In New York City, violent incidents of this type include the 1982 murder of Willie Turks, a transit worker who was killed by a group of whites in the predominantly Irish-American Gravesend section of Brooklyn. In 1986, another young black man, Michael Griffith, was killed when struck by a car while fleeing an attacking gang of white youths in Howard Beach, Queens. Last October, another black man, Derek A. Tyrus, was run over by a car and killed in Rosebank, Staten Island, by a group of whites shouting racial epithets.
In Mr. Hawkins's murder, experts who study racial violence say, the ''electric current'' was one of the most time-honored motives for violence against blacks: their presumed rivalry for the attentions of a woman.
Police accounts have said that Mr. Hawkins's killers were inflamed by reports that a neighborhood resident, Gina Feliciano, had begun to date black and Hispanic men.
''When I was quite young I learned that it was dangerous for a black man to whistle at a white woman,'' said Adele Dutton Terrell, program director of the National Insitute Against Prejudice and Violence, in an allusion to the infamous lynching of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old who was killed after he whistled at a white woman in Mississippi in 1955. ''All these years later, what this case says to me is that just the rumor of interracial dating remains dangerous.
''In this society women are frequently pointed to as the excuse for violent male emotionalism,'' Ms. Terrell said, commenting on the belief among many Bensonhurst residents that Miss Feliciano is to blame for Mr. Hawkins's death.
 
Easier to Visualize Violence
While housing segregation and lack of social contact was pointed to by virtually every expert as major contributors to racial killings, many experts also asserted that in recent years both in New York City and nationally, political leaders have contributed, either by their statements or their lack of attention, to the demonstrations of deep-seated racial animosities.
Geoffrey H. Eley, a British professor of history at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor who has studied racial hatred and violence internationally, said: ''There is a harsh form of expression of attitudes about social issues -everything from the horrible question of the homeless to the way drugs are explained in public discourse - that plays a big part in creating a situation in which it becomes easier to envisage forms of direct violent action.''
William Kornblum, director of the Center for Social Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said that most politicians have failed to act on growing evidence that ''the pendulum of race relations is moving so strongly toward violence and hatred.''
 
Old Animosities Resurface
Underlying much of the growing racial tension, Mr. Kornblum said, were economic anxieties which serve to spur violent behavior.
''There is a tremendous amount of open racial hostility expressed among white kids and among minority kids -but especially by the lower-income white kids, who have been raised to believe they are supposed to be doing better than blacks,'' Mr. Kornblum said. ''Those of us who investigate this hear it all the time.''
Speaking of the concentration of racial violence in working-class neighborhoods, William V. D'Antonio, executive officer of the American Sociological Association in Washington, said: ''The more limited your educational and social world experiences of other people, the easier it is to have highly stereotyped images of them and the less opportunity you have to open yourself to values and beliefs that would counter the biases.''
Many sociologists have remarked that Bensonhurst, the community where Mr. Hawkins was killed, is in many ways nearly self-contained with blue-collar businesses typically passed from father to son and social codes all its own.
But others cautioned against promoting the notion that bigotry and racial animosities were wholly generated by working-class people.
''Black Americans have been here for more than 300 years, but remain much more segregated than Asians or Hispanics who have arrived much more recently,'' said Dr. Williams of Cornell University. ''There is no other large group in America which is nearly as segregated, and this is true for both high- and low-income blacks.
''There has been an enduring potency of anti-black feelings with us because of the long heritage of slavery and later of racial subordination,'' he said. ''This is advantageous to white people of all classes for reasons of economics, politics as well as the psychological gratification that comes from feeling better than other people by an accident of birth.''
Studies by her group showed that ''one out of every four minority people from any given sample indicate that they have suffered some form of what we call ethno-violence within the last year - this ranges from insults to physical assault,'' Ms. Terrell said.
''In a sense, I barely see why anybody is shocked by this,'' she said of the killing of Mr. Hawkins. ''Every day we have incidents of harassment, intimidation and crime against blacks, Jews, Asians, Hispanics and gays.
''These people were in a neighborhood where they didn't belong,'' Ms. Terrell said. ''The sad lesson is that in America we have neighborhoods where people do and don't belong.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Offering 'Perestroika Perks,' Aeroflot Beckons U.S. Fliers

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, will begin a most American advertising campaign today, appealing directly to business travelers from the United States.
The ads promote Aeroflot's business-class and first-class service on its flights from New York and Washington to Moscow. They urge Americans to collect ''perestroika perks'': complimentary flights to Kiev and Leningrad for passengers to Moscow, chauffeured cars to hotels, free nights at a Moscow hotel and a ''Mont Blanc pen to sign your deal with the Russians.'' Radio commercials unabashedly exploit warming international relations, reminding potential travelers that ''after all, you've got a personal invitation from Mr. Gorbachev himself.''
''We've discovered the American marketing concept,'' said George Terentiev, commercial manager for Aeroflot in the United States. 
But Aeroflot has many obstacles to overcome, including a reputation for uninspired service. Like the Soviet Government itself, Aeroflot is struggling to reverse years of bureaucratic inertia and indifference toward consumers. For instance, Aeroflot only last spring opened a toll-free reservation number for passengers.
''Before, you couldn't communicate with us,'' said Mr. Terentiev, a former water-polo player who has an office in the Pan Am Building in midtown Manhattan.
 
Campaign Begins Today
''They're really going to have to put on a Western-style campaign to win the hearts, minds and pocketbooks of Western business travelers,'' said Michael Billig, editor of Business Travel Management, a magazine for corporate travel managers. ''Executives feel better flying an American airline than one that is semi-shrouded in secrecy,'' he added, a reference to Aeroflot practices like not reporting crash statistics in the Soviet Union.
The campaign, which begins this morning on radio station WINS-AM in New York City and will appear in national publications this month, is part of a marketing plan intended to generate desperately needed hard currency. Aeroflot has already run advertisements in trade magazines in an effort to reach travel agents, many of whom remain ignorant about the airline, the world's largest.
Aeroflot, with roughly 140 international destinations, is a highly visible symbol of the progress of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, and the Soviet leader has taken a special interest in revamping the airline. ''Aeroflot is on the cutting edge of glasnost and perestroika,'' said John P. McCaffrey, vice president of industry affairs for the Pan Am Corporation.
Last year, Pan Am and Aeroflot began joint flights from New York to Moscow. Using Pan Am Boeing 747's staffed with Soviet and American flight attendants, the airlines each sell half the seats. Aeroflot resumed its own flights to the United States in 1986, after a three-year ban imposed by the United States after a Soviet fighter plane shot down a Korean Air Lines 747, killing 240. The United States had previously imposed sanctions against the airline after the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 and the Soviet-backed imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981.
 
A $1 Million Effort
Aeroflot has hired the Middlebrook Group, a marketing company based in Wilton, Conn., and Kelley Swofford Advertising, an ad agency based in Miami, as well as Jeanne Westphal Associates, a Miami public relations firm. Officials at Aeroflot declined to disclose the size of the advertising campaign, but conceded that its overall marketing effort would cost more than $1 million this year, up from a negligible amount in 1988.
A large portion of Aeroflot's advertising budget is aimed at travel agents. ''The biggest problem with Aeroflot is that we know very little about them,'' said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the American Society of Travel Agents.
Although the airline recently opened a toll-free number exclusively for travel agents, they are still unable to issue tickets directly for Aeroflot flights. But the airline hopes to join a large computer reservation system soon that would give it considerably more influence with agents.
 
Round-Trip Ticket Costs
Round-trip, economy-class tickets from New York to Moscow cost $1,085 if purchased 21 days in advance. The business-class fare is $2,685, and first-class travel runs $4,365 - more than the average annual per-capita income of Soviet citizens. These fares are equivalent to the undiscounted fares of other large airlines and are sometimes discounted.
One problem that Aeroflot faces that no amount of advertising can gloss over is its fleet of planes, which are noisier and burn more fuel than those built by Western manufacturers. Its 132-seat Ilyushin-62 aircraft must make a refueling stop at Gander, Newfoundland, en route to Moscow.
A new generation of aircraft that are closer to Western standards is being developed, and one plane scheduled to enter service in 1992 is expected to fly nonstop from New York to Moscow. Meanwhile, the airline is revamping the interiors of its planes that fly trans-Atlantic routes. And in the hopes of attracting more Western travelers, Aeroflot is considering leasing a Boeing 747, Mr. Terentiev said - either in a joint arrangement with Pan Am or on its own.
 
Meeting With Boeing This Week
Aeroflot executives will be meeting in Moscow this week with representatives of the Boeing Company to discuss possible lease arrangements, said a recently retired Boeing executive who was involved in earlier negotiations.
Last year Boeing sold two 767's to LOT, the Polish airline - the first time an American manufacturer had sold an airliner to a Communist bloc nation.
Another concern of American travelers is Aeroflot's safety record, which, for its domestic flights at least, remains a mystery. The airline does not ordinarily report such statistics.
Aeroflot also has to overcome its reputation for poor service. ''They've been a monopoly since their inception, and their service reflects that,'' said Gary Burandt, chairman of Young & Rubicam/Sobero, a joint venture based in Moscow. Earlier this year, Aeroflot signed a contract with the Marriott Corporation's in-flight catering service to help improve its food service. 60% Rise in Number of Seats With the growing demand for travel between the two countries, Aeroflot has increased its number of seats 60 percent over the last year and now flies from New York and Washington to Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport up to eight times a week. The number of passengers flying the airline jumped from 25,000 in 1987 to 40,000 last year. Mr. Terentiev said that he expects that number will reach 80,000 this year.
Still, Aeroflot can claim less than 10 percent of the Soviet-American market. Most business travelers prefer to fly to Moscow on one of the 13 other airlines with routes there, through cities like London or Frankfurt.
And although many Aeroflot flights leave full, the majority of the seats are filled by Soviet passengers. In order to pay for fuel and landing fees here, the airline desperately needs to earn dollars. ''Aeroflot can sell every seat with Soviet passengers,'' said William Roy, managing partner of the Middlebrook Group. ''But they need to balance that with people paying hard dollars.''
About 125,000 Americans visited the Soviet Union last year, up from 110,000 in 1987 and 25,000 in 1980, when relations between the two countries soured after the invasion of Afghanistan. With joint ventures between the countries now feasible, Aeroflot hopes that its share of American business travelers will increase. The airline wants to start flying to Los Angeles, which has a large Armenian population.
 
Shortage of Moscow Hotel Rooms
But Aeroflot can only grow as fast as the hotel space in Moscow allows. A shortage of hotel rooms has existed for years, and even booking a room three or four weeks in advance can be difficult.

HEADLINE: EUROPE SUPPLYING BLOOD FOR THE U.S.

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Americans are increasingly turning to Europeans to meet the need for blood tranfusions in surgery, accidents and the treatment of cancer and many other diseases.
In the United States, regions with surpluses have long sent blood to areas with shortages. But the demand has increased to the point where such domestic shipments cannot meet all deficits, and more foreign sources are being tapped. In some cases, blood centers find it cheaper to buy donated blood from Europe than to collect it locally.
While the amount of blood imported from Europe is relatively small, blood bank officials are concerned that if this country relies more on imported blood, it could become vulnerable to the vagaries of international politics. 
 
'It Is a Shame'
The New York Blood Center met the community's needs during a strike that curtailed its own collections by stockpiling blood and relying on imports from Europe and other American cities. But if a crisis had developed during the strike, which ended last Friday, New York ''could not have squeezed any more blood from Europe,'' said Michael C. Scahill, a spokesman for the center.
''It is a shame that the United States cannot meet its own needs and has to import blood from anywhere,'' said Dr. A. William Shafer, executive director of the American Red Cross's Southeastern Michigan Chapter and Regional Blood Services in Detroit, where some imported blood is being used.
Importing blood does not raise a safety issue because the imports undergo the same tests as blood collected domestically.
 
New Practice for Red Cross
For the first time, the American Red Cross is importing blood from abroad. It is buying red blood cells from the Bavarian Red Cross in West Germany in a move that its officials see as shipments from one sister group to another, akin to those within the United States. Officials declined to say how much they were paying.
The New York area, the largest importer by far, has long imported blood from West Germany and Switzerland. It will soon buy blood from the Netherlands because the other countries cannot increase their exports.
Blood is a cornerstone of the practice of medicine. About 2 percent of the American population receives a transfusion of blood or blood products each year, the Red Cross says. But there is no single repository for data on the amount of blood collected in this country. #6% of Americans Donate While demand has increased, the number of Americans who give blood has remained steady at about 6 percent of the population. In New York the number is less than 5 percent. About 40 percent of the nation's population is eligible to donate blood; the others are ineligible for reasons of age or health. Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds, be in good health and be from 17 to 76 years old.
Steps to urge more people donate their own blood before elective surgery and to salvage more blood lost in operations, though helpful, have not solved the chronic blood shortage in the United States.
Use of advanced genetic techniques to make a substance, erythropoietin, to increase production of red cells in the body may eventually cut the nation's need for red cells by up to 4 percent. Researchers are trying to grow blood cells in the laboratory and to develop synthetic blood. But practical application is still years away.
Of the estimated 12 million units of blood transfused in this country each year, about 280,000 are imported from Europe. That includes more than 250,000 units imported by the New York Blood Center, or 30 percent of the red cells that are transfused in the metropolitan area. New York gets 21,000 additional units of blood from Louisiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi, Michigan, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma and Massachusetts.
Nelson Groh, an official of the American Red Cross in Washington, said his organization expected to import about 30,000 units of blood from Bavaria this year. About 20,000 of the imported units will go to Dr. Shafer's group in Detroit, and the rest will be shipped to Washington and to the Wilkes-Barre and Scranton area of Pennsylvania.
In a trial phase of the program last fall, Miami imported 200 units of blood from Bavaria. Dr. Peter A. Tomasulo, who heads the American Red Cross's South Florida regional blood center, and blood bank officials elsewhere in the country said they would not hesitate to turn to Europe for blood if they failed to recruit enough donors in their areas.
 
Reasons for Shortages
Erosion in community spirit heads the list of explanations for the chronic blood shortage in this country. But economics is another important factor.
Dr. Peter L. Page, who directs the American Red Cross Blood Services Northeast Region program in Dedham, Mass., said he decided to stop using mobile units to collect blood from small numbers of donors because of costs of collection.
Instead, he said, it was more economical to buy blood from Red Cross centers in Vermont, New Hampshire, St. Paul, Buffalo, Omaha, Portland, Ore., and other areas. Blood can be bought domestically for about $50 a unit from surplus areas, as against $100 a unit when it is collected locally from small groups.
Blood bank officials say that it could cost Americans more to supply all of their own blood and that the excess European blood would only be discarded if it was not shipped to the United States, although some blood is shipped to other European countries.
The Europeans have a surplus primarily because of a different method of collection, American blood bank officials say. In the United States, whole blood is collected by volunteer blood banks and separated into red cells, plasma and other components. But most of the plasma is collected at commercial blood banks, in a process that returns the red cells to the donor's body. In Europe, though, the plasma separation technique is used less often, American blood bank officials said, leading to an excess of red cells that are either discarded or sold to other countries. Statistics are not available on the percentage of people who donate blood or blood fractions in Europe as compared with the United States.
The New York Blood Center pays $57 for a unit of blood collected in Europe, as against $75 for collecting it here.
European donors know their blood may be shipped to the United States, American officials said.
Economic hardships in different regions of the United States have had an adverse effect on blood collections in cities where blood centers routinely sent mobile units to collect from large numbers of factory and office workers. But the closing of many of those factories and offices has made it harder to collect as much blood as efficiently.
Dr. Shafer said such closings in Detroit were an important factor for his adding European blood to the supplies he has bought from Lansing, Mich., Wichita, Kan., Wichita Falls, Tex., Boise, Idaho, and other areas.
 
Effect of AIDS Epidemic
AIDS has also had its effect on donations. After the discovery in the early 1980's that the AIDS virus could be spread through blood transfusions, the number of donations and transfusions dropped by about 10 percent for a period in New York, said Dr. John W. Adamson, the new president of the New York Blood Center. But now the numbers are rising again.
Homosexual men and others at high risk for AIDS are asked not to give blood, eliminating an undetermined number of eligible donors. Surveys have also found that many people mistakenly believe that AIDS can be spread by donating blood.
One reason blood is shipped from one region to another is because of geographical imbalances that often result when people donate in their home area but go to major medical centers elsewhere for specialized care. Another factor is an imbalance between the collection and use of certain blood types, particularly the O positive group, the universal donor.
''We can never keep enough group O blood on the shelves,'' said Norman Kear, administrator of the Los Angeles-Orange Counties region of the American Red Cross blood services. Group O positive blood is often given immediately in accidents and trauma cases in disproportionate amounts to what is collected.
An estimated 13.2 million units were collected and 12 million were transfused in the fiscal year 1986-1987, which the Red Cross says is the latest available estimate. The American Red Cross collected 6.4 million units. About the same amount was collected by the American Association of Blood Banks in Arlington, Va. A much smaller amount came from the Council of Community Blood Centers in Washington.
About 1.2 million units, or 9 percent of those collected, were not used for a variety of reasons; for example, because laboratory tests identified contaminating microbes or the designated safe period expired.
Dr. James AuBuchon, who heads the regional blood center of the American Red Cross in Washington, said the 4,000 units of blood he expected to import from Bavaria this year would represent about 2 percent of the blood distributed by his center. An additional 6 percent is imported from other Red Cross blood banks in the United States.
Anthony J. Dombroski, executive director of the Northeast Pennsylvania Regional Blood Center, which serves the Scranton area, said the 5,000 units of blood he expected to receive from Bavaria this year represented about 6 percent of the transfusions in his area.
What shocked the center, Mr. Dombroski said, was its sudden recent turnaround from an exporter to an importer of blood.
''Everyone talks about educating the public,'' Dr. Shafer said, ''But I am not sure anyone has the foggiest idea how to do it.''
Yet the need is great because ''every city is skating on thin ice,'' Dr. Adamson said.

HEADLINE: DISUNITY IS FEARED AS BUSH MAPS WAR ON DRUG USE IN U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Even as President Bush prepares to declare war on drugs Tuesday evening, bureaucratic infighting threatens to undermine the plan of attack.
The strategy that Mr. Bush will present at 9 P.M. Eastern time in his first nationally televised address is intended to bring unity to an effort that for years has been plagued by feuding, duplication and sometimes conflicting philosophies among the more than three dozen Federal offices claiming some jurisdiction.
William J. Bennett, the Federal drug policy director, acknowledged in an interview last week that ''there's going to be a certain degree of enmity and rivalry.'' But he insisted, ''There's nothing major that's going to clog the wheels.'' $2 Billion a Year Yet Administration officials, lawmakers and analysts said they were not convinced that Mr. Bennett has the influence to carry out the blueprint he drafted for Mr. Bush's approval, a blueprint that calls for spending $2 billion a year more for enforcement, treatment and prevention and for military and economic aid to South American countries battling cocaine producers. 
Although he is responsible for assuring that agencies cooperate in carrying out the plan, Mr. Bennett has no official power to tell them how to spend their money or deploy their people.
In some ways, the infighting among agencies seems beyond any President's control, since it results from differences in institutional cultures.
The State Department, for instance, has long been more interested in improving relations with foreign powers than penalizing them for not fighting drugs. The Justice Department is geared more toward arresting drug traffickers than using military force to stop them.
 
Pentagon's Reluctance
The Pentagon has for years been reluctant to pour money into a battle in which victory seems distant. And while their philosophies may be similiar, the Customs Service and Coast Guard have had celebrated feuds over issues like who gets credit for seizing a boatload of marijuana.
William von Raab, who left office a month ago as United States Customs Service commissioner, ending an eight-year tenure in which he was often involved in intramural disputes over drug policy, asserted in an interview today:
''My major concern about the plan is not what the plan says but whether the departments and the agencies will implement it with enthusiasm. I'm not saying they won't pay lip service. But will they really support it? I have heard even now some of the proposals are being pooh-poohed by the State Department and the Justice Department.''
Indeed, there were struggles between Mr. Bennett's office and some Federal agencies in drafting the strategy itself. Justice Department officials, for example, blocked an effort to establish an intelligence center for Federal agencies to share information on traffickers, which the officials saw as intruding on their domain. The Justice Department tried but failed to block other efforts that could diminish its authority by giving more money to state and local law enforcement and increasing the military's presence in South America.
 
'There's No Pouting'
Outwardly, Mr. Bennett and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh have insisted that relations are fine.
''There's no pouting,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''Thornburgh and I have worked well together. We've had some differences, and we've worked them out in a direct way.''
As Attorney General in the Reagan Administration, Mr. Thornburgh opposed the effort in Congress last year to create the post Mr. Bennett now holds. Since Mr. Bennett took office, the Attorney General has taken pains to insist that he and Mr. Bennett get along, while at the same time describing himself, and not Mr. Bennett, as the chief drug enforcement official.
The drug package would cost $7.8 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, about $2 billion more than in the current fiscal year. It calls for building more prisons for Federal drug offenders and for aid to local governments to step up enforcement against narcotics peddlers. It also calls for greater economic and military aid to Colombia, Bolivia and Peru and for greater efforts to arrest middle-level operators in major rings.
 
Casual Users Are Targets
The plan emphasizes stiffer penalties for casual users and more spending for treatment and prevention.
For budgeting purposes, Administration officials said, they have decided to wait until February to declare certain areas of the country in need of special Federal aid. The areas that would get top priority are New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and the Southwest border.
Along with the strategy, Administration officials said they would submit to Congress a proposal from budget officials this week for specific cuts in other domestic and military programs to pay for the fight against drugs. Mr. Bush has pledged not to raise taxes.
But already, some Congressional officials have complained that the White House will take credit for the drug program and leave Congress to decide how to pay for it. Jurisdictional disputes are inevitable on Capitol Hill, where Representative Matthew J. Rinaldo, Republican of New Jersey, said he fears that at least 80 committees and subcommittees will try to question Mr. Bennett about the plan.
 
How to Resolve Disputes
The plan would establish two groups, one dealing with supply, the other with demand, to mediate disputes among agencies. It also proposes that agencies revise their personnel evaluations so that individuals who cooperate with other departments are rewarded.
But the real test of a new collegiality is whether Mr. Bush will put the force of his office behind the strategy and Mr. Bennett.
''There will be a challenge for this White House to break from the usual pattern of handling 30 issues incrementally and really hammer away at one or two themes,'' a senior White House official said.
When Mr. Bennett was sworn in last March, the President delivered a stern lecture to the Cabinet: ''I will not tolerate, and the country cannot afford, bureaucratic infighting that forces us to fight this battle with one arm tied behind our back.''
 
Bennett Reportedly Was Annoyed
Mr. Bennett said he expects full backing from the President. Even so, aides to Mr. Bennett said he was annoyed over Mr. Bush's decision not to place his position in the Cabinet. Mr. Bush has defended the decision, saying that Mr. Bennett would be invited to Cabinet sessions in which drugs were discussed.
Recalling how an earlier President would referee disputes, Mr. von Raab said: ''Lyndon Johnson would just call four of the agency heads in and tell them in unattractive and vulgar langauge that if they didn't pull themselves together, they'd be fired. The President could basically tell Bennett that he had the last word on this issue. But that doesn't seem to be happening.'' Mr. von Raab had wanted Mr. Bush to name him the drug chief.
Yet some say that skirmishes between the agencies may not be so bad.
''It would give the appearance that we were trying to do something,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Select Committe on Narcotics Abuse and Control.
Mark A.R. Kleiman, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, agreed: ''Competition among prosecutors and investigative offices can lead to bad outcomes and bad feelings, but it keeps people on their toes.''

HEADLINE: Is Mr. de Klerk Sincere About Blacks' Rights?

BYLINE: By Karl S. Beck; Karl S. Beck is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Will F. W. de Klerk, the Afrikaner lawyer chosen by the National Party to succeed P.W. Botha as President of South Africa, give blacks real political rights?
Mr. de Klerk, currently the acting President, says he has a reform plan that will prevent any racial group from dominating any other. Foreign governments expect that soon after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections he will reveal the details. Meanwhile, the police are arresting and shooting blacks who demand equal rights. 
Some consider Mr. de Klerk South Africa's ''last white President.'' Indeed, his plan may include just such a surprise. But his country's history warns us that that this could be one more clever ploy in white South Africa's well-rehearsed strategy to preserve white control.
For Mr. de Klerk, as for his predecessors during four decades of National Party rule, the most pressing issue is black people's demand for equality.
In the 50's, 60's and 70's, the party's responses were brutal repression of Africans' political organizations and Prime Minister H. F. Verwoerd's ''grand apartheid'' - a social-engineering monstrosity that tried to remove Africans from ''white South Africa'' and make them citizens of ''independent'' Bantustans with no cities, ports, industries or anything else of value.
The Verwoerd scheme failed because many Africans resisted going to impoverished backwaters. Besides, they were needed in urban areas by the growing economy.
A more recent ploy was former President P.W. Botha's ''reform'' of the early 80's, which was conceived to co-opt Indians and coloreds (people of mixed race) into sustaining white control.
Mr. Botha realized he could not remove black Africans from South Africa, and he saw the population ratio altering steadily against whites. He also sensed black Africans' growing assertiveness, which he tried to divide into economic and political components, encouraging the former and repressing the latter.
In 1983, at President Botha's urging, whites voted for a new Constitution that opened parliament to coloreds and Indians. These nonwhites are accommodated in separate chambers of a three-house legislature, which does not include black Africans.
Initially, Mr. Botha assumed he had recruited four million colored and Indian allies for the five million whites. (There are at least 27 million black Africans in South Africa.) And he set out to channel black Africans' political energies toward local government. He believed blacks could be bought and, indeed, some have been co-opted.
Contrary to Mr. Botha's expectations, vast numbers of coloreds and Indians sided with the now-banned United Democratic Front, which was organized in 1983 to oppose the Botha Constitution.
In addition, millions of Africans were angered about being prohibited by law from any say over how they are governed. This caused the 1984-1986 rebellion, which appears to be starting again.
F. W. de Klerk has revealed little of his plan. He says he understands all blacks want representation in the national Government, and promises to include them ''at the highest levels'' while continuing to structure the political system as a collection of groups defined by race.
Foreign governments can expect that the plan will uphold the paramountcy of white interests and contain instruments necessary to suppress black power. They should also expect the National Party to insist on choosing blacks to anoint as political leaders. Can we really expect Nelson Mandela or Desmond Tutu to be among Mr. de Klerk's leadership candidates, especially following Mr. Tutu's arrest last week?
It would not be surprising if Mr. de Klerk relinquished a greatly weakened presidency to a black quisling while assuming office as executive prime minister with authority over security and the economy.
The U.S. and European Community governments are urging Mr. de Klerk to accelerate reform. If his plan does not legalize equal political rights for all South Africans, foreign governments should not equivocate in public while hoping to influence him in private. They made that mistake with Mr. Botha in 1983 when they publicly approved the Constitution that created the three-house legislature.
Rather, they should make it clear to Mr. de Klerk that a political system based on racial discrimination, no matter how elegantly presented, is not South Africa's ticket for admission to the group of democracies.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Nonaligned Nations In Crisis

BYLINE: By FLORA LEWIS

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya provides the only flashy show and firebrand talk of the ninth nonaligned summit meeting. He sent five camels ahead to be milked for him and two horses for mounted guards at the tent pitched in his embassy's garden, and proclaimed he had come ''to save the movement.''
It is another sign of changing times. The Yugoslav hosts have made an intensive effort to de-radicalize, lower the pitch - in short, what they call ''modernize'' the triennial meeting. Revolutionary exhortations and diatribes against ''imperialists'' no longer win stormy applause. 
Fidel Castro of Cuba, who used to thunder for hours, apparently realized it wouldn't be his type of scene anymore and didn't show up, sending his brother Raul instead.
The nonaligneds are facing an identity problem now that they don't really have anybody to be nonaligned with, and the enemy is more likely to be the neighbor than a superpower. Most of the leaders here are more concerned about economics than about ostentatious third-world politics. They realize, as one moderate Arab said, if you want to talk business you have to talk to somebody, not just shout at your would-be partner.
It is a striking change from the founding summit session here in 1961. There were 25 members and an extraordinary cast of characters, including Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia in his resplendent white-and-gold uniform, India's Nehru with a pink rose on his tunic, Egypt's Nasser, Indonesia's Sukarno, Ghana's Nkrumah, Archibishop Makarios of Cyprus. Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia was eclipsed by the huge display of assertive charisma.
In the middle of the strident speeches against colonialism and atomic weapons, Nikita Khrushchev ended the Soviet moratorium on nuclear testing and set off a 50-megaton bomb in the atmosphere, at least 2,500 times bigger than the Hiroshima bomb. Radioctive fallout probably still lingers around the world.
But you could have heard a pin drop in Belgrade. Nobody thought of criticizing Moscow. George Kennan, then U.S. Ambassador here, was furious, and that only sharpened the summit meeting's tone of anti-Americanism. Ten years ago in Havana, at the sixth summit session, Mr. Castro insisted that the Soviets were the natural ally of the nonaligneds.
Now there are 102 members, and they are wondering what their movement ought to be about. Some are showing an ironic nostalgia for the good old cold war, when they could work up a steam about the East-West conflict endangering the world. They don't quite say so out loud, but they evidently regret the chance to win benefits and importance by playing one side off against the other.
Others, the majority, are relieved that major tensions are easing and ideology is no longer the big issue. But they are worried about being marginalized as East and West grope for accommodation. They don't want to be squeezed out of the political game - even pawns play a role. The more thoughtful are concerned that the opening East will become such an economic attraction that the West won't be interested in contributing to their development and trade.
All the serious wars and conflicts are among themselves now, and it's getting hard to blame the big powers for keeping them going. Their own arms races show up their pious talk about the urgency of disarmament. And the embattled ones feel a risk of losing attention for their causes.
One effort to sustain some purpose for a movement that confers a sense of participation is to shift the focus from nonalignment between East and West to North-South engagement, and to latch on to the new issue of the environment, which certainly does require these countries' concern.
The Yugoslavs have taken a clear official position, trying hard to cut out the West-bashing and to focus on ''practical, realistic recommendations.'' But they will have to compromise to reach consensus. There is now a sharp debate in this country about whether the prestige of being nonaligned chairman for three years is more trouble than it's worth.
Tito came up with the nonalignment idea as a way of creating a foreign policy and some importance in the world out of the vacuum left by quitting the Soviet bloc but remaining a Communist-ruled country. It gave Yugoslavia support when there were real security fears of Soviet intentions. Now, one tendency here is to say this country should look to Western Europe and cast off the third-world bias that the movement imposes. The issue isn't settled.
The whole world is having to move into a new era because of the changes in the East, in ways that hadn't been foreseen. The ripples of disintegrating Communism are spreading far.

HEADLINE: Happy Days for Economic Advisers

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
In the early 1980's, the influence of the President's Council of Economic Advisers had fallen to such an ebb that upon his re-election Ronald Reagan seriously entertained the idea of abolishing it.
And if Congress resisted, the reasoning at the White House went, the President could simply refuse to make appointments to the three-member panel.
But not only did the council survive, but, under President Bush, it also seems to be making a comeback that some in the capital say may soon be inviting comparisons with the halcyon days of Walter W. Heller, the tax-cut proponent who advised Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and, a decade later, of Alan Greenspan, the chief economic adviser to President Gerald R. Ford.
There is little doubt that the council's resurgence, seen most clearly so far in the areas of trade and clean air, rests mainly on the personal chemistry of its current chairman, Michael J. Boskin, a 43-year-old professor of economics on leave from Stanford University, and his only client, Mr. Bush, a man with considerable respect for economists. 
 
Other Factors at Work
This relationship, cultivated also on the tennis court, involves frequent meetings, memo-writing and late-night phone calls when the President wants to follow up.
But many observers, including people around the council, see additional factors at work in the panel's revival.
One is that Dr. Boskin, although relatively new to the ways of Washington, has proved highly adept in advancing his views.
Mr. Reagan dealt with his council chiefs mainly through subordinates. One chairman in the Reagan Presidency, Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard, sometimes felt obliged to take public positions at odds with those of his superior. Dr. Feldstein is said to have been eager to preserve his academic reputation, but his disagreements may also have reflected an inability to make his voice heard in the Reagan White House.
But Dr. Boskin appears content with moving the center of gravity rather than insisting on total victory.
 
Opponent of 'Japan Baiting'
''He's sensitive to the political process,'' said David D. Hale, a Chicago economist who also gives Dr. Boskin high marks for resisting the not inconsiderable amount of ''Japan baiting'' in Congress and among various interest groups.
Murray L. Weidenbaum, Mr. Reagan's first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Dr. Boskin had also benefited by coming to his post at the beginning of an Administration. Moreover, the Bush Administration has managed to avoid visible squabbling. ''The degree of leaking in this White House has come way down,'' Professor Weidenbaum said.
For his part, Dr. Boskin is reluctant to take credit for the council's new-found and widely acknowledged esteem. ''I feel very much part of a team assisting the President,'' he said in an interview, ''and I'm lucky to have terrific teammates.''
Whether it is the team or Dr. Boskin or both, in the area of trade the council is known to have been instrumental in arranging a compromise within the Administration on extending steel import quotas for 30 months while gradually ending them. The two-and-a-half-year period is long enough for the quotas to remain in effect for a crucial Congressional debate that is expected to take place in 1991, but short enough to end them before the next Presidential election. The council's efforts are also thought to have helped keep to a minimum the number of countries cited for unfair practices under the new trade law.
 
Role in Clean Air Plan
Another significant contribution is seen in the Administration's clean air proposal, which seeks to harness market forces by introducing marketable permits and tradeable emissions rights. The goal is to reduce acid rain and automobile pollution by providing businesses with the incentives to do the job by the most efficient means they can devise.
Other issues on which the council's footprints have been found include the Administration's proposal for a subminimum wage for job training and in its cost-benefit analysis of ambitious legislation to expand the rights of the disabled, including employment and public accommodation.
Unlike some of his predecessors, Dr. Boskin appears to make considerable use of the two other members of his council, both of them of nearly the same age as he. They are John B. Taylor, 42, also on leave from Stanford, and Richard Schmalensee, 45, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Dr. Taylor, who in the Greenspan days worked as a senior staff member on the council and later served as consultant to the Townsend-Greenspan Inc. advisory firm in New York, who analyzes broad economic trends and who has also been designated to handle trade issues. His professional reputation rests in part on developing techniques for evaluating monetary policies of the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Expert on Regulatory Policy
Dr. Schmalensee, who is still awaiting confirmation by the Senate, deals primarily with microeconomics, a branch of economics dealing with specific factors affecting an economy. His expertise is in antitrust and regulatory policy.
Practically every morning, usually shortly after Dr. Boskin returns from the White House staff meeting, the three advisers convene for perhaps a half hour to discuss virtually any subject of the day in which economics plays a role. The council also meets monthly with the Federal Reserve's board of governors on monetary policy - ''a subject we discuss openly, recognizing that the Fed has a degree of independence,'' Dr. Taylor hastened to declare.
The council was created in 1946, a time of great faith that the Government, provided with the best experts, could successfully manage the economy. That faith has waned, but even the few believers are not doing strenuous battle. In terms of the council's renewed influence, it hardly hurts to have inherited a solid economy.
For Dr. Boskin the bottom line remains, however, that it does not hurt to be known as a man who, although once seen as as a supply-sider, is willing to listen and to compromise.
''While I start from a firm set of principles, I've always considered myself pragmatic and eclectic, trying to understand and appreciate different points of view,'' Dr. Boskin said, characteristically weighing his words. ''In the end, the decisions are political decisions made by elected officials, and that's as it should be. Economic analysis and advice is only one input - sometimes quite important, other times less so.''

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
The High Hidden Costs Of the War on Marijuana

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Cocaine is not the only losing front in the Government's war on drugs. In what experts regard as the most authoritative study of the illegal market for marijuana, a Harvard economist has concluded that the billion-dollar Federal effort to disrupt the trade is a failure.
Tighter controls at the borders in the Reagan years did indeed reduce imports of marijuana, says the economist, Mark A. R. Kleiman of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. But he argues that this merely stimulated domestic cultivation and encouraged producers and sellers to put far more potent forms of the drug on the market.
By cutting back on enforcement, Mr. Kleiman argues, the Government could reverse these two unintended effects and thereby advance the goals of anti-drug policy. Total consumption of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, would probably fall, he says. So would the profits of drug traffickers. 
 
'Costs of Control'
It is not clear how these conclusions, in Mr. Kleiman's new book, ''Marijuana: Costs of Abuse, Costs of Control'' (Greenwood Press), will be received in Washington.
There seems to be little sentiment, either in Washington or among the general public, for treating marijuana differently from illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin. On the other hand, Mr. Kleiman's call for a relaxation of the effort to stop marijuana imports may mesh with the Bush Administration's general inclination to spend more of its anti-drug budget on prosecution of drug offenders and treatment of users. President Bush is scheduled to present the Administration's anti-drug strategy in a broadcast speech tonight.
The Federal war on marijuana, Mr. Kleiman says, has been anchored by the simple idea that one ton confiscated by the Customs Service or the Drug Enforcement Administration is one ton less consumed. In this case, he believes, simplicity is misleading.
Confiscated marijuana has been replaced at low cost, he says, so the enforcement effort has had little effect on consumption. Moreover, as a closer look at the marijuana market suggests, the border crackdown has given rise to a much more potent form of the drug.
In the Carter years, Washington's limited effort to disrupt drug imports focused on cocaine and heroin. The Reagan Administration radically altered course, sharply increasing total expenditures on border controls and ending the unofficial policy of ignoring small shipments of marijuana.
The intensified search for marijuana, Mr. Kleiman reports, reduced imports from about 4,200 tons in 1982 to 3,900 in 1986. The price of the drug went up, compensating shippers and dealers for the added risk of property confiscation and arrest. Adjusted for inflation, the average retail price rose 35 percent, to about $84 an ounce.
 
Still Widely Available
Marijuana remains widely available, however, and a dollar still buys enough to get high. And the success in reducing imports has masked the ominous ways in which the market has adjusted.
The increased cost of importing marijuana stimulated domestic production, which rose 10 percent from 1982 to 1986, by Government estimates. And this infant industry of the 1970's has grown into a healthy giant: one-quarter of the marijuana sold in the United States is now home-grown. As Peter Reuter, an economist at the Rand Corporation, wryly pointed out, ''This is the rare instance in which trade protectionism really worked.''
Small-scale domestic producers, lacking farmland they can easily conceal, have had an incentive to cultivate sinsemilla, the sticky, seedless marijuana with a much higher content of the active ingredient, THC, than ordinary marijuana. And with the help of cloning technology, says John P. Sutton of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Americans now grow ''the most potent marijuana in the world.'' As a result, Mr. Kleiman estimates, the total amount of THC consumed by Americans actually rose 22 percent from 1982 to 1986.
The social cost, many experts believe, has similarly climbed. In the 1970's, marijuana sold in the United States had a THC content of 1 to 2 percent. Last year the D.E.A. confiscated marijuana whose THC content was as high as 18 percent. Smokers looking for the the equivalent of a beer may thus unwittingly end up with a triple martini, with unfortunate consequences for job productivity.
 
Higher Profits Than Ever
Another unwelcome effect of the Reagan policy, Mr. Kleiman argues, is on the way the marijuana market is organized. Tougher border controls, he believes, increased risks to all importers and drove poorly capitalized ones out of business. But the added costs to large, well-organized shippers, who could afford to lose an occasional boatload, were more than offset by the higher prices they could charge. The profits to those still in the trade, he concludes, are higher than ever.
One way to undo the unintended effects of the crackdown on marijuana, Mr. Kleiman says, would be to legalize it and regulate its purity and potency. Legal marijuana could be a major source of tax revenue rather than a $14 billion business for criminals and a billion-dollar cost to the Treasury. But there is little support for such a radical experiment; it is generally agreed that more people would smoke marijuana if it were legal, just as many more people began drinking alcohol with the end of Prohibition in 1933.
 
The Middle Ground
Still, Mr. Kleiman argues, there may be a politically acceptable middle ground.
Cutting the Federal enforcement budget in half might increase consumption of marijuana by a few percent, he says, but it would probably reverse the changes in the market that have made marijuana much more potent and profitable in the 1980's. And lowering its potency would reduce the threat it poses to health, safety and productivity.
Some economic analysts take issue with some of Mr. Kleiman's findings. Mark Moore, also at the Kennedy School, says loosening border controls on marijuana would not save much money, since the same personnel would still be involved in the effort to block cocaine and heroin. But there is little disagreement among economists that the consequences of marijuana interdiction have been largely perverse.
Yet it may be hard to persuade policymakers and the public to treat marijuana differently from other drugs. Mathea Falco, an Assistant Secretary of State for narcotics matters in the Carter Administration who wrote a study on drugs for the Twentieth Century Fund, a research group in New York, points to a paradox in the evolution of drug policies.
 
Public Makes Few Distinctions
In the past decade, she says, the public has become much less willing to consider each drug as a separate problem, requiring a separate containment strategy, even though the social and medical consequences of the various drugs have been diverging widely. Cocaine, for example, used to be mainly a pleasure drug for the well-off; now crack, its cheap and smokable form, has run rampant through the inner cities, destroying families and neighborhoods. Heroin's destructiveness, too, has taken on a new dimension; addicts who share needles have become a major conduit for the spread of AIDS.
The Reagan Administration catered to the attitude that all drugs are unacceptable with its policy of ''zero tolerance,'' the absolute prohibition of all illegal drugs. And the strategy paper released by William J. Bennett, the Bush Administration's director of drug control policy, makes few distinctions among illegal drugs or strategies for combating them.
But there is still one reason to believe that the Administration may quietly choose to de-emphasize border control for drugs in general and marijuana in particular: money.
Attacking drug supply and demand at every level, as Mr. Bennett seems to be advocating, will be very expensive. And in the search for Federal cash to augment both law enforcement and drug treatment, it will be very tempting to tap the billion dollars a year that serve to protect domestic marijuana producers from foreign competition.

Atlanta Has a Dream: It's the 1996 Olympics

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 4

 BODY:
With his colorful surfer attire and a raquetball raquet as a baton, Rob Anderson is a fitting drum major for a ragtag outfit here that goes by the name of the Seed and Feed Marching Abominable.
But when Mr. Anderson and perhaps three dozen members of his marching ensemble escorted some 24 amused members of the International Olympic Committee from a local subway station toward a road race this morning, even the irreverent Mr. Anderson found himself getting a bit worked up.
''When my band started playing the Olympic fanfare, I got the chills,'' said Mr. Anderson, who in his other life is a 38-year-old computer programmer.
Like the Seed and Feed ensemble, Atlanta may seem a little out of place amid Olympic festivities. But Mr. Anderson is hardly alone in his enthusiasm for the city's dream of being host of the 1996 summer Games. 
After making its formal presentation to the Olympic committee last week in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Atlanta is squiring around 24 of the 92 committee members as part of its bid for the Olympics. Organizers are spending more than $5 million as part of an effort to get the nomination. This morning, more than 7,000 runners in their Atlanta 1996 T-shirts stampeded down West Peachtree Street in a three-mile road race that is part of the city's show of support for the Games.
Atlanta began as a long shot and despite impressing Olympic committee members, it is still not the favorite for selection when the committee meets next September in Tokyo to choose the site for the 1996 Games.
''When we started, so few people knew who we were, they kind of resented our bidding,'' said Mayor Andrew Young. ''We still get mistaken for Atlantic City.''
But Atlanta has always been oriented toward drawing outsiders for extravaganzas. In 1881, only 17 years after Sherman's Union troops burned the city, Atlanta was host of the International Cotton Exposition, luring representatives from seven foreign countries.
''This city's history shows whatever its people get behind has a reasonable chance of success, no matter what it is,'' said William P. Payne, president of the Atlanta Organizing Committee. Atlanta hopes to be only the third American city ever to be host of the summer Games. Los Angeles was host in 1932 and 1984 and St. Louis was host in 1904.
Atlanta's pitch is an artful bit of marketing. The nuts-and-bolts appeal centers on its healthy economy, ample hotel rooms, modern athletic facilities, stadiums and transportation, and the presence of one of the busiest airports in the world.
The emotional appeal, always important in a city that is supposed to uphold the Olympic ideal, is a blend of Southern hospitality and the legacy of the civil rights movement and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. For good measure, the city bills the games as a way for the world to discover the South, and glossy multilingual brochures herald such attractions as Le Grande Ole Opry de Nashville, au Tennessee.
''I'm very impressed, both by the changes in the city, all the new buildings, and the way of life,'' said Jean-Claude Ganga, the I.O.C. member from Congo. ''The way blacks and whites work together is fantastic.''
The biggest obstacle to Atlanta's chances is probably Athens, the emotional favorite because the 1996 games mark the centennial of the rebirth of the Games and the 2,500th anniversary of the Games.
On the other hand, there are major questions about Greece's political stability and physical ability to mount the Games. Toronto and Melbourne, Australia, are also believed to be solid contenders, while Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and Manchester, England, are believed to be less competitive.
Aside from pride and inspiration, the Olympics loom large here when the buzzword from up-and-coming cities is that they are international cities. Boosters figure that Atlanta's bid will raise its international visibility whether it gets the Games or not.
Cedric Suzman of the Southern Center for International Studies, a nonprofit group that fosters international ties, said Atlanta is becoming increasingly international, in terms of business and transportation, even if its style does not reflect it.
''The objective measures are there,'' he said. ''The subjective ones still have some way to go.''
Atlanta backers figure that is not a major problem.
''Asking if you're an international city is like asking if you're old money,'' said Lisa Cohen, a Venezuela native who now lives in Atlanta. ''In America, the great thing is you can become it.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Expected to Remain Steady

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
As the final month of the third quarter gets under way, credit market analysts say little evidence exists to suggest that the Federal Reserve Board will engineer another decline in interest rates in September.
Recent reports, including employment data for August that were somewhat stronger than anticipated, flesh out the notion of continued moderation in economic growth, with an active service sector compensating for growing weakness in manufacturing.
''The numbers confirm the dichotomy in the economy,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''They are numbers that jibe with a rate of growth in the third quarter of 1.5 percent to 2 percent, which is where the Fed wants it. 
''The real question is whether, going forward, Fed policy which keeps the Federal funds rate at 9 percent will be able to sustain that sort of growth,'' Mr. Fine added. ''I don't think it will, and that the Fed will ease further in the fourth quarter.''
 
A Historical Perspective
While additional weakness in manufacturing could induce the Fed to ease rates further, recent history suggests that the economy could continue to grow strongly even if that occurs.
The most recent survey from the nation's purchasing managers, released on Friday, produced the lowest reading since December 1982. It was also the fourth straight month of readings in which the managers' index of economic conditions was below 50 percent, a level generally considered neutral for the manufacturing sector.
The performance of the index this year is reminiscent of 1985, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Four years ago, the purchasing managers' index remained below 50 percent for much of the year, yet the economy expanded by a healthy 3.4 percent, she noted.
Continued growth is possible, and even likely, but many analysts are expecting the pace of activity in the global economy to slow significanty next year.
 
World Growth to Slow
In a recent analysis, economists at the Bank of America project that growth in the world economy will slow by half a percentage point in 1990, to a 2.7 percent rate.
The United States and Canada will be responsible for most of the slowdown, the analysts said. Output in the United States is expected to drop to a 1.6 percent rate, from an anticipated 2.9 percent level for all of 1989. Canadian growth should slow to 1.5 percent next year, from 3 percent this year.
As noted, the Fed would like to see a somewhat slower rate of growth to help ease inflation pressures. And a decision to keep the overnight Federal funds rate at the 9 percent level it has maintained for more than a month would be likely to keep other short-term interest rates on hold for the near term, market participants said. But a status-quo stance by the central bank need not prevent long-term rates from falling. The Federal funds rate is what the Fed charges on overnight loans to banks.
''The longer the Fed stays where it is, the better it is for the long end because it reduces the threat of inflation down the road,'' said Roger A. Craig, manager of about $650 million in fixed-income assets at Banc One Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. ''I think that bond yields will fall back to around 8 percent, even if the Fed doesn't ease.''
At the end of last week, the Treasury's bellwether 8 1/8 percent bonds maturing in 2019 were offered at a price to yield 8.12 percent. A stable Fed policy should also benefit the dollar, which over the last week or so has moved quietly to three-month highs against the Japanese yen.
''I don't see any reason to think the dollar will weaken substantially,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm, ''and that is a positive force.''
 
'Quality Buying'
Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said: ''Compared with other countries, real interest rates in the United States are extremely high right now. That is the principal source of the dollar's strength.
''When portfolio managers get back from their vacations and long weekends,'' Mr. Kasriel added, ''they are going to decide these are attractive rate levels to invest in, and we are going to see some quality buying.''
While many market participants retreated to beaches or woodlands for much of August, those who remained generated atypically brisk late-summer business, analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc. said.
Daily trading activity in Treasury, Federal agency and mortgage-backed securities reported by primary dealers exceeded $145 billion in the four weeks that ended on Aug. 23, the firm's analysts noted in their weekly publication, Comments on Credit. By comparison, the average daily volume for the same period in the previous three years was 25 percent lower.
Two factors contributed to the increased activity, the analysts said: an end to widespread expectations of a slowing economy and tumbling interest rates, and an acceleration in issuing mortgage-backed securities by Federal agencies. The increase in new issuance was augmented by more sales of existing mortgage-backed securities by savings and loan associations, which have been paring such positions to meet more stringent capital requirements.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Conrail's Success Stirring Rumors

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
CONRAIL, a company born of bankruptcies, and one whose profitable operation seemed highly unlikely less than a decade ago, has done rather well since the Government sold it off less than three years ago.
Now, in speculation that says as much about the investment climate as about the company's accomplishments and prospects, Conrail has become the subject of takeover rumors. The company's share price has leaped 13.5 percent, to $44.25, in the last two weeks.
Conrail, known formally as the Consolidated Rail Corporation, was created to take over several bankrupt Northeastern railroads, notably Penn Central. The Government poured billions into fixing it up, and sold the company to the public in 1987 at $28 a share. That was considerably less than the Government's cost, but Federal officials were glad to be rid of the headaches of running a railroad. 
Conrail has since proved to be a consistent moneymaker, if not much of a growth vehicle. Its profits totaled $4.44 a share in 1988, and analysts think a small increase is possible this year, despite a decline in first-half profits and revenues that James A. Hagan, Conrail's president, said were below expectations. He blamed a soft economy and said the company would seek to cut costs further.
But it was not profit forecasts that set off the recent speculation, sending Conrail shares above their 1987 high of $40.875. It was that traders have begun to focus on the three-year period of takeover protection provided by Congress, which will expire on April 2. Until then, any railroad that buys more than 10 percent of Conrail cannot exercise voting control over those shares, and no one else can buy a 10 percent stake. ''In play, or not in play, is the question for Conrail,'' said Donald H. Powers, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, who doubts a takeover attempt will materialize.
Responding to the concern, Conrail has put its own anti-takeover defenses in place. A conventional ''poison pill'' provision would force anyone who wanted to buy more than 10 percent of the stock to negotiate with Conrail's board or seek to overturn the provision in court. And the company has announced plans to establish an employee stock ownership plan, although it has not yet done so.
The company has also raised its dividend, effective this month, by a nickel, to 35 cents a quarter, while hinting that further increases are likely.
One reason for the speculation is that Conrail is beginning to look like a cash cow to some observers, one that cannot spend all the money it generates. Graeme Anne Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston, estimates that the company will have excess cash flow this year of $130 million, after spending $600 million on capital improvements. ''In the future, they will generate a lot of free cash flow,'' she said. ''That's the type of thing that attracts financial-type buyers.''
In the past, such buyers would have ignored a company as cyclical as a railroad, fearing what would happen in a recession. But Wall Street now looks more kindly on such deals. Airlines, similarly vulnerable to economic cycles, are now a magnet for takeover speculation, and one railroad, CNW, has been acquired in a leveraged buyout.
In an interview, H. William Brown, Conrail's chief financial officer, agreed that the company would probably allocate only $400 million to $500 million for capital spending in 1990, ''lower than in any year since we've been public.''
A bidder could encounter obstacles. ''Would the Government ever allow someone to significantly leverage up Conrail?'' Mrs. Lidgerwood asked. ''I doubt it.''
The use of leverage might stir fears that a buyer trying to meet debt payments would skimp on maintenance and capital spending in ways that would become evident years later. Congress decided once that rail service for the Northeast was a national necessity, and it would probably do so again if Conrail went broke. But legislators would certainly like to reduce the likelihood of such an event.
Mr. Brown of Conrail exudes confidence that the company can survive a recession now. ''We are a straight rail that will reflect the economy,'' he said, adding that management has taken steps that will enable it to cut costs when traffic weakens. ''You'd have to have a very significant downturn before we'd run into a cash crunch.''
The other type of prospective purchaser would be another railroad. Norfolk Southern tried to buy Conrail from the Government, and no doubt would still be interested, but again politics could cause problems. Along with CSX, it is a leading rail competitor of Conrail, and many shippers would find themselves with no alternatives if the lines combined. ''You saw the reaction that got in Washington,'' Mr. Brown said. ''It doesn't seem to me that is a likely possibility.''
Mr. Powell, the Merrill Lynch analyst, suggested that Union Pacific might be another possible merger partner; a union would create a truly transcontinental railway. Mr. Brown calls that ''an idea that comes up more from spectators than from railroaders.'' He said Conrail preferred to be able to hand off traffic to one of four competing railroads running to the West Coast. Conrail, he said, has no plans for any kind of merger.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Japan on Trade Surplus

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 4

 BODY:
The United States today pressed Japan to make immediate changes in its economy to reduce its $50 billion-a-year trade surplus with America, saying action was vital for their relationship.
''We urged them to solve them quickly,'' said one American participant in trade talks between the two nations. 
Success, he said, ''is vital to our bilateral relationship.''
American officials at the talks criticized everything from the complex goods-distribution system in Japan to its high level of personal savings, arguing that limits on Japanese consumption discouraged the purchase of imports.
Today's talks were the first in a nine-month series of discussions aimed at getting at the root causes of the trade gap between the two nations.
''I think it was a good session,'' said Linn Williams, the United States Deputy Trade Representative. ''I expect another constructive meeting tomorrow.''
The two sides have agreed to issue an interim statement next spring on their progress and a final report next summer detailing future actions planned, American officials said.
The talks were proposed by Washington last May after countless negotiations on Japanese import barriers failed to reduce the trade gap.
The nine-hour session lasted 90 minutes longer than planned and was taken up with American criticism of Japan. On Tuesday, it will be Tokyo's turn to attack American economic faults.

HEADLINE: Hardship Seen At Car Dealers

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Nearly half of the 25,000 automobile dealers in the United States are either losing money or just breaking even, and many may not survive until next year, the head of the National Auto Dealers Association said last week.
Auto dealers reported that profit margins are sharply lower this year than last, Ron Tonkin, president of the dealers' group, , said at a news conference. He said a study by J. D. Power & Associates, an industry market research group, showed that the situation may be worse than the association's figures indicate.
Mr. Tonkin said as many as 2,000 dealers may not survive until next year.
He said the auto makers were partly responsible for the situation because they took away financial incentives that helped dealers reduce inventories. In addition, the auto makers have transferred many of their costs to dealers, Mr. Tonkin said.
Rebates have also hurt dealers, he said, adding that the auto companies should set stable prices and stop the costly incentive programs intended to attract buyers.

HEADLINE: Confidence in U.S. Economy Sends Stocks Up in London

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
The dollar fell in Europe today while United States currency markets were closed for Labor Day, but renewed confidence in the American economy lifted stock prices in London.
The dollar closed in London at 1.9780 West German marks, down from 1.9815 on Friday in New York. The currency was unchanged at 145.95 Japanese yen. 
Dealers said there was a growing belief that the dollar would start climbing toward the psychologically important level of 2 marks, from around 1.98 marks now, when trading begins on Tuesday.
They said economic figures released in Washington on Friday would encourage traders to keep buying the dollar although they were wary that central banks might intervene to keep it at acceptable levels.
The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate in August, excluding non-farm jobs, fell by one-tenth of a percentage point, to 5.1 percent, reflecting a basically healthy economy.
The Commerce Department, in another report, said the index of leading indicators rose by two-tenths of a percent in July, the first increase in three months.
Taken together, the markets interpreted the data as proving that the economy was still growing and not slipping into a recession, as some analysts had forecast.
This is expected to encourage the the Federal Reserve to maintain tight credit policies to continue to keep inflation down.
Relatively high American interest rates have supported the dollar so far this year because of good returns on dollar-denominated investments. In June, it rose despite concerted intervention to highs of 2 marks and 149 yen.
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average surged to a record 2,752.09, a gain of 14.82 points, because of the belief that the American economy is in fairly good health.
The sentiment found favor in London, where the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 issues gained 11.70 points, to close at 2,419.20, setting a post-crash high.

HEADLINE: Mexico and Japan Expected To Solidify Economic Ties

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu arrived here today on a three-day official visit that is expected to solidify a diversifying and rapidly growing economic relationship whose importance to Mexico is exceeded only by Mexico's ties to the United States.
The visit comes less than two months after Japan pledged to make up to $10 billion available to countries in Latin America and elsewhere in the third world for debt-reduction efforts. As part of the debt restructuring recently negotiated with its foreign creditors, the Mexican Government is to receive the largest portion of that money, $2.05 billion in new loans.
In Washington this past weekend, Japanese officials announced that they would speed up distribution of those funds, promising to disburse $1.4 billion to Mexico by January. The money, which will be used to buy zero-coupon United States bonds as collateral for the debt-reduction bonds Mexico plans to issue, was originally to have been disbursed in equal parts over the next three years. 
Perhaps more than any event in recent years, Japan's willingness to help find a solution to the problem of Mexico's $100 billion foreign debt certified that Tokyo had become an important economic and financial force here. Japan, one diplomat here said, ''has been invited by the United States to become a major player in a country Washington has always viewed as being its backyard, and Mexico is having to learn to adjust to that new reality.''
For Japan, Mexico is attractive both as a market of 85 million people and as a gateway to the United States and the rest of Latin America. The fact that Mr. Kaifu included Mexico on the itinerary of his first foreign visit as Prime Minister ''shows the great interest and sympathy our country has toward Mexico and the entire zone of the Caribbean and Latin America,'' Ryukichi Imai, Japan's Ambassador to Mexico, said at a news conference.
Mr. Kaifu's visit, one Mexican official said, caps ''a period of dynamism'' in economic relations with Japan beginning at the start of the decade. Japan has become this country's second-largest trading partner, second-biggest creditor and third-largest foreign investor, according to Mexican Government statistics.
Since 1982, Japanese private direct investment here has doubled, and now amounts to $1.5 billion among some 200 companies.
A particularly active sector is the one known as the maquiladora, which permits foreign-owned factories in Mexico to import components free of duty, assemble them in Mexico using cheap local labor and then export the finished product. More than a score of Japanese manufacturers, including Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba and Matsushita, operate in Mexico, exporting mainly to the United States, which charges a low duty on products assembled in Mexico.
 
Growth in Trade
Bilateral trade too has grown to $3.4 billion last year, from $2.1 billion in 1980, with the balance slightly in Japan's favor and Mexico pressing Tokyo to buy a greater variety of Mexican products. ''The fact that petroleum represents 71 percent of our sales makes it imperative to maintain an emphasis on the promotion of our non-oil exports,'' one Mexican official said.
But Mexican interest in Japan has intensified since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in December. Mr. Salinas's children have attended Japanese schools here, speak the language and have visited the country, all of which has given Mr. Salinas a reputation as something of a ''Japanophile.''
''The Japanese have a culture that I admire very much,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''I like their discipline, their democratic discipline, the way they have introduced into their culture the need to be orderly.''
 
Facing Two Oceans
Since coming to power, Mr. Salinas has repeatedly emphasized that Mexico is a nation facing both the Pacific and the Atlantic. Diplomats and bankers here said that his motivation is partly strategic, reflecting Mexico's traditional search for any counterbalance to its political and economic dependence on the United States, but that he is also eager to take advantage of the trade and investment opportunities.
The Japanese private sector has expressed some reservations about increasing its presence here. Though new and more liberal foreign investment regulations were announced in April, Japanese business executives continue to complain of what they describe as the insufficient clarity and potential for bureaucratic arbitrariness in the way Mexico deals with foreign investment.
 
New Loan Expected
Mr. Salinas is expected to announce at the end of this week's visit that he will travel to Japan sometime in 1990. Mexican officials said that while Mr. Kaifu is here the Japanese Government would also announce a $1 billion long-term, low-interest loan to be used to combat Mexico City's air and water pollution, the worst of any major city in the world.
It is less clear, however, what Japanese Government agencies and private banks plan to do about the $14.8 billion of Mexico's foreign debt that they held as of the end of 1988. Mr. Imai said it remained to be seen whether Japanese banks would choose to make new loans to Mexico or accept a reduction in the value of existing loans, the options available to them under the July debt-reduction agreement.

HEADLINE: Challenging Airfone's Monopoly

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Twenty years after forming a company that helped break up the Bell telephone system, once the world's largest monopoly, John D. Goeken is seeking to crack another telephone monopoly, the GTE Corporation's service that allows airline passengers to make calls during flights.
Such calls are possible because of technology that Mr. Goeken developed at Airfone, another company he founded and later sold to GTE. It is the only company licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to provide public telephone service on commercial airplanes. But a recent court ruling in favor of Mr. Goeken may allow him to establish new competition.
Although GTE Airfone's license is temporary and expires in December, the F.C.C. is considering whether to grant the company a monopoly license, giving it the entire four megahertz of the radio spectrum that has been allotted for air phone service. 
 
Goeken Group's 'Sharing Plan'
Mr. Goeken wants the F.C.C. to allow competition by licensing two or more providers to share that spectrum. He said his ''sharing plan'' would allow new companies to provide air-to-ground telephone services with the same efficiency as a single provider and would bring consumers better service and lower rates.
Last week, the F.C.C. agreed to hear Mr. Goeken's plan before ruling on whether to grant GTE a permanent license.
Mr. Goeken said that if his company, the Goeken Group, is allowed to enter the air phone market, it will offer consumers a variety of new in-flight services, including the capability to transmit and receive data and facsimiles from the ground on a laptop computer or facsimile machine.
 
Claims of Improved Service
''We plan to show the airlines that our air phone system is of higher quality and will allow them to attract more passengers,'' Mr. Goeken said. ''Our system will connect consumers faster and will not cut them off in the middle of a conversation,'' a reference to a cause of frequent complaints by business customers about the current system.
Industry analysts said new competition for air phone service would probably result in lower rates and spur a variety of new services. These could include in-flight reservation services - allowing passengers to make airline, rental car and hotel reservations with a toll-free number - and a system that would allow consumers to call up stock quotes.
Analysts expect Airfone to have revenues of about $50 million this year, and they predict that with new competition, the air phone market could reach $300 million in two years. GTE Airfone, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said it was still in the investment stage and declined to discuss its finances.
 
License Approval Expected
''I fully expect Mr. Goeken to get his license to enter the air phone industry, because it goes along with F.C.C. policy of allowing as much competition as possible in the telephone market,'' said Steve Sazegari, a telecommunications analyst with Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.
Mr. Goeken, who learned about microwave radio in the Army, is considered a pioneer in telecommunications technology. In the late 1960's, he offered the first serious competition to the long-distance telephone industry when he started Microwave Communications Inc., which provided two-way radio service for truck drivers between Chicago and St. Louis. With the aid of a financial expert, William G. McGowan, Mr. Goeken's company has grown into a multibillion-dollar corporation, known today as MCI Communications. Lawsuits filed by MCI and the Government led to an agreement that resulted in the dismantling of the Bell System's monopoly.
MCI is now the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Mr. Goeken, who left MCI in 1974 and founded Airfone in 1976, also established the FTD Mercury Network, which processes millions of orders for florists nationwide each year. View of Official at F.C.C. ''When you tell Jack Goeken that he can't do something, he always finds a way around you, usually with his technical expertise,'' said Frank Wright, chief of the F.C.C.'s frequency liaison branch, which operates in the commission's Office of Engineering and Technology. ''He has a brilliant mind and seems to be moving the technology along. He's always in the process of change.''
Mr. Wright declined to comment on the agency's plans for spectrum allocation in the air phone market except to say the commission hopes to reach a decision by spring.
The Goeken Group can expect an uphill battle from GTE, which says that it does not oppose competition but that it is not technically or economically feasible for more than one carrier to provide air phone service.
''We feel that we have the ability to compete with anyone, including a company that Goeken may decide to start,'' said Ron Kernkamp, GTE Airfone's vice president for business planning and development. ''But our traffic projections indicate that in areas of high demand, the supply and quality of service would suffer if more than one provider were allowed to use the four-megahertz spectrum.''
For technical reasons, the commission has expressed some concerns in the past about dividing the small spectrum between several licensees.
 
How Air Phones Work
Airfone was born in 1976 when Mr. Goeken invented the technology that allows telephone conversations from airplanes moving at speeds of more than 500 miles an hour.
Airfone conversations are carried on a special radio frequency. Signals are beamed by an antenna under the aircraft to a ground station set up along the flight path. There are about 75 ground stations throughout the United States and Canada.
The ground stations include radio transmitters and receivers connected to the telephone network. An aircraft equipped with an Airfone system has a radio receiver and a computer that assists the radio in locating the best ground station to connect the call.
To use the Airfone system, a passenger inserts a credit card in a wall-mounted unit. Once the card has been validated, a cordless handset is released, allowing the passenger to take the phone to a seat. Charges appear on the caller's credit-card bill.
 
Airlines Receive a Commission
Many of the large airlines offer Airfone, including American, Delta, Eastern, Northwest, Ozark, Trump Shuttle, TWA, United, Midway and Continental.
Airlines providing Airfone service receive a commission based on the number of calls made. Calls within the United States and Canada, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, cost $7.50 for the first three minutes and $1.25 for each additional minute.
In 1986, GTE bought the company from Mr. Goeken and the Western Union Corporation, a part owner, for about $60 million. Under the agreement, Mr. Goeken was to remain chairman of Airfone through 1990 and receive compensation based on the company's future earnings.
But Mr. Goeken resigned from Airfone in February, contending that GTE had stripped him of his authority to manage the company and failed to exploit opportunities to increase the business. He sued GTE, saying his employment contract had been breached, and sought to be released from a clause in the contract that prevented him from forming a competitive company. The DuPage County Circuit Court, in Wheaton, Ill., ruled in favor of Mr. Goeken in June, but GTE has appealed.
 
Earnings Estimated
GTE Airfone is expected to report about $50 million in revenues this year, Mr. Goeken said, while predicting that the service would lose about $100 million from 1988 to 1990. GTE said it does not break out figures for the Airfone subsidiary.
Several companies hope to use a different part of the radio spectrum to develop a market for air telephone calls relayed by satellite.
Mr. Kernkamp of GTE Airfone said that the company had been installing new equipment and increasing the number of ground stations to improve the quality of service and that it has introduced a seat-back version of its Airfone that allows passengers to use a telephone without leaving their seats. The ''Seatfone'' can be installed in the front of the airliner's food tray and is wired rather than cordless.
Mr. Kernkamp said GTE Airfone also planned to introduce a new pricing plan that would make calls under three minutes less expensive.
GTE Airfone has contracts to provide its air telephone equipment for 2,697 planes; it has installed the system in 1,107 planes.
 
Plan to Oppose Airline Pacts
Mr. Goeken said he would oppose GTE Airfone's use of exclusive long-term agreements with most big airlines because the F.C.C. ''never intended to give GTE Airfone a monopoly position'' when it granted the company a temporary experimental license.
Although he has founded a number of highly successful communications ventures, including MCI, Airfone, FTD, CML Satellite Company and the Business Telecommunications Corporation, Mr. Goeken has spent little time with his startups, choosing to move on to new challenges.
''In a big company, people are afraid to take risks because they have to account for any losses,'' Mr. Goeken said. ''I would rather try it and find out it doesn't work rather than spend a month arguing about whether or not to do it.''

Marvin Davis is seeking the help of foreign airlines in an effort to top a $6.75 billion offer for UAL from a group that includes the company's management, its pilots union and British Airways, a person involved in the California billionaire's bid said. Both European and non-European carriers have been approached, the source said. The future of the offers for UAL, the parent of United Airlines, lies with virtually the same directors that two years ago reversed their approval of a leveraged recapitalization plan. [Page D1.]

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT OFFERS STRATEGY FOR U.S. ON DRUG CONTROL

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Calling the drug problem ''the toughest domestic challenge we've faced in decades,'' President Bush tonight proposed a national drug control strategy that focuses heavily on increased law enforcement against drug sellers and users.
In a televised address from the Oval Office, Mr. Bush adopted a tone of urgency in warning that drugs were a grave threat ''sapping our strength as a nation.''
''There is no match for a united America, a determined America, an angry America,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Our outrage against drugs unites us, brings us together behind this one plan of action, an assault on every front.'' #70% for Law Enforcement Nearly 70 percent of the proposed drug package is directed at law enforcement, and the plan seeks stiffer sentences for everyone involved in drugs, from occasional users to international drug traffickers. 
But critics say this approach gives short shrift to education and prevention efforts as well as to treatment of drug addicts.
In some respects the strategy calls for the Goverment to do more of what it has been doing for years, like building more prisons and intensifying efforts against international drug organizations. In fact, since the Nixon Administration, about 70 percent of Federal anti-drug money has gone to law enforcement. [News Analysis, page B7.] Fighting Drugs on the Street The proposal calls for a $7.9 billion program beginning in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, an increase of about $2.2 billion over the current fiscal year. But Mr. Bush's plan would spend only $716 million more than was budgeted for the next fiscal year, because most of the added $2.2 billion would not actually be spent until future years.
In his proposals, Mr. Bush also essentially sought to shift the focus from stopping narcotics at the border to fighting drug trafficking on the street.
The major elements of the plan have been disclosed over the last few weeks.
The President's plan calls for increasing the nation's police effort and creating more Federal prison space for drug offenders, as well as providing some additional money for treatment programs for addicts. It would also provide more military and economic aid to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the main sources of cocaine.
In confronting what many Americans have told poll takers they believe is the most serious problem gripping the nation, Mr. Bush has undertaken the most visible domestic initiative of his Presidency. With the prime-time address, his first as President, Mr. Bush placed his own leadership on the line and raised the stakes on a domestic issue that raises potential pitfalls.
The central one is that the money proposed seems to many critics to be inadequate to the enormity of the undertaking. Previous attempts by Presidents to wage a war on drugs, starting tenatively with John F. Kennedy and including Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, have failed.
 
Democrats Are Critical
Republicans generally applauded the Bush proposal, but many Democrats were critical, saying the package was inadequate in the face of the narcotics crisis.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said: ''I think that the problem is so great, it's reached not only every city in the country, but into rural areas as well. It's going to be a many, many year effort, and it's going to require much more money and effort.''
Mr. Foley said the program would increase pressure for an eventual tax increase. ''It's very difficult to assume we can, at least over the long term, meet the cost of the drug war without some additional revenue coming into the Government,'' Mr. Foley said.
Over all, the areas covered in the President's anti-drug plan include $1.6 billion for corrections, $250 million for the the court system, $3.1 billion for law enforcement, $1.2 billion for prevention and education, and $925 million for treatment.
Mr. Bush's speech was marked by a dramatic device: At several points the President held aloft a plastic bag containing crack, the smokable form of cocaine, that was seized several days ago near the White House. ''It's as innocent looking as candy, but it's turning our cities into battle zones and is murdering our children,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Let there be no mistake. This stuff is poison.''
Mr. Bush spoke stiffly and, at times, seemed uncomfortable as he delivered his remarks to the national television audience.
To attack cocaine at its source, Mr. Bush's plan would triple, to $261.2 million, the amount of military and law-enforcement aid for Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. Morever, the plan proposed a $2 billion five-year program for the Andean region in the three countries, the primary sources of cocaine smuggled to America, and called for a summit between the United States and Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to deal with illegal drugs.
Gearing up for the prime-time address, Mr. Bush returned to the White House from his summer vacation in Kennebunkport, Me., on Sunday afternoon and almost immediately spent at least an hour with Roger Ailes, his campaign news media adviser, rehearsing the speech.
With other aides, Mr. Bush practiced the address for an hour this morning and 45 minutes in the afternoon. In between speech preparations, Mr. Bush joined William J. Bennett, the Federal drug policy director, to discuss his new strategy in separate meetings today with the Cabinet, lawmakers, state and local officials as well as law-enforcment officers and rehabilitation and education experts. White House aides said the speech had undergone numerous drafts and was extensively rewritten several times.
 
Infighting Is Cited
Mr. Bush as well as Mr. Bennett have emphasized that past national drug efforts had been marked by bureaucratic infighting and overlap. They vowed that, under Mr. Bennett, the first head of Federal drug policy, duplication and feuding within the Government would diminish.
''What we had in the past was a lot of departments and agencies doing things, very good things, catching bad guys and putting bad guys in prison, and seizing cocaine, and making life difficult for traffickers,'' Mr. Bennett told reporters at the White House today. ''But these efforts were going on independently of each other and not in a coordinated way.''
''This is not, obviously, the end of all enmity, of all turf, of all stepping on toes,'' he said. ''But it is now less likely to happen, and when it does happen, it will be resolved because there's an office of policy.''
 
'Amed at Reducing Drug Use'
Beyond this, Mr. Bennett said the distinctive element of the drug strategy is that ''we identify the chief and seminal wrong here as drug use.''
''Drug use, we say, is wrong,'' said Mr. Bennett. ''There are lots of other things that are wrong, such as money laundering and crime and violence in the inner city, but drug use itself is wrong. And that means the strategy is aimed at reducing drug use.''
In his prepared speech, Mr. Bush addressed what he termed the four major elements of the plan. These are expanding law enforcement and criminal justice measures to deal with drugs; international assistance to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia; increasing drug treatment centers and an increase in funds for school and community programs to help young people ''reject enticements to try drugs.''
''I'm proposing that we more than double Federal assistance to state and local law enforcement,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I am also proposing that we enlarge our criminal justice system across the board, at the local, state and Federal level alike. We need more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors.''
Mr. Bush said he was proposing a nearly $1.5 billion increase in drug-related Federal spending for law enforcement.
''We've all heard stories about drug dealers who are caught and arrested, again and again, but never punished,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Well, here the rules have changed. If you sell drugs, you will be caught. And when you're caught, you will be prosecuted. And you're convicted you will do time. Caught. Prosecuted. Punished.'' On the international front, Mr. Bush said that the $65 million in emergency aid that the United States is sending to Colombia to aid its drug fight was only the first step in a five-year $2 billion program to help Colombia, Peru and Bolivia ''counter the producers, the traffickers and the smugglers.''
The third part of the strategy, treatment for addicts, includes an increase of $321 million in Federal spending. Mr. Bush acknowledged that experts believe that two million drug users may be able to ''get off drugs with proper treatment,'' but only 40 percent of them are actually getting help. ''This is not enough,'' said the President.
And the fourth part of the strategy, education, involves a $250 million increase in Federal funds for school and community prevention programs. ''Every school, college and university, and every workplace must adopt tough and fair policies about drug use by students and employees,'' said Mr. Bush.
Of the overall program, Mr. Bush said; ''This is the toughest domestic challenge we've faced in decades. And it is a challenge we must face, not as Democrats or Republicans, libereals or conservatives, but as Americans.''
Classified sections of the report approved by the White House National Security Council, which deal with international affairs and intelligence, were not included in the version made public, Administration officials said. Those chapters, officials said, included specifics like details about deploying the military in fighting drugs abroad.
The unclassified version of the plan does say that improved intelligence gathering is essential to stemming the flow of drugs and it urges law enforcement officials to work more closely with intelligence officials at the Pentagon, State Department and Central Intelligence Agency.

HEADLINE: DE KLERK STIRRING WASHINGTON HOPES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
American officials say they have high hopes, but no firm expectations, that the Acting President of South Africa, F. W. de Klerk, will be more willing than his predecessors to negotiate with blacks on steps to end apartheid.
Seven months after President Bush took office, the Administration is still reviewing American policy toward the Pretoria Government in the hope that it can reach agreement with Democrats in Congress to avoid a repetition of the bitter battles of the Reagan years.
The current sanctions against South Africa were adopted by Congress in 1986 over President Reagan's veto. They include a ban on the import and export of certain products and a prohibition on new lending and investment. 
The Bush Administration contends that the existing sanctions have been effective in putting economic, political and psychological pressure on white South Africans, but that further sanctions now would be self-defeating.
 
Democrats May Lack Votes
Democrats in Congress say they probably do not now have the votes to win Senate approval for tougher sanctions. As a result, they said, Mr. de Klerk will have at least several months to show if he is willing to phase out white rule and to negotiate with blacks on power sharing.
Herman J. Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said Mr. de Klerk had expressed support for ''a negotiated political settlement'' of the conflict in South Africa.
''He ought to be given a chance to pursue that if he gets elected,'' Mr. Cohen said in an interview last week. ''Some of his recent comments have been interesting and helpful. We'll wait to see what he does.''
South Africa holds elections on Wednesday. The voting is to choose members for houses of Parliament for South Africans of white, mixed-race and Indian descent. The black majority has no representation in Parliament. Mr. de Klerk, the head of the governing National Party, is expected to become President if the party wins the elections, as seems likely.
To Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the need for a bipartisan policy on South Africa seems almost as important as the substance of that policy. He is seeking an agreement like the one he negotiated with Congress on Central America.
''No South African policy, in my opinion, is going to work unless we're unified, unless we can coordinate well between the legislative and executive branches,'' Mr. Baker said at his confirmation hearing in January.
Representative Howard Wolpe, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said Democrats in Congress were seeking some sort of agreement with the Administration to this effect: The United States would impose additional sanctions if, by the spring of 1990, Mr. de Klerk has not taken steps to enter negotiations with ''credible black leaders,'' to end rule by emergency decree, to lift the ban on leading anti-apartheid groups and to release political prisoners like Nelson R. Mandela.
 
Congressman's Prediction
''If it's clear by February that de Klerk does not represent fundamental change, that repression is continuing and that conditions for negotiations have not been achieved, you will find bipartisan support in the Senate as well as the House for strong additional sanctions,'' Mr. Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat, predicted.
Mr. Cohen said the Administration had made ''no commitment on a time frame for sanctions'' to Mr. Wolpe or any other member of Congress.
The growing anti-apartheid campaign in South Africa and the current crackdown on dissent there may increase Congressional support for additional sanctions. Today, the Administration noted the detention of Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu on Monday and a spokesman declared, ''We condemn South Africa's system of racial segregation and urge the South African Government to permit peaceful expression of political dissent.''
 
A 'Much Smoother' Leader
Representative Wolpe said there was ''a lot of speculation about whether de Klerk represents real change.''
''There is nothing in his history that should provide optimism, not a single reformist initiative that he has been associated with in his career,'' the Congressman said. Mr. de Klerk, he went on, is ''much smoother'' than his predecessor, P. W. Botha, and ''better able to put a positive face on the tragedy of South Africa,'' but ''that is very different from saying we'll witness a fundamental change of policy.''
Mr. Cohen, however, declined to predict how Mr. de Klerk would respond to demands for change. ''His background is irrelevant,'' the diplomat said. ''It's ridiculous to talk about his background.''
Many of the people now predicting that Mr. de Klerk will be intransigent also once said South Africa would never give independence to Namibia, but Pretoria has agreed to do just that, Mr. Cohen noted.
He recalled that some experts had suggested that Mr. de Klerk, because of his conservative credentials, could take steps to end apartheid, just as President Nixon, an inveterate anti-Communist, was able to go to China in 1972.
The Bush Administration has made some gestures indicating that it is more sympathetic to anti-apartheid forces than was the Reagan Administration. For example, on June 30, President Bush met at the White House with Albertina Sisulu, co-president of South Africa's largest anti-apartheid coalition, the United Democratic Front.
She is the wife of Walter Sisulu, who led the African National Congress with Mr. Mandela until the two were imprisoned in the early 1960's.

HEADLINE: Ciudad Bolivia Journal;
Forsaken Land Awaits a New Breed of Farmers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CIUDAD BOLIVIA, Venezuela

 BODY:
Out on the flat plains of western Venezuela, where cows outnumber people, a seed has been sown to bring Latin Americans back to the land.
In a small step forward for a nation that until recently imported eggs from Miami, the first graduates marched forth this summer from a new institute here, proudly gripping diplomas in ''advanced tropical farm management.''
In a continent where each year millions of people abandon the country for the city, the graduates of the Simon Bolivar United World Agricultural Institute learn skills irrevocably anchored in the land: repairing manure spreaders, building silos, surveying irrigation ditches, making cheese, controlling weeds and pruning fruit trees.
According to the Inter-American Development Bank, 90 percent of Latin America's population growth in the last two decades has been concentrated in cities. While the population of Sao Paulo, Brazil, is expected to swell to 20 million by the end of the century, some rural areas of Brazil are losing population. 
 
Half of Food Imported
In Venezuela, a nation twice the size of California, fertile soils abound. But 81 percent of Venezuela's 19 million people now live in cities and the country imports half of its food.
''With the oil boom, it was cheaper to import food,'' said Luis Marcano, director of the new agricultural college. ''So the countryside was largely abandoned.''
The college, opened in 1986, is fruit of a growing realization that Latin America needs more farming professionals trained in modern techniques.
With fishponds, cow-milking stations, henhouses, beehives, fruit plantations, cornfields and vegetable gardens, Simon Bolivar is the first agricultural school in a network of seven United World Colleges scattered across the globe. Started in 1962, these colleges seek to promote international friendship by attracting students from a wide variety of countries.
The first 29 students who graduated here in July were all Venezuelans. But today, the student body of 160 is made up of aspiring farmers from 25 Latin American and Caribbean nations.
 
A Long Trip for Some
For some, the trip here is a long one. Marco Antonio Gomes, a lanky 22-year-old from southern Brazil, took a weeklong succession of buses across the Amazon to reach the campus here, within sight of the snowcapped Andes.
''I was hoping they would send a plane ticket,'' Mr. Gomes said.
The attraction is a kind of agricultural education that is new to much of Latin America. Traditionally, agricultural institutes stress classroom work with occasional field visits to working farms. In contrast, Simon Bolivar brings to the third world the work-study concept long popular in the United States. The school's motto is ''Learn by doing.''
Living by farmers' hours, students awake to a campus siren at 5:45. By 7, they are in the fields or at the barns. ''What we can't learn in the field, we learn in class in the afternoon,'' said Jose Maria Ortega, a 22-year-old Ecuadorean who hopes to become a farm manager.
As students milked the school's herd, a mix of Brown Swiss and zebu, Lino A. Rodriguez, a dairy instructor, said, ''All our meat, milk, cheese and chicken now comes from the farms.''
Standing by a pigsty, Miguel Angel Pinango, a 20-year-old first-year student from Venezuela, said, ''It's better to be out here with the animals, where we can check the things we learn in class.''
Today, about half of the food served in the school cafeteria is produced by students. By 1992, Mr. Marcano hopes that the food production will cover 75 percent of the school's needs and will be sold locally to defray 20 percent of teaching costs.
Learning rural development skills, students also work in eight surrounding villages, teaching nutrition, health and improved farming techniques to 600 peasant families.
In their third and last year at the school, students spend six months managing a private local farm. By graduation, the entire senior class found farming jobs in Venezuela.
 
Self-Sufficiency Is Aim
Confronted with diminishing revenues from oil, Venezuela's dominant export, the nation's new President, Carlos Andres Perez, has embarked on an long-term effort to return his nation to self-sufficiency in food.
In one step, he lifted exchange controls last March from the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar. The resulting devaluation almost tripled the price of imported food.
In 1979, during his first term as President, Mr. Perez approved the farming institute here, acting on a proposal made by Prince Charles of Britain during a visit in 1978. ''It is an interesting experiment,'' Mr. Perez said in a recent interview in Caracas. ''We are going to give them some more land so they can grow.''
Prince Charles, who is president of the international council of United World Colleges, returned here in February to see how his idea had taken shape.
 
Courses Are Added
''I believe that the Instituto Simon Bolivar could be a trend-setter,'' he wrote after his recent visit. ''By combining sensitive treatment of environmental issues with sustainable development, the college could contribute toward resolving the problem of the integration of development with conservation measures.''
He cited the need to teach recycling and biological control of pests and to develop ''more appropriate forms of technologies for rural communities.''
Armed with a mandate to increase enrollment in five years to 360, Mr. Marcano is now working to add one new diploma course each year over the next three years. The courses will be rural development, energy technology for farming, and environmental protection.
''Environmental protection will not just be the bucolic concept of preservation for preservation,'' the agronomist said one recent morning as he paused from working with Venezuelan ecologists who were shaping a curriculum. ''We are trying to design a career for management of renewable sources for production as well as for conservation.''

HEADLINE: Union Takes On China-Owned Factory

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLAYMONT, Del., Aug. 30

 BODY:
To the United Steelworkers of America, the new management of the steel plant here has an attitude toward organized labor that is reminiscent of the American robber barons.
To the management, the union's demands represent a prescription for failure for an enterprise that has created jobs, paid taxes and has otherwise contributed to the local and national economy.
It sounds like a classic labor dispute, except for one thing: The new management of CitiSteel USA Inc. is an agency of the Chinese Government.
CitiSteel, a wholly owned subsidiary of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, says it seeks a more efficient work force, without featherbedding, and one in which the employees are given broad responsibilities. Only a handful of its steelworkers were employed by the company's predecessor, the defunct Phoenix Steel Corporation. 
The union charges that CitiSteel does not want a unionized plant and has therefore broken a promise to fill its work force with former Phoenix Steel workers.
The dispute is before the National Labor Relations Board, and both sides say a decision is imminent.
 
An American at the Helm
In an open letter to the Chinese Government, the union said: ''How ironic, the People's Republic of China, which professes to be a workers' government, in their own land, is guilty of suppressing workers in ours.
''CitiSteel may like to call itself a 'Socialist Conglomerate,' but when it comes to worker issues, it acts just like the worst capitalist.''
But James E. Hasson, president of CitiSteel, said, ''We have told everyone we've hired that we do not feel that they need a third party to represent them, but they, of course, have the right to bring in a third party.''
Mr. Hasson, an American, reports directly to the company chairman, Ming Lu, a Chinese whose office is across the hall from Mr. Hasson's. The administration building overlooks the grimy steel complex on the banks of the Delaware River.
The Chinese bought Phoenix Steel's assets in June 1988 for $13.5 million, invested an additional $56 million in renovation and assumption of debts and reopened the plant last March. Whereas Phoenix Steel had manufactured armor plate for submarines, the new company makes steel plate for bridges, buildings and heavy machinery, selling it in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
China bought the plant because ''the price was right,'' Mr. Hasson said, and it also was a business that the trust corporation understood, because it already operates two steel plants in China.
In addition, Mr. Hasson said, the Chinese sought ''to gain a toehold on heavy manufacturing in the U.S.''
The Delaware plant is only one part of China's growing network of overseas investments, which are owned and operated by the trust corporation. Others include a Colorado gold mine, a Washington logging company, an Arizona office building, a Canadian pulp mill, an Australian aluminum smelter, a Spanish fish processor, a New Zealand wool-scouring company and a Thai machinery company.
The plant here is producing 14,000 tons of steel plate a month, and its management hopes to increase production to 20,000 tons a month, for annual sales of $100 million.
CitiSteel employs 200 people and plans to hire 50 to 100 more. But 800 people worked at Phoenix Steel, and the steelworkers' union says the Chinese are morally and legally bound to hire those workers. So far, CitiSteel has hired only 38 former Phoenix Steel employees, and all of those were skilled workers.
Mr. Hasson said his company has not filled its work force with Phoenix Steel employees because ''we are running the business in a totally different manner.'' Unlike Phoenix Steel, where the workers did only one job, ''we expect people to do a number of jobs,'' he said.
''You can't bring back the old work force and expect to make major changes,'' he added.
 
'The World Is Changing'
Mr. Hasson also said that by eliminating featherbedding and broadening individual workers' responsibilities, the company expected 250 to 350 workers to produce as much as the larger work force of Phoenix Steel.
''The world is changing,'' Mr. Hasson said. ''The Chinese are just as capitalistic as anyone.''
But Norman Hayman, staff representative for United Steelworkers District 7, said, ''They've been screening out people because of their union activities.'' That is the charge the union took before the labor relations board.
The union contends that because it represented the workers at Phoenix Steel, it now represents the work force at its successor plant as well. ''We can't organize the plant,'' Mr. Hayman said, ''because we'd be saying we don't have the right to represent the employees. We think we do.''
But CitiSteel contends that it merely bought the assets of the Phoenix Steel plant and is not a successor to the defunct company, and, therefore, the union has no right to represent its workers.
 
Promise Is in Dispute
The union bases its assertion that CitiSteel promised to hire Phoenix Steel workers on a statement by Grover Brown, a lawyer for L.H. Chang, a Hong Kong businessman who brokered China's acquisition of the company.
Mr. Brown, in an effort supported by the union, persuaded the Delaware Legislature to exempt CitiSteel from the Coastal Zoning Act, which bans heavy manufacturing in coastal areas, including rivers. At that hearing he said of CitiSteel, ''It is their intention to utilize those former workers who have the skill and can be the most helpful in getting the plant open.''
The union interprets Mr. Brown's statement as a commitment to hire the workers who had been laid off by Phoenix Steel; the company says the statement gives it considerable leeway in determining who to hire.
But the Chinese appear to be embarrassed by the union's campaign, and CitiSteel recently agreed to hire 25 more former employees of Phoenix Steel.

HEADLINE: Help for Workers in a Complex World

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Because millions of American workers cannot read, write or reason well enough to do their jobs, demand is growing for programs to teach adults literacy and technical skills.
The programs, often taken to people where they work, can be as basic as English for recent immigrants or as sophisticated as helping employees in high-technology industries master complex documents.
In a Long Island City warehouse, a teacher gives English lessons to Hispanic, Italian and Slavic employees at a Ronzoni pasta factory so they can learn to operate new automated equipment. In northeastern Mississippi, the state is using a tractor-trailer outfitted as a mobile learning laboratory, complete with computers, to give lessons in job-related reading and mathematics to 14 potential recruits for a new plant that makes rocket motors for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 
A Widely Scattered Effort
''Most jobs today need basic skills approaching 12th-grade levels,'' said Harold W. McGraw Jr., president of the Business Council for Effective Literacy, a national clearinghouse for data on adult literacy. But he added, ''Seventy-five percent of the adults in today's labor force will be there for the next two or three decades, and one in five reads below the eighth-grade level.'' 
It is hard to assess the results of literacy programs, partly because there has been little effort to coordinate them. Federal efforts are scattered among 79 agencies; at least half the states have some sort of literacy initiative, but the goals and budgets vary widely.
Even the definition of literacy is disputed. Last year Congress asked the Department of Education to define the term and then to estimate how many Americans are illiterate. But that survey, involving thousands of interviews, will take four years, said Andrew Kolstad, project officer at the Government's National Center for Educational Statistics.
While the study will assess the dimensions of the problem, no one disputes that a problem exists and that it becomes more urgent as businesses try to keep up with foreign competition.
''Twenty to thirty million adult Americans lack basic literacy skills, and that makes adult literacy a life-and-death economic and social issue for this country,'' said Forrest P. Chisman, director of the Southport Institute, a research group in Washington that completed an analysis of adult literacy this year.
 
A 'Jump Start' for Nonreaders
The study, ''Jump Start,'' was published by the institute and financed by companies and foundations. It urged the Government to create a national center for research and technical help in training a corps of thousands of adult literacy instructors. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Representative Thomas C. Sawyer of Ohio recently introduced bills that would advance those objectives.
Although President Bush has vowed to be the ''education President,'' Mr. Chisman said, ''the Administration clearly does not yet have a literacy agenda.'' The First Lady is honorary chairwoman of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, which focuses on encouraging parents and children to learn reading together. The foundation, financed by private donations, is operated by volunteers.
But in a time of big Federal deficits, action on literacy is most likely to come from state and local governments, private companies and foundations. Among government programs, experts say a number hold promise, including these:
* In Illinois, a statewide effort has been organized to pull together civic groups, educators, volunteers, employers and labor representatives to support 250 tutoring programs at colleges, libraries and even firehouses. The state has spent $19 million in the past four years to educate 36,000 adults in reading and mathematics, and has helped businesses and unions operate basic-skills programs for workers in factories and union halls.
* In Massachusetts, a team of literacy experts, government officials and labor and business leaders developed a work-force literacy program that is expected to grow from 45,000 to 100,000 participants a year by 1991. It is one of the first state efforts shaped around specific needs in the job market, reflecting the shift from manufacturing toward service industries.
* Virginia has begun a 10-year program centered on the Virginia Literacy Foundation, which has raised $3 million from 230 businesses and provides support for private literacy groups. A state Adult Literacy Committee promotes collaboration between public and private literacy groups.
* Mississippi has become the first state to offer a tax credit to corporations training or retraining workers.
* New York City provided more than $40 million over last four years for adult literacy, far more than any major city, according to the Business Council for Effective Literacy. It budgeted $15.2 million this year for programs at 300 places, including schools, colleges, libraries and factories like the Ronzoni warehouse, where 75 workers were tutored.
City officials estimate that New York has at least 1.5 million adults who cannot fill out a job application, understand instructions on a medicine bottle or write a simple letter. Yet literacy programs reach just 47,000 New Yorkers, and 13,000 are waiting for placement.
 
'Diverse as the City Itself'
''Our classes are as diverse as the city itself,'' said John Casey, acting director of the Mayor's office of adult literacy. New York's programs provide basic education in reading and writing, but also in skills like interviewing for a job.
At the Mid-Manhattan Adult Learning Center on West 120th Street, 700 adults take remedial instruction or train for new careers. Though classes have ended for the summer, one instructor, Anne Goodwin, gave up her vacation and devoted another two weeks without pay to tutoring 15 students facing high school equivalency tests.
Outside government, some of the most aggressive drives for worker literacy come from the trade unions, which are pressing for education benefits for members.
In New York City, the Consortium for Worker Education links 10 unions around the issue of literacy. It has helped 17,000 members, preparing most for entry-level jobs and providing others with college training. Financed by Federal, state and city grants, it is now negotiating to extend literacy training to the 200 unions affiliated with the Central Labor Council, which represents 1.2 million workers.
''By 1994, the consortium should be training 30,000 workers,'' said Joe McDermott, the executive director, ''and employers who want qualified workers will have to come to us.''
 
'Good Work and We Can Prove It'
Until recently, literacy attracted limited support from private sources. Substantial grants came mainly from a few companies, including the Gannett Company and B. Dalton Bookseller, and the MacArthur, Ford and Hewlett Foundations.
Another philanthropy, the UPS Foundation, based in Greenwich, Conn., is providing $2.2 million over three years for a literacy program. Part of the money will help teen-age mothers learn basic skills through the New Chance Program of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a national research organization that develops programs for the needy. It will also equip 20 centers, operated by U.S. Basics, a nonprofit educational institute, for teaching English to immigrants. And it will help United Way promote six programs with a goal of developing a model for a nationwide effort.
Some smaller businesses are setting up their own programs with government help.
Champ Industries, a metal works in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., began losing contracts because workers could not keep pace with new marketplace technology. ''Our products must meet precision standards,'' said Stephen Shuster, the president, ''and some workers could not use a ruler.'' Champ secured help from the Long Island Regional Education Center, which brought in experts from local schools to instruct workers in reading blueprints, basic mathematics and reading and writing English.
Now new orders are coming in, and the workers attest to the change, showing off the statistical process control charts they are trained to keep.
''Before, we argued who made the mistakes,'' said Michelle Cuesta, a 24-year-old machinist, as she sliced metal tubes with a pipe saw. ''Now we turn out good work and we can prove it.''

HEADLINE: Colombia's Leaders Take Drug Fight Seriously

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Help Colombia Fight Back, Now'' (editorial, Aug. 23) is refreshing in that it takes seriously the expressed desires of Colombia's political leadership to do battle with and break the power of their country's drug mafia.
Much coverage of Colombia's drug problem by the news media in the United States has treated Colombian authorities as not merely intimidated (which they have been), but also corrupt. Accordingly, it is widely doubted, in the news media as well as by elements in our Government, that the Colombian Government's crackdown is serious. 
In this I detect more than a whiff of the irritating North American sense of superiority to poorer peoples.
No doubt, the powerful blandishments of drug money have corrupted some Colombian officials, particularly at lower levels. But Colombia's political leadership is conscious that drugs are tearing apart the fabric of their society, as the consumption of low-quality cocaine (''bazucco'') ravages the country's urban poor. Probably of greater concern to the elite is the erosion of legal authority.
The wealth and power of the drug mafia challenges the dominance of the political and economic elite. There is a clear class difference between the university educated and cultivated traditional elite and the drug lords, who mostly are of poorer origins and have emerged from precocaine criminality.
The character of the struggle was evident in the murders of a minister of justice, an attorney general, numerous judges and one of the country's most respected newspaper editors. But it has been most pointedly dramatized by the murder of Luis Carlos Galan, the leading candidate for the presidency of Colombia. He was the political emblem of a new generation of the Colombian elite. A United States analogy would have been the assassination of John F. Kennedy in October 1960.
Of course, Colombia's political leaders are serious. But they do need support.

HEADLINE: Colombia's Leaders Take Drug Fight Seriously;
Heading for Invasion?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Bogota Says It Plans to Extradite Major Drug Financier to the U.S.'' (front page, Aug. 23), you report on property confiscated in drug raids by the Colombian authorities, including some 80 planes and helicopters. In this country, these would eventually be auctioned by the Government to raise revenue. If agents of the drug cartels repurchased these, it would solve two problems for them with one dollar; they will have replenished their supplies and laundered a portion of their drug profits. Perhaps the vehicles should be fitted (in an acceptable proffer of American technological help) with disguised tracking devices. 
You publish a photograph of a ranch seized near Bogota, prominently showing a 10-meter satellite communications antenna. The photo seems to buttress the Bush Administration's contention that its opponents in this matter are well organized and technologically sophisticated.
However, Bogota is only 5 degrees north of the Equator, a latitude at which any dish using the common commercial communications satellites would be oriented almost vertically, toward a satellite in geosynchronous orbit above the Equator. A possible, but less likely, explanation would be a link to a satellite far to the east or west. Are their communications not working, and by implication, is their technology and organization not after all so formidable?
The Administration's policy seems to be to beat the war drums in preparation for possible direct intervention. On the surface, Colombia presents far simpler logistical problems than Lebanon, with its language and time differential. An intervention in Colombia could be managed by a day-shift Pentagon and a Spanish-speaking President.
Fortunately, Congressional and Colombian repugnance for a cooperative invasion remains strong. Eventual public support might be built on a perceived threat to a whole generation of American children. While not deriding the dangers of organized drug running, I suggest the press and the public not overestimate the power and organization of the drug cartels.
Nevertheless, on their own turf, the cartels are probably unbeatable on any scale that leaves the integrity of Colombian society and the structure of its ecology intact. Too many people in Colombia and the surrounding countries have allowed coca cultivation to become their economic mainstay. The American struggle against cocaine can only be won by restructuring the fabric of American culture to make drugs an undesirable alternative to its citizens. It can never be won by attempting to root out every shrub of an entire continent's major cash crop. That was a painful lesson learned in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.

HEADLINE: You'll Never Get Rich Trading Sleep for Cash

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Hammermesh concludes from his research at the Michigan State University on the economic substitution effect of working versus sleeping that sleep is ''a matter of economic discretion,'' and that higher wages lead people to substitute work for sleep (''Economic Watch: Sleep? Why? There's No Money in It,'' front page, Aug. 2).
He concludes from regression analysis of subject data that a 25 percent increase in wages reduces the time spent in sleeping by 1 percent. Several points must be made to place this analysis in perspective.
First, correlation between wages and average hours spent sleeping means just that - a change in one occurs along with a change in the second; this alone does not allow one to infer causality. Indeed, both higher wages and reduced sleep can and do relate to other factors, for example, age, job structure and level of responsibility, extent of family and social responsibilities.
Second, organizational behaviorists agree that the link between pay and motivation is weak, at best; that while satisfaction may be the result of performance, it is not necessarily a motivation for future performance (inequity in rewards is an entirely different matter). An added complication is that performance-motivating factors differ depending on job responsibility and complexity, for example, for professionals (corporate officers and managers, physicians, lawyers) versus, say, hourly workers.
Third, the correlation in Mr. Hammermesh's work is exceptionally small, even if statistically significant - a person making $75,000 a year who receives a 25 percent increase in pay can expect to sleep on average 5 minutes less each night. Such a conclusion has no practical significance at all.

HEADLINE: The Nature of Racism: 2 Clergymen Disagree

 BODY:
Since the killing of a 16-year-old black, Yusuf K. Hawkins, by a gang of whites in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, there have been expressions of outrage, grief and remorse.
Many people, including the Rev. Herbert B. Daughtry and the Rev. Charles S. Fermeglia, have called for interracial harmony and greater communications among people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. But in a discussion on race held at The New York Times, even Mr. Daughtry and Father Fermeglia had trouble understanding each other.
Mr. Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, ministers to a black congregation. Father Fermeglia, an associate pastor at St. Dominic's Roman Catholic Church in Bensonhurst, works in a parish composed largely of Italian-Americans. 
Mr. Daughtry, who is 58 years old and has been pastor of House of the Lord for 30 years, and Father Fermeglia, who is 30 and is serving in his first church since becoming a priest last year, set out their concerns in an often spirited discussion last week with E. R. Shipp and Ralph Blumenthal of The Times.
What follows are excerpts from that discussion.
 
Response of Bensonhurst
Q. How do you evaluate the response of the Bensonhurst community to the slaying of Yusuf Hawkins?
Father FERMEGLIA: They're acting on the defensive. They're responding out of fear for the most part. . . . And they want this to end because they don't want to continue to be branded with the name of racists. It's such a word that has so much meaning to it. It just -it shocks, it hits so much.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: I think I, what I'm concerned about . . . is an attempt to just quiet this thing and get it over with, which always kind of concerns me. It's one thing to say, ''Let's cool the tension'' and ''Let's use the tension.'' So I, at this point, I just would kind of hold off a bit to see if in fact Bensonhurst is about the business of using the tension or just trying to cool the tension and return to business as usual.
Father FERMEGLIA: You're absolutely right. You're right. There's an attempt to smooth it over, more than anything. Because people don't want to deal with this. . . . I think we have to use the tension. And if we don't we're going to miss the point.
 
Significance of Demonstration
Q. In both of your views, what is the significance of the expressions of racism that came from a group, perhaps a small group, of demonstrators and counterdemonstrators, during the marches after the killing?
Mr. DAUGHTRY: That's the obvious, most blatant manifestation of racism. But you have to wonder how pervasive it is at a subtle level. Now I am by no means condemning the whole community. And I have not been from the beginning. . . . But the manifestation of the obvious, how deep is that? . . . These are youngsters. Did they learn that at the kitchen table, and the living room conversations, you know?
Mr. Daughtry pointed out that blacks have been attacked by whites in Bensonhurst on several occasions in recent years, including a December 1987 assault upon two black men, Steven and Sylvester Lamont, who were collecting cans. Following that assault, blacks marched through Bensonhurst.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: So you say, well, if the decent people would have come forward after the Lamont experience and begun to sort of do a self-inventory and to kind of put things in place and to kind of work at this . . . you're driven to raise the question: Would Yusuf still be alive?
Father FERMEGLIA: That march that happened in Bensonhurst (meaning the January 1988 march following the assault on the Lamont brothers) did not touch the people of my parish and my neighborhood because it's in a completely different section, you know, of the area. . . .
Mr. DAUGHTRY: You mean if a person is attacked or hurt in another part of Bensonhurst, or two blocks down from what might constitute your parish, people don't hear about that, don't relate to that?
Father FERMEGLIA: That's right. That's why we haven't gotten much response from the other parishes . . . around the area. And even many of the synagogues.
The two clergymen differed over the origin of negative perceptions about blacks. Father Fermeglia sees the portrayals of blacks on television and in the movies as a major culprit. Mr. Daughtry, on the other hand, said that churches have been the greatest contributors to the view that blacks are inferior to whites.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: I would put the church as the cornerstone because the church. . . . When I say church. . . .
Father FERMEGLIA: Say it. You mean the Catholic Church.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: No. No. I'm glad I corrected it. Christian doctrine.
Father FERMEGLIA: Christian. That includes all of us.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: Yeah. Well, that's why I wanted to correct it. But I want to even define it further. I want it to mean white Christendom . . . (which) should bear the greatest brunt of the criticism for helping formulate the perceptions of African people. . . . Just the projection of God as white, and Jesus as white, the prophets and all the good guys white . . . so that it really is saying that the ultimate ruler is white, looks like us. . . . So the church is guilty of distorting history to project the lie.
 
Church's Teachings
Q. Reverend Daughtry, you're suggesting that the teachings of the church, the racist teachings of the church - if I paraphrase you correctly - are responsible in some way for the problems in Bensonhurst, for forming the perceptions that led to the kind of violence that erupted in Bensonhurst?
Mr. DAUGHTRY: White Christianity is the guiltiest partner to this scheme, and that plays out in Bensonhurst and Howard Beach and all of it -and Bed-Stuy, by the way.
Father FERMEGLIA: To say that the church has perpetuated a lie is to not understand the importance of tradition in the church. . . . A person taken from Italy brings with him his church, brings it into this country. So he perceives his church as it has been depicted in art, through music, through worship. . . . You perceive your church through your background and where you have come from.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: I really wish you really wouldn't try to say where I perceive. . . .
Father FERMEGLIA: In my estimation, I would think the black man would perceive his church from his roots. . . .
Mr. DAUGHTRY: You have a way of talking down, as though you're talking to one of your parishioners, and while I take it as long as I can, but every so often I just have to stop and remind you what you're doing.
Father FERMEGLIA: I perceive that from you too, but you see I'm not going to get caught up in the way it's being said. I'm here to listen to you. O.K.? That's the problem. The problem is we're all caught up in the way things are being said instead of sitting down and listening to each other, to the important things that we all have to say.
The perception that blacks are subhuman is gleaned from the movies . . . the media, which is just getting more and more dangerous, because they're not acting responsibly. . . . That's the area that we have to hit.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: A rather, rather, rather revealing homily, I would say, to say the least. I would have enjoyed sitting for the rest of the time of your sermon, Father, it's just that the time dictates that we kind of close this thing.
Father FERMEGLIA: Listen to me.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: I was listening -hard. Not only was I listening, I was watching. You see, sometimes body language also delivers a message.
Father FERMEGLIA: What did it deliver?
Mr. DAUGHTRY: I think you're terribly defensive . . . and I think your body language reveals that. Even the other night when you grabbed my tie I wondered if you were going to string me up. I mean. . . .
Father FERMEGLIA: Oh, man, that's really, that's low, that's low.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: Listen to what I'm trying to say.
Father FERMEGLIA: That's real wrong.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: Can you imagine what a black person with a history of being lynched, having seen his relatives strung up by the neck, having grown up with folks around him being lynched, can you imagine what that must mean to be arguing - and we both lifting our voices - and then you reach for my tie?
Father FERMEGLIA: I wasn't trying to do anything like that.
Mr. DAUGHTRY: Father, listen to what I'm saying. I didn't say that you - I was saying, do you understand what it means for me? You understand what I'm saying? What it means to you is a totally different reality born of your experience.
Father FERMEGLIA: I apologize.
 
Troubling Equations
Q. Some people equate a white person being mugged in Bed-Stuy by blacks with a black youth being killed in Bensonhurst by whites. How do you explain these kinds of things to the people who are listening to you?
Father FERMEGLIA: One of the reverends at the meeting yesterday said, ''You know, no white person who comes into a black neighborhood has anything to worry about, because of his color. He will not be attacked. Whereas, no black person can come into a white neighborhood without worry of being injured.'' . . . We have become comfortable with making a distinction between racial violence and violence in general. The result is the same - murder, death, killings. . . . What can be done? That is the point. What should be done?
Mr. DAUGHTRY: To confuse criminal behavior with racist behavior, there is a difference. I mean the end result may be that you've got a dead body, but unless you understand there is a difference, you're going to keep getting dead bodies. It is one thing for a person to be killed because of his religion or her religion, his pigmentation or her pigmentation. . . . It is another thing for a person to be killed because somebody wants some money. The reason that that person killed may have to do with a whole lot of sociological, economic, political factors.
Father FERMEGLIA: Would you excuse it?
Mr. DAUGHTRY: Not by any means. . . . What bothers us in the black community is when we raise the question of racist violence, they point to criminal behavior. Well, we're the victim of criminal behavior. I mean, according to some of the statistics I've read, black youths between the ages of 16 and 26 . . . represent the greatest homicide rate killed by other blacks.
You and I coming out of different cultural experiences, historical experiences, got to deal with all this stuff. But it seems to me to deal with it, we got to deal with ourselves. I have to search myself. You know - do I understand Italians, do I understand Jews, do I understand Irish? It's a matter of our constantly learning these things, being sensitive to each other about these things. . . . But if we keep on trying to put criminality and racism in the same bag and keep on linking Central Park to say Bensonhurst or to Howard Beach, we'll never get out of the woods.
Father FERMEGLIA: What changed my attitudes concerning the separation between racist and violent attacks is precisely the one attack in Central Park. This attack was not done by lowlifes. It was done by kids who were educated. . . . That really frightened me. . . . And I don't understand. . . . It caused me to question. So I don't see it as clear cut.

HEADLINE: Goldin, in Campaign's 'Basement,' Runs On, With Humor

SERIES: Profiling The Candidates - Second of six articles.

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

 BODY:
Harrison J. Goldin had barely begun to campaign in a community center in Queens at lunch time recently when an elderly woman gave him a weary look and said bluntly: ''Make it short. I'm hungry.''
Mr. Goldin, a politician for some 25 years, took no offense. He patted the woman on the shoulder, saying: ''I never hold up lunch. I know better.'' 
Indeed, as Mr. Goldin stepped up to the microphone in the auditorium, he insisted that the meal be served as he spoke. The gesture won him warm applause.
With less than a week to go before the Democratic primary, Mr. Goldin, the city's Comptroller, continues to campaign for mayor from early in the morning until late at night, still walking the streets, shaking hands and participating in candidate forums whenever he can.
Everywhere he goes, he reminds voters that next Tuesday's primary is not a two-way contest between Mayor Edward I. Koch and Borough President David N. Dinkins of Manhattan, the candidates who have come to be widely seen as the front-runners.
''You do not have to settle for Mayor Koch or David Dinkins,'' Mr. Goldin told the mostly elderly men and women gathered at the Forest Hills Community House. ''There is another choice. You can have a candidate who has energy, who has enthusiasm, who has experience and fresh ideas. You can vote for Jay Goldin.
''Now,'' Mr. Goldin said, catching his breath, ''Table 19, come and get your lunch.''
Despite such public pleas, Mr. Goldin seems acutely aware of his low standing in the polls and treats it with some humor. He described his position as ''in the basement,'' a place he said he shares with another Democratic candidate, Richard Ravitch, a businessman and former head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
''It is a very distinguished basement,'' Mr. Goldin said. Privately, some of his aides admit that they have plans for next Wednesday that have nothing to do with campaigning. One aide said he is taking his car to get a new muffler.
For several weeks now, Mr. Goldin has been unable to afford any television advertising, though he expects to be on the air again by Friday with a new commercial, which campaign aides would not describe.
His most recent commercials have concentrated on the three themes Mr. Goldin hoped to make the cornerstone of his campaign: making drug use a crime, sentencing drug users to upstate work camps and giving New Yorkers a $100 million tax cut.
Steve Matthews, Mr. Goldin's campaign manager, said the candidate has about $250,000 left to spend, about half of which will go for the new commercials. By comparison, Mayor Koch recently has been spending $200,000 a week on commercials and plans to spend more than that this week.
Much of Mr. Goldin's remaining money, Mr. Matthews said, will be used to advertise and campaign in the city's Hispanic community.
 
Transit Fare and Foster Children
''We believe there is still a constituency there that has not yet decided who to vote for,'' Mr. Matthews said.
Since he announced his candidacy on May 23, Mr. Goldin has issued position papers on a wide range of subjects, from preserving the $1 transit fare to using police helicopters to patrol desolate areas of the city at night, as is done in Baltimore.
Yesterday, Mr. Goldin outlined a plan to improve children's services, including creating a separate agency for children, instituting harsher penalties for child abusers, stepping up recruitment of foster parents and changing state law to make abused and abandoned children eligible for adoption more quickly.
To improve the city's educational system, Mr. Goldin has pledged to reduce the Board of Education's central bureaucracy and give principals more authority over hiring, curriculum and budget matters. In exchange, the principals would be held accountable for the success of their schools. No longer would they have lifetime tenure at one school.
To reduce traffic and air pollution, Mr. Goldin wants a system of restricted lanes and varied tolls on the city's bridges and tunnels that would encourage car pooling. And Mr. Goldin would have the city, like the State of California, gradually convert its motor vehicles to run on alternative fuels.
On economic matters, Mr. Goldin says his proposed $100 million tax cut could be paid for by changing the way the teachers union's pension fund is invested. #16 Years as Comptroller Mr. Goldin, 53 years old, has been the city's Comptroller for 16 years, helping to oversee the city's $2 billion investment portfolio and its more than $2 billion in annual bond offerings as well as conducting audits of city operations and voting on the soon-to-be-abolished Board of Estimate.
He has won wide praise for his handling of the office. Three years ago, a survey of independent financial experts by Crain's Publications ranked him as the best municipal comptroller in the country.
But he has also been investigated or criticized for aggressive fund-raising tactics with people seeking to do business with the city, for misleading bondholders at the onset of the fiscal crisis and for steering clients to Ivan F. Boesky, the Wall Street speculator.
Mr. Goldin has said that all such charges had been ''looked into fully'' and that the investigations showed that he was ''a candidate for mayor who knows how to run a clean and honest office.''
Born and raised in the Bronx, Mr. Goldin graduated from Princeton and from Yale Law School. He began his career working as a civil rights lawyer in the South for the Federal Justice Department. In that job, Mr. Goldin was a roommate of James Meredith, the first black student at the University of Mississippi.
 
Lost Endorsements
Shortly after returning to New York, Mr. Goldin was elected to the State Senate, running against the established Bronx Democratic organization. He was re-elected five times.
Mr. Goldin and his wife, Diana, have three sons: Daniel, 18; Matthew, 17, and Jonathan, 11. The family lives in Manhattan.
Mr. Goldin's candidacy this year had been widely expected. In fact, Mr. Goldin has been accused of running for mayor during most of his political career. But from the outset Mr. Goldin had difficulties, losing a number of important endorsements early on.
For instance, the Liberal Party and the liberal New Democratic Coalition - both groups that had longstanding ties to Mr. Goldin - endorsed other candidates even before Mr. Goldin announced.
Fund raising has also been a problem. Although Mr. Goldin began the race with a $1.5 million war chest left over from past elections, this year's new campaign laws made more than $900,000 of it unusable.
At the senior center recently, Mr. Goldin spoke for about 10 minutes and then answered questions on subjects ranging from discount transit fares for the elderly to a shortage of housing. Every so often, however, he interrupted himself to call out the number of another table that could pick up their lunches.
''It looks like a very nice lunch,'' Mr. Goldin told the crowd as he prepared to leave. ''I hope you enjoy it. And, don't forget who called your number.''

HEADLINE: Campaign Trail;
Endorsements, Actual and Canceled

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The minuet of endorsements, mayoral and otherwise, continued yesterday.
Saying he was breaking with ''normal custom'' and backing a candidate during a primary campaign, Senator Edward M. Kennedy endorsed David N. Dinkins for mayor of New York yesterday.
Mr. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, accompanied Mr. Dinkins on two campaign stops, first at the Borinquen Neighborhood Health Center in East Harlem, then at the ''21'' Club. The Senator called Mayor Edward I. Koch ''the great divider'' and referred to Mr. Dinkins as ''the great healer.'' 
''This is a city in conflict,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''Dave Dinkins has the qualities that can heal.''
For his part, the Manhattan Borough President seemed eager to use the shooting of Yusuf K. Hawkins in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn as a way to show off his differences with the Mayor.
''I am the healer and he is the divider,'' Mr. Dinkins said.
Mr. Dinkins appeared to relish the opportunity Mr. Kennedy's presence afforded him to talk wistfully about his role in Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 campaign for President, particularly in the California primary in the days before he was assassinated.
No doubt Mr. Dinkins's bank book also relished the Senator's presence. Mr. Dinkins's staff said that with Mr. Kennedy's help they raised more than $40,000 at the luncheon.
Mr. Dinkins played to applause each time he appeared on the street, and he seemed unusually exuberant, considering the questions he was fielding about a poll in New York Newsday.
The telephone survey of 677 voters, conducted by the Gallup Organization between Aug. 26 and 29, found that Mr. Dinkins was losing ground to Mr. Koch among blacks and those ''most likely to vote.''
Over all, the poll said, Mr. Dinkins was leading with 40 percent of the vote. Mr. Koch was second with 39 percent. Two other Democratic hopefuls, Richard Ravitch and City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, trailed with 4 and 3 percent, respectively.
But among Democrats most likely to vote, Mr. Koch was the choice of 41 percent, while Mr. Dinkins had the support of 37 percent. Mr. Goldin still had his 3 percent, while Mr. Ravitch climbed to 6 percent. The poll reported a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Primary polls can be unreliable because of low turnouts. Although they can measure voter attitudes, they cannot predict how many voters or which segments of the electorate will head for the voting booths. And Mr. Dinkins said the poll was not valid because it was done by a process called random digit dialing.
''If you had been with me Monday in Brooklyn at the West Indian parade,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''you would have seen what I mean.''
 
Koch Endorsements
Mr. Koch picked up some endorsements of his own yesterday. He traveled to Brooklyn to receive a blessing from the Satmar Rebbe, Moses Teitelbaum. ''You should have success,'' said the spiritual leader of the Hasidic sect. Then the Mayor received the support of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg.
Rabbi Bernard Weinberger, vice chairman of the United Jewish Organizations, conceded that the Satmar Hasidim were still opposed to the Koch administration's plan to build a garbage-burning incinerator (the city calls it a resource-recovery plant) in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The issue is in litigation. Earlier, Mr. Koch was endorsed by 15 leaders of the Irish-American community on the steps of City Hall. The Mayor said the moment was important for him emotionally as well as politically, since it meant he had been forgiven for his ''stupid'' remark last year that British forces in Northern Ireland were not an ''occupying force.'' The Housing Police Benevolent Association also endorsed Mr. Koch yesterday.
 
The Ones That Got Away
Then there were the endorsements that weren't.
Some politicians expected Harrison J. Goldin to endorse the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, for city comptroller, the job he is vacating. But people close to Mr. Goldin's mayoral campaign say he had been leaning toward another candidate in the crowded field, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi.
But Mr. Hevesi endorsed Mr. Dinkins last week, and as a result, as of yesterday the staff-level negotiators representing Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Goldin had nothing to negotiate.
 
Go Ask Alice
So what was Harrison J. Goldin doing in wonderland? After all, Alice is too young to vote and the Cheshire Cat cannot.
The answer is, holding a news conference.
Mr. Goldin went to the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park yesterday to announce a 42-point plan to improve the status of children. There, surrounded by the larger-than-life Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and other characters, he called for the creation of a separate Department for Children, which would give the city's young people ''the high-level attention they deserve.''
''For 12 years the Koch administration has treated our children with insensitivity,'' Mr. Goldin said. ''The result has been a foster-care system out of Dickens, the tragic death of children entrusted to city care and a seemingly endless stream of children's scandals from Lisa Steinberg to the latest horror of Herman McMillan, accused of sodomizing his nine children in the Bronx.''
Mr. Goldin said his new department would combine existing children's services from various city agencies, including the Human Resources Administration, which Mr. Goldin called ''a behemoth.'' His plan also calls for state and Federal tax credits for employers who provide child care or contribute to child-care expenses and a requirement that all large new commercial buildings include space for child care.
Not many children were on hand to hear Mr. Goldin make the announcement. In fact, his audience numbered three - two children and their French babysitter.
Neither Sabrina Pinto, 5 years old, nor Danielle Kurtzweil, 6, nor the babysitter, Natalie Doyen, knew who Mr. Goldin was. But since there was no one else around, except a gaggle of reporters, Mr. Goldin spent several minutes comparing Central Park and the parks of Paris.
Sabrina said parks in Paris have more amusements but no squirrels. Ms. Doyen countered that Central Park was ''better organized.''
The candidate appeared crestfallen at the small turnout. He said that he had come to the Jose de Creeft statue many times before and that it was usually ''teeming with children.'' The turnout would have been larger if two of Mr. Goldin's own sons, 17-year-old Matthew and 11-year old Jonathan, had shown up. Instead, they accompanied their older brother, Daniel, 18, who Mr. Goldin said was enrolling at Princeton, Mr. Goldin's alma mater.

HEADLINE: Rivals' Contest Aids Buffalo's Mayor

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO

 BODY:
Mayor James D. Griffin is a balding, bellicose man who calls his detractors ''goofs'' and ''liars.'' And like Edward I. Koch, his sometimes caustic counterpart at the other end of New York State, he has been in City Hall ever since winning a long-shot campaign in 1977.
But as Mr. Griffin, like Mr. Koch, seeks a fourth term as Mayor, he appears to be weathering one danger of long incumbency. In a three-way primary contest focused largely on Mr. Griffin's personality, polls suggest that most Buffalo residents want a new Mayor, but that they also expect Mr. Griffin to win.
As has happened in two previous campaigns, the 60-year-old Mayor has benefited by facing two strong opponents in next Tuesday's Democratic primary. While hurling charges of ''spoiler'' at each other, they have failed to gain on the man who has overseen Buffalo's economic recovery. 
Supporters and opponents of Mr. Griffin say the Mayor can depend on a solid core of loyal voters drawn to his decisive style and conservative outlook, although both say the core will probably not amount to a majority of Democrats in the primary.
 
Two Decisive Shifts
The challengers are State Assemblyman William B. Hoyt, a liberal known in Albany for his expertise in energy and the environmental, and Wilbur P. Trammell, a wealthy businessman and former chief city judge who wants to be Buffalo's first black mayor.
Mr. Trammell and Mr. Hoyt acknowledged that if they both got a healthy share of the opposition vote, Mr. Griffin could come out the winner, but each challenger said he detected a decisive shift toward his camp in recent weeks.
''Jimmy Griffin has always been helped by division among his enemies,'' said State Senator Anthony M. Masiello, who decided not to challenge Mr. Griffin in June after the county Democratic organization supported Mr. Hoyt. ''In this race there's been too much rhetoric between Hoyt and Trammell, and not enough against Griffin.''
Joseph F. Crangle, the former Erie County Democratic leader, said Mr. Griffin was ''one of the luckiest guys in politics. He's not Machiavelli or anything, but he does know how to benefit from a split in the other side.''
 
Rough Politics in Buffalo
In the past, Mr. Griffin has shown that he does not even need the Democratic nomination to win. In both 1977 and 1985, Mr. Griffin lost the Democratic primary to black opponents, only to beat them in general elections by running on the Conservative or Republican lines.
Politics can get rough in Buffalo, and Mayor Griffin punched an Erie County official in the mouth during an argument last year. But in that climate it appears difficult to shake his grip on City Hall. While the candidates talk about leading Buffalo into the future Mr. Griffin and his record are the central issues.
The Mayor points to Buffalo's resurgence during his tenure, which includes significant development downtown and along the Lake Erie waterfront, and to an unemployment rate that has dropped to 5 percent from around 15 percent in the early 1980's. Partly through layoffs and other cuts, he has also held city tax increases to an average of under 1 percent a year.
But his opponents maintain that the prosperity has not spread to many of Buffalo's neighborhoods, and that the Mayor has divided the city by virtually ignoring Buffalo's blacks, who make up a third of the city's 325,000 residents.
 
Condoning Segregation
The challengers say the school system, the housing authority and the police force are all in disarray. They cite a Federal order issued this year that charged the Buffalo Housing Authority with condoning segregation in its 27 projects, and they say that periodic bans the Mayor has issued against police overtime have led to significant delays in emergency response times.
Mr. Hoyt said there has been a ''sleaze factor'' in the Griffin administration, illustrated by the conviction of the Mayor's brother Tommy, a former Parks Commissioner, on charges of lying about his residence in a Florida real-estate deal, and by the discovery that a police captain was the landlord of a suspected drug den.
Amid all the strong words about the election, the Mayor displays nonchalance. He said he pays no attention to his opponents or the polls, and indeed claims to have stopped reading the city's daily newspaper, The Buffalo News, in 1983.
 
A Passion for Canoe Trips
The Mayor's challengers, meanwhile, have problems of their own. Mr. Trammell's populist pitch, stressing greater resources for poorer neighborhoods, was deflected somewhat by publicity about his family cars - he and his wife each drive a Mercedes-Benz -and the amount of income tax he paid last year, $382,000.
Mr. Hoyt, a patron of the arts and an outdoors enthusiast with a passion for canoe trips, has a high-class image that may be something of a liability in blue-collar Buffalo.
One supporter praised Mr. Hoyt for having ''panache,'' but this prompted a reporter to write: ''Can the majority of Buffalo voters relate to a Mayor with panache?''
Mr. Griffin shows no signs of abandoning his cranky, confrontational style. At a campaign stop on Buffalo's West Side the other day, he told a woman heckling him about trash in the street that ''I didn't throw it there.''
 
'Bigoted' Spending Policies
Both challengers, as well as several black politicians and members of the clergy in Buffalo, say they believe the Mayor has helped to polarize the city along racial lines. Mr. Trammell said the Mayor had shown ''bigotry'' in his relations with blacks and Mr. Hoyt said he had ''prejudicial, bigoted'' spending policies that hurt varied services in black neighborhoods.
The Mayor dismisses criticism from black officials as both unfair and selfishly motivated.
''They want to be able to say, 'Oh, Whitey Griffin isn't doing anything for us,''' he said in an interview. ''That's how blacks get elected.''
On the streets of Buffalo, there are many people who love the Mayor and many who do not. But it is hard to find someone with no opinion of the man.
 
'Griffin's Very Spunky'
''I've had enough of him,'' said 81-year-old Sally Slowinski, walking home after buying some vegetables. ''He doesn't care what he says to people. I say, 'Let's get rid of him.' ''
But Jay Soos, taking lunch at a center for the elderly in North Buffalo, had good words for the Mayor. ''Griffin's very spunky,'' said Mrs. Soos. ''No milquetoasty politics out of him.''
Even those who have opposed the Mayor credit him for his straightforwardness. ''He never stabs you in the back,'' said Mr. Crangle. ''He stabs you in the chest. You know where he's coming from, and a lot of people respect him for that.''
 
Challenging Petitions in Court
Mr. Hoyt and Mr. Trammell, in time-honored Buffalo fashion, are inflicting damage on each other with ''spoiler'' charges, and both have pledged to run in the general election regardless of what happens in the primary, Mr. Hoyt on the Liberal line and Mr. Trammell for the independent Neighborhood First Party, whose petitions Mr. Hoyt is challenging in court.
Mr. Griffin, who says he has remained a registered Democrat because ''that's what my father is,'' is assured a spot on the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life lines.
But while they feud with each other, both challengers insist they are united in the desire to unseat Mr. Griffin.
In that regard, at least, they are sounding similar themes. In a recent debate, Mr. Hoyt likened the Mayor to an ''old shoe with the leather cracking and the heel worn down,'' while Mr. Trammell said Mr. Griffin was like an old car. The Mayor, he said, drove the city ''up the hill in first gear, and now we've got to get into second gear and into the 21st century.''

HEADLINE: Text of President's Speech on National Drug Control Strategy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Following is the prepared text of President Bush's speech here tonight setting out his plans for a national drug control strategy:
This is the first time since taking the oath of office that I felt an issue was so important, so threatening, that it warranted talking directly with you, the American people. All of us agree that the gravest domestic threat facing our nation today is drugs.
Drugs have strained our faith in our system of justice. Our courts, our prisons, our legal system are stretched to the breaking point. The social costs of drugs are mounting. In short, drugs are sapping our strength as a nation.
Turn on the evening news, or pick up the morning paper and you'll see what some Americans know just by stepping out their front door: Our most serious problem today is cocaine, and in particular, crack. 
Who's responsible? - Let me tell you straight out. Everyone who uses drugs. Everyone who sells drugs. And everyone who looks the other way. Tonight, I will tell you how many Americans are using illegal drugs. I will present to you our national strategy to deal with every aspect of this threat. And I will ask you to get involved in what promises to be a very difficult fight.
This is crack cocaine seized a few days ago by Drug Enforcement Administration agents in a park just across the street from the White House. It could easily have been heroin or PCP. It's as innocent-looking as candy, but it is turning our cities into battle zones, and it is murdering our children. Let there be no mistake, this stuff is poison.
Some used to call drugs harmless recreation. They're not. Drugs are real and terribly dangerous threat to our neighborhoods, our friends and our families.
 
9 Million Fewer Casual Users
No one among us is out of harm's way. When 4-year-olds play in playgrounds strewn with discarded hypodermic needles and crack vials - it breaks my heart. When cocaine - one of the most deadly and addictive illegal drugs - is available to school kids -school kids - it's an outrage. And when hundreds of thousands of babies are born each year to mothers who use drugs - premature babies born desperately sick - then even the most defenseless among us are at risk.
These are the tragedies behind the statistics. But the numbers also have quite a story to tell. Let me share with you the results of the recently completed household survey of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It compares recent drug use to three years ago. It tells us some good news and, some very bad news. First, the good.
As you can see in the chart, in 1985, the Government estimated that 23 million Americans were using drugs on a ''current'' basis - that is, at least once in the preceding month. Last year, that number fell by more than a third. That means almost nine million fewer Americans are casual drug users. Good news. Because we changed our national attitude toward drugs, casual drug use has declined. We have many to thank: our brave law-enforcement officers, religious leaders, teachers, community activists, and leaders of business and labor. We should also thank the media for their exhaustive news and editorial coverage; and advertisers for running anti-drug messages.
Finally, I want to thank President and Mrs. Reagan for their leadership. All of these good people told the truth - that drug use is wrong and dangerous.
 
Frequent Use of Cocaine Soars
But, as much comfort as we can draw from these dramatic reductions, there is also bad news - very bad news. Roughly eight million people have used cocaine in the past year, almost one million of them used it frequently, once a week or more.
What this means is that, in spite of the fact that overall cocaine use is down, frequent use has almost doubled in the last few years. And that's why habitual cocaine users - especially crack users are the most pressing, immediate drug problem involving every family.
Earlier today, I sent this document, our first such national strategy to the Congress. It was developed with the hard work of our nation's first drug policy director, Bill Bennett. In preparing this plan, we talked with state, local and community leaders, law-enforcement officials and experts in education, drug prevention, and rehabilitation. We talked with parents and kids. We took a long hard look at all that the Federal Government has done about drugs in the past: what's worked, and - let's be honest - what hasn't. Too often, people in government acted as if their part of the problem - whether fighting drug production, or drug smuggling, or drug demand - was the only problem. But turf battles won't win this war. Teamwork will.
Tonight, I'm announcing a strategy that reflects the coordinated, cooperative commitment of all Federal agencies. In short, this plan is as comprehensive as the problem. With this strategy, we now finally have a plan that coordinates our resources, our programs and the people who run them.
Our weapons in this strategy are: the law and criminal justice system; our foreign policy; our treatment systems, and our schools and drug prevention programs. So the basic weapons we need are the ones we already have. What has been lacking is a strategy to effectively use them.
Let me address four of the major elements of our strategy.
 
Stepping Up Law Enforcement
First, we are determined to enforce the law, to make our streets and neighborhoods safe. So to start, I'm proposing that we more than double Federal assistance to state and local law enforcement. Americans have a right to safety in and around their homes.
And we won't have safe neighborhoods unless we are tough on drug criminals - much tougher than we are now. Sometimes that means tougher penalties. But more often it just means punishment that is swift and certain. We've all heard stories about drug dealers who are caught and arrested - again and again - but never punished. Well, here the rules have changed: If you sell drugs, you will be caught. And when you're caught, you will be prosecuted. And once you're convicted, you will do time. Caught. Prosecuted. Punished. I am also proposing that we enlarge our criminal justice system across the board -at the local, state and Federal levels alike. We need more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors. So tonight, I'm requesting - altogether - an almost billion-and-a-half dollar increase in drug-related Federal spending on law enforcement.
And while illegal drug use is found in ever community, nowhere is it worse than in our public housing projects. You know, the poor have never had it easy in this world. But in the past, they weren't mugged on the way home from work by crack gangs. And their children didn't have to dodge bullets on the way to school. That is why I'm targeting $50 million to fight crime in public housing projects - to help restore order, and to kick out the dealers for good.
 
Inter-American War on Cartels
The second element of our strategy looks beyond our borders, where the cocaine and crack, bought on America's streets, is grown and processed. In Colombia alone, cocaine killers have gunned down a leading statesman, murdered almost 200 judges and seven members of their Supreme Court. The besieged governments of the drug-producing countries are fighting back, fighting to break the international drug rings. But you and I agree with the courageous President of Colombia, Virgilio Barco, who said that if Americans use cocaine, then Americans are paying for murder. American cocaine users need to understand that our nation has zero tolerance for casual drug use. We have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in Colombia to fight alone.
The $65 million emergency assistance announced two weeks ago was just our first step in assisting the Andean nations in their fight against the cocaine cartels. Colombia has already arrested suppliers, seized tons of cocaine and confiscated palatial homes of drug lords. But Colombia faces a long, uphill battle, so we must be ready to do more.
Our strategy allocates more than a quarter of a billion dollars for next year in military and law enforcement assistance for the three Andean nations of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. This will be the first part of a five-year, $2 billion program to counter the producers, the traffickers and the smugglers.
I spoke with President Barco last week, and we hope to meet with the leaders of affected countries in an unprecedented drug summit, all to coordinate an inter-American strategy against the cartels. We will work with our allies and friends - especially our economic summit partners - to do more in the fight against drugs. I'm also asking the Senate to ratify the U.N. anti-drug convention concluded last December.
To stop those drugs on the way to America, I propose that we spend more than a billion-and-a-half dollars on interdiction. Greater interagency cooperation, combined with Defense Department technology can help stop drugs at our borders.
Our message to the drug cartels is this: The rules have changed. We will help any government that wants our help. When requested, we will for the first time make available the appropriate resources of America's armed forces. We will intensify our efforts against drug smugglers on the high seas, in international airspace and at our borders. We will stop the flow of chemicals from the United States used to process drugs. We will pursue and enforce international agreements to track drug money to the front men and financiers. And then we will handcuff these money launderers, and jail them - just like any street dealer. And for drug kingpins, the death penalty.
 
Expansion of Drug Treatment
The third part of our strategy concerns drug treatment. Experts believe that there are two million American drug users who may be able to get off drugs with proper treatment. But right now, only 40 percent of them are actually getting help. This is simply not good enough.
Many people who need treatment won't seek it on their own. And some who do seek it are put on a waiting list. Most programs were set up to deal with heroin addicts. But today, the major problem is cocaine users. It's time we expand our treatment systems and do a better job of providing services to those who need them.
So tonight, I'm proposing an increase of $322 million in Federal spending on drug treatment.
With this strategy, we will do more. We will work with the states. We will encourage employers to establish employee assistance programs to cope with drug use. And, because addiction is such a cruel inheritance, we will intensify our search for ways to help expectant mothers who use drugs.
 
Mobilizing for Prevention
Fourth, we must stop illegal drug use before it starts. Unfortunately, it begins early - for many kids, before their teens. But it doesn't start the way you might think, from a dealer or an addict hanging around a school playground. More often, our kids first get their drugs free, from friends, or even from older brothers or sisters. Peer pressure spreads drug use. Peer pressure can help stop it.
I am proposing a quarter-of-a-billion-dollar increase in Federal funds for school and community prevention programs that help young people and adults reject enticements to try drugs. And I'm proposing something else. Every school, college and university -and every workplace - must adopt tough but fair policies about drug use by students and employees. Those that will not adopt such policies will not get Federal funds. Period.
The private sector also has a role to play. I spoke with a businessman named Jim Burke who said he was haunted by the thought - a nightmare really - that somewhere in America, at any given moment, there is a teen-age girl who should be in school, instead of giving birth to a child addicted to cocaine. So Jim did something. He led an anti-drug partnership, financed by private funds, to work with advertisers and media firms. Their partnership is now determined to work with out strategy by generating a million dollars worth of air time every day for the next three years - a billion dollars total. Think of it, a billion dollars of television time, all to promote the anti-drug message.
As President, one of my first missions is to keep the national focus on our offensive against drugs. So next week I will take the anti-drug message to the classrooms of America in a special television address, one that I hope will reach every school, every young American. But drug education doesn't begin in class or on TV. It must begin at home and in the neighborhood. Parents and families must set the first example of a drug-free life. And when families are broken, caring friends and neighbors must step in.
These are the most important elements in our strategy to fight drugs. They are all designed to reinforce one another, to mesh into a powerful whole. To mount an aggressive attack on the problem from every angle. This is the first time in the history of our country that we truly have a comprehensive strategy.
 
Nation's Largest Drug Budget
As you can tell, such an approach will not come cheaply. Last February, I asked for a $700 million increase in the drug budget for the coming year. Over the past six months of careful study, we have found an immediate need for another billion-and-a-half dollars. With this added $2.2 billion, our 1990 drug budget totals almost $8 billion - the largest increase in history.
We need this program fully implemented - right away. The next fiscal year begins just 26 days from now. So tonight I'm asking the Congress - which has helped us formulate this strategy - to help us move it forward immediately.
We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit. We have submitted our plan to Congress that shows just how to fund it within the limits of our bipartisan budget agreement.
I know some will still say we are not spending enough money. But those who judge our strategy only by its price tag, simply don't understand the problem. Let's face it, we've all seen in the past that money alone won't solve our toughest problems.
To be strong and efficient, our strategy needs these funds. But there is no match for a united America, a determined America, an angry America. Our outrage against drugs unites us, brings us together behind this one plan of action, an assault on every front.
This is the toughest domestic challenge we've faced in decades. And it is a challenge we must face - not as Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives - but as Americans. The key is a coordinated, united effort. We have responded faithfully to the request of the Congress to produce our nation's first national drug strategy. I'll be looking to the Democratic majority and our Republicans in Congress for leadership and bipartisan support. And our citizens deserve cooperation, not competition; a national effort, not a partisan bidding war.
To start, Congress needs not only to act on this national drug strategy, but also to act on our crime package announced last May; a package to toughen sentences, beef up law enforcement and build new prison space for 24,000 inmates.
You and I both know the Federal Government can't do it alone. The states need to match tougher Federal laws with tougher laws of their own - stiffer bail, probation, parole and sentencing.
And we need your help. If people you know are users, help them get off drugs. If you are a parent, talk to your children about drugs -tonight.
Call your local drug prevention program. Be a big brother or sister to a child in need. Pitch in with your local neighborhood watch program. Whether you give your time or talent, everyone counts.
Every employer who bans drugs from the workplace. Every school that's tough on drug use. Every neighborhood in which drugs are not welcome.
And most important, every one of you who refuses to look the other way. Every one of you counts.
 
Hard Work and High Stakes
Of course, victory will take hard work and time. But together we will win - too many young lives are at stake.
Not long ago, I read a newspaper story about a little boy named Dooney, who, until recently, lived in a crack house in a suburb of Washington, D.C. In Dooney's neighborhood, children don't flinch at the sound of gunfire. And when they play, they pretend to sell to each other small white rocks they call crack.
Life at home was so cruel that Dooney begged his teachers to let him sleep on the floor at school. And, when asked about his future, 6-year-old Dooney answered: ''I don't want to sell drugs, but I will probably have to.''
Well, Dooney does not have to sell drugs. No child in America should have to live like this. Together, as a people, we can save these kids. We have already transformed a national attitude of tolerance into one of condemnation. But the war on drugs will be hard-won, neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, child by child.
If we fight this war as a divided nation, then the war is lost. But, if we face this evil as a nation united, this will be nothing but a handful of useless chemicals.
Victory. Victory over drugs is our cause, a just cause, and with your help, we are going to win.
Thank you, God bless you and good night.

HEADLINE: Outlays for Next Fiscal Year Would Rise by $716 Million

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
President Bush's drug control proposals would cost only $716 million more in the next fiscal year than drug programs already in that year's budget.
That is merely a speck in the $1.1 trillion that the Government plans to spend in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Administration has suggested raising the money by taking nips and tucks in a variety of programs that most Americans have never thought about. 
Nonetheless, Congressional authorities say Congress is unlikely to accept the Administration's suggestions for cuts and will probably look elsewhere in the budget to find the money.
Although Mr. Bush's strategy calls for an increase in eventual financing of more than $2 billion, only about a third of that would be spent in 1990. The main reason is that extra funds the President requested from Congress for prisons would not actually be spent until subsequent years.
 
Paying for Drug Program
''We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit,'' Mr. Bush said in his television address tonight.
His budget director, Richard G. Darman, said only small steps would be needed to keep the proposals within the agreement that Mr. Bush and Congress struck last spring to meet the target of keeping the deficit at or below $100 billion for the year.
In a letter to the chairmen and top Republicans on the Congressional appropriation committees, Mr. Darman suggested that $320 million, almost half the money, could be cut from Federal aid to states to help offset the cost of liberalized immigration rules.
Mr. Darman maintained that states had enough unspent money left over from allocations in previous years that the cut would not lead to hardship.
 
Other Sources of Money
Mr. Darman suggested that the remaining money be found in these ways:
* Abolish the Economic Development Administration, a proposal Mr. Bush made in his budget last February that was rejected by Congress. The agency makes grants to states and local governments and guarantees loans to private ventures in an effort to reduce unemployment. Killing the program would raise $194 million.
* Cut by $40 million the Justice Department's grants for juvenile justice programs.
* Raise $15 million by curbing ''misuse and abuse'' of postal subsidies to nonprofit mailers.
* Use $50 million intended for public housing operating subsidies for the specific purpose of ridding the projects of drugs.
* Delay for one year, at a saving of $132 million, the Pentagon's purchase of a new communications system, the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System.

HEADLINE: No Change in Basics

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
President Bush's strategy for fighting drugs calls essentially for the Government to do more of what it has been doing with only marginal success for years: build more prisons, make more arrests, pay for more treatment centers and intensify efforts to break up drug-trafficking organizations.
The President rejects the notion espoused by many Democratic lawmakers and experts on drug abuse that there needs to be a vast shift in resources from attacking the drug supply to emphasizing prevention and treatment.
Roughly 70 percent of the Bush plan is for efforts to contain the drug supply and enforce laws against illegal drugs; the rest is for treatment and prevention. That ratio has been much the same since the Presidency of Richard M. Nixon. 
 
'A Feeling of Time Warp'
The plan calls for a $2.2 billion increase in anti-drug spending. But critics say new ground can be broken only if more attention is directed to effective prevention and long-term treatment programs, and that billions of dollars are required if the nation's drug crisis is truly to be faced.
To critics of the plan, Mr. Bush's strategy is a familiar refrain.
''I have a feeling of time warp,'' said Jack A. Blum, a former special counsel on narcotics for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''Nelson Rockefeller started all of this in 1968. It was replayed by Richard Nixon in the 1972 campaign. The Bush policy is modestly reworked Richard Nixon.''
 
Plan Called 'Comprehensive'
Yet Mr. Bush, who vowed in his inaugural address that ''this scourge will stop,'' suggested tonight that the scope of his Administration's effort to curb illegal drugs would be unprecedented. ''This plan is as comprehensive as the problem,'' he asserted. ''With this strategy, we now finally have a plan that coordinates our resources, our programs and the people who run them.''
The blueprint does temper its own optimistic goals, saying there are limits to what the Government can do.
As the President said, ''I trust the lesson of experience: No single policy will cut it, no matter how glamorous or magical it may sound.''
He added: ''To win the war against addictive drugs like crack will take more than just a Federal strategy. It will take a national strategy, one that reaches into every school, every workplace, involving every family.''
Therein lies a fundamental, perhaps inevitable, flaw, critics say: A national strategy cannot really reach into every school, workplace and family without the money to back it up and without more specific programs.
Strikingly, the report devotes much space to the notion of the Federal Government's limitations: Major kingpins are often beyond the Government's reach; states and cities must come up with more money; schools and churches must do more to warn children of the perils of drugs.
 
Treatment on Demand
While emphasizing this need for others to do more, some analysts say the plan neglects actions they believe the Government itself must take. Several local officials, for example, said that a crucial element of any successful anti-drug strategy must be treatment on demand for any addict who seeks it. But they contended that treatment on demand cannot be accomplished in this country without substantial help from the Government.
Instead, the report emphasizes forced treatment and greater accountability among those who administer local treatment programs.
Perhaps more important, critics said the plan fails to recognize fully that the problem is more complicated than getting drug dealers off the streets and that root causes, underlying social ills, are not addressed.
Judith F. Fischer, a professor of human development and family studies at Texas Tech University, suggested that rather than placing such heavy stress on building more for prisons space for drug offenders, the strategy should have made some provision for more literacy programs, for family-support organizations and for efforts to fight poverty.
''It would be money well spent, so that down the road we wouldn't need those jails,'' she said. ''Kids have got limited opportunities in society. How are they going to make it? Selling crack?''
 
Some New Initiatives
The Bush plan does contain some new initiatives that take into account a problem that has become much more complicated since the Nixon Administration, when crack, the smokable derivative of cocaine, did not exist. The plan, for example, calls for more sophisticated intelligence gathering to target drug traffickers, greater emphasis on infiltrating money-laundering operations, and new levels of economic and military aid to help Andean nations battle the cocaine cartels.
Yet even William J. Bennett, the national drug policy director whose draft of the strategy was largely untouched by Mr. Bush, said today that a strategy that took six months to develop was designed as much to unify Federal efforts as it was to turn up bright new ideas.
''The national strategy,'' he said, ''for the first time tries to bring together the disparate pieces in disparate areas of the Government's effort.''
But financial figures cited in the strategy indicate an uphill battle: the $7.9 billion for the fiscal year 1990 is proposed for the solution to a problem that by some estimates is now costing American business alone $60 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Pocketbook Issues Seen As Top Campus Priorities

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
College and university officials say money-related matters, from the tuition undergraduates pay, to the salaries faculty deserve and can command, to the renovation needs of campuses, will loom large in higher education this academic year.
They say that while goals like increasing the number of minority students who enter and graduate from college and improving the quality of undergraduate teaching will continue to be high on their agenda, institutions can no longer delay finding ways to ease the financial pressures they face.
At first glance, the focus on financial matters seems in contrast with recent years when social and educational issues drew great public attention, among them the debate on whether the traditional curriculum for English literature and general education courses on Western civilization.
But those interviewed said the money issues had been generating increasing concern in higher education for some time. Now the financial pressures have reached the stage where significant action will have to be taken, both by individual institutions and higher education as a whole. 
 
Shortages on Faculties
Carol Simpson Stern, president of the American Association of University Professors and head of the department of performance studies at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill., said the long-expected scarcity of faculty members was beginning to become evident in some disciplines.
Professor Stern said it was this issue that most clearly showed the interrelationships between financial, educational and social policies in higher education.
She said it was an educational issue, since the scarcity of faculty is likely to hinder efforts to improve undergraduate teaching, and a social issue, because one of its causes is the severe shortage of minority faculty. That, in turn, stems from the minuscule number of black and Hispanic college students who pursue graduate study.
Finally, it is a financial issue because the faculty shortage means that professors will be able to command higher salaries.
 
Severe Impact Foreseen
D. Bruce Johnstone, Chancellor of the State University of New York, said the faculty shortage would probably be most severe in community and junior colleges, which had greatly benefited since the 1960's from the oversupply of faculty for four-year institutions.
Dale Parnell, chief executive of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, which represents 1,200 two-year institutions, said his members considered the recruitment and professional development of faculty their most pressing priority.
Other goals are developing better programs to encourage students to continue their education at four-year institutions, and drawing more money from the private sector, something Mr. Parnell called ''a big new issue for us.''
Dr. Johnstone, SUNY's Chancellor, said colleges were increasingly burdened by the costs of maintaining and improving campus operations, along with the costs of purchasing scientific equipment for undergraduate studies and faculty research.
 
Ever-Present Tuition Issue
Finally, there is the pervasive financial issue that colleges and universities face: rising tuitions.
Eamon Kelly, president of Tulane University, in New Orleans, said, ''The debate over it won't be settled because of the basic economic forces at work.'' He said these included the costs putting pressure on university budgets, contributing to the need for colleges to keep raising tuitions.
Dr. Kelly said that although he thought colleges like his tried their best to keep prices reasonable, there was no limit to how high tuitions could rise because they were linked to personal disposable income and the inflation rate.
''As long as those elements and other costs rise,'' he said, ''tuitions will increase.''
John A. DiBiaggio, president of Michigan State University, said it was telling that many colleges and universities including his own had enrolled more students in recent years even as the debate over tuition has continued.
Referring to studies showing that college graduates stand to earn more than $500,000 more than those who did not attend college, he said students and their families ''look upon college as an investment,'' adding, ''They recognize that there's a difference between having a college degree and not having one and that that difference is expensive.''
 
Problems Facing Colleges
 
What college administrators identify as the most pressing concerns of this academic year.
 
The scarcity of minority faculty members.
 
Increasing Federal aid to students with grants rather than loans.
 
Counseling students, particularly minority students, at community colleges about continuing their education at four-year schools.
 
Financial problems stemming from maintenance.

HEADLINE: Social Ills Pull Educators' Concern to New Issues

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Frustrated by the number of children who are ill-prepared for school, educators are turning their attention from issues like the curriculum to social problems, including crack, AIDS, child abuse and the growing number of splintered and troubled families.
''If those children come into my classroom and they have been up all night because someone in the house is using drugs, that impacts on what I teach,'' said Mary Hatwood Futrell, who just completed a six-year term as president of the National Education Association.
Interviewed as the nation's 40 million schoolchildren return from summer vacation, many leading educators said teachers and school officials are increasingly finding that students have personal problems the schools cannot solve alone. Such problems can make questions that have engaged educators for most of this decade, like strengthened curriculums and tougher academic standards, seem secondary. The social problems are edging to the front of the educational agenda. 
School districts throughout Missouri, as well as those in Tampa, Fla., Auburn, Ala., and Farrell, Pa., have begun training parents of preschool children to be better parents. In special evening classes and in home visits, teachers urge parents to read to their children, to engage in substantive conversations with them and to turn expeditions like a trip to the grocery into educational exercises.
 
'Those Children Just Shine'
Missouri's program got under way last year, involving the parents of 50,000 children entering kindergarten.
''Most of the children are much more ready for school,'' said Louis Wright, principal of Rockport Heights Elementary School in Arnold, a working-class suburb of St. Louis. ''They're more attentive. Those children just shine.''
In Shreveport, La., educators go to maternity wards at hospitals to distribute packets of literature that guide mothers in rearing newborns.
Several educators said too many homes were sending children to school lacking the basic vocabulary needed in the first grade. In homes run by unmarried or divorced mothers, children may not get enough help or direction from adults. Ms. Futrell estimates that 15 million school-age children live in poverty.
Dr. Samuel G. Sava, the executive director of the National Association of Elementary School Principals, said, ''In the poorest homes, there's not a great deal of interaction, not because parents don't care, but because parents are spending a lot of time on survival, trying to earn enough money to support their families.''
 
AIDS, Crack and Homelessness
Urban teachers are seeing more children who have AIDS, are addicted to drugs, are homeless or are victims of physical or sexual abuse. Even teachers in rural states like Nebraska have students who use drugs, officials say.
''It's time for parents and communities to realize that school is only one piece of a child's life and that the burden of these problems needs to be shared with the community,'' said Ann Lynch, president of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.
Some schools have asked teachers to become, in effect, social workers, but many teachers bridle at that. In 1987, Rochester offered its 2,500 teachers salaries of up to $69,000 a year, if they would take on duties like talking with students about their personal problems and visiting them in their homes. Some teachers have begun to complain that the program is forcing them to work excessive hours in tasks for which they have little training.
Dr. Scott Thomson, the executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, recalled a poll last May conducted by the Phi Delta Kappa, a fraternal society of teachers. In that survey, high school teachers said drug use was the biggest problem they faced, ahead of low salaries or undisciplined students.
He said more than half the states had zones around schools where penalties for drug sales are particularly harsh. In Florida, the first signs marking such zones were posted Aug. 28 outside Mollie Ray Elementary School in Orlando. The signs warn that conviction for the possession or sale of drugs within 1,000 feet of the school will result in a three-year jail term without the possibility of parole.
 
A Return to the 1970's
The social concerns are not entirely new. Dr. Thomson, a former Superintendent of Schools in Evanston, Ill., said the focus on social issues represented a return to the concerns of the 1970's, when educators were pushing for free breakfasts and other social programs. Many of those programs became standard practice, but educators realized that children were still failing to measure up in reading and mathematics and soon revived the emphasis on the basics of good reading, writing and arithmetic.
''Now we see such forces pushing the other way back again because of a growing number of minorities and immigrants, the problems of pregnancies and drugs, of less and less family support,'' Dr. Thomson said. ''Now schools have to stay open longer, provide more social workers, provide health clinics and educate families in how to raise children.''
But he cautioned, ''My own view is that we were too willing to drop standards in the 1970's and we darn better not repeat that mistake in the 90's.''
In coming years, teachers will be facing more children from troubled homes, Dr. Sava said. Enrollment in kindergarten through eighth grade will climb to 31 million in the 1990's from 28.8 million last year. Roughly one-third of the children will be black, Hispanic or Asian and a growing percentage will be ''youngsters from economically deprived environments,'' Dr. Sava said.
States like California and cities like Miami and Pittsburgh are already acting to reopen closed schools and to build new ones for teaching the growing number of students.
 
Facing Greater Diversity
''It will be a more diversified group coming into our school system,'' Dr. Sava said. ''Some children will be able to understand 12,000 words and some only about 4,000 words.''
To reach poor families, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers has been trying to recruit more black and Hispanic parents into local P.T.A.'s and is translating its literature from English into other languages for immigrants.
''People involved in the P.T.A. weren't always conscious of making those people feel welcome,'' said Tari Marshall, the public relations director for the national congress. The national group, which does not keep ethnic statistics, is urging chapters to schedule meetings during hours that accommodate working parents and it is pressing parents to work at preparing children for school.
Ms. Marshall said, ''There are small things you can do with 10 minutes a day: making sure that your child has a quiet place to do homework, spending five minutes to talk about the day in school, maybe once a month contacting their teacher, making sure children aren't sitting in front of the TV set for hours a day.''

HEADLINE: New Pests Threaten California Crops

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EL MONTE, Calif., Sept. 5

 BODY:
Record numbers of exotic insects are invading Los Angeles County and threatening California's $16 billion-a-year farm economy.
As of July, according to a county entomologist, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have been counted in the county, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants, Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealybugs and scale insects.
''We are being literally swamped,'' Rosser W. Garrison, the entomologist, said. ''The variety of insects is increasing, and the sheer number is increasing.'' 
Los Angeles County's farm production is negligible, but the county acts as the pests' entry point to the rest of the state, which is the nation's leading agricultural producer, said Robert G. Atkins, a deputy county agriculture commissioner.
Los Angeles has become a magnet for the imported insects because of its warm climate and its high number of foreign visitors, some of whom are believed to bring in fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors, customs officials said.
Los Angeles boasts a growing population of immigrants with a taste for fruits and vegetables from their native countries. ''They have friends and family who are sending them a taste of home,'' Mr. Atkins said.
One new pest, the ash whitefly, already has reached epidemic proportions in Southern California and is racing for the state's agricultural heartland, the San Joaquin Valley.
Mr. Atkins noted that California's belated response to a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation drew widespread publicity nine years ago. It eventually cost the state $100 million to exterminate, and farmers lost $100 million.
Three medfly infestations have occurred in Los Angeles County in the last year, each costing roughly $1 million for eradication. But they have attracted little notice.
The county's budget for plant quarantines in the fiscal year 1987-88 was more than $784,000, an increase of almost 54 percent over fiscal year 1977-78, officials said.
Discoveries of less-notorious pests are charted each month by Mr. Garrison, who detected five types of insects that were new to the county last year and three so far this year.
Although agriculture officials have established methods of dealing with fruit-fly infestations, other kinds of insects can be neither readily identified nor exterminated.
One of the most ruinous new pests, the ash whitefly, apparently hitchhiked to the suburban San Fernando Valley from Europe or the Middle East. It has no natural enemies in California, and its numbers are exploding.
Although fruit flies, which lay their eggs in hundreds of fruits and vegetables, are like a cancer, Mr. Atkins said, the ash whitefly acts more like a low-grade virus, attaching itself to the undersides of leaves and slowly sucking the life out of trees.
At first, agriculture officials thought the ash whitefly attacked only ornamental trees like the ash, but they later found that it thrives in dozens of varieties of trees, including olive, pear, apple and peach trees.
To combat the insect, agriculture officials plan this winter to release millions of pinhead-sized wasps that are the insect's natural enemy. But they say it probably will be years before the wasps can greatly reduce the ash whitefly population.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
In First for TV, a Network Asks Its Rival for a Show

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The NBC television network has asked a production company owned and operated by the ABC television network to create and produce a prime-time drama series. If it works out, it would be the first time one network has produced a television show to run on another network.
Brandon Stoddard, the head of ABC Productions, said yesterday that he had agreed to consider making the show, as well as a mini-series, for NBC. He said the decision reflected ''a movement away from the network system as we have traditionally known it, which is that of a distribution system for programs provided by the studios.'' 
The studios to which Mr. Stoddard referred are the large Hollywood-based production companies like Warner Brothers, Universal and Paramount that have traditionally produced most of the programs for television and motion picture theaters. He said he expected, within the next five to seven years, that a kind of ''network studio system'' would develop.
Each of the three networks has moved to produce more programming of their own in anticipation of a change in Federal regulations in 1990, lifting restrictions that have limited the networks to producing only five hours of prime-time programming each week.
One network executive said the networks were acting out of a sense of self-protection, in reaction to studio efforts this year to ''milk every nickel possible out of the networks.''
The network official referred to negotiations this spring between the studios and networks over hit series whose original contracts had run out. ''We just got killed by those guys,'' he said of deals involving Universal Studios, which renegotiated its contract with CBS for ''Murder She Wrote,'' and Disney, which contract for ''Golden Girls'' with NBC.
''The studios are only growing stronger,'' the executive said. ''Producing our own programs is one way we can try to get control of the product.''
Hollywood producers have accused the networks of using the end of the production limits as leverage in their fights with the studios to gain concessions on the financial and syndication rules.
Federal Communications Commission regulations have prevented the networks from taking a percentage of the profits from the lucrative syndication sales of any network series. The networks have lobbied in Washington to change those regulations.
But the studios have lobbied to keep the rules. Congress has asked both parties to negotiate a compromise. The network negotiators concede there is no incentive for the studios to compromise - except for access to air time, which the networks can restrict by broadcasting as many of their own productions as possible.
Mr. Stoddard said, however, that increasing the leverage against the studios was not an incentive for the ground-breaking deal with NBC. He pointed instead to a range of economic factors affecting network television. ''The main reason for this is to expand the marketplace to allow more shows to get made,'' he said.
The president of NBC's entertainment divison, Brandon Tartikoff, initiated the idea of ABC Productions doing a series for NBC. Mr. Tartikoff said yesterday he had a concept for a 10 P.M. dramatic series that he felt could best be executed by Mr. Stoddard because of his background with similar programs.
The proposed ABC-NBC deal ''raises all sorts of questions,'' an executive at CBS said. ''Does ABC deliberately back off from competing agressively with the show it's producing for NBC, because it has an economic incentive to have the show it is producing last long enough to make it in syndication?''
Mr. Tartikoff discounted the potential for conflicts, saying ABC's Entertainment division had a separate mission from its production company. He said the lines between networks had already become blurred in the production area, mentioning a series to be produced by NBC Productions, ''Shannon's Deal,'' originally rejected by NBC, which he said had stirred interest from CBS.
Both Mr. Stoddard and Mr. Tartikoff said economic changes had compelled them to look for profits in new areas. Mr. Tartikoff pointed to the area of Saturday morning, whose profits declined to $8 million last year, from $30 million five years ago. ''That's $22 million that flew up into some hole in the ozone,'' he said. ''As we move into the 90's we have to try to make additional profit somewhere.''
The profits to be made in programming are enormous, if the producers have a stake in the syndication sales. As Mr. Stoddard pointed out, ''Even a marginally successful comedy can make as much as $70 million or $80 million in syndication.''
But the network cannot share in those profits. The networks have offered what they call a compromise with the studios. They will allow the production restrictions to remain in effect for half the prime-time schedule, in exchange for some ability to share in the syndication profits on the other half. The studio position, said Barbara Dixon, a spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Association of America, the group represeting the studios, is unchanged.
''They're dug in at the moment,'' Mr. Tartikoff said. ''But you never know. Things change.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rise Causes Fed To Step In

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday, prompting a round of concerted dollar selling by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the West German Bundesbank and eight other European central banks.
With the dollar now back around 1.99 marks, some traders think it will not be long before it passes the important 2-mark level again. This would put the dollar back where it was earlier this summer, leaving it much higher than many economists had predicted several months ago and well above the levels believed set last year for it by the United States and its economic allies.
If the dollar does move higher, it will once again test the resolve of the United States and its allies and their policy of trying to keep the dollar within an agreed-upon range, which is believed to be 1.70 to 1.90 marks and 120 to 140 yen. A further rise could also lead to an increase in the American trade deficit by making exports more expensive abroad and imports cheaper here. 
 
High of 1.9938 Marks
In trading yesterday, the dollar rose to a high of 1.9938 marks and 147.25 yen. But it fell on several waves of dollar selling by the central banks and then rose again. It failed, however, to regain its highs of the day, which traders said showed the intervention had some impact. In late trading, the dollar was at 1.9880 marks and 146.85 yen, up from 1.9775 marks and 145.60 yen Friday. The New York market was closed on Monday for Labor Day.
''I think the market is very bullish again,'' said Frank Watson, vice president at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. He said he expected the dollar to move past 2 marks this week and to continue higher in the next three to six months. As 1989 began, when the dollar was at 1.77 marks and 124.95 yen, the consensus view was that it would be lower by year-end.
The recent resurgence of the dollar - it fell below 1.90 marks and 140 yen last month - has been fueled in part by the changing view of the strength of the United States economy.
 
Lower Rates Cut Dollar Allure
After surging past 2 marks and 145 yen in June, the dollar fell as it appeared the Fed would lower interest rates to prevent the economy from slowing so quickly that it would slip into a recession. The lower interest rates, compared with those in other countries, made investments here in dollar-denominated securities less attractive, which prompted dollar selling. In addition, the prospect of very slow growth or a recession also weighed down the dollar.
But with the revisions in economic statistics in the last two months, economists now feel that the economy is much stronger than initially thought and that the Fed will not ease interest rates again soon. This view has pushed the dollar higher again. There is also a belief that the economy can now slow down safely with a decline in inflation, better known as a soft landing.
Mr. Watson of the Swiss Bank said it would take either renewed recession fears or a sudden surge in economic activity to kill the bullish sentiment. ''The middle road is the right road for the dollar now,'' he said.
 
No Bundesbank Action Expected
He also said a rise in interest rates by the West Germans could weaken the dollar, although he does not expect the Bundesbank to take such action at its regular meeting on Thursday.
The rise in the dollar yesterday came after the dollar had been creeping up throughout August. That rise was somewhat restrained, however, because many traders were on vacation. But on Friday, the employment report for August gave another signal the economy was still showing strength, adding support for the dollar.
Yesterday, the dollar gained most in Tokyo, despite heavy dollar selling by the Bank of Japan. Reports that Fed officials said interest rates would not be pushed lower unless there were new signs of a sharply slowing economy also hepled send the dollar higher, traders said.
''It's not like it was a big surprise,'' said Liliana Nealon, vice president at the Union Bank of Switzerland. ''August was slow and as soon as everyone came back from vacation there would be a strong demand for dollars.''
Mrs. Nealon said she did not think central bank intervention would hold the dollar back in the current bullish climate. ''I don't think concerted central bank intervention can turn a well-established trend,'' she added.

HEADLINE: A Fragile Air Freight Strategy

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Federal Express Corporation is learning to greet customers in many different languages around the world, but some replies have been unfriendly.
The company acquired the Flying Tiger Line for $880 million in February, and merged with the 44-year-old carrier on Aug. 7. The move gave Federal Express the legal right to fly highly coveted international air freight routes to 21 countries, but has also forced it to deal with a cosmopolitan class of merchant it has mostly driven out of business in the United States: freight forwarders.
These are people who own no planes and few trucks, but contract out to deliver shipments from a customer's door to virtually anywhere in the world. They book cargo space aboard aircraft and ships, fill out bills of lading and customs statements, hire trucks and negotiate solutions to the many bureaucratic and practical obstacles that can slow the movement of freight. 
Federal Express and such rivals as Airborne Express, Burlington Air Express, DHL Worldwide, Emery Worldwide and United Parcel Service have grown into giant corporations by providing these services directly to customers in the United States, while operating their own planes as well. But cultural and political barriers have protected freight forwarders until now in the international air freight market, and Flying Tiger has relied almost entirely upon them.
Some freight forwarders are worried that Federal Express will try to work around them, dealing directly with corporate shippers to increase its sales and profits. Company executives are talking to freight forwarders around the world to allay their concerns and are promoting a new policy on heavy air shipments that requires shippers to use freight forwarders.
Nevertheless, since Federal Express's acquisition of Flying Tiger, a few concerned freight forwarders have taken their trans-Pacific business elsewhere, and more freight forwarders have moved their trans-Atlantic shipments to other carriers, said James L. Barksdale, the chief operating officer of Federal Express. He declined to provide figures, but said that the totals were not large and that Federal Express did not plan to cut fares to retain customers.
The difficulty with freight forwarders is the most visible problem Federal Express faces. Other problems include union efforts to organize its workers; complaints from some customers that the merger has gone too quickly and that service has suffered as a result; slowly growing competition from passenger airlines, and the rising use of facsimile machines.
Despite these problems, Federal Express showed only a slight dip in profits for the 12-month period ending May 31. It earned $184.5 million on sales of $5.2 billion in that period, compared with $187.7 million on sales of $3.9 billion in the year before. Flying Tiger had an income of $89.5 million last year on sales of $1.4 billion.
 
Reassurance Offered
Federal Express executives have visited several hundred freight forwarders in the last month, Mr. Barksdale said, to reassure them that the company would not try to steal their clients.
In addition, Federal Express has announced that beginning on Oct. 1, all customers must use a freight forwarder for international shipments weighing more than 150 pounds. Federal Express would pay a commission to a freight forwarder even if the customer insisted on dealing directly with Federal Express, Mr. Barksdale said. ''That's the difficult part, obviously - enforcing our own discipline,'' he said.
Federal Express is wooing international freight forwarders because they have the personal connections needed to do business abroad. ''It's not a cold computer deal, it's a warm personal thing,'' said Lawrence L. Rodberg, chief executive and president of Eden Air Freight, a domestic and international freight forwarder based in Irvine, Calif. ''You can't get robots doing the international thing, even after 1992,'' when the economic integration of Europe should lower barriers to trade there, he added.
 
Routes in Short Supply
For some shipments, freight forwarders have little choice but to do business with Federal Express. International air routes are negotiated bilaterally by countries and are in short supply in some regions. Federal Express was willing to pay what is generally considered a high price for Flying Tiger because Flying Tiger had carefully accumulated such routes over the last four decades.
It would have taken Federal Express ''40 years to build that thing a route at a time,'' said Theodore R. Scherck, president of the Colography Group, an expedited freight consulting firm in Marietta, Ga.
''The acquisition tends to consolidate the available cargo space to Japan,'' said Donald W. Layden, the senior vice president of international operations for United Parcel Service, which is seeking permission from the Department of Transportation to fly more of the available routes.
The shortage of available capacity on flights to and from East Asia has made it difficult for some forwarders to defect. ''There are some agents who have indicated they would like to shift more of their business, but we can't capitalize on that,'' said David W. Behrends, the vice president for cargo at Northwest Airlines, which is the largest American carrier of freight in the Pacific after Federal Express. ''We were really full in both directions - the problem is, you can't be fuller than full.''
If capacity were available, the airline could sell an extra half-million freight ton-miles a month - the equivalent of a Boeing 747 freighter carrying 110 tons from Tokyo to Seattle once a month - to freight forwarders unhappy about the Flying Tiger merger, Mr. Behrends said.
Federal Express is ''saying they'll never go after the direct sell internationally,'' but that may not hold true given the company's expertise in dealing directly with customers, said a major freight forwarder who has moved all his domestic shipments from Flying Tiger to other carriers since the merger. The forwarder asked not to be identified becaues he still uses Federal Express for trans-Pacific flights, where he has few or no alternatives.
Freight forwarders are suspicious because, as Mr. Scherck of the Colography Group said, ''Federal is in the express business trying to put all those guys under.''
 
'Like the Dinosaur'
Freight forwarders have seen their share of the nation's $11 billion air freight business fall to 8 percent from 94 percent 11 years ago, said William R. Boesch, American Airlines' vice president for cargo. ''The American-owned freight forwarder is becoming unfortunately like the dinosaur,'' he said. ''It is becoming extinct.''
Federal Express is trying to woo its own pilots at the same time it is wooing freight forwarders. Although the 1,070 pilots at Federal Express are not unionized, the 930 at Flying Tiger have been represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The National Mediation Board ruled on Aug. 4 that all 2,000 pilots should vote on whether they want to be represented by the A.L.P.A.
The work rules associated with most A.L.P.A. contracts would hinder the ability of Federal Express to provide punctual and economical service, said George V. Robertson, a transportation analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., a Baltimore brokerage. ''The way these guys give the kind of service they've always given has been to be flexible,'' he said.
 
'A Reasonable Shot'
The A.L.P.A. has been holding meetings and open houses to organize the pilots. ''We feel we have a reasonable shot at it,'' said John F. Mazor, a union spokesman. Federal Express opposes unionization. ''We believe we have earned the right to represent our pilots,'' Mr. Barksdale said. But the company will recognize the A.L.P.A. if it wins the vote, he added.
Allowing the A.L.P.A. onto the premises could slightly reduce Federal Express's advantages over commercial airlines, which are trying to expand their air freight businesses.
For a mixture of political and business reasons, however, domestic and foreign passenger air carriers say they are unlikely to bypass forwarders and deal directly with customers.
Another worry for Federal Express is the facsimile machine, which sends electronic images of documents over telephone lines. Its rapidly expanding use has ''slowed down growth of the overnight letter business,'' Mr. Barksdale said. But demand has not actually dropped, he added.
The immediate effort, Mr. Barksdale said, is to persuade freight forwarders that ''we have no tricks up our sleeves.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Imported TV Sets Face Test in Japan

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack

 BODY:
IN what might seem like carrying coals to Newcastle, the Philips Consumer Electronics Company this month will begin exporting color television sets from its Greeneville, Tenn., factory to Japan.
Philips, a subsidiary of the Dutch electronics giant Philips N.V., said the exports, although in extremely modest numbers at first, would be the first by a non-Japanese company based in the United States. In recent years, some Japanese consumer electronics companies have begun to export a few television sets to Japan from their factories in the United States. The activity in part reflects a desire to reduce trade tensions by appearing to cut the American trade deficit. 
But the move also reflects the fact that with the rise of the yen in the last few years, Japan is losing its cost advantage in consumer electronics, not only to the United States but also to places like Taiwan and Korea. Osami Suzuki, a vice president of Toshiba America in Wayne, N.J., said glass, electricity, water for cooling and land for factories were all less expensive here than in Japan.
Toshiba in March began exporting projection television sets to Japan, at a rate of about 2,000 a year. Next year it will ship large-screen standard televisions to Japan using picture tubes from a new plant in Horseheads, N.Y.
Sony exports picture tubes to Japan and also occasionally sends finished television sets, said Koh Shimizu, a spokesman for the company.
But American companies have lost competitiveness in consumer electronics, a matter of increasing concern to both the electronics industry and Government officials. One idea being considered to help the American industry get back into the consumer electronics business is to make a new generation of high-definition television sets.
Philips wants to be included in any United States effort and has been particularly vocal in portraying itself as an American company in recent months.
Cracking the Japanese market in televisions will be tough. Japanese sets have reputations as being better than American sets. Moreover, distribution in Japan is notoriously difficult, because most of the big Japanese television manufacturers own their own retailers.
But Alford F. Rodgers, director of international sales for the Philips Consumer Electronics Company in Knoxville, Tenn., said the company had arranged for distribution through the Seibu department store chain.
But quality and distribution are not the only problems to solve. John Taylor, a spokesman for the Zenith Electronics Corporation, the only remaining American-owned television company, said the company tried to sell televisions in Japan years ago but failed ''because of non-tariff barriers.'' RCA considered trying many times but concluded it would be impossible, said D. Joseph Donahue, a senior vice president of Thomson Consumer Electronics, the subsidiary of the French company, Thomson S.A., that owns the RCA and General Electric television businesses.
Philips officials say succeeding in Japan is necessary if a company is to be successful in consumer electronics, which is a global business. ''Japan today is the fashion center for electronics,'' said Donald F. Johnstone, president and chief executive of Philips's Knoxville-based unit. ''To build TV sets for Japan is a far more stringent exercise in performance and quality than to build sets for the United States.''
The TV effort is part of a broader effort by the Dutch company to sell audio and video products in Japan. Other products for the Japanese market will be made in Japan or Europe. The United States was picked for the television effort because the United States and Japan use the same broadcast system.
Still, Philips will not exactly pose a threat to Japanese giants on their home turf. This year it will export only 1,500 sets to Japan. That number is expected to grow to 30,000 sets next year and 50,000 the year after that. By contrast, Philips sells 3.5 million sets a year in the United States under the Magnavox, Sylvania, Philips and Philco brand names.
''We're making a product for a niche in Japan,'' Mr. Rodgers said. The first sets, with 27-inch screens, will be aimed at the same Japanese consumers who drive Mercedes cars.
The lettering on the sets is in English to appeal to Japanese consumers who want an import. And the sets have been specially made for the Japanese market, with a new kind of finish, a stereo sound system compatible with the Japanese standards and the sharper contrast that Japanese consumers seem to prefer, he said.

HEADLINE: West German Economy Continues to Strengthen

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 5

 BODY:
West Germany's economy turned in the strongest performance in 13 years in the first half, as the gross national product expanded by 4.6 percent from the level a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said today.
Economic growth accelerated in the second quarter, as the nation's G.N.P. expanded 4.9 percent from the quarter a year earlier, the statistics office said. That was the strongest quarterly growth since 1980. The figures were adjusted for price and seasonal factors. Gross national product measures the total value of goods and services produced by a nation. 
Strong demand for West German capital goods, particularly from abroad, was behind much of the G.N.P. growth, economists said. Another factor was a sharp rise in earnings from West German foreign investments. Economists said that increase had come about partly because of the relative weakness of the mark, particularly against the United States dollar, in the first six months of this year.
 
Stronger Mark Seen
Although the mark has been under renewed pressure recently, the nation's booming economy is likely to provide support for the West German currency over the next few months, particularly if American economic growth shows signs of further cooling, economists said.
''At some point, West Germany's excellent economic performance is going to be noticed by the foreign exchange market,'' said Gert Schmidt, an economist with Industriekreditbank in Dusseldorf.
However, the economic figures provided little support for the mark today. At the close of trading in Europe, the dollar finished at 1.9925 marks, up from 1.9755 on Monday and just below the important 2-mark level.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also expecting to benefit from the economy's surge. His center-right coalition Government hopes to make West Germany's economy one of the central issues in national elections next year.
In the second quarter of 1989, exports were up 15.1 percent from the period a year earlier, the statistics office said. But domestic demand rose only 2.8 percent. West Germany is the world's leading export nation, and it posted a record trade surplus of 128 billion marks, or about $64 billion, in 1988. For 1989, economists are predicting a trade surplus of more than 40 billion marks, or about $70 billion.
The Economics Ministry said G.N.P. growth for all of 1989 could exceed the 3.6 percent expansion of 1988. That prediction is well below forecasts by private economists, as well as that of Karl Otto Pohl, the president of West Germany's central bank. Last week, Mr. Pohl said West German G.N.P. might grow more than 4 percent in 1989, a rate he called astounding.
He also disagreed with speculation that an increase in the nation's important interest rates is imminent, saying that he has seen ''no scenario that would justify a dramatic change,'' in monetary policy.
 
Inflation in Check
Inflationary pressures, which have prompted increases in Bundesbank interest rates in the past, appear to be in check. Preliminary figures released last week showed West Germany's cost-of-living index had dropped one-tenth of 1 percent in August from July, causing the year-to-year inflation rate to fall to 2.9 percent in August, from 3 percent. That is the lowest level since March.
While unemployment has remained relatively high, figures released today by the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg showed some improvement, as the nation's unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent in August, down from 7.7 percent in July and 8.5 percent in August 1988.
Hans Klein, the Government's chief spokesman, said the current boom could reduce unemployment even further. ''There has been continued improvement in all sectors of the job market, sustained by the powerful economic growth,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Critical of I.M.F. Austerity Plan

BYLINE: By BURTON BOLLAG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Austerity measures imposed on the poorest countries by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans, have produced no results, according to a United Nations report.
''I guess you could say the sacrifices have been in vain,'' said Roger Lawrence, an official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, referring to the reductions in social spending and the drop in living standards the austerity measures have caused.
That is one of the conclusions of the conference's annual report, scheduled for release Wednesday. The Geneva-based body is the main United Nations agency promoting the economic interests of the developing countries. The agency has often criticized the ways that industrialized countries have responded to economic conditions in poor nations. 
 
Foreign Debt
The report says there is a troubling split in world economic performance. While healthy growth has continued, both in the industrialized countries and in several developing countries - mainly in eastern Asia - the economies of the developing countries of Africa and Latin America have stagnated or worsened. The report attributed much of their plight to their large foreign debts.
Recent initiatives, particularly by the United States and France, to forgive part of the debt are ''extremely welcome and positive,'' Mr. Lawrence said. However the conference argued that these measures would provide only about half the minimum debt reduction needed to spur economic growth.
The report examined the results of the adjustment programs adopted by the least developed countries to qualify for new I.M.F. loans. The United Nations has put 42 nations, with a combined population of more than 400 million, in this category. They all have very low per-capita income levels.
The report found that of the 12 least developed countries, which have applied such programs for most of the 1980's, the growth rates of only three - Bangladesh, Gambia and Mali -were above the average for all the least developed countries. ''The adjustment programs in the least developed countries have so far produced mixed results and achieved, at most, limited success,'' the report said.
 
Detrimental Effects
The adjustment programs usually involve cutting public spending, devaluing the national currency to stimulate exports and reducing imports. By causing governments to reduce subsidies on food staples, such programs have provoked rioting, most recently in Venezuela.
The report said that often the main result of these programs had been a contraction of economic activity. Currency devaluation ''had little effect in stimulating exports in the least developed countries, but certainly created hardship, particularly to vulnerable groups,'' by raising prices, the report said.
What is needed, it continued, is increased debt relief, more flexible adjustment programs and better access to industrialized countries' import markets.

Stock Strategist Turns Cautious

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
THE Labor Day weekend has often been a turning point for investors, with September proving to be a weak month for stock prices. True to form, one of Wall Street's most influential investment strategists turned cautious over the holiday weekend and yesterday advised his institutional clients to sell 10 percent of the stocks in their portfolios.
In a report called ''Where Have All the Bargains Gone?'' that will be mailed to clients later this week, Barton M. Biggs, chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said: ''I think the global equity markets have heard and discounted a lot of good political and economic news, and a little bad news might be very disconcerting. It's time to begin cutting back.'' 
Mr. Biggs is also chairman of the asset management group at Morgan Stanley, which invests $30 billion for clients. The firm also began selling stocks for those clients and parking the proceeds in short-term instruments like Treasury bills.
Mr. Biggs's sell recommendations included these categories: airlines, hotels, brand-name food and beverage stocks and broadcast media companies. Broadcasting companies, Mr. Biggs said in an interview yesterday, ''have had a good long mania going for some time.''
In addition, Mr. Biggs recommended selling stocks in the New Zealand and Canadian markets. ''The odds are that Canada will have a recession next year, which will blast corporate profits,'' he wrote. ''Most serious of all, I think the Government plan to raise tax rates is totally counterproductive and will result in a capital and brain drain to the United States.''
Behind Mr. Biggs's caution is the recognition that stock markets around the world have climbed in ''surges of enthusiasm'' this year. The Dow Jones industrial average is up almost 30 percent so far this year. At these levels, Mr. Biggs said, there are fewer stocks to buy.
''I find it very difficult to develop sparkling new, compelling investment ideas both in terms of market and specific stocks,'' he wrote. ''The only cheap stocks left are junk companies that aren't worth what they are selling for unless some greater fool takes them over.'' He declined to identify the companies he considers junk.
Mr. Biggs also noted that the market's advance this year has carried the stocks of growth companies and the economically sensitive industrial companies higher. The stocks of large-capitalization growth companies are up almost 40 percent in the last 10 months. ''As for the cyclicals, in the last two months they also have had a good pop,'' he wrote. ''International Paper at $58 is a different animal than at $48.''
The whiff of speculation in the market also worries Mr. Biggs. ''The airline companies overnight have been transformed into God's latest gift to the leveraged buyout buyer, but it's still basically a brutally cyclical business,'' he said.
In general, Mr. Biggs believes that the world economies are slowing. ''World money growth surged after the crash, but the trend is clearly down again,'' he said. ''Almost everywhere tight monetary policies, inverted or flat yield curves and decelerating money growth are beginning to take their toll.'' Even though the United States may have some form of what he calls the ''much mocked'' soft landing, he wrote, ''a worldwide recession is not out of the question.''
And although inflation may be ebbing, he believes the combination of weaker prices and slow economic growth will hurt corporate profits. ''My problem is that I think the combination of low business activity and diminishing inflation is going to result in disappointments in profits in the second half of this year and particularly in 1990,'' he said.
Mr. Biggs's current caution represents a shift from the spring, when he was one of the few investors to predict the sharp burst in stock prices. Shortly before the market rose almost 500 points, he predicted a stock ''melt-up.'' Yesterday, he said, ''I think we've had a pretty good melt-up.'' And if prices continue to climb, Mr. Biggs said he would recommend selling even more stocks.
But he said he was not ready to call an end to this bull market. ''The equity markets in general do not yet exhibit the usual signs of a cyclical peak,'' he said. ''If they did, I would make a much more dramatic move.'' Signs of such a peak would include a higher proportion of advisers in the weekly Market Vane survey describing themselves as bullish and a higher percentage of stock buying by pension funds and mutual funds. Almost 52 percent of the advisers in Market Vane's current report describe themselves as bullish, and the average equity commitment in a portfolio survey by Indata in Stamford, Conn., was below 50 percent, still considered relatively low, he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Biggs is concerned that prices of some stocks like Coca-Cola are becoming ''ridiculous.'' ''I just plain and simply can't find anything I want to buy,'' he said, ''and experience teaches that's an important warning flag.''

Office Space In Orange County Rises

BYLINE: By Shawn G. Kennedy

DATELINE: WALLKILL, N.Y.

 BODY:
THE shortage of affordable housing, the high commercial rents and traffic congestion in such suburban office strongholds as Westchester County, Fairfield County and Bergen County have prompted some users of office space to venture farther north into the Hudson Valley region. A handful of developers has kept up with the demand for space in Orange County.
One sign of the pace of development activity in Orange County is the 173,000-square-foot office building now under construction in Wallkill, about 60 miles north of New York City. It is the fifth structure to go up in the Crystal Run Corporate Park, at the intersection of Routes 17 and 84, and when completed it will be the largest speculative office building in the county, that is, built without having any prospective tenants or signed leases. 
The office park, which already has 256,000 square feet of space, is the project of the Herbert Albert Company, a family-owned development company based in Manhattan that started building office space on a speculative basis in Orange County early in the 1980's.
As office developers, the Alberts, who bought 150 acres in Wallkill in 1971, were among the first to see the potential of the region and to act on the belief that it would attract office tenants.
''They opened the store and put suits on the rack before there were customers,'' said Michael J. DiTullo, president of the Orange County Partnership, a private, nonprofit agency established to attract business and industry to the county. ''That was a time when even people in other parts of New York State thought Orange County was a place south of Los Angeles or somewhere in Florida.''
James T. Albert, a principal in the company who has been responsible for the Orange County project, has not yet found a tenant for the building under construction and is still working on filling the space in the fourth building in the park, a 96,000-square-foot structure where about 72,000 square feet is available for rent. The other three buildings and 24,000 square feet of the fourth building have been leased. He said the company had no plans to slow its pace of construction in the park, where some 1.6 million square feet is planned.
So far the company has attracted a mix of local and national tenants, including Prudential Insurance, Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield, Wehran Engineering and Orange County Trust. ''You have to have space ready when tenants come to look,'' Mr. Albert said. ''So our strategy has been to build on a speculative basis.''
Mr. Albert and others said that Orange County was just beginning to meet its potential as a significant office and industrial center. But compared with other parts of the metropolitan region, the county is something of a late bloomer in terms of economic expansion.
During the 1970's and 1980's, when there was an explosion of suburban office development within commuting distance of New York City, Orange County languished. The region's two main nonagricultural industries, leather and garment making, were weakened by foreign imports as well as the migration of manufacturing companies to the south.
But the county is currently witnessing an economic expansion and development boom. Mr. DiTullo said that within the last four years more than 35 national and international companies have set up operations in the county. They include General Electric; General Foods; Anheuser-Busch, which operates a 305,000-square-foot plant in the Stewart International Airport industrial park, and Minolta, a Japanese company, which recently opened its 90,000-square-foot North American headquarters building in the Westgate Goshen Business Park in Goshen.
This boom has meant a gain of 30,000 jobs since 1983 and an 11 percent increase in population since 1980, and it has propelled Orange County to the top of the list of the fastest-growing counties in New York State.
Based on the county's current office vacancy rate of 7 percent, as well as projections for the demand for space in the next decade, the Alberts are moving ahead with further development plans. They expect to start construction next spring on a 130,000-square-foot building in their office park. That project will complete the first phase of development there. Work on the second phase, for which more than a million square feet of space has been planned, is scheduled to be under way by 1992.
Meanwhile, they expect to have the fifth building in the park ready for tenants early next year. The brown and gray brick building was designed by Wheldon Abt, an architect based in Wallkill, to fit into the site's naturally sloping topography. Although it would have four stories, all but one level would have an entrance to the outside.
The asking price for space in the new building is $18.50 a square foot.

HEADLINE: Tax Deferrals Criticized

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Tax-deferred savings plans like individual retirement accounts have become a ''cruel hoax'' for many retirees who find themselves subject to higher income tax rates than when they were young, according to a private study released today.
A report from the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit research group based in Dallas, said tax-deferred savings programs were intended to help working people postpone taxes until retirement, when they traditionally moved to lower tax brackets. 
But because some Social Security benefits now are taxed and some elderly people pay a new surtax for Medicare coverage against catastrophic illnesses, many middle-income retirees ''are discovering their marginal tax rate is up to four times higher than the rate they paid while working,'' the report said.
''These two taxes combined can raise the marginal tax rates of elderly retirees as much as 37 percentage points,'' said Aldona Robbins, a former Treasury Department economist and a co-author of the study.
The study recommended abolishing both the Social Security and Medicare taxes or at least changing the tax treatment of retirement savings.

HEADLINE: Japan Urges U.S. to Save

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In talks today seeking solutions to the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, Japanese representatives asked the Americans to save more, cut their budget deficit and adopt longer-term business thinking.
American officials attending the talks said they would seriously consider Japanese suggestions for improving United States competitiveness and reducing the nation's $50 billion trade deficit with Japan. 
''We agreed with a great deal of the suggestions of our Japanese colleagues, and hope they will take just as seriously our suggestions,'' said Richard McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and leader of the American delegation, which had urged the Japanese on Monday to end trade practices that limit entry into their markets.
Michihiko Kunihiro, Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs, said, ''Although we haven't come up with any concrete answers to those questions raised by either side, I think it was significant that each side has come to know the other's point of view.''
However, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told Japanese reporters, ''There is no need to obey the United States calls.'' He added that the Americans' approach of emphasizing how the structural reforms they suggested would benefit Japanese consumers put his Government in the uncomfortable position of having to ''explain why such improvements cannot be done.''
Both Japanese and American participants declined to comment on specific policy changes that might result from the talks, which are scheduled to resume in Washington on Nov. 6 and 7.

HEADLINE: Promoting Texas: Ribs to Chili

BYLINE: By ANNE S. LEWIS

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 5

 BODY:
''Come to a country where the menus are in English and the food has an accent,'' an advertisement says. ''Visit a country where the natives are friendly and the language barrier is easily overcome,'' says another. Both trumpet, ''Texas: It's Like a Whole Other Country.'' 
Texas has actually been a ''whole other country'' at various times, of course, and this year the state will spend $18.3 million to persuade would-be vacationers to think of it as a destination unexpectedly exotic, yet comfortably familiar. And like those of many countries, Texas tourism advertisements highlight the state's indigenous cuisine, running the gamut from Tex-Mex, barbecue and a palate-numbing chili (the state dish) to the ubiquitous chicken fried steak.
''Our research shows that good food or a unique cuisine is one of the top five reasons why people travel to a particular destination,'' said Dale Weisman, a media specialist with the Texas Department of Commerce's tourism division. ''Since we have such a unique cuisine that is so popular in this country - and even with foreign travelers - it made sense to promote it.''
Advertisements appearing in national and international publications since April 1988 have displayed tantalizing platters of smoked ribs, glistening with barbecue sauce and colorful trays of spicy Mexican food - enchiladas, salsas, and seafood.
''Unfortunately, we can never feature the chicken fried steak in a photo because - bathed in cream gravy - it's so unphotogenic, and fried food is held in such disfavor today,'' said Alicia K. Smith, of G.S.D. & M., the Austin advertising agency for the campaign. Ms. Smith said the only other state she was aware of that had designed an advertising campaign around food was Illinois.
Radio promotions and editorial supplements chronicle the wide spectrum of Texas gastronomy, in settings as diverse as chili cook-off grounds in Terlingua and the rolling vineyards of the Texas hill country.
According to the US Travel Data Center in Washington, an industry-financed organization, only New York and Illinois will spend more than Texas to attract tourists this year. In 1987, Texas received the fourth largest share, after California, Florida and New York, of total travel expenditures by American travelers in the United States.
Although Texas has historically been ambivalent about encouraging visitors, things are different in the current economic downturn. Today, tourism is the state's fourth largest industry. And Texas is taking no chances with that: the tourism division has instituted an in-state hospitality program to encourage Texans to be neighborly to their guests. The tag line? ''Texas Friendly Spoken Here.''

HEADLINE: On Battleground of the Street, Few See a Victory Over Drugs

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Still perspiring from their foot chase of a crack dealer, Officers Charles Fernandez and Adam L. Burden caught their breath while listening to President Bush's drug speech over the radio in their darkened car. ''Another Band-Aid approach,'' Officer Fernandez said.
A few blocks away, 10 former crack addicts and dealers, as part of their rehabilitation, watched the speech on television Tuesday night. They broke into cheers when the President called for the death penalty for drug kingpins: ''Yes! Yes! Yes!'' 
In still another part of Miami, a 27-year-old dealer was too busy to watch the speech even if he had been interested; his corner crack business was booming. ''He can slow it down,'' the dealer said of the President as teen-agers on bicycles swarmed about. ''But he can't stop it. It's like gold. People go crazy for it.''
Every war has its political battles and its tactical battles. And while President Bush was beginning his political maneuvering with a speech, the view from this city's streets, some of the country's front lines where the war on drugs is actually fought, is that his proposals are too limited and too simplistic.
 
Laughter and Applause
Many addicts said they were still high when released from jail, usually after being held for less than 24 hours following an arrest for petty theft or drug buying. What are needed, the police and counselors and addicts agreed, are far more beds than the President's plan would provide in prisons and rehabilitation centers - enough beds to keep crack users off the streets long enough to get drugs out of their systems and get them into counseling.
''When you're out there drugging, nothing's going to change unless you get your mind clear,'' said a 39-year-old recovering addict. ''But you're in jail and back on the street next morning. You never get your mind clean.''
And many former addicts laughed at the mention of prison, saying it was just as easy for them to get drugs there as on the streets.
Former addicts and counselors applauded the President's proposals for greater education about drugs. But they said what was needed was not just the simple teaching about the harmful effects of drugs but the more complex teaching of how children can come to like themselves.
Addicts and counselors said the President was wrong in equating the problem with crack, which many of them believe will be replaced by another substance that will emerge in time. The problem is self-destructive behavior, they said. They called for forming psychological teams that would begin as early as kindergarten to identify vulnerable pupils.
''You think I didn't know crack was bad for me?'' asked a 30-year-old former crack addict now in a rehabilitation center. ''I knew all about how bad it was. But it didn't make any difference. I don't think Bush understands: You know how bad it is, but you still do it.''
That addict, along with nine other former crack addicts, watched the speech in the recreation room of the center, run by a group called Spectrum. The center houses 68 former addicts, male and female, black and white, providing counseling and helping them find jobs. A decade ago, all its residents were heroin addicts. Then came those hooked on a mix of heroin and Quaaludes and other pills. Now all but three or four are there for crack addiction.
Visible from the windows of the center, which is in Miami's poor, black Liberty City section, are at least two crack houses. Business was steady throughout the Bush speech. Some of their customers said they had been among the more than 55,000 people arrested in Florida last year for drug sales and possession. By some estimates, up to 40 percent of Dade County's 1.86 million residents have on occasion used illegal drugs.
 
'We're Just Playing Games'
At times the two police officers listening to the President in their patrol car in another part of Liberty City were cynical and laughing. ''More overtime,'' Officer Burden said when Mr. Bush mentioned more spending on law enforcement.
''We're just playing games,'' Officer Fernandez said. ''We're doing our job; we're arresting them. You have to start with the courts. The bad guys are not afraid. They know they'll be out in hours, and they're still going to be out in hours.''
But at the rehabiliation center, there was respectful quiet while the President spoke. Afterward, the consensus among the former addicts and dealers was that he needed to be much tougher.
One former addict said his crack-addicted sister had refused any help, and when he was asked what the President could do about someone like that, several members of the group shouted, ''Arrest her!'' Mandatory confinement and treatment, they said, was the answer.
''He should cut off her getting welfare,'' said a 27-year-old.
 
Recalling 'Mother's Day'
''We used to call it Mother's Day,'' said a convicted dealer as he recalled when welfare checks arrived and women lined up at crack houses.
''They should remove her kids from her,'' said a 38-year-old woman. ''Parents should have to reconstruct their lives in order to get their kids back.''
When it was pointed out that they sounded more like a group of Republicans griping in the country club than like poor inner city drug users, they said they were worked up because addicted mothers meant addicted children. It is that chain above all else, they said, that has to be broken.
In fact, most of the former addicts did not directly blame societal conditions like racism or unemployment for their drug problems but family problems like addicted or abusive or inattentive parents.
''We see the same thing over and over,'' said Eileen Mahoney, treatment coordinator at the center. ''There are people who don't care and don't take care of themselves. Then their children don't care and don't take care of themselves. Bush has to understand that you need to start with them before they're 20 and addicted. You start with them when they're like this.''
Then she bent down and held her hand knee high.

HEADLINE: SOVIETS AND CHINA MAY SEE SOFTENING FROM U.S. ON GATT

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
A diplomatic cable made public today disclosed that the Bush Administration might soften its opposition to membership for the Soviet Union and China in the organization that manages the world trading system.
The disclosure came as a surprise because the United States had suspended talks on Chinese membership in the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after the violent crackdown on demonstrators in June in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
Membership in GATT, which sets rules for international trade and settles disputes among member nations, would greatly benefit the Soviet Union and China. It could offer both Moscow and Beijing a framework for normalizing trade relations with other countries. 
 
Source of Dissension
The issue has been a source of dissension within the Administration. Some insight into the Administration debate came today with publication of the cable by a private group opposed to letting China join GATT. The cable was from the American Embassy in Beijing to the State Department, showing that the United States wants to discuss GATT membership with the Chinese on Monday and Tuesday in Washington.
The President's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, insisted that the China talks about GATT membership did not constitute a breach of the President's ban on high-level contacts with that nation. He described them as ''low-level, continuing discussions.''
Soviet membership in GATT is expected to be discussed at a meeting later this month in Wyoming of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Traditionally, the Soviets and the Chinese have been linked together by American policy makers in considering their membership in GATT.
The United States has long been the leading champion of GATT and has urged other countries to accept its free-trade rules. The Americans have been willing to discuss opening the group to Communist nations as part of overall efforts to reduce worldwide tensions.
Because of fears that the Soviets could disrupt GATT, there has been no serious discussion of Soviet membership at this time. But some officials, chiefly in the State Department, are willing to consider observer status, and view the issue in the context of a gradual normalization of U.S.-Soviet relations. China already has observer status in GATT.
Opponents, chiefly in the Defense Department, fear that the Soviets will seize any trade and economic opportunities offered by the United States to strengthen their military potential to become more formidable adversaries.
As the leading and founding member of GATT, the United States has a big say in the agency's membership decisions.
The issue arises as the Bush Administration makes preparations for the Sept. 22-23 Wyoming meeting with Mr. Shevardnadze, in which the question of membership is expected to figure among a number of Soviet demands for American concessions to support economic reform in the Soviet Union.
The State Department cable from Ambassador James Lilley in Beijing said the Chinese Government had expressed surprise that Washington had agreed to the talks, which were suspended after the June crackdown.
 
Cable Leaked by Policy Group
The disclosure of the cable, which was leaked to the Center for Security Policy, a policy group that favors a strong military posture, prompted extended explanations today by Administration officials.
Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration was still opposed to China's full membership in GATT. ''They have to undertake significant economic reforms to be eligible,'' he said.
Before June, the United States pursued steps toward China's gradual admission. The decision to resume the discussions with China underscores the importance the Administration places on improving economic ties with Communist nations.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the coming meeting with the Chinese ''will provide an opportunity to exchange views, but is not in any sense a negotiation.''
The 96-nation GATT is a charter of rights and obligations of trading countries. It also provides a mechanism for members to resolve trade disputes.
GATT membership implies both recognition of the importance of trade in international economy and a position of legitimacy or acceptance within the international trading community, objectives eagerly sought by both Beijing and Moscow.
 
Observer Status
China, whose observer status allows it to attend proceedings in the 42-year-old Geneva institution, but not to participate, jealously guards its GATT status. As part of the economic reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, Moscow is now seeking observer status as a prelude to full membership. China could be angered if it does not stay a step ahead of the Soviets, Administration officials said.
For the Soviet Union, GATT membership is part of a long list of demands for economic concessions from the West to assist their program of economic reorganization.
Among other items on the Soviet agenda are membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, multilateral institutions that lend money chiefly to developing countries, and an end to restrictions imposed unilaterally by the United States on Soviet trade, including high American tariffs and a ban on export credits.
Mr. Gorbachev made a dramatic bid in July to gather Western support for his policies. In a message at the Paris economic summit meeting, he pledged the Soviet Union's ''full and entire participation in the world's economy. He added, ''The rest of the world can only gain by the opening of the world economy to a market such as the Soviet Union.''
Some officials said the State Department was weighing as one option the establishment of a United States-Soviet Economic Working Group to put economic issues between the two countries on an equal footing with arms control, human rights and regional issues.
GATT association for the Soviets would be among the items explored by the working group.

HEADLINE: Camden Forces Its Suburbs To Ask, What If a City Dies?

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
This once-powerful industrial city on the Delaware River has been so battered, drained and gutted that there is little left today except neighborhoods of the extraordinarily poor and their government.
Fewer than 100 households in this city of 80,000 have incomes of more than $50,000. Its children are the poorest in the nation; 61 percent live below the Federal poverty level. On some of the city's worst blocks one-third of the houses have crumbled or collapsed, and children play on ruptured sidewalks and in lots strewn with shattered glass.
At noon the main avenues are so still that one can whistle and hear an echo off industrial plants that once flooded the world with ships, radios and fountain pens. 
''Everything has flown over the wall that could,'' said the Rev. Michael Doyle of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in the neighborhood of South Camden, an area of gutted houses and crumbled streets. ''What is left are all those with broken wings. The problem with Camden is that so much is broken.''
Where did everyone go? A 10-minute drive away, to the thriving suburbs of Camden County. There, tens of thousands of cars clog highways lined with businesses and stores that offer more jobs than anyone can fill; there live the families that left Camden 20 years ago and have hardly looked back.
But county leaders say the suburbs can no longer afford to turn their backs. The cost of Camden's lingering death - measured in crime, drug addiction, AIDS, and a wasted work force - is beginning to endanger their own economies. In a mostly suburban county of 500,000 people, property taxes are rising to pay the growing bills of urban decay. While an underclass remains isolated and unemployed in the city, businesses in the suburbs are starving for workers.
 
'Economic Necessity'
''New Jersey cannot grow and prosper if we continue to have two New Jerseys,'' said Representative James J. Florio, who has represented Camden since 1975 and is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee.
''It is no longer just a moral imperative,'' said the director of the County Board of Freeholders, Robert E. Andrews. ''It is an economic necessity.''
A growing number of political leaders, both in New Jersey and elsewhere around the country, see the developing relationship of city and suburb as pivotal for the nation's economic future. In recent months the two worlds of Camden County have attracted particular interest because of the candidacy of Mr. Florio, a politician who was shaped by Camden and its suburbs, and who then selected the region's leaders and helped shape its policies.
 
Concern for Urban Centers
Campaigning for governor, Mr. Florio argues that New Jersey's economic future depends on reviving its urban centers, The starkness of Camden's poverty has forced political and community leaders to ask these basic questions about the nation's abandoned inner cities:
* Can government programs really remove people from welfare and train them for lasting employment?
* Should renewal efforts focus on large redevelopment projects intended to attract new businesses and tourists or on smaller programs that create jobs and housing for poor residents?
* Have crack, AIDS, homelessness and the deterioration of the family so overwhelmed the poor that it is too late for government to help?
 
Limits of Government
Mr. Andrews and Mr. Florio, both Democrats, as well as Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, have placed their hopes for Camden on a new state welfare program that provides job training and on a $175 million aquarium and redevelopment plan intended to draw businesses and tourists to the riverfront.
Critics of Mr. Florio and of the Democrats who have run Camden said the failures illustrate the limits of what government can do. They point to decades of ideas that have failed, from a plan in the 1950's to make Camden a distribution center for the Edsel to urban renewal schemes that demolished downtown blocks but never replaced them.
If the new efforts fail, county leaders fear, the suburbs may suffer the fate that people once thought reserved for the city - businesses fleeing for places where taxes are low, land is cheap and workers abound.
 
Decades of Decline
Blighted City, Booming Suburbs
The forces that destroyed Camden were the same that ravaged industrial cities throughout the Northeast and Middle West that were the backbones of the American economy until the 50's. Most cities lost some industries and neighborhoods, but not every one. They were struck by some blights, but not others. Camden seemed to be hit by everything and saved almost nothing.
In 1939, Camden stood across the river from Philadelphia as a modest but proud competitor, with 300 factories and 118,700 residents packed into nine square miles. It was a simple city of flat-roofed brick houses trimmed with white marble and shaded by sycamores.
On summer nights, families sat on front porches to watch young people walk down the brick sidewalks toward the city's 13 movie theaters or the nightclubs and dance halls that featured musicians like Tommy Dorsey and Gene Krupa. Neon signs flashed, crowds overflowed into the streets, and the faint scent of roasting coffee from a nearby factory hung in the air.
The New York Shipyards employed 35,000 people in World War II. The headquarters for RCA-Victor churned out records, radios and television equipment. A few blocks away, the Esterbrook plant produced 200 million pens a year. Forty-two factories cooked and canned most of the world's supply of Campbell's soup.
 
Move to Suburbia
''It was its own world, an entire, exciting world,'' recalled State Senator Walter Rand, a 60-year-old Democrat who grew up in the city.
After the war, a generation of newly wed veterans propelled by cars, federally subsidized mortgages and the need for housing, settled in subdivisions built on nearby farmland. Healthy businesses began to follow them, and many older manufacturers fell into a slow decline.
RCA cut its work force from 18,000 in the city and began building offices in the suburbs. Today its plants, owned by General Electric, employ 2,924. In 1955, the city's newspaper, The Courier Post, moved to nearby Cherry Hill. A slow fade by the shipbuilding industry ended when the New York Shipyards closed in 1967.
The Campbell's headquarters stayed, but the factories dwindled. Last month Campbell's announced that its last factory here, with more than 900 workers, would close next year.
As whites and jobs moved to the suburbs, they left behind the blacks and Puerto Ricans who had traveled north to work in the factories. Those families increasingly turned to welfare, and their neighborhoods to slums.
As described by social scientists like Prof. William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago, the decline of blue-collar jobs in cities was accompanied by a rise in families headed by women.
Over decades, a sense of hopelessness settled over neighborhoods where youths had few contacts with the job market.
''Nobody really talked about getting a job or what you were going to do when you grew up,'' said Emma Gomez, 30, an unmarried mother of three who was raised here and now lives on welfare. ''I wanted to be somebody. But it was hard when no one had any motivation.''
 
Malls Triumphant
In the mid-60's, even the Mafia left for the suburbs, Police Chief George D. Pugh said. Though the city had a long history of prostitution and gambling rings, they gave way to once-rare street crimes, muggings, purse snatchings and murders by small-time thugs.
By the late 60's suburban malls had vanquished downtown department stores. After blacks rioted in 1969, the last white merchants and families fled, leaving behind a population with so little disposable income that the city cannot even support one movie theater.
''The reaction to all this was intense,'' said State Senator Lee B. Laskin, a Republican who left for the suburbs in 1972. ''Camden was a small city of familiar neighborhoods. The feeling in this sleepy little city was so good, people couldn't believe it could happen here. What made me decide to move was what made the decision for most young couples - our children.''
In South Camden, odors from the county sewage treatment plant waft through the air where the silence is broken by trucks rattling their way to area's junk yards. The elderly pass their days on porches and stoops. Young men gather in listless clumps, dragging deep on cigarettes and staring off at nothing.
Since the arrival of cocaine smoking three years ago, dozens of gangs or posses have carved up the city into fiefs. Killings by firebombs and machine gun have become a part of life. On Fifth Street in North Camden, a posse declares its sovereignty with a blue and yellow mural of a baby holding a knife and the words: ''North Camden Fifth Street Danger Zone. Children of the Ghetto 1989.'' Today the city is more than 85 percent black and Hispanic. Forty-two percent of the population is younger than 18. Fifty-two percent of the ninth graders drop out of high school. The unemployment rate is officially 12 percent, but may Mr. Andrews said it might really be twice as high. The average price of a house is $35,000, but many can be bought for less than $1,000.
Camden leads the nation in statistics that measure the failure of life for children: 61 percent of its children live in poverty; nearly one of three babies is born to a teen-ager, and 90 percent of the teen-age mothers are unmarried.
 
Shadow Over Paradise
Troubles Visit Cherry Hill
Mr. Laskin moved to Cherry Hill, a suburban oasis for the more affluent Camden emigres, as well as a magnet for families from Philadelphia, New York and northern New Jersey. Today, with a population of 73,600, it is almost as large as Camden.
Cherry Hill officials boast one of the better public school systems in the state: nearly all of its students graduate from high school and more than 85 percent go to colleges. The average house costs $150,000, though some cost as much as $500,000.
In the last 15 years, Cherry Hill has evolved from a bedroom community into an employment center with shopping centers, industrial parks and corporate offices for companies including Subaru of America, the Cigna Corporation and I.B.M. Its residents have little reason to go to Camden.
''I am not sure Camden is anywhere in the world view of voters in Cherry Hill, except that it costs money,'' said the town's mayor, Susan Levin, a Democrat. ''It is neither a place they visit nor a place they think about very much.''
But if Cherry Hill and other Camden suburbs are economic successes, trends at work in the county now point to a more troubled future.
 
Labor Shortage
Routes 38 and 70, the main highways, are clogged with traffic jams most days. The price of housing is beginning to rise out of the reach of many young couples.
More dramatic, perhaps, employers have been gripped by growing anxiety that there are no longer enough workers to fill jobs, from sales clerk to executive. Newspapers sometimes go undelivered for lack of carriers; hospitals and corporations search for employees out of state and overseas.
More than anything else, economists say, the labor shortage threatens economic growth in suburbs around the nation like Camden's over the next decade.
''I can't imagine it becoming more difficult,'' said Frances Burnstein, president of the Greater Cherry Hill Chamber of Commerce. ''There isn't a retail store where a young person can't walk in and become instantly employed for at least $5 an hour.''
Elkins-Sinn, a pharmaceutical company in Cherry Hill, has begun recruiting workers in Camden, sending vans into the city to pick them up. Other companies are contemplating similar programs. But until the unemployed in Camden receive better education, training and support services like child care, said Ms. Burnstein, they may not be able to fill the needs of employers.
''We can't just treat the employment problem without treating the social issues,'' she said.
 
Plan for the Future
Searching For an Answer
If there is one issue that infuriates voters in Cherry Hill, it is property taxes in Camden County, which are now the second highest in the state.
In Cherry Hill, the owner of a $150,000 home pays $3,600 a year in property taxes; 35 percent of that goes to the county to pay for, among other things, the jails, courts, hospitals and other services largely used by the poor of Camden. And by most estimates, those costs are growing.
No one, for example, knows how far the AIDS epidemic will spread in Camden. Surveys show that the virus is moving quickly among intravenous drug users who share needles. An increase in cases of syphilis is a warning, health experts say, that the sex taking place in the city's crack houses is also spreading the AIDS virus.According to Michael DiPiero, a Republican freeholder who overseas the county's health services, the epidemic could cost each county household hundreds of dollars in coming years.
 
New Program
''People are realizing it is a better deal to spend $6,000 on a person in a job training program than $20,000 a year to keep them in prison,'' said Catherine DeCheser, the director of the Community Planning and Advocacy Council, the county's human services planning organization. ''We either bring these people into the labor force or we continue to support them as dependents.''
In May the county began a program, run by a not-for-profit-corporation outside the welfare system, to train mothers on welfare for jobs available in the county and provide them with child care, health insurance and subsidized transportation as they begin to work.
The program, part of the statewide revision of welfare instituted by Mr. Kean, also reflects the thinking in a $3.3 billion welfare measure enacted by Congress last year. Over the next four years, the county hopes to enroll 4,000 of its 12,000 welfare families.
Studies of the new generation of such programs, conducted in San Diego and other cities, show that they can help significant numbers of single parents get off welfare. But the studies also show that such programs easily fail unless they are properly run and provide a rich array of education and training programs as well as jobs.
 
Rising to the Challenge
Politics And Payments
Republican officials argue that if history is any judge, the Democratic leadership in Camden is unlikely to achieve such bold goals.
From 1936 until 1981, when Mayor Angelo J. Errichetti was convicted of bribery in the Abscam scandal and ousted, Camden politics was dominated by a faction-ridden and corrupt Democratic machine.
Among its less successful ideas were plans to make Camden a distribution center for Ford's Edsel in the late 50's. and There were also visions of shopping malls, fountains, marinas and theaters projected by city leaders in the late 1960's. The cranes and demolition teams came and went in the 1960's, but the businesses never materialized.
In 1981 Democrats allied with Mr. Florio overturned the Errichetti machine and took control of county government. But Republicans charge that these Democrats have also used county programs to benefit themselves. Though suburban voters would like to see the city revive, suburban Republicans say they fear new programs will only generate new bureaucracies and raise taxes while failing to help the poor.
''My fear is that the city won't come back,'' said Senator Laskin. ''Not because there aren't honest, sincere residents there. But the political leadership is not there. I just don't see government doing what has got to be done.''
 
'Who Is Going to Pay?'
In a state-financed effort to bring back the city, Camden recently began building a $42 million aquarium, part of a 90-acre waterfront project that city leaders and Mr. Kean hope will include a new headquarters for Campbell's, a hotel and a trade center. The project's planners say that it will double the city's tax base, create 1,000 new jobs and attract a million tourists a year.
If the project succeeds, planners say, the city could afford to begin improving critical services so that Camden, with the county's only cheap housing, might begin attracting middle-income couples priced out of the suburban housing market. In the long term, they say, the city's salvation rests with bringing back some of suburbia.
''My philosophy is that the poor cannot support the poor,'' said Melvin R. Primas Jr., the Mayor since 1981. ''We have a very large population that believes government will take care of them from birth to death. But who is going to pay for it? The poor can't support the poor.''
But a number of housing advocates say the project, at best, would create a suburban alcove in a few downtown blocks, a neighborhood with a separate economy and little to offer the poor. They argue that the state's money should be invested directly in the creation of housing and jobs.
 
Combined Problems
''Even if you can gentrify half of Camden, the poor people and their neighborhoods will be moved somewhere else,'' said Tom Knoche, an organizer with the Concerned Citizens of North Camden, a community group.
Perhaps the most telling question for the future is how far and how fast life will disintegrate on the city's crumbling residential blocks. Problems like AIDS, crack and the breakdown of the family that once were separate seem to be melting into one another, creating costs no one can estimate and victims whose pathologies are hard to comprehend.
The answer will come from people like Ms. Gomez, who is watching her three children grow up in a housing project where drug dealing, addiction and death are fast overcoming the last vestiges of civilized life. She fears that her two sons and daughter will be sucked into the drug world, as was her sister, who died six years ago.
This summer, Ms. Gomez joined the county's job training program. But after tests showed she could read only as well as a fifth grader, she was told it would take months or even years of work before she is ready for the kind of job she needs to be able to leave. That news was disheartening, but she said she will persevere.
''I want to move to the environment of Cherry Hill and show it to my kids,'' she said. ''I don't know if I am going to make it, but I am going to try.''

HEADLINE: A Chic Crowd Of New Rich For Ethiopia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
At a soft-drink bar not far from the airport here, stylishly attired teen-agers in stone- washed jeans, glittery T-shirts and spiked heels socialize under a portrait of the singer Michael Jackson.
Facetiously known as the ''fa-fa generation'' after the name of a high-protein food for famine victims, they are the children of wealthy merchants, a top slice of Ethiopians who have grown newly rich through favors from the Marxist-Leninist Government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
On Sunday afternoons the teen-agers attend dances at the Hilton, specially staged so they are amused while their parents, who think nothing of paying $600 for a yearly membership at the hotel's sports club, relax on the swimming pool patio. On Fridays and Saturdays from midnight to 5 A.M., the youths cavort at the Hilton's curfew-breaking dances. 
Diplomats, civil servants and professors here refer to the young Ethiopians as the ''new class'' - a reference to the work of the Yugoslav dissident Milovan Djilas, who wrote about classless socialist states creating their own stratifications. The emergence of such a class in one of the world's poorest countries - a country where hunched-over women lugging loads of wood on their backs is a common sight in the capital - represents more than just money.
 
Interest in Things American
With flashy clothes reflecting the latest Western fashions, those youths are the most striking embodiment of a trend that is apparent in less obvious ways among civil servants and poor urban workers: a fascination with things American.
The interest in American culture, news of which seeps in through a vibrant videotape-rental business, well-thumbed American magazines and programs on the Voice of America, is in marked contrast to the disdain for the Soviets, Ethiopia's major arms benefactor. An official of the Ministry of Information recently said he was uneasy walking in a provincial town with a plainly dressed American because many of the residents thought he was with a Russian.
Translations of American novels like Sidney Sheldon's ''Master of the Game'' and Ken Follett's ''Eye of the Needle'' are best sellers in the bookstalls in the Mercato, the swirling outdoor market in Addis Ababa. Brand-name American sneakers, a status symbol among the new class, sell for $90 and more at the Mercato.
The widening gap between the new rich and the poor masses is nowhere more evident than at ''closed door'' salons. They are so named because guests must arrive by car and be ushered through the gate of a private home. Here, the new traders and Marxist party officials do business, eat and drink copiously - one is expected to buy a bottle of Scotch, not just a glass.
''There are so many obstacles for normal business, but a lot of short cuts if you know how,'' said a man who frequents the salons.
 
Ways to Make Money
One of the most sought-after favors from the Government is a license to export chat, a green leaf that is chewed as a mild narcotic. The legal export of chat to Somalia and Djibouti is reported to be hugely profitable. ''The licenses to export are given by the Government,'' a civil servant said. ''If you get one or two, you are set for life.''
An easier way to make money is to sell scarce essentials at marked-up prices. For example, lines of poor women often form outside state stores before opening time. They are not buying for themselves but for merchants who resell the items - toilet paper, soap and condensed milk, for example - at higher prices at their private stores. The result is that state stores lack essential goods at low prices, Addis Ababa residents say.
At the high end of the scale, at the Mercato, traders make larger profits on imported goods - radios, television sets and videotape recorders - often smuggled in through Djibouti with officials looking the other way.
Liberalized economic regulations announced in July were interpreted by some here as an effort by the Government to find a way for the new rich to invest their money rather than spend it on lavish weddings and expensive cars bought from departing foreign officials.
 
Private Investments Allowed
The new guidelines allow for private investment in small-scale industry, joint ventures between Ethiopians and foreign partners and the private construction of hotels. Nervousness about possible nationalization has apparently deterred interest in establishing industries. But Ethiopian officials said there have been 240 applications to build hotels by private citizens, who under the new rules can spend up to $1.5 million on the enterprises.
Perhaps the most blatant example of the traders' wealth concerns the first new high rise in Addis Ababa in many years. Some civil servants have expressed amazement that traders paid 197,000 birr (almost $100,000) for the right to rent 400-square-foot stores that were constructed by the municipality on the ground floor of the still uncompleted building.
There was not only astonishment at the money involved but also frustration.
''If this chap was allowed to build, he could build a beautiful store instead of taking this miserable 45-square meters,'' said a civil servant. ''Then the Government could talk about liberalization.''
Rumor has it that one of the stores is destined to be an outlet for the widest range of American videotapes yet available.

HEADLINE: South Africa's National Party: Vehicle for Afrikaner Power

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The National Party of South Africa, which lost ground in elections today, has been the main vehicle for Afrikaner nationalism for more than 50 years and the dominant political force in the country since it came to power in 1948, steadfastly fighting to expand the political and economic power of the descendants of the Dutch and Huguenot settlers who came to the country in the 17th century.
''The National Party has been in power without any serious challenge for the last 41 years,'' said Chester A. Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from June 1981 to May of this year. ''The party has used its 1948 victory to assure the permanent empowerment of the Afrikaner mainstream. They brought into being an Afrikaner nationalist revolution, and they have been magnificently successful at empowering their own people economically.'' 
''If the Afrikaners stay together as a tribe,'' Mr. Crocker said tonight, ''they can dominate politics and the whole country. If the party is not doing well, that's because they are not united any more.''
 
Splits and Mergers
The National Party is known to the outside world as an instrument for insuring the supremacy of whites over blacks in South Africa. But it was founded, in part, to advance the interests of one group of whites, the Afrikaners, who chafed under domination by another group of whites, those of British descent.
The party is a product of splits and mergers of various political factions in the period between the world wars. During World War II, Mr. Crocker noted, ''some members of the National Party were pro-Hitler.'' When they came to power in 1948, he said, they had ''a lot of half-baked ideas about racial superiority,'' derived from German and Afrikaner sociologists, and some of those ideas developed into the doctrine of apartheid.
''The National Party today is trying to undo that nightmare, trying to reverse course and find a way out of the wilderness,'' Mr. Crocker said.
The Nationalists came to power in 1948 under the leadership of Daniel F. Malan. Its program called for racial separation under white ''guardianship.'' It proceeded to adopt a body of openly discriminatory legislation that was amplified under Hendrik F. Verwoerd, who served as Prime Minister from 1958 to 1966, when he was stabbed to death on the floor of Parliament by a deranged white man working as a messenger.
 
Policy Becomes Ideology
Under Mr. Verwoerd, racial segregation was strictly enforced, and elevated into an elaborate ideology based on an even more elaborate structure of repressive laws. The token political representation of nonwhites was all but eliminated and opposition groups were severely repressed.
Mr. Verwoerd was succeeded by John Vorster, who continued his policy of establishing separate tribal homelands where blacks were supposed to exercise the only political life allowed them. A series of minor concessions to the blacks brought about a challenge from the right-wing, or ''verkrampte'' (narrow-minded), faction of the National Party led by Albert Hertzog.
The so-called enlightened, or ''verligte,'' faction of the party favored solidarity among all white South Africans and the pursuit of friendly relations with the outside world, including black African countries. By contrast, key members of the right-wing faction viewed the party as a vehicle of Afrikaner nationalism, and some even favored the exclusion of English-speaking citizens from membership in the party.
Most of the verkrampte faction left the party in 1982, when a leader of the party's conservative wing, Andries Treurnicht, was expelled from the Nationalists' parliamentary caucus in a dispute over power sharing with South Africans of mixed race and Indian descent. He and other far right-wing members of Parliament established the Conservative Party of South Africa, pledged to resist any diminution of white political power.
It was at the end of 1985 that P. W. Botha, the party and national leader from September 1978 until last month, alienated the extreme right by declaring that ''we have outgrown the outdated colonial system of paternalism, as well as the outdated concept of apartheid.''
Under Mr. Botha, the National Party pursued its vision of ''constitutional reform'' despite increasing opposition from the Conservatives and liberals, then led by the Progressive Federal Party. In April 1989, the Progressive Federal Party and two other small liberal parties merged to form the Democratic Party that contested today's elections.
Mr. Botha suffered a stroke early this year and resigned in February as leader of the National Party. F. W. de Klerk was chosen to succeed him as party leader.

HEADLINE: Li Peng, in Interview, Rules Out General Amnesty

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Prime Minister Li Peng has declared in an interview that decision-makers in China felt nearly impotent and were forced to act as ''a clandestine government'' before moving to put down the student-led rebellion that began in Tiananmen Square in the spring.
While defending China's repression of the movement, and ruling out any blanket amnesty for those who led the movement, Mr. Li conceded in an interview published today in Le Figaro that those who took part in the rebellion ''had good reasons to protest.''
He said the Communist Party had been ''incompetent'' and had since acted vigorously to root out corruption and ''influence peddling'' among its members and relatives of its leaders.
The interview is apparently the first broad public exposure of the Chinese leader's views in a Western publication on the democracy movement and the repression that followed. 
While acknowledging shortcomings in China's ruling circles, Mr. Li attacked Washington for its criticism of China. He said economic sanctions would do little to change Chinese opposition to the democracy movement and would only bring a loss of Chinese business to those who impose them.
In offering his account of the events that led to the student revolt, Mr. Li cited these causes, among others:
* Inflation, which had reached 18.5 percent because of what he described as the ''erroneous'' economic policies of the Government.
* Corruption in the party, which he said had aroused the anger of the Chinese people.
* Increasingly unfair distribution of income.
''The discontent has been provoked by the inefficiency of our work,'' Mr. Li said. He went on to say that stringent measures were applied to forbid employment of any party officials or their direct and distant relatives in commercial activities.
Mr. Li was also critical of the United States response to the disorder that shook China and strongly suggested that the United States had long favored an overthrow of the Communist Government in China, a policy that he said continues today.
''Someone very close to the President of the United States told me that he found joy in the fact that the American economic and social system is finding adherents among the Chinese students,'' he told Le Figaro. He said President Bush seemed not to have departed from a dream of John Foster Dulles, the former Secretary of State, that a generation of Chinese would overthrow the Government one day.
Taking several opportunities to single out Mr. Bush for criticism, Mr. Li said he doubted that the West could do as much as China is doing now to root out corruption. In a clear reference to Mr. Bush, he said he knew the American President had ''a son who works in an oil company and another who lends himself to commercial activities.''
 
'Subversion and Infiltrations'
The Prime Minister ruled out an unconditional amnesty for those arrested in connection with the anti-Government demonstrations, saying that while discontent with the Government was understandable, those who used it to try to overthrow the Government could not be forgiven. But he said those with no leading role in the troubles would not be pursued.
''These two aspects, dissatisfaction and rebellion, must be separated,'' Mr. Li said. ''I think that the danger of action to overthrow the Government has not been totally eliminated, neither overseas nor in China itself. I fear that we must still continue the struggle against subsversion and infiltrations.''
Mr. Li said China's concept of human rights is governed by its obligations to its population, which lives in a land of limited resources. ''Our primary task is to allow this population to feed and clothe itself,'' he said. ''This is much more important that empty words about human rights.''
He said economic sanctions ''will bring difficulties that we are ready to face.'' But he said China would continue with the economic policies that attracted foreign businesses to it in the first place, aware of the fact that ''what interests businessmen are profits and not ideology.''

HEADLINE: Kansas City Journal;
Council Vote to Decide Conventional Center Plan

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 6

 BODY:
The Kansas City Council will try Thursday to set off a chain of events that a lot of people here say will put new life into a city that is already awakening from a long slumber.
The Council is scheduled to decide whether to ask the city's voters to approve a financing plan that would double the size of the downtown convention center and, if so, when to do it.
If the plan is approved, some people here say, it would stanch the bleeding of jobs and business across the state line into Johnson County, Kan.
Those who oppose the plan say it could alter the sense of an unhurried pace and uncrowded space here that newcomers and visitors often find appealing. 
What the plan would ask voters to approve is an increase in city taxes on hotel rooms and restaurant meals. The proceeds, which are expected to amount to about $6 million a year, along with up to $2 million a year in aid already authorized by the Missouri Legislature, would finance a $120 million expansion of H. Roe Bartle Hall, a multiblock downtown structure that will double in size to about 400,000 square feet.
Although Bartle Hall was completed only 13 years ago, it has fallen far behind in the competition for convention business as other cities have built larger and larger centers. Kansas City, once one of the top 10 destinations for conventioneers, has fallen to 23d on the popularity list.
The convention center's decline has paralleled in some ways a decline in the population of Kansas City.
After reaching a high of 507,330 in 1970, the city's population fell to 441,000 in 1986. But since then its fortunes have started to look up again, with a boom in downtown construction and a resurgence of jobs that had been lost to the suburbs.
If the Council approves the plan, it will end more than a year of wrangling over such basic aspects of the plan as the direction in which the building would expand - one faction favoring the south and another favoring the east.
Once the question of the direction was resolved (the south won), disputes began over when to present the proposal to the voters. Some people want to put it on the November ballot. Others want to wait until February to allow more time to develop plans and generate support.
''I am very pleased that both the city's business leaders and the City Council are now pulling together,'' said Whitney E. Kerr, a developer who has been at the center of the debate.
Mr. Kerr is a partner with H. Ross Perot Jr., a son of the prominent Dallas industrialist, in a 23-acre downtown parcel that they have assembled for a development that would include a world trade center and a hotel. They have offered to let the city build part of the expansion of their land at no charge.
Earlier, Mr. Kerr and others, including R. Crosby Kemper, a leading banker, had used much different words in questioning the motives of some of their opponents, including executives of Hallmark Cards Inc., a company that is revered in this city.
''I am convinced that territorialism is at the base of the problems,'' Mr. Kerr told a local reporter recently. His remark reminded people here that many executives in the city's downtown office buildings drive to work across the state line from mansions on the rolling acres of Mission Hills, Kan.; that their prestigious Kansas City Country Club is not in Kansas City at all but in Mission Hills, and that some have competing business interests elsewhere in the city and the suburbs, including Hallmark's own midtown Crown Center development of offices, stores and hotels.
Irving O. Hockaday Jr., the president and chief executive of Hallmark, said his main concern was over timing, planning and support, not over the expansion itself.
And, in an interview the other day, he vented some irritation of his own. He said a variety of contributions to city causes by ''Hallmark and the Hall family'' had made it ''abundantly clear that they are good corporate citizens.'' When critics question their motives, he said, ''they know better, and it makes me wonder what their own motives are.''
The conflicts are being played out against the background of a city that still stirs newcomers much as it did Andre Maurois, the French author who recorded his impressions after a trip here in 1947.
While brushing off the downtown ''with its violent contrast of skyscraper and wasteland,'' he focused his praise on a residential section that he called ''a masterpiece of city planning,'' and asked, ''Who in Europe, or in America for that matter, knows that Kansas City is one of the loveliest cities on earth?''

HEADLINE: Elderly Poor Face Higher Costs for Medical Coverage, Study Says

BYLINE: y MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Nearly 60 percent of older Americans would pay more for insurance for catastrophic medical costs under a plan approved in July by the House Ways and Means Committee, a study released today by an advocacy group said.
Those facing higher bills under the plan would be the poorer elderly, while bills would be reduced for 25 percent of older Americans who are more prosperous, said the study commissioned by Families United for Senior Action. The nonprofit group, which lobbies for the low-income elderly, was formerly known as the Villers Foundation.
''If it is the height of political folly to raise costs for three out of five older Americans, it is the depth of economic injustice to shift the burden of catastrophic health care onto those least able to afford the cost of illness,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families United for Senior Action. 
 
Response to Protests
The House panel passed the measure in response to the protests of the more affluent elderly who resent paying a surtax of up to $800 annually to finance the insurance program. Congress approved the program last year to protect the elderly against the catastrophic costs of an extended major illness. The Senate Finance committee will meet Thursday to draft its proposed revisions in the program.
Sponsors of the House committee plan have acknowledged that it would shift the costs from the wealthier elderly to those who are poorer, but they said the plan was the only politically feasible way to salvage the program. The new study by Lewin/ICF, a health research firm, provides the first detailed analysis of the impact of the proposed changes.
Under the committee plan, the richest elderly would continue to pay the maximum surtax of $800, but the maximum would be paid by those with incomes of more than $45,000, not $35,000, as under current law.
 
Increase in Premium
The committee plan, which would take effect next year, would cut the surtax in half, from 25 percent of every $150 in taxes paid to 12.5 percent. To make up the loss in revenue, the flat premium would be increased from $4.90 a month, or $58.80 annually, to $8.40 a month, or $100.80 a year.
In addition, beneficiaries would have to pay $800, instead of the current $600, to qualify for drug benefits under the plan.
Under current law, 42 percent of the elderly pay a surtax, which many consider an unfair burden. They assert that they are paying more than the value of the insurance, an assertion substantiated by the Congressional Budget Office. The surtax is used to build reserve funds.
In addition, many elderly have complained that the legislation fails to provide the needed protection against the expenses of long-term nursing home care.
 
Incomes Below $12,500
The study by Families United for Senior Action found that 58 percent of the elderly households, or 12.8 million households, would pay more for their insurance, while 25 percent, or 5.6 million elderly households, would pay less. The remaining 17 percent, or 3.8 million households, would pay the same.
Of those who face higher bills for their insurance, the study found that 31 percent have incomes of $6,249 to $9,373. Another 22 percent have incomes of $9,374 to $12,497, the study said.
Of those who would pay less, 79 percent have incomes at or above $18,747, the study said.
Mr. Pollack said his organization would prefer that the financing of the catastrophic bill remain unchanged, but he acknowledged the political pressures on Congress to make some revisions. He said he hoped that Congress would protect ''those most vulnerable'' with incomes of about $6,200 to $9,300.
In a related development today, Representative Edward R. Roybal, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, supported the Ways and Means Committee proposal to halve the surtax, but opposed the proposal to increase the flat premium. Instead, he proposed removing the current wage ceiling of $48,000 for paying the Medicare payroll tax.

The Cost of Reagan

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Self-indulgence is good for us:
That was the message of the Reagan years. And how we wanted to believe it. ''It's morning again in America,'' the Reagan TV spot said in the 1984 campaign. We were convinced.
Now it is the morning after. The reckoning is starting to come in for those eight years. We see that the indulgence in private greed exacted a heavy public cost, one that will burden our children and grandchildren. 
The savings and loan scandal was a squalid case of private enrichment at public expense. S & L officials used their depositors' money on worthless loans and yachts for themselves. Most of the cost of repaying the insured depositors will fall on us.
How much? It is hard to estimate. President Bush and his people have done their best to fudge it. But it will be well over $100 billion in the next 10 years, and more in the decades following.
When the Bush Administration produced its savings rescue legislation last winter, it was called a $50 billion plan. That was the amount that was to be raised by bonds to buy out insolvent institutions. But it did not include the larger sum in interest on the bonds, most of it to be paid by the public.
When the legislation was enacted last month, it was called a $166 billion rescue package. That was the sum of capital, interest and other bailout costs over the next 10 years. But again it may not be high enough. The Economist of London said of the $166 billion figure:
''It assumes no more thrift insolvencies, no rise in interest rates, no more withdrawals of thrift deposits and a healthy input from the sale of assets owned by the thrifts that have gone bust. All questionable assumptions - so the chances are that more cash will be needed.''
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over 30 years, the life of the Bush rescue plan, it will cost $300 billion to close insolvent S & L's. The taxpayers will pay at least three-quarters of that, $225 billion.
President Reagan was not the sole author of the S & L disaster, not by any means. Congress changed the law to insure larger loans and ones of riskier character, and some members tried to protect shady savings officials. But the tone of indulgence was set by Mr. Reagan with his antipathy toward government regulation.
Another heavy burden on the future comes from the Government's nuclear weapons manufacturing plants. Perhaps because individual greed is not involved, this scandal has not made as many headlines as the S & L troubles. But it is every bit as serious.
The weapons plants have been pouring nuclear poison into the atmosphere and land around them for years. They require fundamental repairs, and the existing risks to health from radioactive waste have to be removed. The cost is estimated at more than $100 billion.
Here again the responsibility is not the Reagan Administration's alone. Troubles at the nuclear plants began earlier. But they grew flagrant in the last eight years, when so many more weapons were being produced, and they were ignored.
Money is not the only measure of what the Reagan years cost. The scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development did not produce large losses to the Treasury by current standards: a mere $2 billion or so. But they did painful damage to the idea of Government assistance for housing.
There is no way that the private housing market can solve the problems of urban ghettos or the homeless or needy older people. But any proposal now for Government insurance or subsidy will evoke cynical memories of James Watt's $300,000 telephone calls.
The intangible costs of the Reagan years to our domestic tranquillity are surely greater than what can be measured in dollars. They are the costs of hostility to the role of government, of indulgence toward private greed, of insensitivity to the needs of the weak in our society.
Ronald Reagan saw a Hobbesian jungle out there and liked it. He believed, with unquestionable sincerity, that we would all be better off if the strong and the rich were left free to act, even at the expense of the less fortunate.
Americans are naturally skeptical of government, so it was not surprising that they responded to the Reagan message. But in real life there is no safety or humanity for anyone unless the society as a whole is a decent one. Hobbes, in the 17th century, said that life without organized society would be nasty, brutish and short.

Nadler Says 'This Is Not My Year' and Abandons Race

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The lopsided four-way Democratic race for New York City Comptroller became a slightly less lopsided three-way contest yesterday when Assemblyman Jerrold L. Nadler, stuck at the bottom of the pack, dropped out and threw his support to a fellow Assemblyman, Alan G. Hevesi.
Standing on the steps of City Hall, Mr. Nadler, who raised $300,000 yet could never afford television or radio advertising and is $80,000 in debt, said that he was ''a political realist, and I know that this is not my year.''
That leaves Mr. Hevesi, of Queens, and Frank J. Macchiarola, a former Schools Chancellor, waging an uphill fight against the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, who they agree has been far ahead in the polls.
Poll results published yesterday in New York Newsday showed Ms. Holtzman's support has slipped in the last month below the 40 percent level needed to avoid a runoff with the second highest vote-getter. Mr. Hevesi's camp clearly hoped Mr. Nadler's withdrawal would give its campaign a boost. 
The poll showed Ms. Holtzman's support at 37 percent, down from 51 percent a month earlier, Mr. Macchiarola at 18 percent, Mr. Hevesi at 6 percent and Mr. Nadler at 3 percent.
It was based on 877 telephone interviews of registered Democrats by the Gallup Organization from Aug. 26 to 29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Primary polls can be unreliable because they cannot predict turnouts, which can markedly affect the outcome of a race.
The poll indicated that almost none of the support lost by Ms. Holtzman had shifted to the other candidates, but rather it had resulted in an increase in the number of undecided voters.
Mr. Hevesi's aides were quick to note that the poll was taken before Mr. Hevesi had received two major endorsements, from The Daily News and The New York Times. They said the decision by Mr. Nadler, of Manhattan, would elicit even more support from politicians who had backed him.
 
As the Tension Grows
Mr. Koch may be gaining some support, but he may also be gaining weight. After a midday meeting with groups of the elderly, he told reporters that he felt ''more anxiety'' about this race than he had about any of the 23 previous campaigns of his career.
''I'm trying not to eat too much,'' he said. ''If suddenly I feel a lot of anxiety, I give in.''
In the worst case, he allowed, he might indulge in a bowl of butter pecan ice cream with chocolate sauce.
But the Mayor's chief rival, Borough President David N. Dinkins of Manhattan, had healthier pursuits on his mind at the meeting.
''I frankly feel more calm and confident than ever,'' he said, adding that he had calmed his nerves playing tennis over the Labor Day weekend. If there is time to play again before the election, Mr. Dinkins said, he would invite reporters to join him.
''You bring the racquets,'' he said, ''and I'll provide the balls.'' Did You Hear the One . . . A campaign that has seen its share of clowning is to be joined today by a professional comic. Aides to Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a television commercial for their candidate featuring Jackie Mason poking fun at Mayor Koch.
Is that an indication of the candidate Mr. Giuliani expects to face in November if he wins the Republican primary?
''If it is Ed Koch, fine,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''If it isn't, then the people of New York will have gotten to see one of the funnier routines. Maybe this will lend a little bit of humor to the campaign.''

HEADLINE: Parties Skirmish Over a Strategy In War on Drugs

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The morning after President Bush told the nation that he did not want his drug strategy to set off a ''partisan bidding war,'' skirmishes broke out today between Republicans and Democrats over how to finance the program.
Democratic leaders in Congress accused the President of seeking credit, with great fanfare, for an anti-drug package without a realistic plan of how to pay for it. But, lacking consensus over any alternative to Mr. Bush's plan, Democrats disagreed among themselves over how best to respond.
Anticipating a cool reception from Capitol Hill, the Administration today began its effort to sell the program to skeptical lawmakers and the public.
Mr. Bush's proposal calls for a $7.9 billion program to fight drugs and includes elements like intensified law enforcement and new economic and military aid to the South American nations where illegal drugs are produced. 
 
Rangel Worried About Funds
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, commended Mr. Bush for focusing more attention on the drug crisis but quickly turned to budget matters.
''Why do we nickel-and-dime the effort?'' Mr. Rangel asked. ''If we were being invaded by a foreign force, I am sure the President would not be looking to take from other Federal programs to fund our national defense.''
Mr. Rangel said there was little choice but to raise taxes to finance a strong anti-drug effort, but other Democrats, like Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, disagreed. Emphasizing the political realities of Mr. Bush's pledge against a tax increase, Mr. Kennedy said, ''It's unrealistic for Congress to support a tax in crease if Bush opposes it.''
Asked whether Democrats would agree that a tax increase was needed to finance drug programs, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said, ''I don't think there's any consensus at this point as to exactly how it should be done.''
 
Bush Calls Debate Misguided
Not wanting the spotlight on drugs to shift entirely from the White House, Mr. Bush visited a Washington hospital where infants who were abandoned by their addicted mothers are being treated. He and his Federal drug policy director, William J. Bennett, in separate and joint appearances, declared that the debate over money was inevitable, but misguided.
''There has been little, if any, substantive criticism about this national strategy,'' Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House. ''And listen to the critics, if you will, but recognize that you don't hear much substance. What you're hearing the debate about is how one pays for it or whether it needs to be more in one category or another.''
While several Democratic lawmakers questioned the content of Mr. Bush's package, with many saying it lacked emphasis in areas like drug prevention and education, those concerns were overshadowed by the debate over financing the plan, which calls for a spending increase of $2.2 billion over the $5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.
The Administration's budget director, Richard G. Darman, proposed paying for the drug initiative by cutting programs currently budgeted, including immigration legalization services, juvenile justice and economic development.
But many Democrats said they found his recommendations unacceptable.
 
Sharp Words From Mitchell
''Yesterday the President told the nation he had sent to Congress a plan for finding the drug war program money,'' said the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. ''But he didn't tell the American people what that plan is, what other programs he wants to cut to finance the drug war. He didn't tell the American people he wants to cut $40 million from juvenile justice and delinquency prevention.
Mr. Mitchell said that ''virtually every item that President Bush identified as being a priority'' was enacted in the 1988 drug bill 10 months ago. ''The 1988 drug bill authorized $2.7 billion for this year, 1989,'' he added, ''but we have only been able to appropriate $1 billion. One reason for that, unfortunately, is the opposition of the Administration, this Administration.''
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who has proposed a 1 percent surtax on Federal income tax to raise $5 billion a year to fight drugs, said he feared that proposals for new spending on drugs would fall victim to partisan rancor.
''If tomorrow the President were to say, 'Let's have four fewer Stealth bombers,' it would pass the House,'' said Mr. Schumer, who is chairman of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. ''But for him to say, 'Let's take the money from public housing and put it into drugs,' it's not going to work. That's not how the politics of the Congress works.''
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley was more optimistic that the Bush program could be financed without new taxes, predicting that Congress would approve spending ''at least the amount the President recommended'' for the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
 
Outlay Held Inadequate
Even so, Mr. Foley and others Democrats complained that the amount was inadequate to wage an all-out attack on drugs.
''We are totally and woefully undermanned,'' said Representative Nicholas Mavroules, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''You're dealing with a $150 billion business when you're dealing with cocaine, and we're putting up a couple of lousy billion dollars to try to fight this war.''
Although Democrats were at times divided in their reaction to the Bush plan today, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware delivered an aggressive response to the President's speech Tuesday night.
Initially, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Foley planned to deliver the Democratic response, but several of their advisers suggested that it would be more effective to have a single spokesman. So the House and Senate leaders designated Mr. Biden, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and heads a task force that is studying the drug program.
Relations between Mr. Bennett and Mr. Biden have been cordial, and Administration officials said the Senator told Mr. Bennett in a telephone conversation early Tuesday that he would not be particularly critical in his speech. Still, Mr. Biden's response was written hastily, according to his aides, who were unable to produce a full text until shortly before the speech was delivered.
This morning, Mr. Biden was no longer the Democratic point man, as a news conference on the issue was led by the Mr. Gephardt.
 
Republicans Defend the Plan
Republicans jumped to the Administration's defense. ''This is a war on drugs,'' said the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, ''not a war on the American taxpayer.''
In a speech today to the National Press Club, Mr. Bennett dismissed the calls for more spending. ''When I was asked to write the strategy,'' he said, ''I wasn't told to hold it to a certain number. No number was intimated to me. I wasn't even told or reminded of the fact that we were at the end of the fiscal year. I'm a grown-up. I'm a part of the Administration. I live in the real world. I understand there's a budget agreement.''
''And,'' he added, ''I understand that as important as this issue is, you don't say to somebody, 'Make a wish list.' ''
One explanation for the lack of a united front among Democrats is that House and Senate leaders were still trying to work out the legislative mechanics that would translate the President's drug proposals into law, a process that may ultimately involve dozens of committees and subcommittees in both chambers.
The task will fall initially to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the panels responsible for producing the 13 annual spending bills that finance the Government's activities.
Since the House has already approved its versions of the 13 spending bills, decisions on how to reallocate money will have to be made in conference with the Senate Appropriations subcommittees after the full Senate has voted on the spending bills.

HEADLINE: COLOMBIA DEPORTS DRUG TRADE FIGURE;
Reward for 2 Suspects

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The Government offered $250,000 tonight for information leading to the arrest of two of Colombia's main drug traffickers.
The reward offer came after the reported extradition of a suspect accused of being a financial adviser to the Medellin cartel to the United States.
The drug traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every person extradited and news of the departure of Mr. Martinez raised new fears in an already tense nation. 
Both of Colombia's nightly national televsion news programs reported that Mr. Martinez, a 35-year-old economist who has been indicted on money-laundering charges in Atlanta, was put aboard a Drug Enforcement Administration jet plane bound for the United States.
Early this evening, the Government began running advertisements on the two television channels offering $250,000 for information on Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, leaders of the Medellin Cartel and two of the richest men in the world. Pictures of the two men were shown with four telephone numbers to be used for reporting information.
 
Cartel Leaders Elude Arrest
In the Government's recent raids, it has been unable to capture any of the leading figures in the drug-trafficking business here, an industry that provides 80 per cent of the cocaine consumed in the United States.
American and Colombian officials say they believe the leading drug traffickers have been able to elude security forces because of tip-offs from corrupt police officers and soldiers. The officials say they believe the traffickers are in Colombia in vast areas of the countryside that they control with heavily armed bands.
There were no immediate reportes of violence following the television accounts of Mr. Martinez's extradition. But there were reports that army and police units had been reinforced in Bogota and in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city and the center of its cocaine-trafficking business.
Late this afternoon, President Barco issued a decree aimed at giving him greater control in areas where the drug traffickers have established dominance. In the decree, he said that civilian mayors who were having trouble asserting their authority would be replaced temporarily by army officers and assigned other duties.

HEADLINE: Colombians Hail Bush Drug Plan, But Say the U.S. Aid Is Too Little

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Reacting to President Bush's new drug control strategy, Colombians said today that they were delighted that for the first time an American leader had stressed domestic consumption and not only foreign production and shipping.
''It's very good that President Bush has started a war against drug users inside the U.S.,'' said Senator Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal Party.
For years, Colombians and other Latin Americans have complained that the United States seemed preoccupied with stopping cocaine at its source while, in their view, doing little to reduce demand at home. Eighty percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States is shipped from Colombia. 
All the leading newspapers featured Mr. Bush's speech, which was broadcast here on television on Tuesday night with simultaneous Spanish translation.
''Bush Enters the War,'' El Espectador, a leading newspaper, declared in a headline over its main article. ''Bush Declares War,'' said El Siglo, a conservative daily.
 
Bombs Explode in Medellin
Soon after Mr. Bush finished speaking in Washington, three bombs exploded in Medellin, the center of Colombia's drug trafficking. The city has taken the brunt of the drug lords' counterattacks in a stepped-up campaign mounted three weeks ago by President Virgilio Barco Vargas after a leading presidential candidate was assassinated.
Eleven people were wounded, none critically, in the explosions, including two Americans from Miami working for the Spanish-language television network Univision. The two Americans were identified as Bernadette Pardo, a correspondent, and Carlos Ignacio Corrales, a cameraman.
Two of the bombs exploded in bank offices and one went off in a restaurant where the journalists were having dinner. A second restaurant was set on fire, the police said.
In Bogota, Mayor Andres Pastrana said that for security reasons he was instituting a ban on large public meetings that might become potential terrorist targets. He also set up a system of shifting roadblocks and said some streets would be completely closed to nighttime traffic.
 
Extradition Ruling Due
A Government official said the extradition appeal of a 35-year-old Colombian economist, Eduardo Martinez Romero, who has been indicted in Atlanta in a $1.2 million money-laundering operation linked to the Medellin cartel, had been taken up by a special council appointed by the President and was expected to be decided in the next few days. The drug traffickers have promised to kill 10 Colombian judges for every person extradited, and the country is nervously awaiting the special council's decision.
In an interview, Gen. Jose Joaquin Matallana, a retired army commander, said President Bush left ''a good impression'' in his speech Tuesday night because he recognized ''Colombia's efforts in the struggle against narcotics.''
But he said the $261 million in antinarcotics aid that Mr. Bush said would be shared by Colombia, Peru and Bolivia was ''very little'' in comparison to the amount needed. A senior Government official said the $261 million was ''peanuts.''
''Over all the message was very good,'' said Juan Carlos Pastrana, the editor of the Bogota daily La Prensa.
But he said he thought there was too much focus on long-term solutions and too little on immediate needs.
 
'Short End of the Stick'
He said that assuming an $80 million share for Colombia from the $261 million designated for the three Andean nations, Colombia would be ''getting the very, very short end of the stick.''
''Out of nearly $8 billion, Colombia gets $80 million?'' he said. ''That is a very short end. Too much blood is being spilled here for $80 million.''
There was no formal Government reaction, but one official hailed President Bush's drug package as ''a more balanced approach.''
In the past, he said, there had been an ''overreliance'' on interdiction and stopping drugs at the source ''while other elements were not involved.''
He described the President's emphasis on law enforcement in the United States as ''a conceptual breakthrough.''
 
Praise in Peru and Bolivia
LIMA, Peru, Sept. 6 (Reuters) - Officials in Peru and Bolivia praised the United States' latest anti-drug campaign today but cautioned that aid from Washington was still tiny compared to the billions of dollars changing hands in their nations' cocaine trade.
''This is a good, interesting plan, a step in the right direction, but it's going to take much, much more,'' said Senator Andres Quintana, an outspoken Peruvian advocate of local anti-narcotics drives.
''The important thing is that the U.S. is finally recognizing its stake in the problem as the main consumer country,'' Mr. Quintana said.
Peruvian officials have long criticized the focus of United States anti-narcotics policy, saying it puts too much emphasis on eradication of coca, the raw material for cocaine, and not enough on cutting United States appetite for the drug. But officials in both Peru and Bolivia, which produce about 90 percent of the world's coca, said the United States now appeared to be seeking a better-rounded, joint strategy.
''It's noteworthy that there is a shared concern,'' said Gonzalo Torrico, head of the Bolivian Government's anti-drug efforts. ''It's a task in which no country can opt out.''
The cocaine trade nets at least $2.5 billion a year in Peru and Bolivia combined, officials said.

HEADLINE: Hip, Hot and Hyper: Soviet TV Cuts Loose

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LENINGRAD

 BODY:
Imagine the gods of television had made Geraldo Rivera a Russian.
Imagine they had given him 10 minutes live each night, unconstrained by usual standards of squeamishness or discretion, to produce a fast-paced montage of big-city life, long on bizarre crimes, mild erotica, consumer ripoffs and environmental horrors.
The result would probably resemble ''600 Seconds,'' this city's nightly Leningrad digest, where glasnost meets gonzo and, some viewers fear, where much of Soviet television may be headed in excited imitation.
Since it was first broadcast 20 months ago, ''600 Seconds'' has become the most popular program on Leningrad television. It has also made its swashbuckling 31-year-old anchor, Aleksandr G. Nevzorov, a celebrity in much of the program's western Soviet viewing area. 
''Every show is a few more centimeters of free territory,'' said Mr. Nevzorov, who tends to speak of television as trench warfare rather than entertainment. ''The people love us because our aggressive approach makes them feel we are speaking the truth. They feel there are still forces of light and people of courage in Russia.''
 
A Hundred Flowers Bloom
The thaw of Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made way for much intelligent television in the Soviet Union. Uninhibited discussion, compelling documentaries, wicked satire and introspective youth programming are now mixed with less highbrow offerings like European pop festivals, silly game shows, beauty contests and potboiler serials, the current hit being a gangster series imported from Italy.
While ''600 Seconds'' is generally adored, some viewers worry that it represents the first foothold of television American style, where heat comes before light.
What sets the program apart from other television of the new era is not so much daring topics or a willingness to challenge orthodox thinking -both now staples of the better Soviet programs - but tempo and stance.
The tempo is breathless, often 10 short reports and two information digests crammed into the allotted seconds, while whirling digits count down from 600.00 to 00.00 in the background.
Viewers never know what is next: one day topless bathers invade the beach beneath the Peter and Paul fortress; another day, radioactive zucchini is intercepted at a Leningrad market. A tribute to Air Force Day segues into a report on a local video hall that shows children's cartoons by day and the erotic adventures of Superman at night.
 
If Not Much to Say, Say It Fast
''Sometimes we don't have much to say when we go on the air, but we still try to speak quickly,'' said Svetlana Sorokina, a converted forestry engineer who shares anchoring and reporting duties with Mr. Nevzorov and a third correspondent. ''Many people don't understand. It's not that we don't have enough time, it's just our style.''
The stance is ironic, aimed at challenging illusions and rousing indignation rather than exploring the nuances of issues.
While other programs recruited economists to explain the shortage of soap, ''600 Seconds'' covered the subject with a wry lament: the story of a woman whose prize possession was an elegant piece of soap carved in the shape of an orange, a gift from a former foreign minister. After treasuring the memento for 50 years, she was finally forced by the lingering shortage to break down and wash with it.
While other programs debate the risks of nuclear power, ''600 Seconds'' features a nightly radioactivity reading from regions around the city.
The program revels in forcing the public to face what it probably suspected, but preferred not to think about.
 
Strangers in the Urn
The latest ''600 Seconds'' sensation, for example, was a grisly report from a Leningrad crematory in which Mr. Nevzorov disclosed that the custodians of the dead loot the corpses of shoes and gold teeth before incineration, then mix the ashes in a heap. Leningraders were aghast to learn that the urn of Uncle Igor could hold anyone at all.
The central television censors have given extra leash to programs like the hip late-Friday-night show ''View,'' which mixes rock music videos with investigative journalism, parody and interviews, and its slightly more grown-up Saturday night cousin, ''Before and After Midnight.
This year, ''View'' scandalized many people by broadcasting the proposal of a Moscow theater director to remove the remains of Lenin from his glass case on Red Square and give him a decent burial. Some believe the show contributed to the ouster of the state television committee chairman.
Local television operates on a tighter budget, but sometimes with greater liberty. In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, leaders of the unofficial popular front, Sajudis, run their own unbridled weekly talk show. ''Good Evening, Moscow,'' the most popular entry in the capital's daily offerings, gave the city, among other things, informative campaign debates before the March elections.
Leningrad, which prides itself on a revolutionary history, is such a pioneer of innovative television that it is widely watched in the Baltic republics and western Russia, including Moscow, where there has been a run on the special antennas required for a clear Leningrad signal.
 
Politics, Literature, Religion
The Leningrad roster includes such standouts as ''Fifth Wheel,'' which features intellectual discussions of politics, literature or religion that sometimes meander on for three hours, and ''Public Opinion,'' which sponsors phone-in polls on hot local or national issues along with debates by the leading antagonists that go on all evening.
''600 Seconds'' is the opposite extreme of the languorous reflection that Mr. Nevzorov derides as ''pseudo-intellectual.'' This is television for the gut. Six days a week, ''600 Seconds'' is like a jolt from a cattle prod following the usually soporific evening news and propaganda program, ''Vremya'' (''Time'').
''They don't have time to think during the program, but they start thinking as soon as the program is over,'' said Mr. Nevzorov, who came to television after jobs singing in a church choir and trick-horseback-riding. ''They get 15 to 20 info-shocks, more or less powerful, and then they start thinking.''
One thing viewers of ''600 Seconds'' are invited to think about a lot is crime, especially brutal and senseless crime. The message of nightly stories about gangland killings, caches of illicit machine guns and child rape seems to be that the city is badly in need of more and tougher law enforcement, which may be why Mr. Nevzorov gets eager cooperation from the local police.
Sometimes a correspondent and cameraman burst into the cell of a suspect to demand he explain his offense on camera, a technique that American civil libertarians would find alarming.
''The most important thing here is not showing the criminal himself, but that the crime is discovered, that crimes are punished,'' said Kirill M. Shishkin, a producer, explaining the propoganda aim behind the tabloid approach.
So far, Mr. Shishkin insists, the program has never once run afoul of the censor. Indeed, because the program is assembled in a rush that lasts almost until air time, the censor does not see it beforehand.
''That's one thing about creating television at this pace,'' he said. ''The censor can't possibly keep up with us, and he just gives up.''

HEADLINE: City Opera Musicians Set Strike Vote for Tuesday

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
The union representing the orchestra of the New York City Opera has tendered a seven-day strike notice to the company. On Tuesday night the union musicians will vote either to accept management's offer or to walk out the following day. For that evening, the City Opera's schedule lists a performance of ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' at Lincoln Center.
The musicians, who are members of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, have been playing without a contract since a three-year agreement expired on May 30. Talks began earlier that month. 
The City Opera has also been negotiating with the American Guild of Musical Artists, whose five-year pact with the company expired on the same date. The guild represents soloists, chorus, dancers and stage directors.
A Local 802 spokesman said the impasse in current talks centers on issues of guaranteed work and salary levels. The old orchestra contract offered 23 weeks of employment during the season along with six weeks of additional employment or supplemental income equaling, according to a union officer, half of the base pay. The company's current offer, the union spokesman said, is 23 weeks of employment without either the extra six weeks' additional employment or the supplemental income.
 
Opposed to 'Give-Back'
''The orchestra musicians are dead set against any such give-back,'' John Palanchian, vice president of Local 802, said yesterday. Martin J. Oppenheimer, who is vice chairman of the City Opera board and its chief labor negotiator, said: ''We don't characterize our offer as a give-back. The City Opera wants to provide all the work it can, but it also has to make sure there is work. No major corporation can operate any other way and neither can we.''
Mr. Oppenheimer said yesterday that the company's current offer did not reflect any new or worsening financial crisis at the City Opera. ''The company is not unhealthy,'' he said, ''but the money given us by Lawrence Wien to help finance our spring musicals season will run out this year, and we simply don't know if we will have the extra work to offer musicians once this money is gone.'' Lawrence Wien gave the City Opera $5 million for five seasons of musicals. This is the last year of that gift.
The guild is to meet this afternoon to discuss Tuesday's move by the musicians and will also assess progress in its own talks. ''Money problems right down the line - for rehearsals, performances, everything - are our unresolved issues,'' Sanford Wolff, executive secretary of the Guild, said yesterday.
Both unions cite little movement in their negotiations thus far. Benefits, working conditions and other matters are also on the table, but union spokesmen feel these issues will be more easily resolved once the questions of money and guaranteed work are settled.
The guild said it was also concerned about plans to shorten next year's summer season so the Bolshoi Ballet could appear at the New York State Theater, the home of the City Opera, for two to three weeks beginning in July. The Bolshoi's engagement would be presented by Nederlander Productions, which is also co-producing next spring's City Opera production of ''The Sound of Music.''
 
'A One-Shot Thing'
Cutting into the City Opera's summer season would deprive guild members of work, Mr. Wolff said. Mr. Oppenheimer said that the City Opera musicians would be proposed as the Bolshoi's pit orchestra, and that he expected they would receive that work. He also defended the possible Bolshoi appearance, saying: ''This is not an attempt to shorten permanently the City Opera season. It is a one-shot thing.''
Mr. Wolff said the guild's negotiations had run ''parallel to the musicians' union's but not in tandem.'' He also said it was ''completely possible'' that the guild might follow the musicians' union out on strike, if one is voted next Tuesday.
The City Opera orchestra's base pay, under the old contract, was $755.25 a week, which did not include rehearsal time or special events -both paid at a rate of a little over $23 an hour. The orchestra is seeking income parity with orchestra players at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and San Francisco Opera, who, Mr. Palanchian said, are earning ''roughly 20 percent more for the same amount of work.''
Wednesday's scheduled ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' now jeopardized by the strike threat, is to be followed by performances of ''The Mikado,'' ''Die Zauberflote,'' ''Madama Butterfly'' and ''La Traviata.'' Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' a difficult 20th-century work originally scheduled to open next week, was canceled during the summer because of the many extra rehearsals it would have required and the uncertainty of the current labor negotiations.
The City Opera's fall season is scheduled to run until Nov. 19.

HEADLINE: Italian Bank's Unauthorized Credits to Iraq

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The chairman of Italy's largest state-owned bank came under strong pressure to resign today following disclosure that the bank's branch in Atlanta issued more than $1 billion in unauthorized export credits to Iraq.
With trading in the shares of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro already suspended, the bank chairman, Nerio Nesi, was to address an emergency board meeting Thursday to explain how the credit operations passed unnoticed for at least two years.
But Italian politicians and newspapers, denouncing a major financial scandal damaging to the country's banking industry, are demanding that Mr. Nesi, and his general manager, Giacomo Pedde, resign. 
An important part of the credits involve American grain exports that have been guaranteed by the United States Commodity Credit Corporation. The validity of these guarantees could be challenged, however, if fraud by B.N.L.'s Atlanta branch is proved. [In Washington, the Commodity Credit Corporation estimated that it had guaranteed some $700 million of loans to Iraq involving the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro but said that it had no knowledge that any of the transactions were illegitimate. The developments seemed to have little impact on Capitol Hill, where members were just returning from summer recess.] Representatives of the bank, which is better known by its initials, B.N.L.; the Bank of Italy, which is the country's central bank, and the Italian Justice Ministry flew to Atlanta to join investigators from the United States Federal Reserve Board in trying to determine exactly what was done by the branch representative, Christopher Drogoul.
''Let's be very clear,'' a spokesman at the Bank of Italy said. ''It is not a sum that is lost, but rather a sum that is exposed.'' It is too early to know whether B.N.L. will suffer any financial losses from the transactions, he and other officials said, but it is clear that the bank's internal controls were inadequate.
''Where it hurts very much is in our image,'' a spokesman for B.N.L. said. ''The bank has a received a nice slap in the face.'' 2,500 Letters of Credit So far, B.N.L. has said the Atlanta branch issued some 2,500 letters of credit for exports of grain and machinery to Iraq without approval of its North American headquarters in New York or of its main office in Rome. But the bank has declined to disclose the value of these credits.
Some Italian newspapers have speculated that they may have been worth more than $3 billion, but independent financial experts suggest that the figure may be closer to $1.5 billion. Mr. Nesi has strongly denied local reports that illegal arms shipments may have been included in the credits.
Nervousness over the case has been heightened by fears that with its economy shattered by its prolonged war with Iran, the Iraqi Government may be unable to meet its debt to B.N.L., although financial experts noted that Iraq had never defaulted on its trade credits.
 
Short-Term Borrowing Cited
The Bank of Italy spokesman said one worrisome aspect of the case was that the Atlanta branch borrowed short term from some American banks but provided longer-term credits to exporters. If the creditor banks demanded immediate repayment, he said, B.N.L. would find itself in a state of ''illiquidity, not instability or insolvency.''
Perhaps the greatest mystery, however, is how Mr. Drogoul was reportedly able to build what one B.N.L. executive described as ''a kind of parallel bank'' simply by adroit use of a personal computer and development of personal contacts in the United States, Europe and Iraq.
Mr. Nesi told an Italian newspaper that new computer technology ''has enormously increased the possibility of eluding normal control procedures.'' The bank said it would formally ask Italian judicial authorities to bring charges against Mr. Drogoul. It did not say what charges. The Federal Bureau of Investigation received a tip about reported irregularities at the bank's branch at Peach Tree Center in Atlanta in early August. The F.B.I. informed the Federal Reserve Board, which, in turn, invited the Italian authorities to join the investigation.
Mr. Drogoul, a United States citizen who has been employed by B.N.L. since 1981, was reported to be on vacation in France at the time, but he was sent a telex saying he was needed on urgent business and returned to Atlanta before news of the case became public. Information about his current whereabouts was not available here.
Speculation about a broader scandal increased yesterday when an Italian steelmaker, Danieli S.p.A., disclosed that it sought a $70 million credit from B.N.L.'s branch in Udine, Italy, to finance an export to Iraq four months ago. The credit was granted, without explanation, by the bank's Atlanta branch, the company said.
 
$700 Million Guaranteed
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 (Special to The New York Times) - The Commodity Credit Corporation estimated today that it had guaranteed some $700 million of loans to Iraq involving the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro but asserted that it had no knowledge that any of the transactions were illegitimate.
''There's been no evidence that there's been any violations,'' said Lawrence T. McElvain, director of the operations division of the agency, a unit of the Agriculture Department. He said the United States could void the guarantees if misrepresentation or other fraud were shown.
At the Federal Reserve, Robert Moore, a spokesman, would say only that the central bank was ''aware'' of the allegations against B.N.L.
The credit agency's exposure results from its role as facilitator of agricultural exports. It routinely guarantees that American companies sending grain and other materials abroad are paid. The $700 million mostly involves Iraq's Rafdin Bank; the American agency guarantees that Rafdin, on behalf of the importer, pays for the goods. If the American exporter does not receive payment, it looks to the agency.
The Italian bank entered the picture when agency guarantees, which are generally transferable, were assigned to it, Mr. McElvain said. This meant that if Bank Rafdin failed to pay, the agency's obligation would be to the Italian bank rather than the original creditor.
In all, the agency has an exposure of about $1.7 billion with Iraq, including the $700 million related to B.N.L.

HEADLINE: Approval Seen for Daimler On Messerschmitt Merger

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 6

 BODY:
West Germany's Economics Minister, Helmut Haussmann, will approve Daimler-Benz A.G.'s controversial takeover of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., overriding objections from antitrust authorities to create a gigantic aerospace and armaments group, Government sources said today.
The takeover, the brainchild of Mr. Haussmann's predecessor, would make Daimler-Benz one of the world's largest aerospace and armaments conglomerates, with annual sales of about 80 billion West German marks ($40.6 billion) - about a third the size of the General Motors Corporation. After the merger Daimler would have aerospace sales of $7.6 billion, putting it in a race with British Aerospace P.L.C. for European leadership in aerospace, but well behind United Technologies, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell International and a number of other American concerns in global rankings.
Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz's managing board chairman who guided the company's evolution from maker of Mercedes cars and trucks into a high-technology conglomerate, calls the takeover a step toward restructuring Europe's aerospace industry. Daimler-Benz is already looking at possible cooperative deals with companies that are rivals in the aerospace industry today, he said. 
The Government's long-awaited decision will be announced at a news conference Friday, Government sources said, adding that Mr. Haussmann informed senior members of his Free Democratic Party on Tuesday. Neither he nor the companies would comment today.
Mr. Haussmann's approval will overturn the Federal Cartel Office's April ban of the takeover. But it will require that Daimler-Benz and loss-plagued M.B.B. divest themselves of some of their marine and military holdings, the sources said, like M.B.B.'s 12.5 percent stake in Krauss-Maffei A.G., which makes West Germany's Leopard II tank.
Daimler-Benz will also have to assume responsibility for M.B.B.'s 37.9 percent stake in Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, earlier than the originally proposed date of 1999. Airbus has yet to produce a profit, and M.B.B., which does not release profit figures, is estimated to have lost well over 100 million marks in 1988, largely because of its participation in the consortium.
Under the original plan, the West German Government agreed to provide guarantees of more than $2 billion to cover Daimler's exposure to foreign exchange risk from the Airbus program until 1999. Aircraft are priced in United States dollars, which Daimler officials said leaves the company overly vulnerable to currency market fluctuations while it tries to restructure M.B.B. Government Aid to M.B.B. The Government also promised M.B.B. $2.75 billion over the next eight years to help introduce two wide-body jets: the twin-engine, medium-range A330 and the four-engine, long-range A340.
Daimler-Benz will take an initial 30 percent stake in M.B.B., which will eventually be increased to a majority holding. The West German state governments of Bavaria, Bremen and Hamburg currently own 52 percent of M.B.B. While no figures have been released, industry sources estimate Daimler-Benz will pay 1.7 billion marks ($862 million) for its initial share of M.B.B., the nation's leading aerospace concern, with 1988 sales of 7.1 billion marks ($3.5 billion).
Daimler-Benz is already West Germany's largest industrial concern, with earnings of 1.7 billion marks ($863 million) in 1988 on sales of 73.495 billion marks ($37.3 billion).
 
'The Elephant's Wedding'
The West German news media have dubbed the merger ''the elephant's wedding,'' and despite the public attacks that it would be monopolistic and militaristic, approval was no surprise. Martin Bangemann, Mr. Haussmann's predecessor as Economics Minster and also a leader in the liberal Free Democratic Party, had championed the idea of creating a West German aerospace concern capable of competing on a global scale.
Opponents included some Free Democratic leaders, the Social Democratic Party, the environmentalist Green Party, the association of medium-size companies, and critics of the big banks. Alfred Herrhausen, the head of Deutsche Bank A.G., West Germany's largest commercial bank, which owns 28.1 percent of Daimler-Benz's shares, is also supervisory board chairman of Daimler-Benz.
In a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Haussmann said that he ''took the justifiable concerns of the medium-size companies seriously'' but added that the deal was the only way to achieve a ''lasting and long-term reduction'' in federal subsidies for Airbus.

HEADLINE: Fed Dollar Sales Set 3-Month Record

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In its largest intervention ever in a three-month period, the Federal Reserve sold $11.9 billion worth of dollars, including $2 billion in two days, in its effort to curb the rise of the dollar in May, June and July.
This record dollar selling, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in its regular quarterly report yesterday, reflects the commitment of the United States, along with its economic allies, to try to stem the rise of the dollar as part of a policy aimed at dollar stability.
But the dollar is again above the levels at which the Fed and other central banks sold dollars in May, June and July, some traders noted, indicating that even aggressive and coordinated dollar selling can only be effective temporarily, at best. It takes coordinated changes in economic policy - like a change in interest rates - to give the intervention some lasting impact, they added. 
 
Previous Record $6.86 Billion
The previous three-month record intervention was $6.86 billion of dollar buying from November 1978 through January 1979 as part of the Carter Administration's dollar rescue plan. The previous largest dollar selling in a three-month period occurred in August through October 1985 after the United States and its economic allies agreed in New York on a policy to drive the dollar down.
The dollar yesterday was at 1.9753 marks and 146.10 yen in New York, down from Tuesday. But the dollar was above the 137 level against the yen and the 1.97 level against the mark when the Fed sold $2 billion in two days in May.
The report itself may give some added support to the dollar now. This is because there has not yet been a repeat of the intervention of May and June. The dollar selling on Tuesday was seen by traders as only the first major assault of this rally. Many traders may interpret this lack of intervention as an acceptance of the higher level of the dollar unless large dollar selling begins again soon.
 
Interest Rates Cited
James T. McGroarty, a former senior trader at the Fed and now a senior vice president at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn., said the dollar would move higher now, despite heavy intervention, unless the Fed again pushed United States interest rates lower or the Europeans and Japanese raised their rates.
''I would say that intervention is only a short-run tool, a bridge to slow things down,'' he said.
At the beginning of May, the dollar was around 1.88 marks and 133 yen. It rose sharply that month, piercing the important 1.90-mark and 140-yen levels, then rose above 2 marks, to 2.0150, and to 142.85 yen. It then fell before rising again in June, when it reached its highs of 2.0470 marks and 151.90 yen on June 15. Another fall pushed it below 1.90 marks and 140 yen again. Except for a few blips, it stayed below these levels in July, ending at 1.8648 marks and 136.90 yen. But it began to rise again in August. The largest dollar selling came as the dollar neared the 2-mark level before May 22. On May 18 and 19, the Fed sold $2 billion and between May 12 and May 31, the intervention totaled $5.785 billion, $3 billion against the mark and $2.785 billion against the yen.
The other major dollar selling came as the dollar rose again in June and then after it fell, as the Fed tried to reinforce the view in the market that ''monetary authorities were firmly committed to resisting the dollar's rise and maintaining exchange rate stability,'' the report said.
 
Flight to the Dollar
In this period, from June 6 to June 30, the Fed sold $4.952 billion, $3.8225 billion against the yen and $1.1295 billion against the mark. The much larger sales against the yen reflected the fact that the dollar was much stronger against the yen than the mark because of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in China. That caused a flight to the dollar, and the continuing political turmoil in Japan.
The Fed's report notes that it was the cumulative impact of the dollar selling and important economic changes that weakened the dollar. These changes included higher interest rates in Europe and Japan, the expectation, especially in July, that the Fed would lower interest rates to counter a slowing economy and a better outlook for inflation.
But when asked whether the economic policy changes or intervention had more impact, Sam Y. Cross, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said, ''All these factors were working toward that, and it is difficult to parcel out portions of that.''
It has been the switch in the expectations for Fed interest rate policy that has helped push the dollar higher again. With new and revised economic statistics showing the economy stronger than thought a month ago, the Fed is not expected to lower interest rates further for now.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 24.89 Points on Rate Concerns

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Stock prices fell broadly yesterday amid investor fears of rising interest rates and speculation that foreign central banks might slow the dollar's rise, analysts said.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.89, to 2,719.79, as declining issues led advances, 1,091 to 433. Volume on the big board remained moderate at 161.8 million shares.
Analysts said investors feared that the Federal Reserve would not relax its credit policy further soon, given the stronger-than-expected economy. 
''It's a market that's been up an awful lot in a short period of time, and this is a short break,'' said Steven Einhorn, chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs. ''Also, recent data suggest that the economy is not overly weak and any easing by the Federal Reserve will not be immediate but gradual. The market expected that a weaker economy would deliver lower short-term interest rates and yields on bonds, but the recent data hasn't indicated that.''
The dollar lost ground yesterday. The rising dollar has attracted foreign investment in the hopes that stock prices in the United States would also rise but it may have risen too far, some analysts said. There is some concern that European and Japanese governments might move to slow the dollar's advance.
 
Fundamentals Are Positive
''The market has been up for nine weeks in a row,'' said Byron Wein, chief equities strategist at Morgan Stanley. ''It's had a very good run and it's reasonable for it to make a correction, and that's what we're having. This is less than a 1 percent correction, and the market is always vulnerable to that. The fundamentals are still positive.''
Among the blue chips that slipped, Merck fell 1, to 72 1/4; CBS dropped 2 3/8, to 212 1/2, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing lost 2 to close at 76.
Oil stocks also declined. Texaco, the most actively traded big board issue, with over six million shares changing hands, fell 1/4, to 50 5/8. Some investors apparently sought a special dividend the company has announced.
Technology issues lost some of their gains from Tuesday, with A.T.&T. dropping 3/4, to 39 1/8. I.B.M. fell 1, to 116 3/4.
Litton Industries rose 2, to 96 3/4, on continued speculation that Teledyne may sell its 28.7 percent stake in Litton, analysts said. Teledyne is trying to spin off its insurance and finance subsidiaries in a move analysts believe could lead to a further restructuring of the company. Teledyne fell 3/4 to close at 371 1/4.
The Dow transportation average lost much of its gains of the last few sessions, dropping 23.30 points to close at 1,508.71. The decline largely reflected losses in airline issues. UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell 3 7/8, to 286 7/8.
The AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, declined 3 1/4, to 87, while Delta Air Lines dropped 1 7/8, to 79 1/2.
 
Broader Market Measures
Broader market indexes generally declined yesterday. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.66 points, to 194.18. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 3.32, closing at 349.24.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber jumped 4 1/8, to 57 5/8, in active trading on rumors that the Italian tire maker Pirelli S.p.A. may make a bid.
SPX rose 1 1/4, to 33 3/4, after the company announced that it had gotten approval for its air-conditioning refrigerant recovery and recycling system.
Shares of Georgia Gulf rose 1 1/8, to 59 5/8, as analysts continued to expect that higher offers would emerge for the chemical concern, which is being sought by a group led by the investor Harold Simmons, traders said.

HEADLINE: Revised Data on Output Up a Bit in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
American workers posted a modest productivity improvement in the second quarter, with significant gains by factory workers leading the way.
In a revised report, the Labor Department said today that nonfarm productivity increased at an annual rate of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the April-to-June period, up from the two-tenths of 1 percent gain reported in preliminary data last month and higher than the 1.3 percent decline in the first quarter.
The department said unit labor costs increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the second quarter, down from the 6.2 percent jump reported for the first quarter. It said the smaller increase still indicated persistent underlying inflation. 
Analysts said the small productivity gain was consistent with the recent slowing of the economy. But they added that poor performance in the nonfinancial corporate sector, which includes most service industries, suggested that inflation was still around. Productivity fell in the service industries group, while labor costs rose at an 11.1 percent annual rate.
The second-quarter productivity improvement came as output grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent and hours worked expanded by 1.7 percent.
Workers in manufacturing posted a productivity gain of 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, up from the 2.4 percent increase reported in the preliminary data.
The Labor Department said hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the quarter, but consumer inflation continued to erase the wage gains. Hourly compensation adjusted for inflation fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, the department said.
The preliminary data had put the hourly compensation increase at an annual rate of 5.5 percent and the decline in real wages at nine-tenths of 1 percent. In the first quarter, hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent and real wages declined six-tenths of 1 percent.
The 2.9 percent annual-rate productivity gain in manufacturing in the second quarter followed a 2.1 percent gain in the January-to-March period. Unit labor costs in manufacturing fell at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent after increasing at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Fall for 3d Day On Easing of Labor Tension

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices tumbled yesterday, the third straight day of losses on New York's Commodity Exchange, on perceptions that labor tensions are easing in countries where strikes by miners have disrupted production.
On other markets, energy futures rose after an oil refinery explosion in California, meat futures rallied on renewed hopes that pork bellies will be shipped to Poland and corn futures gained on dimming crop prospects.
Copper futures settled 2.55 cents to 3.90 cents lower, with the contract for September delivery at $1.2575 a pound, a two-week low. 
 
Strikes in Peru and Canada
Copper futures had traded above $1.36 a pound as recently as Aug. 25 on supply fears prompted by strikes in Peru and Canada and mine shutdowns in Mexico and Papua New Guinea.
Since then, the Peruvian strike has ended, a strike has begun in Chile, and the Bouganville mine in Papua New Guinea reopened only to be closed a day later. The closing came after a resurgence of landowner-led violence, which had prompted the original shutdown in July.
Over all, the market perceives less of a threat to copper supplies than it did two weeks ago, analysts said.
''The worst seems to be over, at least for the short term, so the market's undergoing a healthy correction,'' said William O'Neill, research director with Elders Futures Inc.
 
'A Kind of Grinding Progress'
The easing of supply worries is based partly on settlement of the Peruvian strike and on signs that talks aimed at ending the two-month-old Highland Valley strike in British Columbia and the six-day-old strike at the Chilean Copper Company's El Salvador mine are making ''a kind of grinding progress,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
Further selling was prompted by the Southern Peru Copper Company's statement yesterday that it would not have to cancel any shipments as a result of the 16-day nationwide copper miners' strike, which ended recently.
Despite its pullback, the copper market is likely to remain sensitive to supply fears, said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal & Company in New York.
''On the next major report of production problems, the market will begin to rally,'' he said. ''The only way I see copper prices really coming in is if we have signs of a recession, and I really don't see that right now.''
Precious-metals futures advanced on the Comex, largely in response to the weaker dollar.
 
Gold $2 to $3 Higher
Gold settled $2 to $3 higher, with October at $363.70 an ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.7 cents higher, with September at $5.103 an ounce.
Energy futures prices climbed on the New York Mercantile Exchange after reports of an explosion on Tuesday that shut down a Shell Oil Company refinery near San Francisco.
Corn and soybean futures prices rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations that the Agriculture Department will reduce its harvest estimates for those commodities in a crop report due out next week.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Amid Fears Of Overseas Rate Increases

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against major foreign currencies yesterday amid concerns of higher interest rates overseas.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $361.60 an ounce, up $2 from Tuesday. 
Currency traders attributed the dollar's retreat largely to speculation that West Germany and Japan might raise their interest rates to thwart the dollar's recent strength. In addition, the traders said, investors sold dollars to take profits. The dollar was also depressed by reported continued intervention by the Bank of Japan.
But Earl I. Johnson, a trader for Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said overall sentiment toward the dollar remained bullish. ''We're just seeing a technical retrenchment,'' he said.
Mr. Johnson predicted that West Germany and Japan would keep their interest rates stable, paving the way for further increases in the dollar later this week.
In New York, the dollar fell to 146.10 yen, from 146.75 yen Tuesday. And sterling fetched $1.5525 in New York, up from $1.5385.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.97525 West German marks, down from 1.9875; 1.7048 Swiss francs, down from 1.7150; 6.6550 French francs, down from 6.7000; 1.18015 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18065, and 1,417.875 Italian lire, down from 1,424.50.
Silver prices gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.103 an ounce, up from $5.063 Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Senate Adopts Sweeping Measure To Protect Rights of the Disabled

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Senate approved sweeping legislation tonight that would prohibit discrimination against disabled Americans, including AIDS victims, in employment, access to public accommodations, transportation and communication services.
The measure passed on a 76-to-8 vote with all the opposition coming from conservative Republicans. The House version of the bill is expected to win passage within the next few months and President Bush is expected to sign the resulting legislation.
The bill is the product of months of negotiation by the Bush Administration, the business community and groups representing the disabled. 
 
Enormous Costs Cited
Business and trade organizations have raised concerns about the legislation's enormous potential costs and the possibility of legal tangles, but they have generally lined up to support it. Most politicians, reluctant to be seen as being opposed to the needs of the disabled, have done the same.
Under the legislation, disablility is broadly defined as ''a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual.'' To assist such activities, both private employers and public agencies might be required to install ramps, elevators and other special equipment in buildings or vehicles, as well as add things like hearing devices to telephone equipment.
 
Dispute Over Who Is Included
In addition to covering people with commonly recognized disabilities like paralysis, blindness or hearing loss, the bill's definition includes people who, while not technically disabled, may have disfigurements or characteristics that cause them to face discrimination or barriers because others perceive them as impaired - for example, somebody with severe scars from old burns.
The bill also covers people already ill with AIDS as well as those infected with its virus.
Because the definitions are so broad, sponsors have estimated the bill could affect some 43 million people, or one out of every six Americans.
The bill's backers described it as a long overdue effort to extend civil rights to a segment of society not previously covered.
''For too long individuals with disabilities have been excluded, segregated and otherwise denied equal, effective and meaningful opportunity to participate in the economic and social mainstream of American life,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who is the chief sponsor of the mesaure. ''It is time we eliminated these injustices.''
 
Debate in Sign Language
Underscoring that point, the entire debate on the legislation, known as the Americans With Disabilities Act, was simultaneously conveyed to hearing-impaired televison viewers by a sign-language interpreter who stood on the Senate floor.
The bill's sweeping definitions prompted a string of objections from Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who demanded to know whether people found to be pedophiles, schizophrenics or kleptomaniacs would be protected against discrimination. ''This is going to be a lawyer's paradise,'' Mr. Helms said.
To placate him and other conservatives who shared the concerns, Senate sponsors reluctantly agreed to an amendment by Senator William Armsmtrong, Republican of Colorado, that excluded the disorders cited by Mr. Helms as well as several other behavior traits, including homosexuality.
On the final vote, the eight Republican Senators who were against the measure were Mr. Armstrong, Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, Jake Garn of Utah, Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, James A. McClure of Idaho, Steve Symms of Idaho and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming.
The legislation would prohibit employers, employment agencies and labor organizations from discriminating against any qualified person with a disability and would require employers to provide ''reasonable accommodations'' for the disabled in work places unless doing so would result in ''undue hardship'' on the business.
These requirements would take effect two years after enactment of the law and would initially apply only to employers with 25 or more employees. After four years, employers with 15 or more workers would be covered.
 
Transportation Provisions
State and local governments would have to assure that buses, subways, rail systems and terminals were accessible to disabled people, and in some cases provide supplementary transportation.
The section of the bill that aroused the most dispute was one that would assure access to public accommodations, including restaurants, hotels, medical and business offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, shipping centers and other privately owned establishments. Newly constructed buildings and those undergoing major renovation would have to be ''readily accessible to and usable by'' people with disabilities. Existing buildings would have to be made accessible to the disabled if the necessary modifications were ''readily achievable,'' a term that sponsors defined as ''easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense.''
Senators representing the concerns of small businesses spent hours attempting to fashion a more precise definition of that standard and an indication of who would decide whether it had been met.
The bill had personal significance for three Senators who had central roles in its drafting and passage. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, has a son who lost a leg to cancer and a sister who is mentally retarded. Senator Harkin has a deaf brother. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, lost the use of his right arm in a World War II injury.

HEADLINE: Pretoria Leader Sees Mandate For Change in Racial System

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Acting President F. W. de Klerk said today that parliamentary elections on Wednesday gave his National Party a ''clear and resounding'' mandate to push ahead with its plan for evolutionary change of the constitutional system of racial segregation.
Although the National Party received its worst battering in 41 years from the right and left, Mr. de Klerk noted that nearly three-quarters of the nation's white voters had endorsed change in the nation's racial system. That was the proportion of voters who supported his party and the new, liberal Democratic Party, which called for searching for a formula to negotiate the future with the nation's black majority.
His remark was an allusion to the surprising number of seats won by the Democratic Party, which made inroads among whites who had formerly voted for the National Party. 
Mr. de Klerk insisted that his party's loss of seats would not impede its promise to show ''real progress'' over the next five years toward a democratic society free from domination by either the country's white minority or its black majority.
 
Tutu Says 23 Killed in Protest
The National Party's so-called Plan of Action, announced in June, was a key part of its campaign platform, though many liberals found it too vague and many conservatives found it too threatening to white interests.
In Washington, the State Department called on Pretoria to end the state of emergency it imposed in 1986, legalize the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups and free all political prisoners, including Nelson R. Mandela and Walter Sisulu, the African National Congress leaders. [Page A8.] The continuing exclusion of blacks in the parliamentary elections prompted widespread protests ranging from non-violent boycotts to violent clashes with the police. Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the Anglican primate of southern Africa, told a news conference in Cape Town today that the police killed at least 23 people in protests on Wednesday night.
Tonight, the police challenged the Archbishop to prove the allegations, and promised that ''such evidence will be thoroughly investigated.''
 
No Coalition With Liberals Seen
At a dawn news conference in Pretoria, Mr. de Klerk made it clear that the National Party did not intend to seek a coalition with the Democrats, who have pressed for an even faster and more total repudiation of apartheid. The Conservative Party remained the official opposition in Parliament.
Final results showed that the National Party held onto 93 seats, a sharp drop from its 123 seats in the last election; 84 seats are required for a majority in Parliament. The Conservative Party won 39 seats, a gain from 22. The Democrats won 33 seats, while liberal or moderate parties had 21 in the last election. Both the Conservatives and the Democrats made their gains at the expense of the Nationalists.
One race in Fauresmith, a rural constituency in the Orange Free State, ended in a tie and will be run again between Nationalist and Conservative candidates who polled 4,519 votes each.
For the first time in several decades, the National Party, which has held power since 1948, failed to attract a national majority of white voters. The Nationalists won about 47 percent of the votes cast, the Conservatives 28 percent and the Democrats 25 percent, according to one estimate.
 
'We Will Move Forward'
Some political scientists here said they considered the elections a watershed in the country's white politics because they had moved South Africa past the point of no return in ridding itself of apartheid.
''We will move forward with confidence and with strength,'' Mr. de Klerk said. He said the National Party's poor showing did not worry him, and promised that the mandate for change given by the voters would be carried through ''to its logical consequences.''
It is expected that Mr. de Klerk will be formally sworn in as President next Thursday, a day after the new Parliament convenes. He has been acting in this capacity since the abrupt resignation of P. W. Botha on Aug. 14. Mr. de Klerk implied today that he would subsequently speak about his plans for negotiating with blacks. The smaller mixed-race House of Representatives and ethnic Indian House of Delegates had voter turnouts running barely a half to a third of those for the white House of Assembly, largely because anti-apartheid groups had called for an election boycott. The voting was lowest in mixed-race townships near Cape Town where violence broke out. In Mitchell's Plain, a mixed-race community, less than 2 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots, and in Manenberg the turnout was well below 6 percent. Even with these meager showings, the Labor Party overwhelmingly maintained control of the House of Representatives and the Solidarity Party led in the House of Delegates.
 
Allegations of Police Brutality
Archbishop Tutu and the Reverend Allan Boesak, another prominent clergyman, accused the riot police today of indiscriminate shooting and unwarranted brutality in suppressing demonstrations against the elections.
A report from Cape Province said that at least 25 people, all black or of mixed race, were killed in clashes Wednesday night between the police and protesters. The death toll would be the worst in a single day since the height of unrest in 1985. Dozens of others were reported treated for injuries, among them a year-old infant hit with police birdshot.
A police spokesman, Brigadier Leon Mellet, said 12 people had been killed in the unrest, 7 of them in fighting between rival factions in Khayelitsha, a black township outside Cape Town. A Western television cameraman who tried to film clashes in Mitchell's Plain said the toll could go as high as 40.
 
Conservatives Cite Gains
The Conservative Party was widely perceived as a loser in the election because expectations of Conservative gains had been substantially greater. The Conservative Party leader, Andries Treurnicht, admitted at a news conference in Pretoria that he had hoped for more seats but said he was content with the 17 additional seats won. He also pointed out that the Conservatives had broken out of the Transvaal, where their 22 seats in the last Parliament were, gaining two seats in Cape Province and six in Orange Free State.
The Democratic Party essentially took back the seats that its predecessor, the Progressive Federal Party, had lost in the 1987 election. It now controls eight populous constituencies in the Johannesburg area, and made new gains in Natal and Cape Province.
As a result of the election, in which some Afrikaners defected to the Democrats and far more supported the Conservatives, Pieter de Langer, the head of the Broederbond, the Afrikaner brotherhood, said that Afrikaners, who for 40 years had overwhelmingly supported the National Party, could no longer be seen as a monolithic electoral bloc.
The National Party managed to beat back Conservative challenges in key Transvaal constituencies in Krugersdorp and Potchefstroom, although by margins of less than 3 percent.
Dissatisfaction with the economy, which is suffering slow growth, mounting inflation and high taxes, was considered a common denominator in Nationalist defections to both the Conservatives and the Democrats. Beyond this, the Democrats want faster progress toward a non-racial, post-apartheid nation, while the Conservatives oppose any further erosion of racial segregation.

HEADLINE: Science Academy Recommends Resumption of Natural Farming

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The National Academy of Sciences has found that farmers who apply little or no chemicals to crops can be as productive as those who use pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, and today it recommended changing Federal subsidy programs that encourage overuse of agricultural chemicals.
In a study, the Academy's Board on Agriculture said it was seeking to reverse Federal policies that for more than four decades have been focused on increasing the productivity of crop and livestock farms principally through heavy use of pesticides, drugs and synthetic fertilizers. The staff of the Board on Agriculture, led by Dr. Charles M. Benbrook, the executive director, in the past has advocated farm practices that rely less on chemicals.
The report's authors said Congress and the Department of Agriculture should change farm policies that have discouraged farmers, particularly those who grow crops subsidized by the Government, from trying natural techniques. The reason, it said, is that the subsidy program, with its unnatural economic forces, caused farmers to reject practices that were less destructive to the environment. 
 
Subsidies and Overproduction
In the Federal corn program, for instance, farmers are paid a subsidy of roughly $1 for every bushel they can produce; the incentive is to produce the most bushels possible. Since the end of World War II, farmers have been taught by agricultural universities and the Department of Agriculture that the best way to increase output is to use ample amounts of chemical fertilizer and then protect the harvest with generous applications of pesticides.
If farm subsidies were reduced, researchers say, it is likely that farmers would no longer produce surpluses marketable only to the Government, and would be encouraged to try natural farming techniques. That would bring supply in line with demand, raising prices and making up for the subsidies. The effect on consumer food prices is not expected to be dramatic because the cost of grain is a small fraction of overall food costs.
This year, farm subsidies cost the Government $13.9 billion.
 
An Important Confirmation
The study by the nation's pre-eminent body of scientists is perhaps the most important confirmation of the success of agricultural practices that use biological interactions instead of chemicals. Such farming methods have been developed by farmers over the last two decades almost entirely outside the Department of Agriculture, agricultural universities and other institutions in American farming.
Until very recently, farming methods shunning chemicals have been viewed by many farmers and farm policy leaders as unorthodox and incapable of generating harvests that match those produced with chemicals.
The study, paid for by the Department of Agriculture, the Kellogg Foundation and four other groups, comes at the start of debate in Congress over a new farm policy law and amid nationwide concern about the toll industrialized farm practices have taken on the environment, on public confidence in the safety of the food supply and on the Treasury.
''Well-managed alternative farms use less synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotics without necessarily decreasing, and, in some cases, increasing per-acre crop yields and the productivity of livestock systems,'' said the committee in the report, ''Alternative Agriculture.''
 
Enthusiasm in Washington
''Wider adoption of proven alternative systems would result in ever greater economic benefits to farmers and environmental gains for the nation,'' it said.
The Department of Agriculture, which was suspicious of natural farm practices during the 1980's, greeted the study enthusiastically, saying the ''time was right'' to consider changes in the direction of American agriculture.
 
But Some Are Skeptical
Several groups, however, were critical of the academy's conclusions. ''There seems to be little science involved in this whole area,'' said Thomas E. Waldinger, a spokesman for the Fertilizer Institute, the Washington-based industry association for the $8 billion United States fertilizer industry. ''The farms that the academy selected to study were already determined to be successful in deploying alternative agriculture practices. It's like saying they're not going to pay attention to those who have tried it and failed.''
The Board on Agriculture said natural farm practices are not a single method of farming, but rather a spectrum of farming techniques that have the common goals of reducing costs, preserving the environment and protecting human health by sharply lowering or eliminating toxic farm chemicals and animal drugs.
Among the practices cited as successful by the report's authors are careful rotations of crops to battle weeds, diseases and insects, and to provide nutrients naturally. Another is the production of a number of crops and livestock in combination. A diverse crop and livestock system, the report said, enables farmers to protect themselves from cyclical swings in prices.
The report said natural practices frequently take more work than chemical practices, and the report's authors expressed concern about the number of people with the necessary skills. #14 Farms Were Studied In its study, which was begun in 1984, the Board on Agriculture closely examines 14 farms in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pennsylvania, California, Florida and Colorado which have developed successful natural production methods.
It is not known how many American farmers practice natural techniques, but it is thought that at least five percent of the nation's 2.1 million farmers have adopted such techniques.
A 720-acre dairy, cattle and grain farm in Knox County, Ohio, managed by Rex and Glen Spray achieved yields of corn that were 32 percent higher and yields of soybeans 40 percent higher than the county average without using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for more than 15 years, the study said. The Spray brothers controlled weeds by rotating corn, soybeans, small grains and red clover and uprooting weeds. They use manure from their herds instead of synthetic fertilizers.
In addition to the problems of overproduction, the environmental costs of using large amounts of chemicals have become more apparent in the 1980's, the study said. Weeds and insects develop genetic resistance to farm chemicals, often forcing farmers to use ever greater amounts to achieve the same effect. Chemicals can also degrade soil, causing farmers to need ever-larger amounts of fertilizer. Meanwhile, chemicals are leaching into streams, rivers and underground supplies of water across the country, and are showing up with greater frequency in the nation's food supply.
 
Breaking the Cycle
The Board on Agriculture said it hoped to break the cycle of overproduction and pollution by changing the farm programs.
For instance, it said, farmers should rotate their crops. But the current farm program discourages rotation, because subsidies depend on the harvest a farmer gains from a set amount of land, or base acreage. The Department of Agriculture calculates the base acreage as the average acreage a farmer devotes to a single crop over five years. Thus, if a farmer who has a base acreage in corn of 100 acres decides to rotate another crop into that acreage one year, the Department of Agriculture considers the base acreage reduced and reduces its subsidy.
The board also said farmers are not encouraged to plant on fallow ground crops beneficial to their soil.

In Denmark, a Bridge Troubles Europe's Waters

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, Sept. 3

 BODY:
For nearly a century, Danes have dreamed of building bridges to leap over the Baltic straits and connect Denmark's eastern islands with its western mainland.
Now, just as it is starting to become a reality, the last link - 8.3 miles of bridge and tunnel across the Great Belt - threatens to turn into the kind of struggle that critics of closer European political and economic integration have always warned was coming unless the European Community's powerful bureaucracy in Brussels was held in check.
Last month, the Community took Denmark to the European Court of Justice, asking it to declare the $382 million contract for the four-mile-long western viaduct section of the $2.4 billion project null and void.
In violation of a 1957 treaty guaranteeing nondiscrimination among Community members, the Community charged, the contract specified that Danish labor and materials had to be used ''to the greatest possible extent.'' 
 
A Test of a Commitment
On Aug. 29, the court, in Luxembourg, announced that it would hear oral arguments on Sept. 22.
The suit is widely regarded as a test of how seriously all 12 European Community countries take their solemn commitment to a true common market by the end of 1992, when cherished national customs, like making sure that big government contracts stay in the hands of local bidders, are supposed to be forsworn forever.
But since the Danish Government has already conceded making a blunder in including the clause in the contract, the affair is also turning into a scandal of shady deals, incompetence and coverups.
The way many Danes see it, the big European Commission chose its test carefully, picking on poor little Denmark instead of investigating why, for example, West Germany just always seems to select a local company like Siemens to win contracts for its national telephone system, or why Fiat always seems to win the big military contracts in Italy.
 
Issue Cuts Two Ways
''We have always been a nation of 'to be or not to be,' starting with Hamlet, and we've always said 'maybe' we'll be a full member of the Common Market,'' said Erik Rasmussen, the head of a research organization here called the Forum for Industrial Development.
''Is the E.C. the deregulated, dynamic market we've been longing for, or is it a risk that it's just a big bureaucratic organization?'' he asked.
The issue of open bidding for government contracts cuts two ways. Britain, with companies both in the consortium that won the bridge contract and in the losing one that first blew the whistle on its discriminatory clauses, is also calling for prohibition of discriminatory provisions.
Western Europe's highways and bridges, like those in the United States, are growing old, and European contractors do not want to be frozen out of the bidding in every country except the one where they happen to be based.
 
'Practice Is Common'
''The practice is quite common,'' said Poul Andreassen, chairman of Great Belt A.S., the Danish state authority that awarded the contract.
''We know that if we had said 'local' instead of 'Danish' materials and labor, it would have been all right,'' he said. ''The Government has agreed that it was wrong. Personally, I don't think it was a mistake. But politically, it could have been done differently.''
After the European Commission got into the act, the minority Government led by Prime Minister Poul Schluter tried to avoid a crisis by removing the offending clause before the contract was awarded.
Mr. Schluter has said that whatever the European Court decides, the bridge will be built anyway. Stopping work immediately, as the European Commission wants, and starting the contracting process over again would cost about $200 million and a delay of one and one half years, Mr. Andreassen said, adding, ''It's not possible.''
 
Questioned by Low Bidder
Jacob Vestergaard, spokesman for the contracting authority, said it paid the winning consortium, European Storebaelt Group, $40 million at the end of July. A separate $400 million contract for the eastern part of the project - a four-lane highway bridge and a double-track rail tunnel - was signed without controversy, but with a buy-Danish clause, last November.
The scandal broke after the low bidder, Western Bridge Joint Venture, dominated by the Bouygues Group of France, asked a Danish lawyer, C. Kaare Pedersen, if the Government had met Danish regulations.
European Storebaelt Group's bid was $62.5 million higher than Western Bridge Joint Venture's, according to figures supplied by the contracting authority. The consortium consists of three Danish contractors, Hoejgaard & Schultz A.S., C. G. Jensen A.S. and Per Aarsleff A.S.; Ballast Nedam Group of Holland, Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd. of Britain and Losinger Ltd. of Switzerland.
Mr. Pedersen told the Bouygues Group that he thought the Danish Government had violated its own contracting rules. Bouyges's suspicions were also raised by the fact that the contracting authority's technical director seemed particularly eager to have Hoejgaard & Schultz join their group if they won the contract, Mr. Pedersen said. Hoejgaard & Schultz was not part of European Storebaelt when it bid last November, according to documents supplied by the contracting authority, but it is now.
 
Commission Put on Notice
''I suggested we make a similar investigation regarding E.C. rules,'' Mr. Pedersen said. The 1957 Treaty of Rome commits the European Community Governments to provide a level playing field for all comers, a commitment strengthened in the Single European Act that will take full effect at the end of 1992.
Thus alerted, the executive commission put the Danish Government on notice. It later took the view that the Government's attempt to sidestep the problem by taking out the discriminatory clause before awarding the contract to European Storebaelt Group was unfair to all four of the other final bidders, who should have had a chance to revise their bids, and it questioned whether the winning bid was still valid.
Later this month, Denmark and Sweden will begin preliminary Community discussions about a bridge between them. ''The European Commission could win the war but lose the peace,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. ''This will certainly be a bridge over troubled waters.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Pretoria to Act Quickly to Negotiate End to Apartheid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The United States said today that the white rulers of South Africa won a ''mandate for real change'' in elections Wednesday and that they should quickly begin negotiations with blacks to end apartheid.
The Bush Administration used the occasion of the elections to make its fullest, most comprehensive statement of policy toward South Africa. In recent weeks, Congressional Democrats and TransAfrica, the black American lobby, have harshly criticized the Administration for not speaking out more forcefully on South Africa.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, congratulated F. W. de Klerk, the acting President of South Africa, on his electoral victory. She said he had won a ''mandate for real change in South Africa.'' But, she said, ''Promises of reform must be followed by concrete, specific action.'' 
 
U.S. to Work With All Parties
''We are committed to working with all parties to bring the South African Government and black South Africans together in a substantial effort to end apartheid,'' Miss Tutwiler said. ''We, therefore, are prepared to work with the new Government toward this end.''
At another point, she said, ''We are committed to supporting negotiations to peacefully bring about a nonracial, democratic South Africa.'' But she declined to specify what, if anything, the United States would do to promote such negotiations.
In an unusually detailed prescription for South Africa, Miss Tutwiler listed steps that she said were necessary to permit talks between black and white South Africans:
* The Pretoria Government must release all political prisoners, including Nelson R. Mandela and Walter Sisulu, leaders of the African National Congress who have been imprisoned since the early 1960's, and must let all ''political exiles'' return to South Africa.
* The Government must lift the national state of emergency imposed in 1986 in response to a wave of anti-apartheid protests. It should also repeal emergency rules that restrict political activity and freedom of association for blacks.
* The Government should end its ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups.
* There must be ''an end to violence from all sources.''
 
'The Clock Is Ticking'
The South African Ambassador, Piet G. J. Koornhof, received a similar message when he visited the State Department today for a meeting with the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, Administration officials reported.
Representative Howard Wolpe, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, predicted that Congress would increase pressure for political changes in South Africa after the victory by Mr. de Klerk and his National Party.
''The clock is ticking,'' Mr. Wolpe said. ''We will be closely watching President de Klerk in the early policy-making months of his administration. I am confident that Congress will demand additional economic sanctions against South Africa if de Klerk does not take steps to dismantle apartheid by early 1990.''
The current sanctions against South Africa were adopted by Congress in 1986 over President Reagan's veto. They include a ban on the import and export of certain products and a prohibition on new lending and investment. The Bush Administration contends that the existing sanctions have been effective, but that further sanctions now would be self-defeating.
But Randall Robinson, the executive director of TransAfrica, whose lobbying has influenced many members of Congress, said, ''No South African Government led by de Klerk or anyone else will be moved to change without the application of greater economic pressure.''
 
Sharpest Setback for Party
Mr. de Klerk's party retained power, but suffered substantial losses to conservative and liberal challengers in voting for the white House of Parliament. The results were the sharpest setback for the party since it came to power in 1948.
Miss Tutwiler said the United States did not consider the elections to be free and fair because South Africa's black majority had been excluded. But she said that the United States was not challenging the legitimacy of the elections, and that there should be no comparison to Panama, where the United States refused to recognize the Government formed last week by supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Sales Still Weak Despite Rate Drop

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
A year after beginning their search, Kevin and Carol Bohan of Elmhurst, Queens, are finally buying their first house. But unlike the Bohans many potential home buyers in the Northeast are not taking advantage of a sharp drop in mortgage rates.
The Bohans did not buy at first because ''the payments on the mortgage would have meant buying a smaller house than we wanted and one that was farther out in the suburbs than we wanted to live,'' Mr. Bohan said.
Largely because of the sharp decline in mortgage rates since last fall, they are buying a three-bedroom Cape Cod-style house in Emerson, N.J., for $176,000. They are getting a 30-year fixed mortgage at a rate of 9.25 percent, and will be able to live closer to Manhattan. 
But the drop in fixed interest rates of more than a percentage point from May to August has not led to a big pickup in housing sales in either the New York metropolitan area or the Northeast, and real estate experts and banking executives profess to be mystified about it.
William J. Foley, vice president of the New York League of Savings Institutions in Scarsdale, said: ''We have been seeing something very strange happen in the last few months. 'For sale' signs are up all over the state, brokers are saying 'things are slow,' yet mortgage activity has increased.''
Mr. Foley said he believed that refinancing of old mortgages to take advantage of lower rates was the primary cause of the rise in mortgage writing. Working against a further increase and more sales, he said, are three other factors: an increase in the amount lenders require for a down payment; the resistance of sellers to dramatic drops in home prices, which causes many potential buyers to delay decisions, ''and a hesitancy on the part of some lenders to go full throttle in pushing lower-interest mortgages because of concerns about the economy.''
Mark Morano, director of research for the New York State Association of Realtors in Albany, said reports from county associations had found ''a large inventory of homes on the market across the state.'' He also listed as a reason the increase in down payments and pointed to the big rise in prices in recent years, which has made homes less affordable to first-time buyers.
Indeed, the ''affordability index'' for houses compiled by the National Association of Realtors in Washington found that in June, for the first time in more than three years, American families at the median-income level could not qualify for a loan to buy the median-priced house.
Ira Gribin, president of the realtors' group, noted that data collected by the association found that while sales of existing homes had declined slightly on the national level over the last 18 months, those in the Northeast had fallen to their lowest level in five years.
Mr. Gribin said he believed that lower interest rates would eventually stimulate sales throughout the country, but added that in high-cost regions like the New York metropolitan area ''the entry-level buyer is still going to be priced out.''
His observations on the Northeast were supported by John Sousa, president of the Commonwealth Mortgage Company of Wellesley Hills, Mass., a major mortgage company in the region that is offering a rate of less than 9 percent. In July, Commonwealth, which has 22 offices in the Northeast, began advertising 8.75 percent rates for 15-year fixed mortgages.
''The result has been a huge demand, but almost all of it is for refinancing,'' Mr. Sousa said. ''Getting a mortgage below 9 percent is like breaking a psychological barrier and a lot of people with adjustable rates who were sitting on the sidelines waiting to refinance have been jumping in when they see the magic figure '8.'
''Yet we haven't detected any widespread increase in the sales of either new or existing homes, which I attribute to fears about a recession and its effect on the housing market, as well as the perception by many potential buyers that housing prices in the Northeast have reached the point that buying a house may not be as good a long-term investment as it used to be.''
Whatever the reasons, the Commerce Department reported a month ago that while sales of new homes had risen 5.5 percent in the nation in June, mainly because of a surge on the West Coast, they had fallen more than 18 percent in the Northeast.
Yet because of a time lag of several months in collecting data on home sales, the outlook today may not be as bleak as it seems.
Thomas Lawler, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association in Washington, the federally chartered private company that is the nation's largest investor in home mortgages, said he believed that ''housing is recovering from the slump of earlier this year as people respond to lower interest rates.''
''But we have had only a moderate pickup in sales volume, perhaps due to the fact that not enough sales data have come in yet,'' Mr. Lawler added. In the very short term, sales might pick up, he said, adding that it was his guess that mortgage rates would continue to decline slowly for the next month or so before rising again.

HEADLINE: Countdown in South Africa

 BODY:
F. W. de Klerk begins his first full term as South Africa's President in difficult circumstances. Blacks send a message of growing impatience from the streets; Congress and President Bush send the same message from Washington. Meanwhile, Wednesday's parliamentary elections have reduced Mr. de Klerk's legislative base and suggested growing polarization among white voters. 
Mr. de Klerk said yesterday that the election would reinforce his intention to honor his campaign promise to create a new constitutional order giving meaningful political power to South Africa's 28 million blacks. It's a task from which he dare not shrink; South Africa is running low on chances for peaceful change.
His stated resolve can only anger the Conservative Party, which gained new seats in Parliament with the argument that Mr. de Klerk would undermine white control. But it may hearten the more liberal Democratic Party, even though the liberals regard Mr. de Klerk's promises as vague and his pace slow. The liberals also made unexpected - and thoroughly welcome - gains among white voters.
The depth of Mr. de Klerk's commitment is in fact far from clear. His victory over his party rival, P. W. Botha, last month was hailed as a sign of hope and change. But within a week of becoming Acting President, he ordered security forces to do their worst with whips and water cannons against activists involved in civil disobedience against apartheid.
President Bush has already hinted that his approach won't be the cozy one of the Reagan Administration. And yesterday, in its most specific statement so far on South Africa, the State Department described the election results as a ''mandate for real change,'' called for an end to violence and urged the beginning of negotiations between whites and blacks.
In Congress, meanwhile, there's strong sentiment for new economic sanctions unless South Africa moves quickly forward. Representative Howard Wolpe, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, says Mr. de Klerk probably has until February to avoid new sanctions by freeing political prisoners, legalizing anti-apartheid groups and starting meaningful talks with ''credible black leaders.''
South Africa's elections have started a countdown. It's up to Mr. de Klerk whether it is a countdown to peace or greater peril.

HEADLINE: Rivals Assail Rebuttal Ad By Holtzman As a Smear

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The Democratic primary race for New York City comptroller, already a testy contest between Elizabeth Holtzman and her rivals, turned testier yesterday as she responded to her opponents' repeated attacks on her record as Brooklyn District Attorney with a new television advertisement attacking their integrity.
Just five days before the primary, the new ad was seen by Ms. Holtzman's rivals, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens and Frank J. Macchiarola of Brooklyn, the former Schools Chancellor, as a sign that she feels herself slipping in a race in which they agree she has so far held a big lead.
 
Clash at Debate
Ms. Holtzman's new strategy was the latest twist in a battle for the city's top fiscal job that has been overshadowed by the mayoral race. The contest is also peculiar because the Comptroller's powers would be markedly changed, and in some ways diminished, if proposed changes in the City Charter are approved by the voters in November. 
In a 90-minute debate among the candidates yesterday, sponsored by the New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Crain's New York Business, the candidates sought to delineate their positions on issues like investing the city's pension funds, auditing city programs and marketing billions of dollars a year in municipal bonds.
But the sharpest clashes came over Ms. Holtzman's 30-second ad, which went on the air Wednesday night and early yesterday.
In the TV spot, a narrator calls Mr. Hevesi ''a long-time crony of Donald Manes's scandal-ridden political machine'' who ''did nothing to stop the corruption.'' The voice also says that Mr. Macchiarola, as Schools Chancellor, ''squandered millions and violated rules by hiring political cronies and friends.''
''And now they're attacking Liz Holtzman,'' the ad continues. ''You know why? Because Holtzman has something they can't match: independence and integrity.''
In the debate yesterday, Mr. Hevesi, who has been running ads critizing Ms. Holtzman's performance as a prosecutor since early last month, repeated those attacks and called the new ad ''really despicable.''
 
'McCarthy Smear' Charged
''A last-minute McCarthy smear is a Richard Nixon tactic,'' he said sharply as Ms. Holtzman sat stony-faced in front of several dozen people at the City University Graduate Center in midtown Manhattan.
''You've really changed in the last 10 years, Liz,'' he added, referring to her service on the House Judiciary Committee that held impeachment hearings on Mr. Nixon under Representative Peter Rodino. ''You're not the Liz Holtzman you were when you were in Congress. Peter Rodino would be ashamed.''
Mr. Hevesi, who delivered the eulogy for Mr. Manes after the Queens Borough President committed suicide as his role in the municipal corruption scandals became known in 1986, said, ''I was a friend of Donald Manes.''
But, he added, ''so were a substantial number of people in this room, so were three-quarters of the people in political life at the time; none of us knew that he was a crook and a thief.''
He noted that Ms. Holtzman had sought and received Mr. Manes's endorsement in her unsucessful 1980 Senate campaign.
Mr. Macchiarola, whose ads have also accused Ms. Holtzman of mismanagement and have chided her for citing her membership in a high school math club as a qualification for comptroller, said, ''Ms. Holtzman has given us a nothing sandwich,'' first by refusing to debate him and Mr. Hevesi on several occasions and now by attacking them.
 
'It's a Baloney Sandwich'
Later, ridiculing Ms. Holtzman's claims that she had managed the District Attorney's office well, he amended that.
''I'm sorry,'' Mr. Macchiarola said. ''I want to apologize to Liz. It's not a nothing sandwich. It's a baloney sandwich.''
He said he had left the school system in 1983 in better shape than when he took over five years earlier.
Ms. Holtzman, who spoke quietly and seemed unusually subdued, responded that it was ''very important in this race, since my opponents have tried to establish a comparison between them and me, to establish a comparison between me and them over the issue of independence.'' She denied that her standing was slipping and said she had a ''distinguished record'' of eight years in Congress and eight years as District Attorney.
She repeatedly referred to her opponents as ''the gang of two'' and accused them of ''rattling off misstatement after misstatement.''
All polls to date have shown Ms. Holtzman running well ahead of both Mr. Macchiarola, who has ranked second, and Mr. Hevesi. But primary polls can be unreliable because they cannot predict voter turnout, which can often markedly affect the outcome.
 
Runoff Election Sought
Mr. Macchiarola and Mr. Hevesi each hope to draw enough support from Ms. Holtzman, as well as from the one-third or more voters who polls have indicated are undecided, to keep her from winning the 40 percent plurality she needs to avoid a runoff with the second highest vote-getter. Naturally each also hopes he will come in second and face Ms. Holtzman in a two-way race on Sept. 26.
Mr. Macchiarola, a 48-year-old professor of business at Columbia University who also headed the New York City Partnership, a civic and economic development group, said he believed voters would see him as the best alternative to Ms. Holtzman. He has been endorsed by a range of public officials and by The New York Post and The Village Voice.
But Mr. Hevesi, 49, who has been endorsed by New York Newsday, The Daily News, The New York Times and many public officials, won the support this week of a former rival, Assemblyman Jerrold L. Nadler of Manhattan, who dropped out of the comptroller's race for lack of money and endorsed him.
Mr. Hevesi has begun a new blitz of television ads listing the endorsements and contends the effect will be a rapidly building momentum for his candidacy.
 
Holtzman Remains Confident
Ms. Holtzman, 47, who only began her $500,000 television and radio campaign last week and who has the endorsement of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, many labor and civil rights groups and The Amsterdam News, said she was confident she would prevail.
One of the relatively few substantive issues on which the candidates disagreed in their debate yesterday was whether next year's scheduled state and city income-tax cuts should go into effect as planned or be deferred.
Mr. Macchiarola said the cuts should be made on time, while Mr. Hevesi, a member of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, said they might have to be deferred to help close an expected budget gap.
But Ms. Holtzman, who spent much of the debate seated on a high chair behind her podium, while her opponents stood behind theirs on either side of her, said: ''That's an issue the Governor will have to make a decision about, with Mr. Hevesi's assistance, at the time.''

HEADLINE: No Longer Called Underdog; Koch Strides to Primary

SERIES: PROFILING THE CANDIDATES - FOURTH OF SIX ARTICLES

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Walking briskly, as is his inclination, with his arms aloft to announce his presence, Mayor Edward I. Koch arrived at the Fairview Swim Club in Forest Hills, Queens, on a campaign stop the other day.
It was a Koch crowd, and the Mayor spoke mostly about the closeness of the contest and how much he needed the members' help. But at one point during his brief talk, Mr. Koch allowed himself a moment of satisfied reflection.
''Six months ago, people counted us out,'' he told the swimsuited audience. ''But I always had faith.'' 
During the last four years, Mr. Koch has endured a corruption scandal, watched the city's economic boom fade and suffered aminor stroke. Crack, crime, homelessness and AIDS spread, his approval rating dropped and it seemed to some that the Mayor, like Fiorello H. La Guardia and Robert F. Wagner before him, would not run for an unprecendented fourth term.
Now, a few days before Tuesday's primary, Philip Friedman, a political consultant, compared Mr. Koch to another prominent New Yorker: ''He's made the best comeback politically in New York since Nelson Rockefeller.''
Mr. Koch's 24th campaign has, in a sense, been two campaigns, staged simultaneously. The first, features a series of television commercials crafted by David Garth, the Mayor's media strategist, on which Mr. Koch is spending three-quarters of his budget for the primary.
 
A Small Photograph
In the commericials, ordinary New Yorkers talk about the things they like about the Mayor and his administration - his housing rehabilitation program; the antidrug efforts of the Police Department's Tactical Narcotics Teams; Project Giant Step, the publically financed preschool program for 4-year-olds. Mr. Koch's name is not mentioned until well into the ads, and he appears only in a small photograph. That is the soft sell.
The Mayor, as usual, takes care of the other campaign, the hard sell. He vowed to tone down his rhetoric after his harsh criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson during the Presidential primary in New York last year.
But Mr. Koch has not shied from attacking his opponents - especially city Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, one of three rivals for the Democratic nomination and a Koch foe of longstanding, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney who is running in the Republican primary. The Mayor has tried to wait for them to fire the first shot, or at least make a mistake, before he pounces.
Mr. Koch made what even some advisers regarded as an error - although its political impact is uncertain -when he said marchers were wrong to protest in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn following the killing there of a black youth. That comment notwithstanding, Mr. Koch, like Mr. Rockefeller - who staged several come-from-behind victories beginning in the early 1960's - has a quintessential New York style that apparently has not gone out of fashion. It has been amply displayed during the campaign on free televison, as politicians sometimes call news programs.
''People are very dissatisfied in many ways with the state of the city,'' said Andrew J. Stein, the City Council president. ''On the other hand, Koch, through brunt of personality, has managed to get across some of the good things that he's done. It's only because he's such a strong campaigner that he's been able to do that.''
The campaign's advance work has been crisp, as was evident during the Labor Day parade, when Mr. Koch was accorded a spot way back in the line of march. But marching with blocks and blocks of construction workers, he essentially led his own parade.
 
'It's Like a Cyclone'
The candidate has been effective, too, although Mr. Koch's stops are almost always brief, since he likes to keep moving, and he sometimes wears the slightly anxious expression of a man who seems to be trying to gauge his welcome.
''It's like a cyclone,'' said Arnold N. Kriss, the campaign's deputy chairman, describing the Mayor's hit-and-run style. ''He's screaming, he's yelling and people are attracted by the commotion.''
But even in a few moments, Mr. Koch has a knack for redefining himself in terms that seem likely to appeal to groups that have been his core of support over the years.
In Hispanic communities in the South Bronx and Northern Manhattan, for example, he talks about how he is the son of immigrants.
 
Talk About the Middle Class
In lunchtime stops at senior-citizen centers, he tells the elderly that, at 64 years of age, he is one of them, sometimes mentioning that he has already bought his first half-price movie ticket with the discount accorded his new status.
At places like the Fairview Swim Club, he often talks about the middle class, the people who he says pay the taxes and create the jobs.
''My problem,'' he said at the swim club, ''is that the activists, the ideologues, do not like my mainstream politics.''
And when Senator Edward M. Kennedy came to town this week to endorse Mr. Koch's chief rival, Borough President David N. Dinkins of Manhattan, the Mayor took the opportunity to cast himself in the tradition of Hubert Humphrey.
 
'Neck and Neck'
Although he has visited black neighborhoods to attend official city ceremonies this summer, Mr. Koch has rarely campaigned in them, ceding votes there to Mr. Dinkins, the city's highest black elected official. On one campaign stop in Bedford-Stuyvesant, he told about 100 black people that he knew ''this election has to pull on your heart strings.''
''We're going places where there are votes,'' said one Koch campaign official.
The prospect of defections by political leaders and clubs in Queens to the Mayor from another Koch opponent, Richard Ravitch, former head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, have buoyed spirits at City Hall. Mr. Koch, who used to refer to himself as an underdog and then said he was No. 2, now says he is ''neck and neck'' with Mr. Dinkins.
''I'm glad its almost over,'' the Mayor said on his way back to Gracie Mansion last weekend after campaigning along Fordham Road in the Bronx. He quickly added, ''And then we'll get geared up for Giuliani.''
A few days later, after one of a series of endorsements he received in the campaign's last full week, Mr. Koch even talked about a fifth term, if only to say that it was ''hardly likely'' he would run for one.

HEADLINE: Review/Architecture;
After 9 Years, Dallas Concert Hall Is Opening

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
It cost $106 million, not the $49.5 million promised; it took nine years to build, not two, and it caused such bitter political and esthetic squabbles that it was almost canceled several times. But Dallas will try to forget all of that Friday night at the opening of the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, a 2,066-seat hall designed by I. M. Pei that stands as this city's latest attempt to assert a cultural presence of international stature.
The limestone-and-glass building, the only concert hall Mr. Pei has designed, sits on nearly three acres at the edge of downtown in the shadow of the city's flamboyant skyline. The building comes at a critical time for Dallas, which is beginning to rouse itself from Texas' long economic slump; for now, Mr. Pei's soaring, glass-enclosed lobbies offer a lavish perch from which to view some of the most spectacular depressed real estate in the world.
The formal opening Friday evening will feature Van Cliburn playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Mahler's Second Symphony, a program that would test the acoustical mettle of any concert hall. But in a pre-opening concert Wednesday evening billed as a ''Tribute to Dallas,'' Isaac Stern played the Beethoven Violin Concerto in D before a houseful of invited guests, and the hall came briefly to life. 
A major contributor to the project was the Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, whose initial gift of $10 million carried the stipulation that the building be named for Morton H. Meyerson, a former president of Mr. Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems. Mr. Myerson was chairman of the Dallas Symphony Association's Concert Hall Committee, which has overseen the project.
The opening of the hall is a triumph for the Dallas Symphony, which was in such dire financial straits 15 years ago that it was forced to suspend operations for an entire season. In 1978, city voters rejected a bond issue that would have included $11.6 million for a new concert hall; under the leadership of Eduardo Mata, the symphony's conductor since 1977, the orchestra revived sufficiently to win public support for a $28.6 million bond issue in 1982. That was supposed to be the full public share of the concert hall's cost, although the city did eventually spend nearly twice that amount with extra contributions for land acquisition, bond interest and such ancillary facilities as the hall's garage and adjacent outdoor plaza. (The rest of the cost came from private contributions.) And Mr. Pei's highly complex design proved vastly more expensive than initially expected. This is a building of considerable ambition architecturally: it is very much a civic monument, not a simple machine for listening. For all its modernism, it has as much in common with the grandeur of a building like the Paris Opera as with typical buildings of our age.
The Meyerson Center is a building at once typical of Mr. Pei's work and altogether different from it. Mr. Pei is a master of sleek, refined geometry, which he uses to assert a kind of modernist monumentality, and the exterior and the lobbies fit this mold: the building looks like a set of crisp boxes of limestone and glass to which swooping, curving forms of glass have been appended. It is unashamedly sculptural, and although it addresses the street with a sort of grudging respect, it stands aloof from the city, an isolated icon.
But the hall itself is as warm as the exterior and lobbies are cool. The startling transition at the Meyerson is not in moving from outdoors to the lobby but in moving from the lobby into the auditorium, for here the architecture transforms itself into something intimate, warm and energetic in a way markedly unlike the rest of Mr. Pei's work. The hall is paneled in African makore and American cherry, set in a grid pattern, with softly lighted onyx panels on the upper balcony fronts and elaborate grids of wood and plaster around the top of the house, like clerestories. A huge gridded acoustical canopy of wood and onyx projects over the stage into the unusually high hall and can be raised or lowered to adjust the sound. There is also a small trompe l'oeil plaster dome painted into a circle in the ceiling. The colors are mostly those of warm, rich woods; the seats are rust colored and the floors are of a warmly colored orange-brown terrazzo.
There are strong echoes of the Viennese Secessionist style here: Mr. Pei seems, like so many architects in the last few years, to have been looking at the gridded designs of Josef Hoffmann. He wisely realized that in these Viennese geometries lay both the modernist rigor he has always pursued and the sensuous pleasures a concert hall requires; it was the ideal stylistic direction to permit him to enrich his palette and stay true to his traditional priorities.
The result is a hall that is one of the handsomest new rooms in which to hear music anywhere. There is nothing vulgar about the Meyerson, no red velvet and swags, nothing soft or sentimental. Mr. Pei would obviously sooner go out of business than create a glitzy, plush hall like the Metropolitan Opera in New York. But it is not like most self-consciously ''modern'' halls, either: This hall is warm and lush, not harsh.
There are some problems, but they are minor: There is too much limestone in the hall, and it sits uncomfortably with the warm wood, and the trompe l'oeil dome is too small for the room. Mr. Pei's associate in charge of the design of the hall's interior, Charles Young, has spoken of the architect's desire to have the hall evoke the quality of a violin, and it does indeed have that same golden glow, that same sense of richness married to rigor and visual discipline.
The acoustical quality of the Meyerson remains to be judged, but much of the credit for the design of the hall must go to Russell Johnson, of Artec Consultants Inc., the acoustician who was involved in the design from the beginning. In an unusual arrangement, Mr. Johnson worked not as a consultant to the architect but reported directly to the Dallas Symphony Association and to the City of Dallas, which built the hall. It was Mr. Johnson who determined the shape and size of the auditorium, who positioned the balconies and decided which surfaces were to be covered in which materials. There were frequent clashes between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Pei, particularly over the prominence of the acoustical canopy, and at times each threatened to resign.
Both men seemed pleased with the hall at its first trial on Wednesday. Although Mr. Johnson prefers not to comment on any of his halls until they have had several months to shake down, he was wandering through the crowd at Wednesday's concert with a air of pleasure at the enthusiastic response of the audience to the hall's sound. Mr. Pei, who some time ago reached a cordial accommodation with the acoustician, was more concerned with the fact that certain critical elements in his design, such as a pair of monumental standing lamps of onyx for the grand staircase in the lobby, were yet to arrive, and that the building was not, after all this time and all this money, completely finished.
What is most pleasing about this building, beyond the pleasures of the auditorium itself, is the extent to which it fulfills Mr. Pei's goal of creating a viable modernist monumentality. Mr. Pei has sought for years to join the civic grandeur of the Beaux-Arts to the crisp shapes of modernism, and he has done so with more conviction here than in any other building, including his glass pyramid that is an entry to the Louvre. Here, modernism does not play off against classicism, as at the Louvre or at Mr. Pei's East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington; it makes its own world. And if that world seems too aloof and abstract from the outside, it is dignified and even exhilarating within the public space.
The limestone-and-glass lobbies are immense and sprawling, but with a splendid sense of reserve: everyone who has ever felt that Mr. Pei's atrium in the East Building was too busy, too filled up with too many things, will find this space a welcome relief. A strong painting by Ellsworth Kelly, a set of four colored panels, fills one wall and brings life to the far end of the lobby, but the rest of the space is left to the architecture. Happily, a plan to put a mural on a great limestone wall that forms the rear wall of the audiorium, the first thing most visitors see as they enter the lobby, was abandoned. That wall, with its graceful arch at the top and rounded windows at each end, should stay as it is, a testament to the ability of pure architectural form to speak.
In honest recognition of the realities of life in Texas, the architects have made the building's best entrance the one from the below-ground automobile drive: it leads to a great staircase that swoops up into the lobby with considerable drama, placing the visitor directly on axis with the auditorium. While the street-level entry is hardly modest, it packs no such wallop.
Realistic as it may be, the automobile orientation of the building stands in some contradiction to the ambitious plan for the Dallas Arts District, a 60-acre redevelopment project of which the new concert hall is a prime part. The district, which includes new office towers and historic buildings as well as the decade's major cultural effort in Dallas until now, the Dallas Museum of Art, was intended to encourage consistent urban design and a pedestrian orientation.
Mr. Pei is best not at making connections to other buildings, of course, but at making isolated monuments; he always has been. He first came to Dallas in the 1960's to design the city hall, a harsh, neo-Corbusian building that is considerably more aloof than the concert hall, and his firm has done several office towers in the city since then, the best of which are strong, minimalist abstractions. But if the Meyerson Symphony Center is an object unto itself, it is a compelling one. The real contribution the swooping walls of glass playing off against the crisp walls of limestone make is to pull us inside the building, to bring us to a set of public spaces that strike a perfect balance between the civic grandeur of a great public building and the sensuous pleasure of music.

HEADLINE: Group Sets Corporate Code On Environmental Conduct

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The pension funds of New York City and California and other investors joined with environmental groups and religious organizations yesterday to introduce a code of conduct to judge which corporations are environmentally responsible. Those involved control more than $100 billion in investments, The 10-point code has been named the Valdez Principles, recalling the disastrous oil spill by the Exxon Valdez oil tanker off the Alaska coast. It calls on companies to address the effect of both products and production processes on employees, communities and the environment. It also includes requirements that companies appoint environmental experts to their boards and conduct and publicize an annual audit of their compliance with the code.
''My sense is that this is an idea that is going to take root,'' said Harry Fatkin, director of health, safety and environmental affairs at the Polaroid Corporation, one of the few companies briefed on the plan before its introduction. ''I found the Valdez Principles to be a negative name for what appears to be a positive program. We are willing to explore it, and we are anxious to talk to other companies that feel the same way.'' 
The code was drawn up by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies. Its backers include the Social Investment Forum, which represents 325 fund managers and investment advisers, and the National Council of Churches' Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.
''We are recognizing that our activity as consumers and investors should be focused on the sustainability of the planet,'' said Peter Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, one of 14 environmental groups backing the effort.
The coalition recently put pressure on the Exxon Corporation to agree to name a director with environmental expertise to its board.
The coalition is by far the most sweeping effort to date to bring investors together with social action groups representing millions of members. They contend that the most profitable companies in the long run will be those that are willing to sacrifice short-term profits by investing to support environmental and social needs. The coalition hopes the principles will gain worldwide acceptance.
The Valdez Principles were inspired in part by the Sullivan Principles, a code governing corporate conduct in South Africa. That code was created in 1977 by the Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia minister who serves on the board of the General Motors Corporation.
Unlike the Sullivan Principles, the Valdez Principles were drafted by investment managers and environmental advocates without participation by industry.
 
'An Idea We Can Improve Upon'
''We view the Sullivan Principles as an idea we can improve upon,'' said Joan Bavaria, a co-chairman of the coalition and the president of Franklin Research and Development, a Boston investment firm. She said funds that invest based on social values have repeatedly found that the environment was the single biggest concern of their clients.
The Council on Economic Priorities, a New York research organization, found similar views among consumers last year.
''As I talked to people this winter about this idea, it was like striking a match to flint,'' Ms. Bavaria said.
The environmental coalition will immediately begin inviting companies to endorse the Valdez code, she said. Companies will also be invited to join the small groups of fund managers and environmentalists to develop specific performance benchmarks for the 10 points, which are vaguely worded.
 
Shareholder Pressure
Harrison J. Goldin, New York City's Comptroller, and Gray Davis, Controller of California, said the code would be the basis for shareholder pressure on companies to improve their environmental performances. Members of the Social Investment Forum said the code should help socially concerned investors to choose companies for investments and help companies to mobilize internal environmental programs. And environmental groups plan to use the information to praise corporate efforts they endorse and to focus negative publicity or even boycotts on companies with poor records.
Denis Hayes, co-chairman of the coalition and head of the organization planning Earth Day 1990 for next April, said the group would begin a large campaign to urge college students to consider which companies are complying with the code in deciding which job offers to accept.
As conceived by the coalition, the Valdez code would create a new demand for annual environmental audits. Such audits are often performed for banks, insurers and real estate buyers to identify potential liabilities, like the existence of a hazardous waste site on property that is being sold or foreclosed.

The article also referred incorrectly to sources of pressure on the Exxon Corporation to name an environmentalist to its board. The move was organized by Harrison J. Goldin, New York City's Comptroller, speaking for leading pension funds. Other members of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies were not involved.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Would Aid Computing

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
President Bush's science adviser will present to Congress today a plan by which the United States would almost double over five years its spending on advanced computing research technologies to develop dramatically faster supercomputers and more powerful software. The plan also calls for the construction of a high-speed computer network that would link the nation's research centers.
But President Bush, who has endorsed the proposal, has stopped short of requesting the additional financing it seeks.
The plan, presented in a report entitled ''The Federal High Performance Computing Program,'' calls for an additional $1.9 billion in Federal financing during the next five years. It does not make clear which institutions and companies would receive the money. To be released by the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy, the report was prepared by a panel of Government computer experts representing more than a dozen civilian and military agencies. 
 
Four Agencies Doing Research
Currently four Government agencies - the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation - spend about $500 million annually on advanced computing research. The report proposes that that amount be augmented over five years by between $150 million and $600 million a year. Financing would be split almost evenly between computer hardware and software, with a smaller amount allocated for construction of a national computer network.
The report says that today's supercomputers are tomorrow's desktop computers and that an investment in such technology could have a huge payback.
The report details 20 fundamental scientific problems that it says will be solved only with a huge investment in advanced computing technologies. The problems include the prediction of global weather and climate changes; mapping the human genetic code; breakthroughs in making computers recognize speech and ''see,'' and military advances in stealth aircraft technology and undersea surveillance for antisubmarine warfare.
Makers of the fastest computers, including Cray Research Inc., the International Business Machines Corporation and Convex Computer Inc., are expected to be among the major beneficiaries.
Industry executives said the plan was an important step toward maintaining the United States' lead in the supercomputer field. ''We're delighted and very supportive,'' said John A. Rollwagen, chairman of Cray Research. ''The report is consistent with the things we've been saying about the use of supercomputers to enhance the United States' competitiveness and the importance of making them available across the country.''
Mr. Rollwagen acknowledged that the sources of the financing for such a large initiative was still an open question. But he said he thought that a high-speed computer network would eventually pay for itself from user fees.
The report calls for initiatives including the development of prototype supercomputers that in the mid-1990's are expected to be 100 to 1,000 times as fast as today's most powerful computers; financing of a high-speed fiber-optic computer network more than 50,000 times as fast as the existing network, which would link all of the nation's universities and corporate and government research laboratories, and investment in university education to attain a level of 1,000 computer science Ph.D.'s a year by 1995. In 1985, the latest year for which figures are available, the number of new Ph.D.'s was 240, and experts say it has probably declined since then.
 
Priorities Debated
The report adds fuel to a debate about the most important spending priorities in protecting American industry from foreign competition.
Some experts think the United States should give highest priority to recapturing a portion of the consumer electronics industry from Japan by investing heavily in research on high-definition television. The American Electronics Association has argued that investing in advanced television technology will generate important spinoffs that will make the United States more competitive in consumer electronics.
But a growing number of computer scientists, economists and academic researchers contend that United States manufacturers are not prepared to challenge the Japanese in that field and that research and development would be more valuable if it focused on developing advanced computer networks and a new generation of computer technologies -markets in which the United States still retains a significant lead.
In fact, these experts say, high-definition television might be quickly made obsolete by advances in computer technology and high-speed networks that enable computers to offer sharp television pictures as well as many other functions.
 
'Data Highway' Sought
The report is also expected to provide support for similar legislation introduced by Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, that would create a national ''data highway'' linking the nation's leading scientific and corporate research centers. Mr. Gore likens such a network to the American highway system, built during the 1950's, which he said led the way to dramatic economic growth.
''Our future economic strength, our ability to provide and support jobs and industry and technology, will depend on our ability to quickly transmit and understand vast quantities of information,'' Senator Gore said. He is the author of the National High Performance Computer Technology Act, which calls for spending $1.75 billion to support advanced computer technologies and construct a national data highway.
''A future national high-speed computer network could have the kind of catalytic effect on our society, industries and universities that the telephone system has had during the 20th century,'' wrote D. Allan Bromley, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in an introduction to the report.I.B.M.

Robbing Peter To Fight Drugs

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
CONGRESS came back to Washington this week, glumly facing - like other returning vacationers - an accumulation of money worries. Prominent on its list was President Bush's pitch for a $7.9 billion anti-drug offensive. Because the President proposed to pay for the program not by raising taxes but by taking funds from other programs, this set off a political dust-up on where to find the money.
In itself, the incremental costs of Mr. Bush's anti-drug initiative are not huge. They amount to $716 million in new spending proposals, in relation to total fiscal year 1990 spending of $1,179 billion. 
To finance the extra costs of the ''drug war,'' Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, has proposed cutting $320 million from immigration assistance programs, $90 million from public housing and juvenile justice programs, $194 million from the Economic Development Administration and $132 million from the Pentagon's single-channel ground and airborne radio system. But those cuts would provide only about half the $1.48 billion the Administration has added to its initial anti-drug program since last February.
The Democrats in Congress are stymied on how to react. They accuse Mr. Bush of not having matched his war-on-drugs rhetoric with dollars. But they are loath to take on the President in a politically risky battle to raise taxes to pay for the drug war or other programs they regard as underfinanced. Instead, they are likely to look for different cuts. Some Democrats will look for extra cuts in the military budget, although others, with local military interests to protect, will resist the Administration's proposed cuts. It appears improbable that Congress and the Administration will be able to work out a new budget deal by Oct. 1, to draw up a 1990 budget with a deficit of less than $100 billion, as specified by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
This time around, the Capitol Hill budget experts believe, there is a strong prospect of a ''sequester'' of military and nonmilitary expenditures, which would take effect on Oct. 15 if there is no agreement between the White House and Congress on spending cuts or revenue increases that would meet Gramm-Rudman deficit targets.
The only alternative would be a bilateral deal for more ''smoke and mirrors'' to disguise the deficit - like the compromise between the White House and Congress to put $50 billion of the costs of the bailout of savings and loans partly off-budget, partly on-budget. There is little room for still rosier economic projections, to raise forecast revenues.
With the opportunities for additional deficit-disguising maneuvers shrinking, and with diminishing hopes for a quick deal on how to cut the budget deficit, talk is growing in Congress of a change in the sequester rule for reaching the Gramm-Rudman target. Instead of simply halving the spending cuts between military and nonmilitary expenditures, the new procedure would be to raise the money needed to reach the deficit target by putting one-third of the cuts on military spending, one-third on nonmilitary spending and one-third on higher taxes.
That proposal would run up against President Bush's ''no new taxes'' campaign pledge, but with Congress taking the lead, and presumably a good part of the blame, it might be more palatable to the White House than the 50-50 spending cuts.
On their collective plate, Congress and the White House have plenty of other key matters, including the President's proposal to cut the capital gains tax, to which Congress is likely to accede; whether to change or junk the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in the face of angry protests by the elderly, whose costs must go up; how to finance the nuclear waste cleanup and other long-term environmental programs; how to make the Brady plan for reducing third world debt more effective, before political and economic explosions erupt in Latin America; how to deal with economic and military relations with China, the Soviet Union and the other Communist bloc countries, and how to bring down the persistent trade deficit, now exacerbated by the unanticipated strength of the dollar.
The big budget deficit continues to constrain and hamper the United States in tackling all these problems, with drugs, as measured in the public opinion polls, just the most conspicuous for the moment. But neither the White House nor Congress is ready to tackle the budget deficit forcefully.
A sharp fall in the stock market, now expected by a number of Wall Street strategists, would only intensify the Administration's and Congress's unwillingness to raise taxes or chop spending. The Dow Jones industrial average fell yesterday by 12.91, after a drop of almost 25 points the day before. But it is the deficit and the loose fiscal policy behind it that lie at the heart of tight money and high interest rates.

HEADLINE: U.S. Oil Discovery Off But Recovery Gains

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Energy Department said today that its estimate of how much oil can be recovered from known reserves in the United States increased by a substantial margin in 1988, marking the fifth time in the last six years that the improvement exceeded 1.8 billion barrels.
The agency added, however, that discoveries of previously unknown oil reserves declined last year to less than 600 million barrels, the second-lowest level since the agency began keeping records in 1977.
''The truth is, we're doing a lot better than most people expected in expanding our known reserves, even though it is not enough to get us through our current difficulties,'' said Dr. William L. Fisher, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas, in Austin. 
 
An Overall Decline
Over all, the amount of proven and recoverable oil reserves declined by 500 million barrels last year, to 26.8 billion barrels.
Dr. Edward H. Murphy, an analyst at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, said the decline in oil discoveries was likely to continue because Congress had refused to allow oil companies to explore for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and Federal offshore areas, where many exploration experts believe the nation's largest undiscovered oil reserves lie.
Many oil companies have reported improved recovery rates from existing oilfields in recent years by using computers and related analytical programs to give production engineers a clearer picture of how and where to drill in aging fields to bring more oil to the surface.
 
Secondary Methods
Also, secondary recovery methods, like the extraction of oil from known reserves by flooding them with water, carbon dioxide and other substances, have also improved production.
Dr. Fisher said the percentage of recoverable oil reserves from existing fields had increased to 35 percent, from 30 percent, in the last decade and could increase to 55 percent in another 40 years.
Several analysts attributed the decline in exploration to the sharp drop in oil prices early in 1986, and the uncertainty about future prices. Most big oil companies are cautious about searching for American fields because they fear oil prices could drop further. They are spending comparatively more money abroad, where fields are considered easier to find.
 
Expanded Search for Gas
At the same time, the industry is expanding the search for natural gas fields in the United States and has improved the recovery rates for existing natural-gas fields. Many companies, including Amoco and Chevron, bought natural-gas properties last year in expectation of rising prices in the 1990's.
The Government recorded an overall decline of 19 trillion cubic feet last year, to 168 trillion cubic feet of natural-gas reserves, because it eliminated from consideration 24.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas on Alaska's North Slope. No pipeline exists for shipping the gas, said John Wood, the official who directed the study from the Energy Infomration Administration's office in Dallas. The report showed that the industry increased the total discoveries of natural-gas reserves outside Alaska last year by more than 10 trillion cubic feet.
The nation produced 16.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from known reserves last year.
''There are also some new plays developing in areas where you have some potential for new discoveries,'' Richard Nehring, an indepedent energy analyst in Colorado Springs, said. A large natural-gas discovery by ARCO last year in the Arkoma Basin in southeastern Oklahoma encouraged other big oil companies to expand their drilling programs in the region, he said.

Bank South Plans To Cut 300 Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Bank South Corporation said a program to increase its income by $15 million annually would include reducing the company's work force by 10 percent, or about 300 jobs. ''We will reorganize certain areas, spread out layers of management, eliminate duplications and, in general, cut costs,'' Robert P. Guyton, the company's president and chief executive, said in a statement Wednesday.
Mr. Guyton said Bank South expects a slower economy and a more competitive banking industry in the 1990's. The Atlanta-based Bank South is a $5 billion multibank holding company with 136 banking offices in Georgia and Florida.
