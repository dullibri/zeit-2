 BODY:
LAST week Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, highlighted traffic congestion as one of the key challenges facing the city, and by extension, the region. He identified improving travel times for residents, visitors and workers as one of his 10 goals for a ''sustainable'' New York.
 And he's right to do so. Indeed, the metropolitan region, especially New York City, is choking on its own traffic. Unpredictable travel times, noise, truck and auto exhaust and the stress -- and sometimes, the deadly peril -- of traversing traffic-clogged streets combine to make the city and the region less livable. Moreover, street congestion makes delivering goods and services in New York City difficult and expensive. The metropolitan area's transportation planning organization estimates that traffic delays annually waste more than $8 billion in man hours and double the cost of freight shipments. 
Recent polls and studies by transportation, planning and environmental groups point to the public's frustration with traffic congestion. Besides the Manhattan central business district, traffic is a major problem in downtown Brooklyn; Queens; nearby city and suburban neighborhoods in Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester County; and the highways that link them together. 
 Within New York City, transportation officials have tried ways to loosen the gridlock: they've switched major avenues to one-way operation, prohibited curbside parking during rush hour; established ''thru streets'' to restrict turns off major crosstown routes; and instituted reversible tunnel and bus lanes to accommodate rush-hour traffic. Nonetheless, the flood of cars and trucks continues unabated, and the city's traffic ''peak period'' now lasts seven or eight hours a day and could grow to 12 by 2030 if we don't take action. 
 So what else can we do?
 For 50 years, economists have argued that road-use charges can reduce traffic congestion: since road space is a limited commodity, there should be a price on it. It doesn't take an economics degree to recognize that when something is free, people tend to use more of it.
 In congestion-charging programs, drivers pay a fee to enter certain districts or to use certain roads at times when traffic is heaviest. In high-occupancy/toll lane programs, special ''express'' highway lanes are reserved for buses and other vehicles with at least two passengers, as well as for solo drivers who are willing to pay a toll to speed their trip. Modern technologies like electronic toll collection have made the various pricing schemes far more feasible in recent years. 
 Other congested cities, including London, Singapore and Stockholm, have benefited from such road-pricing mechanisms. But the idea has never gotten much traction here. Drivers strongly object to proposals for additional bridge tolls or for a London-style congestion charge for entering Manhattan's central business district. Recent polls have shown that even transit users are skeptical of these ideas.
 But with the city's population expected to grow by 1 million people over the next 20 years, our traffic problem promises to only worsen, and we need to find a solution that we can all live with. 
 With that in mind, we set out to find some answers. Through focus groups representing various metropolitan-area constituencies -- motorists, transit users, retailers, restaurateurs, businesses that make deliveries in Manhattan; residents of all boroughs and the suburbs -- we learned that people would accept road pricing if they were convinced that it is really meant to ease traffic instead of raising revenue and is part of a broader transportation program that includes measures to provide traffic relief without fees. 
 Drivers in the city and around the region would support congestion charges, high-occupancy/toll lanes or other road-pricing solutions calibrated to the times and places of worst congestion. They are willing to let road pricing work the market's magic as long as the plan minimizes the impact on motorists who are not really part of the problem. One option to discourage unnecessary driving that is likely to have wide support would be the elimination of free street parking for government employees. 
 Most important, the people we spoke to believe that road pricing must be part of a comprehensive plan to improve transportation -- one that also employs measures like tighter enforcement of rules against double parking, zoning requirements for off-street truck loading to prevent delivery vehicles from clogging traffic and exclusive lanes and traffic-signal priority for buses. 
 They also favor increased transit options like new express bus routes, improved commuter rail service, and additional park-and-ride sites to entice motorists from their cars. Revenue from fees and tolls would need to be used to improve both public transportation and roads. Beginning such improvements before any road charges were introduced would assure people that the program's purpose really is to reduce traffic congestion and not simply to raise revenue.
 Traffic jams are a New York City problem that has a domino effect on the region. They affect not just future sustainability but also our quality of life and economy today. The mayor is right to identify traffic relief as one of his top 10 goals, and leaders in Long Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester should do the same. That back-up on the West Side Highway could lead to the Saw Mill River Parkway.

HEADLINE: A Plan for Growth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Mayor Seeks Plan for City's Population Growth'' (Metro Briefing, Dec. 13) reports that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg intends to develop a plan to make New York City sustainable for future generations. 
 The objective is laudable, but there is a critical element missing from the mayor's presentation: a balance between the pressures of economic development and the need for environmental protection, an essential ingredient of all sustainability planning. 
 For example, building thousands of housing units in low-lying coastal areas would make them vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme storms. Just as questionable would be building housing on spaces that could be used for future parkland and playgrounds, or restored as ecological habitats.
 As he develops his plan, the mayor must address these conflicting demands if he is to find solutions that bring the city lasting benefit.

HEADLINE: Shortfall Ahead for State, Rell Tells Business Group

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
The state faces a projected budget shortfall of $400 million to $700 million for the 2007-8 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, Gov. M. Jodi Rell said last week in a speech to the Metro Hartford Alliance, a group of chamber of commerce executives from the greater Hartford area. It was the first time Mrs. Rell mentioned a projected shortfall. The current budget is expected to have a surplus of $486.5 million, said her spokesman, Rich Harris. 
 Mr. Harris said the projected shortfall was the result of increased spending on pension funds, state programs and energy costs. ''If we continue to spend on the current track, inflation factors and ordinary growth in the budget would put us about $600 million in the red,'' he said.
Francis W. Ahking, an associate professor of economics at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, said he was surprised by talk of a shortfall, considering that Mrs. Rell had spoken about property tax relief during her recent campaign.
 ''It suggests that she revised the economic growth forecast of the state,'' he said. ''The economic growth in the state is related to job growth, and Connecticut has been at or near the bottom of that category for the last five or six years.''
 In her speech, Mrs. Rell did not address ways to control spending, Mr. Harris said. He said she would present her new budget in the first week of February. 
 Mr. Harris denied that Mrs. Rell's remark was a warning to Democrats, who control the legislature, about overspending.
 ''Everybody wants to do a lot of things on both sides of the aisle,'' he said. ''There are a huge amount of ideas out there, and being fiscally responsible is just good governance.'' JEFF HOLTZ

HEADLINE: Hoping a Wider Highway Can Save Their Livelihoods

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: CHINOOK, Mont. 

 BODY:
For the last decade, residents of northern Montana have been praying for asphalt to stave off the disappearance of their dwindling ranching and farming towns. 
 Now, with the election of a senator from rural Montana, they are lobbying with renewed vigor to get the state and federal government to widen all 666 miles of Highway 2 in Montana, a move they hope will keep them on the map. About 40 miles of the highway, known as the Hi-Line, is four lanes.
''We're fighting for our life,'' said Bob Sivertsen, an auctioneer in Havre who is president of the group pushing for the highway-widening project, which is known as Four for Two and is estimated to cost more than $1.5 billion. ''We don't want to die.'' 
 Most businesses, Mr. Sivertsen said, simply will not locate along a two-lane road.
 After a series of setbacks, including a state study in 2004 that found the best option was an improved two-lane highway, advocates of the project see new hope with the election of Jon Tester to the Senate. Mr. Tester, a Democrat from Big Sandy, a fading agricultural town not far from the Hi-Line, has expressed support for the project. 
 ''He has supported Four for Two in the past and still supports it,'' said Matt McKenna, a spokesman for the senator-elect. ''Transportation infrastructure is economic development, both when you build it and when you drive on it.''
 Supporters want the proposed four-lane road, which they acknowledge is up against long odds in Washington, to tie into Highway 2 in North Dakota, which is nearly completed as a four-lane route across the state. Mr. Sivertsen said the energy boom in Alberta and Saskatchewan would also make good roads even more important. 
 Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat whose family homesteaded along the Hi-Line near the town of Gildford, also supports the widening.
 The Hi-Line, named after the Northern Pacific rail line that carried Norwegian, German, Swedish and other immigrants west to homestead land, created a patchwork of farms and ranches on the northern Great Plains. But the aridity of the plains was too great to support small farms, and old maps show dozens of towns that no longer exist.
 The population here in Blaine County peaked in 1940 at more than 9,500. Last year the census put it at 6,600. In neighboring Phillips County, the population peaked around 9,300 in 1920 and has since shrunk to around 4,200. The population across the Hi-Line would most likely be far lower if it were not for substantial federal subsidies paid to farmers and ranchers here.
 A staggering blow was dealt the Hi-Line, Mr. Sivertsen said, when Interstate 90 was built through the southern part of Montana in the 1970s. 
 Life on the Hi-Line is a constant readjustment to deal with a declining population. Many businesses and homes are ramshackle or shuttered. School districts have been forced to combine. High school football teams play with eight- and six-man teams. Some towns, here and in other parts of the plains, have bought radio stations and stores to operate as they have become unprofitable. Many people have to drive 100 miles or more to get to a good-size grocery store or a doctor. 
 There are some bright spots. Hunters flock here in the fall for the pheasants that can be seen along the road scratching gravel. One of the two Indian reservations along the highway is building a casino, and there has been a sharp rise in the local economy the last two years because of energy development.
 Officials with the Montana Highway Department say traffic data and other factors simply do not support the need for a four-lane highway. But supporters say the process is stacked against them. 
 ''It's geared in favor of high-traffic areas,'' said State Senator Sam Kitzenberg, a Glasgow Republican who has led the campaign. ''It says if you are not a player, you never will be. They say, 'We're going to give you a widened two-lane and a slow, quiet death.' ''
 Another major lifeline in the northern part of the state, one that faces cancellation on a regular basis, is the Empire Builder, the daily passenger train operated by Amtrak.
 Critics of the expanded highway say the decline of the Great Plains is about more than whether a road is two lanes or four. Frank Popper, a professor of geography at Rutgers who has studied the depopulation of the Great Plains and advocates introducing bison to a restored native prairie to replace heavily subsidized farm land, said he was of two minds.
 ''It smacks of desperation,'' Dr. Popper said. The region is out of the nation's consciousness, he said, and a new road will not change that. He argued that money would be better spent expanding hospitals and tourism. On the other hand, he said, the Interstate system drew economic development.
 Pat Williams, a former nine-term Democratic congressman who now teaches public policy at the University of Montana, said: ''There are some places where the adage 'Build it and they will come' won't work. The Hi-Line is one of those places. Expanding a highway will not attract a significant increase in commerce.''

HEADLINE: After Bankruptcy Filing, Recriminations Fly at Air America

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSENand LIA MILLER

 BODY:
In its search for a new chief executive this past summer, Air America Radio interviewed seasoned media executives in an effort to revive the faltering network. One interview took a bizarre turn, however, when the executive got into a political argument with Randi Rhodes, one of the network's on-air hosts.
 ''I laughed and said, 'You sound like Republican talking points,' '' Ms. Rhodes recalled.
At Air America, business and politics always mixed, and that was the problem, critics contend. Begun with an onslaught of publicity in spring 2004 as an alternative to right-wing talk radio, the network is given some of the credit by its supporters for having helped achieve the Democrats' Congressional election victory in November. 
 Detractors label the liberal network's programming as combative, one-note and emotional. At least its business dealings seem to fit that last description. Even before Air America and its corporate parent, Piquant L.L.C., sought bankruptcy protection on Oct. 13, its management was engulfed in a series of financial crises. The search for new investors and managers has been marred by infighting among those who want the network to succeed, according to people in the organization.
 In recent weeks, Air America, which has its headquarters in New York and reaches about 2.4 million listeners weekly, has suffered the defection of a handful of its more than 80 affiliated stations and soon faces the likely departure of its most visible host, Al Franken, even as it cobbles together a plan to emerge from Chapter 11.
 A possible solution surfaced on Friday. Douglas Kreeger, an initial investor and former chief executive who stabilized the network in its early months, said in a telephone interview that there is ''a signed letter of intent'' for a new group to take over the network and that he is ''likely'' to be a part. The lead equity position would be taken by Terence F. Kelly, of Madison, Wis., also an Air America investor from the beginning and a former board chairman. 
 Mr. Kelly said in a separate interview that the investor group included a new strategic media partner he declined to name, and both men would not predict when a deal might come to fruition. 
 ''Any number of things can happen,'' Mr. Kreeger said. 
 This is only the latest twist in the short but contentious history of Air America. At the root of its problems, some critics and competitors say, has been an inability to negotiate a middle path between its political mission and its business. 
 ''It's my feeling that they really put this together without broadcasters,'' said Stuart Krane, a former ABC Radio executive who is the president of Product First, which owns the program of a liberal talk-show host, Ed Schultz. ''If you have a healthy business, then your agenda will be put forth.''
 Air America ran into financial trouble within days of its appearance on March 31, 2004, when it turned out that its original chairman, Evan Cohen, did not have the backing he said he did. Weeks later, Mr. Kelly, a former owner of Midwest radio and television stations, stepped in to take charge of the board. At the end of 2004, he ceded the chairmanship to a new investor, Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. 
 Some people at Air America assert that, under Mr. Glaser and the team he put in place, the network was top-heavy with management, inept at selling ads, unwilling to make program compromises that veered from the liberal message and overstaffed with more than 100 employees when two dozen would have sufficed.
 ''What they did for $45 million they could have done for $10 million,'' said Sheldon Drobny, an investor with a contentious relationship with the network. Mr. Drobny and his wife, Anita, longtime Democratic activists, are credited with the idea for Air America.
 The network has run through a stream of operational executives. Danny Goldberg, a music executive who served as chief for about a year before leaving in April 2006, said the problem was ''a big gap between the ambitions of the company and the funding available to accomplish those ambitions.'' 
 ''There was no way to manage around that gap,'' he said. ''Either lower your expectations or raise more money. No one wanted to change the ambitions.''
 Faced with constant money woes, the board considered a takeover by the Democracy Alliance, a loose group of moneyed progressives, including George Soros, who had pooled resources to support projects they considered worthy. But the group ultimately rejected the appeal, because ''Air America needed to do certain things to make it a more attractive business,'' Mr. Kreeger said. 
 Mr. Kelly said he was disappointed that rich Democrats did not step up to support the network's political goals. On fund-raising calls, he said, he was often turned down because the business plan was too risky.
 He agreed that the network over-spent, ''out of enthusiasm for what we were doing.'' But he said it also ''inherited so many difficulties not of our own making.''
 Saying that Air America reaches millions of listeners and ''clearly had an impact on the 2006 elections,'' Mr Kelly added, ''I think with a relatively small amount of money, we have succeeded wildly.''
 Late in August, the network lost its lease with WLIB in New York and switched to a weaker station, WWRL 1600. Some liberals blamed Product First, which was negotiating its own WLIB deal. It later fell through.
 ''We just saw WLIB as something we might own and do very well with,'' Mr. Krane said. ''There was never any nefarious plot here.''
 Late in September, the Drobnys tried to buy Air America for $2.5 million, but the deal fell apart because, Mr. Drobny says, the terms were changed. He said he would have had to put the money into Piquant's operating account, where it could have been tapped by creditors, instead of into a shielded holding company. 
 In an e-mail message to the board, Mr. Drobny wrote that ''one or more of the board members and attorneys have intentionally taken steps to put the company into Chapter 11 and have taken actions that are intentionally to the detriment of the current members and their creditors.''
 Tracy L. Klestadt, the network's bankruptcy lawyer, termed that ''absolutely inaccurate,'' saying the terms always called for the purchaser to invest in Piquant L.L.C. and ''the Drobnys would not agree to it.'' 
 As for the bankruptcy filing, which came after a creditor, MultiCultural Radio Broadcasting, sought to freeze company accounts, Mr. Klestadt said the board decided a Chapter 11 proceeding ''would be the best way to maximize the value of the assets.''
 Mr. Glaser, who resigned from the board along with Mr. Kreeger and Mr. Kelly at the time of the filing, declined to comment. He is the network's largest creditor with $9.8 million in claims.
 Since Air America sought bankruptcy protection, 5 to 10 potential buyers have looked at the books, Mr. Klestadt said. Late Friday, it told affiliates that ''an official letter of intent has been signed,'' but declined to name the prospective buyer ''due to the sensitive nature of this deal.''
 Some affiliates have grown weary. In recent weeks, an affiliate in the Quad Cities market of western Illinois and eastern Iowa switched its programming to Christmas music, and stations owned by Clear Channel in Boston, Cincinnati and Madison announced plans to bail out. 
 Moreover, Jerry Springer just ended his Air America-syndicated radio show, which never gained a wide audience. Mr. Franken has been telling associates that he is likely torun for the Senate from Minnesota.
 Mr. Franken, who is on a U.S.O. tour of Iraq and Afghanistan and says he is owed $360,750 by the network, declined requests for comment. Through Air America's spokeswoman, he said, that ''although I do not know the specific details about A.A.R.'s progress through the Chapter 11 restructuring process, I was pleased to hear that they had received a letter of intent from a prospective buyer.'' He added his hope ''that the network's ownership situation and financing difficulties will be resolved while I am away.''
 When he returns, he faces competition from an unexpected source: Product First's Ed Schultz, who went on the air in January 2004, three months before Air America. Last week, Mr. Schultz's program moved to a live broadcast against Mr. Franken's.
 Mr. Franken ''gave visibility to the format, but at the end of the day, you'd better be selling a commercial,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''You have to run it like a business.'' 
 Mr. Franken said he was ''pleased to welcome Ed Shultz as a direct competitor.''
 ''Ed's success,'' he added, ''is proof of the vitality of the progressive talk format. I consider Ed a friend -- unless he starts beating me in the ratings, at which point I plan to downgrade him to acquaintance.''
 The Drobnys have started their own network, Nova M Radio, which has two stations and two talk hosts, Mike Newcomb and a former Air America broadcaster, Mike Malloy. They are courting other liberal media people to do programs for the 15 to 20 affiliates they said will soon join them. Mr. Drobny called the effort, ''the second coming of Air America.'' Mr. Kelly said Air America is also in ''active discussions'' with new progressive hosts and hopes to add an investigative unit if his group is successful. 
 Mr. Kreeger added that ''it will be up to us to really create compelling content'' and lure affiliates back. Until then, there is an existing deal with XM Satellite Radio and the network's Web site, which he said had ''absolute untapped potential for 24/7 online streaming that has never been effectively monetized.''
 He disputes the idea that Air America ''was a vanity project,'' but acknowledged that things may be done differently in the future. ''I have come to understand very clearly that the radio component of this requires a radio professional,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fate of Project In Brooklyn Hinges on Nod Of One Man

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Sheldon Silver could always just say no.
 That is the nightmare facing Forest City Ratner, the real estate developer whose $4 billion Atlantic Yards project must now be approved by an obscure state oversight board on which Mr. Silver, the state Assembly speaker, controls one of three votes.
Over three years, Forest City has assembled an astonishingly wide and deep political coalition behind the Brooklyn project, ranging from outgoing Gov. George E. Pataki to Acorn, the liberal advocacy group for low-income people. The developer has endured thousands of pages of studies and reviews, staged hundreds of meetings and hearings, beat back lawsuits and persisted in the face of a growing and energetic coalition of opponents and critics. 
 But now -- once again -- the fate of a multibillion-dollar project comes down to Mr. Silver, a politician who has not hesitated to delay or halt grand development plans when he deems it appropriate.
 It was Mr. Silver, along with Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, who effectively killed the West Side Stadium last year by withholding his vote on the Public Authorities Control Board. And in October, Mr. Silver delayed another major project, the $900 million Moynihan Station, questioning the financing behind it.
 It remains unclear whether Atlantic Yards, which is to include an arena for the Nets, will meet a similar fate. Mr. Silver has said he generally supports the project, along with Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki. Each controls one vote on the board, and the three must vote together to approve a project. They have already set aside $100 million in state funds for Atlantic Yards, and at a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Silver called the Brooklyn project ''worthy of the area.''
 But behind those words lies an array of conflicting agendas and political forces. They include not just the substance of the Yards proposal, but also the divisions between local Assembly members on the project, the lobbying of numerous unions and civic groups and the enduring power politics and rivalries of Albany itself.
 Mr. Silver's vote against Moynihan Station launched a still-simmering war of words between Mr. Silver and Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency overseeing Moynihan Station and the Atlantic Yards project. Mr. Gargano suggested Mr. Silver was crooked, and Mr. Silver returned the favor. Most recently, on Thursday, he called Mr. Gargano ''a dismal failure'' as chairman. 
 Pataki administration officials have suggested that Mr. Silver is eager to deny the governor a legacy project. Mr. Pataki has not yet scheduled a vote on the Yards for the control board's final meeting this year, on Wednesday. That suggests that the governor, with only days left in office, feels he would have more to lose than Mr. Silver would in any showdown. 
 ''Because of the fact that approval requires the vote of all three members, there's an effort to build consensus for these projects,'' said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the governor. ''Right now we're in a review and discussion phase.''
 But the speaker, having already helped delay or kill two major city projects, might not want to face blame for blocking a third.
 Mr. Silver must also contend with the variety of interests represented by his members, and in a town saturated with lobbyists, he is prickly about being lobbied too hard. Many Atlantic Yards supporters are reluctant to speak on the record about the control board vote.
 ''I think undue pressure frequently backfires,'' said James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn assemblyman who has criticized the project and sought to reduce its size -- 8 million square feet -- significantly. 
 Several of his colleagues from north Brooklyn have made similar requests, including Hakeem Jeffries, the assemblyman-elect from the 57th District, which includes most of the 22-acre project site.
 ''I've articulated my concerns to the speaker in writing, and beyond that, I think it would be counterproductive at this time to discuss the matter publicly,'' said Mr. Jeffries, who said he was ''confident'' that Mr. Silver would take into account the views of the Brooklyn delegation. 
 That includes, however, a cluster of state lawmakers from south Brooklyn, who are almost unequivocal in their support of the project as it now stands. Forest City Ratner's chief lobbyist, Bruce Bender, is close to those members; like many of them, he began his career in the area's leading political organization, the Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club. 
 ''Speaker Silver has always acted with the city's and state's best interests at heart, and we are confident he will continue to do what is best for New York,'' Mr. Bender said.
 Forest City is also well connected in Albany circles beyond the Brooklyn legislators. Indeed, for several years after the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Silver convened the Democratic caucus's annual retreat in a hotel the company owned in Battery Park City, near ground zero. (Forest City is also the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company.) 
 Technically, the Public Authorities Control Board has a relatively narrow function: ensuring the integrity and propriety of the state's financial commitments to development projects. And some close to Mr. Silver insisted that he would not use a potential vote as a lever to force unrelated changes to Atlantic Yards, so long as its finances were in order. 
 ''He will continue to be careful that the P.A.C.B. is not a forum for horse-trading or policy judgments and remains a fiscal watchdog over irresponsible state authorities, like E.S.D.C.,'' the Empire State Development Corporation, said Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester assemblyman who is chairman of the committee that oversees public authorities.
 Even on those grounds, however, the project faces some hurdles. Both Forest City Ratner and the development corporation have so far kept the project's financial projections secret. No one else knows how much the developer expects to make from the Atlantic Yards, how big it needs to be to turn a profit, or how much profit will be needed to sustain its more popular elements, including about 2,250 units of moderately priced housing. 
 In recent days, the development corporation has turned over some financial information to Mr. Silver's control board staff. But Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, described it as ''very cursory information, basically what's available on the Web.''
 She added, ''We have asked for some detailed financial and economic information that has not yet been provided.''

HEADLINE: This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Them?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Dec. 16 

 BODY:
When a community rises up against the specter of a behemoth retailer in its midst, that store tends to be a purveyor of cheap toys, discount hardware or 30-roll bundles of toilet paper, not Chilean sea bass, endive and fresh-baked scones. 
 But an unusual neighborhood just north of downtown Los Angeles is waging an equally uncommon battle against Whole Foods, the upscale grocery chain based in Texas. 
The beef is not against the company's labor practices, its threat to small businesses or the products it sells. In fact, residents here say they love Whole Foods. It is just that they are worried about their horses. 
 The community, known locally as the Rancho, is a smattering of horse properties just north of Griffith Park, in a historically working-class area of Burbank that has been gentrifying.
 Behind these far-from-sprawling ranch homes -- the average is about 1,200 square feet -- are horses in tiny stables whose owners are wont to saunter on horseback through the residential streets and onto the Griffith Park trails each day. 
 Because of its adjacency to the park, a large equestrian center and several movie studios -- which used to board horses back in the halcyon days of the western -- the Rancho is one of the few areas near urban Los Angeles zoned for horses, which dozens of homeowners in the area board and ride. Along the quiet suburban blocks, it is not uncommon to see a hitching post in a front lawn, or a rider trotting through the drive-through lane at the Baskin-Robbins. 
 ''This is probably the most unique area in all Los Angeles,'' said Roman Gora, who lives in a small ranch house. His wife's horse, Indie, lives in a stall behind them. This spring, developers proposed building a Whole Foods store on Main Street, the neighborhood's main thoroughfare, on a 177,000-square-foot lot that houses a television caption company. 
 The proposal sparked the ire of some Rancho residents, who anticipated a surge in traffic that would, among other things, spook their beloved horses. ''We don't think this is safe for the community,'' Mr. Gora said.
 The developer, Davies Properties, and Whole Foods, aware of community concerns, offered to expand the street, set the store back from it and add a horse and bike lane. 
 ''We know the neighborhood this is proposed to go into is a very sensitive neighborhood,'' said an adviser to Davies, Michael R. Hastings. 
 But it was not enough to appease the opposition, whose members peppered the area with leaflets warning that residents could lose their horse properties, that trucks would be barreling through the neighborhood at all hours, and that the increase in cars would threaten schoolchildren crossing local streets.
 In a move that stunned both the developer and those Burbank residents longing for an outpost of organic foods, the city's planning board, ignoring the recommendation of its staff that it accept the Whole Foods proposal, turned down the plan in October. 
 Undaunted, Davies Properties is taking its case to City Hall, where the City Council will give the final word on the project in January. 
 ''Are we glad we are being considered for a Whole Foods? Absolutely,'' said Todd Campbell, the mayor of Burbank, a post that rotates among Council members. ''It is a premium store that reflects that Burbank is on the rise in terms of economic vitality.'' 
 But Mr. Campbell would not say if he would cast his vote in the interest of horses or horseradish. ''We're very protective of our community,'' he said. ''We are a suburb with a hometown feel determined not to become another L.A. city.'' 
 Whole Foods executives dismiss the fight as one between the developer and the neighborhood, and said they would not scale down the proposed size of their store. ''We're not in a battle with anyone,'' said Michael Besancon, the president of the company's Southern Pacific region. 
 The store has its supporters, some of whom said they failed to speak up previously because they never imagined it was in danger. ''I went to the planning board meeting,'' said Brian McGovern, a resident and horse property owner. ''I thought, 'How is Whole Foods going to put my children in danger?' ''
 Citing new speed bumps and traffic lanes as a boon to the area, Mr. McGovern said he was tired of driving to North Hollywood for his Whole Foods fix and worried what could come to the property instead. ''They are doing things that I don't think any commercial property would do,'' he said. ''We have a golden goose, and we are cutting its head off.''

HEADLINE: Tax Leads Americans Abroad to Renounce U.S.

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
She is a former marine, a native Californian and, now, an ex-American who prefers to remain discreet about abandoning her citizenship. After 10 years of warily considering options, she turned in her United States passport last month without ceremony, becoming an alien in the view of her homeland.
 ''It's a really hard thing to do,'' said the woman, a 16-year resident of Geneva who had tired of the cost and time of filing yearly United States tax returns on top of her Swiss taxes. ''I just kept putting this off. But it's my kids and the estate tax. I don't care if I die with only one Swiss franc to my name, but the U.S. shouldn't get money I earned here when I die.'' 
 Historically, small numbers of Americans have turned in their passports every year for political and economic reasons, with the numbers reaching a high of about 2,000 during the Vietnam War in the early 1970s.
 But after Congress sharply raised taxes this year for many Americans living abroad, some international tax lawyers say they detect rising demand from citizens to renounce ties with the United States, the only developed country that taxes it citizens while they live overseas. Americans abroad are also taxed in the countries where they live. 
 ''The administrative costs of being an American and living outside the U.S. have gone up dramatically,'' said Marnin Michaels, a tax lawyer with Baker & McKenzie in Zurich.
 So far this year, the Internal Revenue Service has tallied 509 Americans who have given up their citizenship, said Anthony Burke, an I.R.S. spokesman in Washington. He said complete figures were still being calculated. 
 Applications to renounce citizenship are on the rise at the American Embassy in Paris, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity. At the embassy in London, the number of applications was reported to be fairly stable over the past two years, though it would be hard to spot a recent surge because applications are taking longer to process there than in past years. Neither embassy would disclose exact figures. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in London, Karen Maxfield, said Americans living abroad usually took the step ''because they do not have strong ties to the United States and do not believe that they will ever live there in the future.''
 ''All have two citizenships and generally say they would like to simplify their lives by giving up a citizenship they are not using,'' she said.
 Andy Sundberg, a director of the Geneva-based American Citizens Abroad, has been tracking renunciations dating back to the 1960s through annual Treasury Department figures. He considers the numbers low compared with some stretches in the past, like the early 1970s. But he has also noticed a recent increase in interest among Americans in renouncing their citizenship. 
 ''I think the cup is boiling over for a number of people living abroad,'' Mr. Sundberg said. ''With the Internet and the speed and the ubiquity of information, people are more aware of what's happening.'' With the changes in the tax laws, he said, some Americans living abroad fear ''they're heading toward a real storm.''
 He cited a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, which polled its members in October and November and found that many were considering returning to the United States because of the higher taxes.
 Concern about taxes among Americans living abroad has surged since President Bush signed into law a bill that sharply raises tax rates for those with incomes of more than $82,400 a year. The legislation also increases taxes on employer-provided benefits like housing allowances.
 The changes, enacted in May, apply retroactively to Jan. 1, 2006.
 Matthew Ledvina, an international tax lawyer in Geneva, said demand for legal counsel on the citizenship issue was coming largely from American citizens who held second passports and who had minimal ties to the United States.
 ''There are incentives to do it before the end of the year so that you can minimize your future reporting,'' he said.
 Mr. Ledvina said the waiting period for appointments at the American Embassy in London had increased from a few days to more than three and a half months. He said he had recently approached embassies in Vienna, Bern, London, Paris and Brussels before finally getting an appointment in Amsterdam for a client's renunciation application. 
 The legal ritual of renunciation is largely unique to the United States because other countries base taxation on residency, not citizenship, according to Ingmar Dorr, a tax lawyer with Lovells in Munich.
 ''We don't have that issue,'' he said. ''We only have the problem that rich people who don't want to pay taxes in Germany just move to a lower-tax country in Switzerland.''
 For some Americans abroad, motivations for renunciation are mixed and complex, involving social concerns, political displeasure with their government and other reasons. But it is clear that taxation plays a large role for many, even though few are willing to admit that because of penalties enacted a decade ago. 
 In 1996, Congress tried to address a wave of tax-driven expatriation by the wealthy by requiring former citizens to file tax returns for a decade and forbidding Americans who renounced their passports for tax reasons from visiting the United States.
 But in practice, the government is mainly interested in wealthier ex-citizens with a net worth of more than $2 million -- few of whom pay further United States taxes because they generally avoid making American financial investments after giving up citizenship, Mr. Ledvina said. As for the rule barring entry to tax refugees, he said, it has not been enforced by the authorities.
 Still, that possibility prompts ex-citizens to tread carefully and remain discreet about their choices.
 ''I didn't give up my citizenship with a sense of hostility,'' said an importer in Geneva who renounced her citizenship as President Bush was taking office in 2001. ''I gave it up with a sense of fairness.''

HEADLINE: Harrah's Is Said to Be in Talks to Accept $16.7 Billion Buyout 

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Harrah's, the world's largest casino company, was near a deal last night to be sold to Apollo Group and Texas Pacific Group for about $16.7 billion, according to people involved in the negotiations. 
 However, the talks appeared to have stalled late in the evening over certain contract terms and conditions that could derail an agreement, these people said. Still, they suggested that the two sides expected to continue negotiations today.
The talks occurred as Apollo Group was involved in another big deal today, the acquisition of Realogy, the real estate franchisor.
 It could not be learned exactly what was the stumbling block in the Harrah's talks, but people involved said it related to closing details.
 ''Some of the points are deal breakers,'' one person said, ''but I think we'll eventually get over them.''
 Harrah's board has been meeting since Wednesday to review two offers for the company, one from Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group, and another from Penn National Gaming. Harrah's operates casinos under the names of Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and elsewhere.
 Harrah's board entered exclusive negotiations with Apollo and Texas Pacific after the team raised its bid this week from $88.50 a share to $90 a share, the people said. Apollo and Texas Pacific had originally approached Harrah's this fall with an offer worth $81 a share, and later sweetened the bid to $83.50 a share, but Harrah's continued to rebuff them. 
 After being approached, Harrah's decided to hold an auction, and hired UBS to conduct it. 
 Including Harrah's long-term debt of nearly $10.7 billion as of June 30, the bid for Harrah's is worth $27.4 billion, which would make it the fourth-biggest buyout in the United States this year, according to Thomson Financial. The three biggest deals were buyouts of Equity Office Properties Trust, an office-building owner; HCA, which operates hospitals; and Kinder Morgan, an energy company.
 The bidding for Harrah's was the second heated competition for a casino operator this year. This spring, Aztar, the operator of the Tropicana hotels and casinos, was the subject of a bidding war ultimately won by Columbia Sussex for $2 billion. 
 But even if the deal is consummated, the two buyout firms must still navigate a thicket of gambling regulations that have stymied many previous such deals. It was only in the late 1990s that Colony Capital, another private equity firm, established a new ownership structure that opened the door to private equity investment. In buying Harveys Casino Resorts, a publicly traded company, Colony caused Harveys to issue two classes of stock, one with voting rights and one with the economic interest but no voting rights. The two principals who controlled Colony owned the voting shares of Harveys, so they were the only individuals required to have a license. 
 Since then, several private equity investments using that structure, or variations of it, have won approval in Nevada, a vital jurisdiction in casino mergers and acquisitions, as well as other jurisdictions. 
 Shares in Harrah's closed Friday afternoon at $79.50. In after-hours trading last night, the stock was trading up slightly at $79.75.

HEADLINE: Swift Raids

 BODY:
When federal immigration officials raided six plants owned by Swift & Company, the world's second largest beef and pork processor, last Tuesday, they brought Spanish translators. They knew exactly what kind of worker is found in low-paying, strenuous jobs in this country: recent Latino arrivals with limited skills and, in many cases, no legal papers. Nearly 1,300 people -- almost 10 percent of Swift's work force -- were taken away in what the government said was the largest but not the last assault on the underground immigrant economy. 
 The raids have led some people to heap scorn on Swift and, of course, on the illegal immigrants, particularly the dozens of detainees who have been charged with identity theft and other crimes. But doing so misses the bigger picture. Swift and its workers are merely Exhibit A in an immigration system that is failing in all of its parts.
It is a system that rewards illegality and pays lip service to lawfulness and order. 
 Swift insists that it is a model corporate citizen. It obeyed the rules, which require it to check workers' identity papers and file so-called I-9 forms attesting to that. And it went further, participating in the federal Basic Pilot program, a system of checking Social Security numbers that President Bush has touted as a way to crack down on immigration fraud. The company says that prying any more aggressively into workers' legal status would leave it open to civil rights lawsuits.
 The Swift raids are powerful evidence that I-9's and Basic Pilot are ineffective and disingenuous, a nod to by-the-books technical lawfulness that allows a far vaster world of illegality to flourish. Swift and other large-scale employers of immigrants, like farms and hotels, may insist that they never knowingly hire people illegally. But as long as the jobs they offer are the kinds whose pay and conditions consistently fail to attract native-born Americans, their protests will ring hollow. This system is brilliantly efficient at bringing lots of cheap products and services to market, which is great unless you mind its essential lawlessness, anonymity and reliance on an enormous work force of silent, compliant, frightened people whose bitter choice is to stay here illegally or go home and be desperately poor.
 Swift, by its lights, was doing the right thing. The federal government was doing the right thing, waking up, belatedly, to workplace enforcement. And yet it's impossible to see how this will work over the long term. Immigration reform built on piecemeal enforcement -- factory raids and border walls -- won't solve the problem of the 12 million illegal immigrants already here. The American economy wouldn't stand the shock if the Swift raids were multiplied to levels beyond the merely symbolic. 
 The system needs what Mr. Bush and Congress have refused to give it: a way to end the sham. Comprehensive immigration reform is good for the economy, giving companies access to a secure and stable work force. It is good for national security, allowing law enforcement to go after real criminals and leave honest working people alone. And it is good for the immigrant workers across the country, terrorized by Tuesday's raids, who just want to keep doing their jobs, no matter how hard and distasteful.

HEADLINE: Blessed by a U.S. Official, China Will Buy 4 Nuclear Reactors 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
China will buy four Westinghouse nuclear reactors in a deal that shows the continued attractiveness of American technology, but may also stir worries in Washington that the United States is selling its competitive advantage one industry at a time.
 Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman of the United States and Ma Kai, the minister of China's National Development and Reform Commission, signed a memorandum of understanding for the reactors in Beijing on Saturday. The deal calls for the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation to buy the reactors from Westinghouse Electric, which the Toshiba Corporation, based in Tokyo, bought earlier this year.
 Neither side announced a value for the reactors. But outside analysts have suggested the total price tag may be $5 billion to $8 billion. 
 Michael R. Wessel, a commissioner of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was created by Congress to review bilateral relations, expressed concern on Sunday that based on the broad outlines of the deal, ''it appears they are doing what other companies have done, which is to transfer the technology upfront.''
 Such deals limit the long-term benefits to the United States, while clearly helping China, he said. Chinese companies have been acquiring technology from Western companies in the last year for everything from aircraft assembly to car design and engine manufacturing.
 China's purchase of American nuclear technology could also stir security concerns in the United States, particularly after objections in Congress last year to a bid by Cnooc, the Chinese-controlled oil and gas company, for the United States oil company Unocal, and this year to DP World, of Dubai, taking control of operations at American ports. Both bids ultimately failed.
 But having a Bush cabinet official like Mr. Bodman announce the deal could limit objections to the transaction, at least among Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have tended to be the most outspoken about technology transfers to China. The deal also comes after Congress has adjourned for the year, which should mute political reaction.
 American politicians may also be cautious about publicly criticizing the deal right away because of the possibility of an unspoken link between the nuclear technology deal and efforts by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to persuade China to allow faster appreciation of its currency. 
 Stephen R. Tritch, the chief executive and president of Westinghouse, said in a statement that half the value of the contract would be done in China, but that the work would nonetheless support 5,000 design, engineering and manufacturing jobs in the United States. Mr. Tritch said that the deal would also make it possible, however, for China to build future nuclear reactors with less help from overseas.
 ''Westinghouse, our U.S. supplier base and our consortium partners will continue to benefit much as we do now in the Republic of Korea, where recent new plant awards from that country's maturing industry still provide about $100 million per plant in U.S. scope,'' he said.
 Mr. Bodman said at the signing ceremony that ''the Chinese were very demanding.'' But he did not elaborate on whether he was referring to the extent of technology transfers, frequently a sticking point in the past, or to other issues. 
 Vaughn Gilbert, a Westinghouse spokesman, said that the company had successfully licensed technology to France for many years and believed that it could properly manage the transfer of technology to China.
 Thomas Donnelly, another member of the United States-China commission, said that civilian nuclear reactors had little military value for China, which has greater interest in miniaturizing its nuclear warheads and improving missile technology. 
 Westinghouse prevailed in the bidding over Areva of France and AtomStroyExport of Russia. China excluded General Electric because it makes boiling water reactors, instead of pressurized water reactors. 
 Ruth A. Shapiro, the executive director of the Asia Business Council, said that China was in an excellent position to play multinationals against each other to obtain the most advantageous terms.
 ''We can be sure all of them offered great deals, given how competitive the supply side is and how thin the demand is,'' she said.
 Westinghouse and its rivals still have a chance at further orders. The International Energy Agency predicted last month that China's nuclear power generation capacity would increase by 9,000 megawatts by 2015, to 15,000 megawatts. The four reactors announced on Saturday, which are to be completed by 2013, will each have a capacity of 1,100 megawatts.
 The transaction is not big enough to make much of a difference in China's contribution to global warming or air pollution, as China's reliance on coal will continue to dwarf its use of nuclear energy in the years ahead, energy specialists said.
 The International Energy Agency projects that China will add 331,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity by 2015, for a total of 638,000 megawatts. That is the main reason China is expected to move past the United States in 2009 as the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas.
 Mr. Bodman announced separately in Beijing that the United States would work with China to find ways to make coal-fired plants more efficient, and to capture and store the carbon dioxide that they release.

HEADLINE: Corps Proposal for Gulf Draws Criticism From Scientists

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
Ambitious federal plans to repair the Gulf Coast and defend it against future hurricanes are coming under fire from many coastal scientists who say they would only perpetuate a costly and wrongheaded approach to storm management.
 The projects are still in the planning stages by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been ordered by Congress to present its long-term, comprehensive plans by the end of 2007.
 In addition to short-term repair projects, the corps is considering large and elaborate systems of walls and barriers, offshore breakwaters, dune reconstruction on offshore barrier islands, levees and mechanical barriers or gates that would close across inlets to keep surging storm waters out.
 Many scientists have long objected to seawalls, other coastal armor and even some beach restoration projects as costly interventions that can damage the very beaches they are supposed to protect. But they say the larger projects will have the same effects, only worse. 
 ''The most shocking thing to me is that they would even consider some of the things that they are considering,'' said Robert J. Young, new director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines, a project of Duke and Western Carolina universities. 
 At a special session about the corps's proposals at a meeting of the Geological Society of America in October, Dr. Young said his fellow scientists ''were just stunned.'' Dr. Young, who helped organize the session, added, ''I saw mouths dropping open at the scale of proposed coastal engineering.'' 
 David B. Shaver, chief of the geological resources division of the National Park Service, said the session was important in making sure that ''the professional geological community was aware of what was going on.'' He is concerned with the proposals because they affect islands in the Gulf Islands National Seashore.
 The corps says it is working closely with state agencies, federal emergency management officials and environmental regulators, ''trying to come up with a plan that would retain the quality of life'' but also keep residents ''as far out of harm's way as possible,'' in the words of Susan Ivester Rees, a marine scientist with its Mobile district in Alabama, where much of the work is coordinated. 
 ''We are putting a balanced emphasis on everything in as great detail as we can,'' she said. While there are ''a lot of innovative engineering solutions,'' she continued, the corps will look at relocation and other approaches ''beyond your typical asphalt on the ground.''
 The scientists and the corps agree on one point: Hurricane Katrina ''changed Mississippi's Gulf Coast forever,'' as the corps said in its outline of its proposals, ''Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program, Interim Report'' (http://mscip.usace.army.mil/downloads.asp). 
 As the report puts it, ''beachfront neighborhoods were leveled entirely, and estimates by officials have calculated that 90 percent of the structures within one-half mile of the coastline were completely destroyed.''
 But Dr. Young said the corps's approach was ''designed to let those folks put most of that infrastructure back in place.'' 
 ''We have already seen those communities wiped out twice in 37 years,'' he went on, referring to Hurricane Camille, in 1969, and Hurricane Katrina. ''And it's not just that the coast of Mississippi is going to have the same vulnerability; the vulnerability is only going to increase because of sea level rise,'' which most climate experts agree is accelerating because of global warming.
 The proposal that seems to have aroused the most shock and amazement among the geologists would be the most seaward line of defense: a proposal to rebuild offshore barrier islands to their size and shape before Camille, an epic undertaking that would require almost unimaginable amounts of sand, to say nothing of money. ''We are in the billions, easily,'' said Rebecca Beavers, coastal geology coordinator for the Park Service and another organizer of the G.S.A. session. 
 When the geologists at the meeting heard about this plan, ''some people were quite dismayed,'' she said. ''Some people were almost incensed.''
 Even Dr. Rees of the corps agrees that it is far from certain that any island-building project would be worth its economic and environmental cost. 
 ''What we're looking at is restoring the footprint,'' she said, and building dunes perhaps 20 feet high on the islands. But one of them, Ship Island, was cut in two by Camille, and the separation has grown since then. Also, Dr. Rees said, a 20-foot dune, ''which is what was there prior to Camille, probably doesn't give you protection from a Katrina, because the surge at Katrina was higher than that.'' 
 The corps estimates that the storm surge at Ship Island was at least 35 feet. ''I cannot even imagine it,'' she said. 
 In any case, Dr. Beavers said, under the Park Service mandate to maintain its islands in their natural state, restoration efforts are typically undertaken only to mitigate damage by people. 
 Dr. Rees said, ''Obviously, this is going to take a lot of discussion.''
 A similar issue has also arisen, on a much smaller scale, elsewhere in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, on Santa Rosa Island, near Pensacola, Fla. There the issue is whether to rebuild a road that storms have washed out four times since 2004.
 The federal government is prepared to rebuild the road, but only if something is done to prevent it from washing out again. Engineers have proposed installing metal sheet piling and other armor. But more than a dozen coastal scientists from around the country have objected. In a letter to the Park Service, they say armoring the road will interfere with natural sand movement on the island, causing it to narrow. ''This is not science-based management,'' they wrote. 
 Eventually, Dr. Rees predicted, the public will understand that it will not be possible to protect all the buildings and roads and other infrastructure on the coast without destroying what people love about the landscape. ''They do not want to see a 40-foot-high seawall,'' she said. 
 Dr. Rees predicted that the region would end up with a mix of solutions, including coastal armor but also ''buyout, relocation, flood-proofing, elevating houses.''
 But no remedy is foolproof. Dr. Rees said, for example, that Hurricane Katrina destroyed a house she owned on Dauphin Island, Ala. ''The first floor of that house was plus-14,'' she said, referring to its elevation above sea level. ''If you start going much higher than that, not only is it very hard to access, but your construction considerations are tremendously magnified. On top of that, you put yourself into a totally different wind field.'' 
 That tells her, she said, that ''trying to come up with a plan that would retain the quality of life but also try to put people out of harm's way is not going to be possible everywhere.''
 ''Basically,'' Dr. Rees said, ''all we can do is educate the community.''
 But in the 30 years that she has lived in the region, she said, people seem to be learning the wrong lessons. Devastating coastal storms now serve not as warnings but as engines of development, sweeping existing structures away and leaving clear land for bigger and better buildings. ''That's been a typical response since the early 1980s,'' Dr. Rees said. 
 ''In the Gulf Shores-Orange Beach area, they went from almost 100 percent single-family residences and very small hotels to high rise after high rise after high rise,'' she said. Seeing that stretch of Alabama coast today, she said, ''you could not in your wildest dreams imagine what it looked like then. It was a very nice place to live.''

HEADLINE: Chris Hayward, 81, TV Writer And a Creator of 'Munsters'

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Chris Hayward, an Emmy-winning writer for television whose work was once banned in Canada because of the painful inadequacies of one of its leading men -- the righteous, square-jawed and stupendously slow-witted Mountie Dudley Do-Right -- died on Nov. 20 at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. Mr. Hayward, who was also a creator of ''The Munsters,'' was 81.
 The cause was cancer, said his wife, Linda Simmons Hayward. She said that news of Mr. Hayward's death had been made public only recently. 
Mr. Hayward was for many years a writer for Jay Ward Productions, creators of the subversive animated cartoons starring Rocky the flying squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose. Originally broadcast on ABC in 1959 as ''Rocky and His Friends,'' the program, renamed ''The Bullwinkle Show,'' moved to NBC in 1961; it returned to ABC from 1964 to 1973.
 A sophisticated cold war spoof (moose and squirrel are locked in endless battle with the perfidious Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale), the show attracted an ardent cult following and has been blessed with eternal life in syndication. It comprised various segments, including ''Fractured Fairy Tales,'' narrated by Edward Everett Horton, and ''Peabody's Improbable History,'' starring a cerebral dog.
 Mr. Hayward worked on all the segments but was most closely associated with ''The Adventures of Dudley Do-Right,'' which followed the hapless royal Canadian Mountie in his ceaseless pursuit of Snidely Whiplash, a very naughty man.
 Because the Dudley Do-Right segments were deemed harmful to the national esteem, the Rocky and Bullwinkle shows were initially not broadcast in Canada.
 With Allan Burns, Mr. Hayward also conceived of ''The Munsters.'' The show, which chronicled the twisted fortunes of a family of ghouls, was broadcast on CBS from 1964 to 1966. At first, the two men received no credit for creating it. Only after the Writers Guild of America took up their case with the producer, Universal Studios, were they awarded credit and financial compensation.
 In 1968, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Burns won Emmy Awards for their work on ''He & She,'' a short-lived comedy on CBS starring Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss.
 Christopher Robert Hayward was born on June 19, 1925, in Bayonne, N.J. A self-taught singer and composer, he left high school before graduating to pursue a musical career in Los Angeles. But he suffered from stage fright and, encouraged by a night class in screenwriting, switched careers. During the 1950's, he worked for Mr. Ward on the animated series ''Crusader Rabbit.''
 In addition to his wife, Mr. Hayward is survived by a sister, Doreen Nagle of Fresno, Calif.; three children from a previous marriage, Laurel Hayward of London and Ojai, Calif.; Victoria O'Connor of London; and Tony Hayward of Ventura, Calif.; and two grandchildren.
 Among the other shows for which Mr. Hayward wrote are ''Get Smart'' and ''Barney Miller.'' But no subsequent job could match the peculiar charms of working for Jay Ward, a rogue cartoon producer famous for his economy. Jay Ward Productions was no Hanna-Barbera: Mr. Hayward often worked in a freezing basement, for little compensation beyond the joy of writing deliciously bad puns for the masses.
 ''The pay was low and the insecurity great,'' he told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. ''Jay felt the writers should pay him. His theory was 'Never show a profit or else you'll have to pay people.' ''

HEADLINE: Paying Health Care From Pensions Proves Costly

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Many local governments began turning to their pension funds to help pay for health care for retired public workers in the 1990s. Some are now regretting it. 
 When the financial markets were producing soaring returns, governments sought to use the gains in their pension funds to help cover rising health costs. Then came years of investment losses and double-digit increases in health care costs.
Now, in some places, money for retiree health care is running out, and money for pensions is dwindling fast, too. Rising medical costs are particularly wreaking havoc on public pension funds in Chicago; Battle Creek, Mich.; and the state of Alaska. They threaten longer-term harm in Cincinnati. 
 ''The numbers are frightening to anyone who really looks,'' said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan research group in Chicago, where three separate pension funds for public workers have been paying for health benefits along with the usual retirement stipends. 
 The troubles foreshadow broader government problems -- not just in those that combined their pension and retiree medical accounts -- as states and localities that never estimated the cost of their retirees' health care move to do so now.
 Donald Rueckert Jr., senior vice president and an actuary with Aon Consulting who has been helping state and local governments with these calculations, said that when all the numbers are done, under a new accounting rule, the governments' total retiree health bill will probably turn out to be about $1.1 trillion. 
 Relieving the strain on government budgets from rising health care costs will probably mean taking one or more unwelcome steps: tax increases, union givebacks, sales of bonds or public assets, mass-transit fare increases, or increases in the cost of other local services. These measures are so unappealing that few who understand the problem are pushing them very hard.
 The local troubles also offer a sense of the challenge in store on a national scale as the obligations of Medicare and Social Security rise sharply to cover the retirement of the baby boom generation. While the two federal programs maintain separate accounts, economists have warned repeatedly that they have both promised benefits well beyond what they can reasonably be expected to pay. 
 For the Chicago Transit Authority's pension fund, the problems are real now. A recent study showed that the plan, which covers nearly 20,000 people, could run out of money for retiree health care in early 2007 -- and that the money to pay pensions could be gone by 2012.
 ''There were decisions taken years ago that seemed harmless at the time, but now they're very problematic,'' said John V. Kallianis, the plan's executive director. 
 One was the decision in 1980 to start paying retiree health benefits without setting aside enough money to cover the cost. ''Anyone who has embedded their obligation for their retiree health plan in their pension fund and doesn't think it's going to be a big drain on the assets of that pension fund is crazy,'' said Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now managing director of research at Glass, Lewis & Company, a proxy advisory firm. 
 But many local governments and their financial advisers did not see it that way in the 1980s and 1990s. While rules were established aimed at protecting pension assets, their investments were doing so well then that there seemed to be plenty of money to spare. Building a retiree health plan into a pension fund seemed an efficient way to use the ''excess'' and take pressure off the local budget at the same time. 
 Battle Creek's pension fund for police and firefighters has been paying for retiree health care since 1980, when the benefits cost about $60,000 a year; now they cost $1.8 million. The pension fund was to run out of money for retiree health at the end of this year, but officials obtained an emergency 90-day appropriation from the city while they seek a longer-term solution. 
 In Alaska, where the state Constitution guarantees retired public workers' health care, towns and school districts have been watching in amazement as their mandatory pension contributions doubled this year -- even though Alaska tried to rein in costs by closing the state pension fund to new employees. The bills are growing to make up for prior years, when Alaska underestimated the cost of the health benefits by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Mr. Msall of the Civic Federation said it would be a mistake for these places to delay action in hopes that big pension investment returns could solve the problem. ''There's no way the market is going to keep up with the inflationary pressures of unmanaged health care costs,'' he said.
 Like many public pension funds, the Chicago transit plan receives contributions from both the workers and their employer. Currently, 3 percent of every worker's paycheck goes into the pension fund, while the Chicago Transit Authority puts in another 6 percent of its payroll.
 But the employees have been told that the money going into the pension fund is not nearly enough to cover the pension and health payments coming out.
 ''Medical costs are shooting way out of control,'' said Jim Collins, a city bus driver, ''and nobody is giving a whistle.''
 With the assets draining away, the transit authority and the Amalgamated Transit Union have been trying to negotiate a package of higher contributions or benefit cuts that could stop the bleeding. But the talks have stalled. The state legislature passed a law requiring the plan to be correctly funded starting in 2009 but did not make clear how this would happen. 
 Mr. Collins has been driving for 24 years and will qualify to retire next year, when he turns 55. He said he was tired of traffic jams, predawn shifts and workplace politics. By next year he will have earned a pension of about $2,800 a month.
 But planning his retirement is impossible, he said, with the retiree health plan teetering on the brink. If he retired on schedule and the health plan failed, he could be left with no insurance for 10 years, until he turns 65 and qualifies for Medicare. 
 Transit workers are not the only ones in Chicago in this predicament. The pension plan for Cook County's roughly 40,000 government workers and retirees has been paying for retiree health care since 1991, at a cost currently running at about $37 million a year. 
 Cook County's chief financial officer, Thomas J. Glaser, said that the county never authorized this diversion -- the pension trustees did it unilaterally, he contended. The nine-member pension board is dominated by locally influential people who represent the county's workers and retirees, and they can easily outvote the two trustees who represent the county. 
 Since the county never agreed to the provision, Mr. Glaser said, it was disavowing any obligation for retiree health. ''No one can impose a liability on the county without the county's approval,'' he said.
 If Cook County succeeds in bowing out, its 26,000 active government workers will be liable for their retired former co-workers' health care. Their contributions to the pension fund, now 8.5 percent of each paycheck, would have to rise. Employees have not yet been told of this possibility, but Mr. Glaser said he expected it to become apparent in the next few months when the county board debates next year's budget.
 Elsewhere, plans have been tripped up by misreading actuarial projections and thinking there was ''extra'' pension money when there was not. One common error has been to spend investment income before it has been earned.
 Another is to underestimate the rate of health cost inflation. Estimates typically assume the rate will taper off to 5 percent in the next few years, even though health inflation has been running at almost double that, with little sign of slowing.
 The Internal Revenue Service permits pension money to be spent on health care only if certain rules are followed, to keep health payments from bleeding the pension assets. In recent years, governments have thought they could comply by creating a separate account for health benefits inside their pension funds and limiting their contributions to the health account to no more than 25 percent of the total.
 But with gray areas in the tax law and the accounting rules for pensions, those steps may not have been enough to prevent violations.
 Some cities have also promised comprehensive health coverage to all retirees, even those who retire in their 40s. Cities and states that offer narrower benefits, or do not permit such early retirement, are less likely to find themselves squeezed.
 New York City never dipped into its pension fund to pay retiree health benefits but, like many places, it did not set aside any money to pay retiree health care obligations. Instead, it has used the pay-as-you-go method, taking money from each year's budget to pay current health bills. 
 Now that the new accounting rule has forced New York, along with other state and local governments, to look ahead, the city has just published the total estimated future cost of its retirees' health care: $53.5 billion in today's dollars.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said that the city will set up a new trust fund, separate from the pension fund, and prime it with $2.2 billion from the city's current surplus. While the down payment is small relative to what is owed, credit analysts expressed approval that New York, unlike most other places, was at least starting with a plan.
 Still, not every government is in trouble. Alameda County, Calif., which includes Oakland, says it has kept its plans responsibly funded even though it uses pension money for retirees' health care. Still, the fund's executive director called the situation unusual. 
 Other places that have tried to set aside ample resources are running into problems anyway. The pension fund in Cincinnati, for one, shows an unusually large amount of money available to pay for promised pensions and health care. 
 The trouble is, those rosy numbers have recently encouraged the city to withhold contributions -- effectively borrowing from the pension fund -- to shift money to neighborhood development projects even as it is accelerating retirement benefits coming due. Cincinnati is downsizing its municipal work force and offering early retirees and their dependents health care at little or no cost. 
 ''It's like musical chairs,'' said Christopher Smitherman, a former Cincinnati City Council member. ''Whose lap is this whole problem going to fall into?''
 Local officials dispute Mr. Smitherman's contention, saying they are trying to strike a balance between the pension fund and other pressing needs, like hiring more police. When he issued his budget proposals last month, Mayor Mark Mallory said that he remained ''committed to fully funding the retirement system.''
 The Chicago Transit Authority's problems are beyond dispute. The president of the union local representing its railway workers, Rick Harris, said that the workers could double their pension contributions -- and the retirees could chip in for their health care -- and it would still not be enough. 
 ''We're putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,'' Mr. Harris said. 

This series is examining the actions of state and local governments that have left taxpayers with large unpaid bills for public employee pensions. Other articles in this series are available at nytimes.com/business.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Dec. 19, about the financial problems that health plans for retired government workers are causing in some cities, misstated the amount that New York City intends to set aside in a trust fund to pay for its retired workers' health care. It is $2 billion, which is to be paid over fiscal years 2006 and 2007 -- not $2.2 billion, which is the city's contribution to the trust fund in fiscal 2006 as well as its outlay for retiree health care in the same year.

HEADLINE: Making a Life in the United States, but Feeling Mexico's Tug 

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO 

 BODY:
It is the fourth quarter, with South San Antonio High School holding a narrow lead over its archrival in the biggest football game of the year, and most everyone in the bleachers is standing and hollering. But not Raquel Rodriguez. 
 Her son, Jaime, a second-string defensive back, paces the sideline, anxious for a chance to play. Mrs. Rodriguez, shivering in a vinyl car coat and sling-back heels, hardly notices the game, obsessing instead over her family's cellphone bills unfolded across her lap.
She calculates when her cash flow might allow her to pay them, just under $180 in all, and worries she will end up late. She hopes that Jaime will not be sent onto the field, fretting out loud that her health insurance might not cover him if he were injured. 
 ''I can't stand to see them hitting my son,'' she sighed, confessing that 11 years after moving here from Mexico, she still does not understand the game of football or feel part of the larger American way of life that her son so embraces. 
 That Mrs. Rodriguez, 46, was in the bleachers at all was a testament to her many achievements as an immigrant. The eldest of nine brothers and sisters from Monterrey, an industrial city in northern Mexico, Mrs. Rodriguez is the only one in her family who has papers to live legally in the United States.
 Reporters and a photographer from The New York Times spent a week in October following Mrs. Rodriguez and two of her sisters, Veronica and Irma, all of whom speak primarily Spanish, to chronicle the American immigration experience through the turbulent, intertwined lives of one family from Mexico.
 Mrs. Rodriguez's legal immigration status has been both a privilege and a burden. Like countless others from Mexico, the largest source of newcomers to this country, Mrs. Rodriguez has secured a stable, decent life in the United States with her husband and two children, far better than anything she could have hoped for where she was born.
 But she does not feel settled here, and remains endlessly embroiled in the struggle to raise up her brothers and sisters as well. 
 Immigration is often a family affair, and a messy one at that. Mrs. Rodriguez's siblings -- whose last names are not being published here because they have immigrated illegally -- grew up under the same leaky roof, with the same abusive father and in the same poverty that had them sometimes begging for food. 
 Many years later, they have made economic gains, but the temptations and frustrations of immigration have separated the family, leaving none of them completely satisfied that they have taken the right course. 
 Veronica, Mrs. Rodriguez's youngest sister, lives across town with her husband and children, an illegal resident haunted by fear that her family's progress could be undone in a moment by the immigration authorities. Irma, Mrs. Rodriguez's eldest sister, gave up on San Antonio after trying to survive here for seven years and now whiles away her days in Monterrey regretting that decision.
 Still, Mrs. Rodriguez's home remains a strategic beachhead for them and her other siblings. They seek her out for a warm meal, a ride or a cash advance as they navigate her adopted country. Those in Mexico rely on her charity too, which she delivers piled high in the back of her pickup in the form of second-hand clothes, toys and household supplies.
 ''She was like Santa,'' said Veronica, who received gifts of dolls, pants and underwear in Monterrey from her big sister and later slept on her floor when first getting established in San Antonio.
 At times, the family bond is strained by resentment. Quarrels erupt, social graces are ignored and feelings hurt. After Mrs. Rodriguez shared her home for months with Veronica's family, the crowding irritated everyone and she asked them to leave. Both sisters felt bruised in Veronica's hasty departure. 
 But Mrs. Rodriguez does not complain. She has an obligation, she says, almost an obsession, to use her Texas foothold to lift her whole clan. 
 ''My family is always first,'' she says fiercely. ''Always.'' 
 Despite her tenacity, Mrs. Rodriguez's family is not as close as she wants. Dinnertime comes and her husband is working late, her son is at team practice. Her daughter, Gabriela, 22, has a family of her own. Mrs. Rodriguez sits on her blue corduroy couch, yawning with fatigue. Half of her torn heart remains in Mexico.

Running From the Past
 As Mrs. Rodriguez tells it, she was never drawn to Texas by an American dream. She was driven to leave Mexico by the pain of the past. 
 ''I'm going to work hard, Ma, so I can have something,'' she told her mother when she decided to move to the United States. ''So we won't have to ask anybody for anything, like we did when we were children.''
 Although Monterrey is only 150 miles from the Texas border, when Raquel was growing up it could have been a different continent. Her mother and the children lived in one room under a tin roof between four cinder-block walls. They all slept on one box spring, pressed together ''like little chickens,'' Mrs. Rodriguez says, placing coffee cans between them to catch leaks when it rained.
 Her father was a drinker, Mrs. Rodriguez says, mean and violent when he had too much. He walked out early in the marriage but would visit his wife once or twice a year, drunk and demanding sexual satisfaction. By the time his visits ceased, his wife had nine children.
 Mrs. Rodriguez, normally guarded, comes quickly to tears when she speaks of her father. Her eyes have permanent injuries from his blows, she says.
 When she was 14, he tried to evict the family and take the hovel where they lived for himself and a new girlfriend. Mrs. Rodriguez quit school and went to work as a cook for a Christian mission to earn money to buy out her father. Every Saturday for several years, she recalled, he arrived at her workplace to collect her wages.
 Though still a girl, Mrs. Rodriguez took on the role of head of her teeming household. She shielded the smaller children from her father's fists. She barked and badgered to make sure they went to school.
 Although several of her siblings grew up to be evangelical Christians, Mrs. Rodriguez, a Roman Catholic, says her hatred for her father prevents her from converting to their faith. 
 ''They say you have to forgive first,'' she says. ''But my rancor is still fresh. I have wounds that will never heal.''
 Her life began to change when she was 18 and she met Jaime Rodriguez Ramirez at a Monterrey roller-skating rink. Athletic and industrious, Mr. Rodriguez had also gone to work as a child, learning the greasy art of transmission repair. 
 They married in 1982. After a few years, Mrs. Rodriguez said, her husband began to frequent the corner cantina, and she feared he might become like her father. So when he suggested they try living for a year near a sister of his in San Antonio, she agreed. America was a way to get her husband away from the bar.

Gaining Legal Status and Jobs
 Her opportunity to immigrate legally came through simple luck. Her husband's sister married an American citizen. Once that sister-in-law became a naturalized citizen, she applied for residency for Jaime, Raquel and their daughter, Gabriela. Jaime Jr. was an American citizen, having been born in Texas during an exploratory sojourn by the couple. 
 Mr. Rodriguez went to work right away at JV Transmissions, the garage of his sister's husband. Mrs. Rodriguez was hired as a waitress at Dos Pedros restaurant, a homey Mexican hangout with black velvet mariachi hats on the walls. She spoke no English, but rarely had a customer with no Spanish. At times she worked two shifts, sleeping only two hours a night. 
 Even though they were both legal immigrants, the Rodriguezes lived for years like refugees. They shared a one-bedroom apartment with Mr. Rodriguez's parents. Her in-laws slept on the only bed, Mrs. Rodriguez said, while she and her family slept on the floor. 
 Her responsibilities to her clan in Mexico persisted. Various siblings began asking her to help them make a start in Texas, and she felt compelled to oblige. 
 ''I had nothing once,'' she says. ''Now I can't bear to see them have nothing.''

A Sibling Crosses the River
 The first to come was her brother, Gutberto, the sixth of her siblings, and she insisted he stay with her. He forded the Rio Grande, and soon the one-bedroom apartment of her in-laws in San Antonio housed nine people. Mrs. Rodriguez's in-laws still slept in the bed, while Gutberto and his wife and one child joined Mrs. Rodriguez's family on mattresses on the floor.
 Eventually Mrs. Rodriguez and her husband moved out, but their new apartment remained cramped.
 Her sister Irma sent her oldest daughter to live with Mrs. Rodriguez so the girl could attend middle school in Texas. Later Irma herself came, bringing two more of her daughters to stay with Mrs. Rodriguez as well. 
 At one point when Veronica brought her family, the population in the Rodriguez apartment peaked at 10. Tempers were strained and doors were slammed. 
 But if Mrs. Rodriguez thought her siblings were imposing, she does not speak of it now. She accuses only her in-laws, whom she does not regard as core family, of callousness.
 She still fumes when recalling that her mother-in-law barred Gutberto from their house when Mrs. Rodriguez was not there, and refused to feed his children when they came home from school. 
 Throughout it all, Mrs. Rodriguez has been investing on both sides of the border. Eight years ago she landed a school cafeteria job, a step up from waitressing because it provides health insurance.
 Before long, she and her husband paid $69,000 for a sienna-toned two-story ranch house on a calm San Antonio cul-de-sac. In the same period, she built a modest house for her mother in the Monterrey neighborhood where she grew up. Just down the street, she is also gradually improving a larger house, with a swimming pool that mostly stays empty.
 The pull of Mexico remains strong, like a spell. She goes back at Easter and during the school breaks. At Christmas she leaves her husband and children in San Antonio, preferring to celebrate with her mother and siblings in Monterrey.
 When her daughter, Gabriela, turned 15, Mrs. Rodriguez spent $12,000, more than a year of hoarded waitress tips and cafeteria wages, on a quinceanera birthday party, held in Monterrey. Four hundred guests were served whiskey and received color photographs of Gabriela in her queenly gown. Mrs. Rodriguez paid $1,200 for a laminated, four-foot-high enlargement of that portrait. It crowns her living room in San Antonio.

Worries About Endurance
 Mrs. Rodriguez expected to work hard in the United States, and she has. When the doors of the cafeteria at the Roy P. Benavidez Elementary School swing open at 10:30 in the morning, hundreds of hungry children rush toward the serving line, and she has to be ready. 
 She must be sure that 300 enchiladas are covered with the right amount of tomato sauce and that dozens of sandwiches are prepared with three slices of turkey and two of cheese. Potatoes must be baked and cookies cooled. 
 By noon Mrs. Rodriguez is bounding between ovens and freezers. She stirs soups, hoists trays and wheels carts, maintaining the flow of food to the servers out front on the cafeteria line. Her limited English is no handicap in the cafeteria. Most of ''las ladies,'' as the eight women of the kitchen crew are unofficially known, are Mexican. 
 She likes her job because after eight years she knows she does it well. ''When you know how to do your job, nobody yells at you,'' she explains. 
 But she has started to worry about her endurance. She makes $8.43 an hour, taking home less than $12,000 a year. She moves constantly between the walk-in freezer and the heat wave by the stove. One hip aches and her knuckles, frequently dipped in dishwashing water, are bulging with arthritis. 
 Her list of ailments is growing. She has had a hysterectomy, a cyst removed from her breast and multiple surgeries on her battered eyes. (Unable to apply makeup with her injured vision, she had black lines tattooed around her eyes and lips.) She has asthma and diverticulitis. 
 ''It would be nice,'' she muses, ''to have a job where I could sit down.''

Blunt Words From a Friend
 Dropping by one afternoon in Ms. Rodriguez's living room, Blandina Sanchez, a neighbor who is one of her closest friends in San Antonio, puts it more bluntly. 
 ''Get it through your head, Rachel,'' Mrs. Sanchez says, ''you are not going to want to do that job all your life.'' Mrs. Sanchez, an American, wants her friend to accept Texas as home. She calls her Rachel instead of Raquel and speaks to her in English. 
 ''Rachel, you need to go back to school!'' Mrs. Sanchez says, urging her to get her high school equivalency diploma. Mrs. Rodriguez can never rise to kitchen supervisor at the elementary school without English, her friend insists. 
 Mrs. Rodriguez knows that is right, but she just sinks down on her blue corduroy couch, yawning but still tense. Even in her own living room, she does not unwind. She runs financial calculations in her head and plans trips to Mexico. She keeps the lights off well into dusk, sitting in dimness to cut her costs. 
 On Saturdays, she admits, she likes to drink beer, sometimes too much beer. Her worries force her to think about where she belongs. She has always been guided by her family, but now it is diverging. 
 Her husband has done well in Texas. He has worked hard, stayed straight and been a fine father, raising both his children to play sports and keep out of trouble. 
 Gabriela married a legal Mexican immigrant, a construction contractor whose business is booming. Their toddler, Hanna, is an American. Gabriela plays in a women's soccer league in San Antonio.

No Question of Identity
 Jaime Jr., at 18, is even more absorbed in American life. Not only a varsity football player, he is a solid student with plans to move to Phoenix to attend a technical college next year, an educational leap for a family that only recently, with Gabriela's graduation, celebrated its first high school diploma.
 A hefty young man with a square jaw, Jaime exudes self-confidence. Slipping easily between English and Spanish, he favors English, even knowing his mother cannot always understand him. 
 When asked to describe his identity, Jaime, born and raised in the United States, answers immediately, in plain English. 
 ''I'm Mexican, yes.'' 
 His high school friends all call themselves Mexicans. During middle school, he says, there was friction, with some ''popular people'' taunting them, calling them wetbacks. But now he is a senior on the football team.
 ''Now no one really makes fun of me or anything because I talk to everyone, and I play football,'' he says. ''Everyone just keeps it cool now.''
 He is proud of his roots in Mexico. But that does not mean he wants to live there. 
 Mrs. Rodriguez is not sure where she wants to be. She has many friends in San Antonio, and her church, St. Bonaventure, is just down the street. Because of her work discipline and legal immigration status, Mrs. Rodriguez's economic advance has been steady. She has never wanted for a job and has been able to obtain credit cards, car loans and a home mortgage. She drove to her son's football game in a double-cabin pickup truck with polished chrome wheels, a recent purchase.
 But she rarely sees her brother Gutberto and her sister Veronica, though they remain in Texas. She perceives terrible hints that some of her siblings resent her success. 
 ''They don't know how I am killing myself at work,'' Mrs. Rodriguez says, in a moment of anguish. 
 So, although she is eligible to become a United States citizen, any move to do so would be purely practical. It would, ironically, be a way to help reunite her Mexican family because as a citizen she could apply for residency papers for her siblings. ''I would do it to help my brothers and sisters,'' she said of citizenship. 
 In the stands at the football game, Mrs. Rodriguez's pensive mood changed when Gabriela arrived with baby Hanna to watch her brother's big game. Mrs. Rodriguez seized her granddaughter in her arms. It was family again, and she let herself relax. 
 ''I have a job,'' she said. ''My husband has a job. I have good children. I'm happy.''
 But there was more. ''I am also sad. I don't have my whole family with me.''

HEADLINE: Tally in Iran Vote Spells 'Setback' for President's Hard Line 

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran, and Neil MacFarquhar from San Francisco.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suffered a significant setback in nationwide elections held on Friday for municipal councils and a key supervisory body, with voters evidently rebuking him for failing to deliver on promises to improve the economy. 
 Although results from the councils were still coming in on Monday, the tally so far indicated that candidates from the reformist and pragmatic conservative camps -- the two main groups opposing the populist, hard-line president -- emerged stronger from the vote. Presidential allies took a drubbing in important cities.
Municipal elections reflect the voters' feelings on basic concerns like growing unemployment and the slumping real estate market, according to analysts inside Iran and overseas. Domestic problems eclipse the more notorious issues to which the president has drawn international attention, like developing nuclear technology or questioning the Holocaust. 
 ''He has been trying to make himself indispensable by the grandiose issues, but his fate is much more tied to these bread and butter issues,'' said Vali Nasr, the author of ''The Shia Revival'' and a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. ''It's not a fall for Ahmadinejad, but it's clearly a stumble; there is no momentum coming out of his election in 2005.''
 Two contenders in that 2005 presidential election could claim important victories this time around, both seen as setbacks for the president. One, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, himself a former president, won an overwhelming victory to head the 86-member Assembly of Experts. While it has little day-to-day power, the assembly could end up choosing the next supreme leader, the religious figure whose word is virtually law. 
 The other, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who succeeded Mr. Ahmadinejad as mayor of Tehran, and who has been hinting at corruption in the previous government, was almost certain to retain his post. He is seen as a ''pragmatic conservative.'' 
 ''The fact that the reformists and the pragmatic conservatives can produce this kind of performance in an election means they have life in them and that President Ahmadinejad is vulnerable on several fronts,'' Mr. Nasr said. 
 Reformist politicians beat hard-liners in at least five important city councils, including Kerman, Sari, Zanjan, Ahvaz and Bandar Abbas.
 ''I think the first message of people's vote on Friday was that people still favor reforms,'' said Mohammad Atrainfar, a reformist politician. ''The second message was that populist appeals have failed.''
 The president's office sought to play down the results. A government spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham, said Monday that the government had not favored any particular slate. 
 The most intriguing race, and the biggest prize, is the 15-member Tehran City Council, with Mayor Qalibaf's slate expected to dominate. Mehrdad Bazrpash, an adviser to the president, failed to attract voters, but the president's sister, Parvin Ahmadinejad, who has no political background, was in 11th place. 
 Reformists, who support constitutional change to dilute the power of the clerics, captured four of the 15 seats in Tehran. That led them to protest the possibility of tampering, because results are taking longer than expected and an Ahmadinejad ally is in charge of the count. Reformists tend to do well when the turnout is high; this time about 60 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
 Final results for the Assembly of Experts show that more than 65 candidates close to Mr. Rafsanjani won. A cleric considered the president's spiritual mentor, Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, won a seat, but few of his allies did. 
 In the inexact science of reading alliances within the competing circles of mullahs and military men, there have been signs that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is not enchanted with the bruising the president is giving Iran's reputation abroad. 
 Some Ahmadinejad allies were disqualified as candidates before the vote, and a protest against the president when he visited a Tehran university this month was shown on state television, which the supreme leader controls. He continues to praise the government in public. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad had promised to distribute oil wealth more evenly, providing hospitals, schools and jobs, and to crack down on corruption. None has been realized. 
 The tension between the president and Tehran's mayor creates an interesting dynamic because both were Revolutionary Guards. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is more identified with the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force drawn mostly from the working poor, whereas Mr. Qalibaf was the head of the air force and projects a more sophisticated image friendly to business executives. 
 So the question is whether the supreme leader, and by extension the ruling circle of clerics and military men, sees the populist or the more business-oriented route as the path Iran should take. The slates that won in some municipal councils were claimed by both reformists and Mr. Qalibaf's followers, and analysts are waiting to see if that alliance holds for next year's parliamentary vote. 
 ''The significance of this election is that we now have a complete new alignment -- the reformists, the Rafsanjani camp and the conservative bazaar elements,'' said Abbas Milani, chairman of Iranian studies at Stanford University. ''That is a de facto coalition whose purpose is to stop Ahmadinejad from doing further damage, both domestically and internationally.''

HEADLINE: Overhaul Moves White House Data Center Into Modern Era

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Perhaps no corner of the White House has starred in more movies and television shows than the Situation Room, the presidential decision center under the West Wing that Hollywood imagines as a high-tech beehive of activity, where presidents command covert operations around the world.
 In reality, it was something of a low-tech dungeon. 
Until it closed for its biggest overhaul since John F. Kennedy settled into its wood-paneled conference room, most of the room's monitors used -- get this -- picture tubes. Communications were often by fax. The computers and telephones looked like the best technology available, in 1985. There was a small kitchen, but it had no sink.
 On Dec. 27 the new Situation Room is to open formally, the result of planning that reaches back to before the Sept. 11 attacks but took on added urgency afterward. The White House offered a preview to two reporters on Monday, days before its new data center is pumped full of classified information and its doors are sealed to outsiders. 
 Even in its new incarnation, it is not quite up to the standards of ''24.'' But it is getting closer. For starters, Mr. Bush's new main conference room, just underneath the main floor of the West Wing, has six flat-screen televisions for secure video conferences, and the technology linking them to generals and prime ministers around the globe makes it less likely that the encrypted voices and images will go black. (That happened regularly in connections to Baghdad, an event one former administration official said had been known to ''prompt a presidential outburst.'') 
 The screens also have what Joe Hagin, the deputy White House chief of staff, described in a tour as ''John Madden telestrators,'' the ability to perform on-screen drawings.
 (White House technologists settled on NEC plasma flat-screens for the president's main conference room and LCD screens, made by LG, in the remainder of the chamber.)
 The watch officers, who were previously seated so they stared at walls rather than each other, are now arrayed on two tiers of curved computer terminals that can be fed both classified and unclassified data from around the country and the world. That ends a problem that most multi-national companies solved years ago, an inability to merge different kinds of data without effectively having to cut and paste.
 The Situation Room was largely an outgrowth of the Cuban missile crisis, an event that made President Kennedy and his aides realize that they needed a central hub for information during crises. 
 Since then, it has been the site of critical decisions: Lyndon Johnson spent long nights picking bombing targets there; Bill Clinton used it to handle Bosnia and the Asian financial crisis. Over the years, the technology became a patchwork of fixes, as Wang word processors were replaced by personal computers, and then for portable secure video. The 9/11 commission found that on the day of the 2001 attacks, communications frayed, making it hard for Mr. Bush, flying around on Air Force One, to get a picture of what was going on.
 Mr. Hagin, a trusted aide who handles much of the behind-the-scenes work of the White House, said officials decided a complete overhaul was desperately needed almost as soon as they saw it. 
 ''We were all underwhelmed the first time we walked into the Situation Room,'' he said in an interview at the White House on Monday, an assessment shared by others.
 But, Mr. Hagin said, after the Sept. 11 attacks the project took on added importance, as officials came to realize that the room, created in the cold war, was not set up to gather both international and domestic information. 
 Among the most important changes, Mr. Hagin said, was the expansion of its use beyond the National Security Council to also include the Homeland Security Council and the White House chief of staff's office. 
 Officials found the old room's wood-paneled walls too noisy, making it hard to hear for those listening in via video or telephone. The new room has less mahogany and more of what Mr. Hagin described as 21st century whisper wall.
 And, where the old Situation Room suite had only two secure video rooms, the new one has five and a direct, secure feed to Air Force One, a better fit for Mr. Bush personally. 
 ''This president wants to look you in the eye while you're answering his questions,'' said Phil Lago, executive secretary of the security council who is also planning the renovation.

HEADLINE: New Office Would Battle City Poverty

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The city is planning to spend an extra $150 million a year in public and private money on the core priority of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's second term: combating poverty that is hidden beneath New York's vast wealth.
 The effort would involve the creation of a new city office that would operate in part like a philanthropic foundation and in part like a venture capital company. The program, called the Center for Economic Opportunity, would administer a $100 million fund to support experimental programs, like giving cash rewards to encourage poor people to stay in school or receive preventive medical care, or matching their monthly bank deposits to foster greater savings. 
The office would also oversee a program giving tax credits to impoverished families to offset child care costs. Programs are to be constantly evaluated, and those that cannot show success will be terminated. The administration has hired Veronica M. White, a business planning and management consultant who has worked in housing development.
 The effort is classic Bloomberg in that it emphasizes nontraditional solutions and enlists the private sector to tackle problems that have historically vexed governments. Mr. Bloomberg has turned to fellow philanthropists to help improve the schools, to finance a Republican national convention in New York and now to build a ground zero memorial. But yesterday's announcement represents the fruit of his efforts to fight poverty in his second and last term as mayor.
 ''When you do things with public money, you really are required to do things that have some proven track record and to focus on more conventional approaches,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in making the announcement at a credit union on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. ''But conventional approaches, as we know, have kept us in this vicious cycle of too many people not being able to work themselves out of poverty even though they're doing everything that we've asked them to do.''
 The administration's efforts would place an emphasis on rewarding good behavior and promoting self-sufficiency. Officials plan to spend $42 million annually on the tax credit, $25 million to reward actions like attending schools or prenatal education classes, and $11 million to help poor adults save money and learn sound financial practices.
 The new plan calls for the office to spend $5 million a year on measuring progress, and $71 million on about 30 programs that administration officials say they are developing but declined to announce.
 In an approach that has become a hallmark of the Bloomberg administration, the new office is intended to work across all agencies. But the center could also serve as a way of continuing Mr. Bloomberg's agenda after his term ends. 
 This year, he charged a high-profile panel drawn from business, nonprofit and philanthropic circles with devising solutions to fighting poverty that did not cost additional money. But after the panel released its recommendations in September, officials in the administration were able to make the case that creating the new office would help build both the internal institutions and external demand that would allow it to survive a new administration.
 The child care tax credit proposal, which needs state approval, is working its way through the legislative process, said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor overseeing the antipoverty effort. And officials have begun raising money to pay for the incentive program, an approach called conditional cash transfers that have had success in other countries.
 The effort to teach the poor about financial management would operate out of the Department of Consumer Affairs and be called the Office of Financial Empowerment. Jonathan Mintz, the consumer affairs commissioner, said that he was looking to help coordinate and promote a program of individual development accounts that would use public and private money to match accumulated savings.
 Policy experts called the Bloomberg plan significant and unusual. ''The amount of money allocated is not trivial, especially if the money is used to leverage other expenditures, say by private businesses or nonprofits,'' said Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University. ''The whole idea of a broad fund to fund innovation seems pretty novel, especially at the city level.''
 Antipoverty advocates offered measured praise for the announcement, saying that while they were pleased that the city was making a financial commitment, more work remained to be done.
 ''It is good that the mayor is making a financial commitment to fighting poverty, but we are concerned that this process is not transparent,'' said Gloria Walker, a member of Community Voices Heard, an antipoverty group that advised the panel. ''Low-income people need to be involved in monitoring and overseeing these new programs.''
 Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, said that although he was ''extraordinarily pleased'' that the $150 million would go to test innovative approaches, particularly the individual development accounts, he warned that it was not nearly enough.
 ''It equals only about $125 per person for the approximately 1.8 million New Yorkers living below the meager federal poverty line,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Eases Up to Another Record on Increase in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average finished at a record high yesterday as a rise in oil prices bolstered shares of Exxon Mobil, outweighing investors' concerns about a jump in a critical inflation gauge.
 Gains were limited as technology stocks fell after disappointing financial results from Oracle, an industry bellwether. An unexpected quarterly loss from the electronics retailer Circuit City stirred worries about retail store profits during the holiday shopping season.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 30.05 points, or 0.24 percent, to end at a record 12,471.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 3.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to finish at 1,425.55. But the Nasdaq composite index was down 6.02 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 2,429.55. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.08 point, or 0.01 percent, to 782.10. 
 The Dow hit a high of 12,491.91 in intraday trading and achieved its 21st record close since the start of October.
 The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, an important inflation measure, registered its biggest monthly gain in 32 years. That initially sent stocks lower, but investors said they reassessed the data throughout the day.
 ''People are positive that growth is fine and inflation is going to be under control,'' said Neil Massa, senior trader at John Hancock Funds in Boston.
 ''Technology is pressured mainly by the negative headlines around earnings by some big technology companies,'' he said. ''It's nothing to do with the overall environment.''
 Shares of Oracle, the database software maker, were the heaviest drag on the Nasdaq 100 after the company reported disappointing sales late on Monday. Oracle shares fell 81 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $17.10.
 Circuit City reported an unexpected loss, sending its shares down $3.75, or 16.5 percent, to $19.01. Shares of a rival, Best Buy, fell 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $48.55, and the S.& P. retail index was off 0.6 percent.
 Investors also were jittery after a steep drop in Thai stocks overnight after the government imposed capital controls to rein in its baht currency. The Thai government later withdrew its restrictions on foreign investment in its stock market.
 Shares of Exxon Mobil were up $1.48, or 2 percent, to $76.99. 
 Crude oil for January delivery rose 94 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $63.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The rise in oil prices was attributed to expectations that United States crude inventories fell in the last week because of shipping delays along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Inventory data will be released today. 
 The investment bank Morgan Stanley reported results that topped analysts' estimates and announced it would spin off its Discover credit card unit. Shares of Morgan Stanley were up $1.33, or 1.7 percent, to $81.70.
 Home builders' shares fell across the board after Hovnanian Enterprises posted a quarterly loss and gave a weak outlook, sending its stock down 69 cents, nearly 2 percent, to $34.56.
 Six shares advanced for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, while on the Nasdaq, more than eight stocks fell for every seven that rose.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to 1019/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.59 percent, from 4.58 percent. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Raising the Floor on Pay

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
On the verge of controlling Congress, the Democrats are making a much-delayed increase in the minimum wage their signature attempt to lift incomes and quiet widespread economic anxiety. But the party's modest proposal does not catch up with what the states have already done to raise the wages of tens of millions of workers. 
 Putting a floor under wages was once the domain of the national government, a legacy of the New Deal that lasted for decades. As recently as 1984, only one state -- Alaska -- had a higher minimum.
By then, however, Congress no longer regularly increased the minimum. So the states stepped into the vacuum, one after another, everywhere but in the South. In the last election alone, voters in six states approved minimums higher than the federal level, and in some states cost-of-living clauses automatically increase the minimums -- a step that Congress has never taken and that most Democrats still balk at. 
 Some advocates wonder whether Congress can regain the lead, or should. ''I am very strongly in favor of populism at the national level, but it is not happening,'' said Gar Alperovitz, a political economist at the University of Maryland who supports and studies populist movements at the state and local level.
 ''The minimum wage is definitely a populist issue,'' he said, ''but to go beyond the present modest effort in Congress, you have to build support state by state until there is a new national consensus as to what the minimum should be. That is a long slog.''
 The minimum wage is not the only issue in which the states have taken the lead from the federal government. California, for example, has pushed to limit the emission of global warming gases, and New York City has just enacted the first major ban on the use of trans fats in restaurant cooking.
 When it comes to the minimum wage, the Democrats plan to introduce a bill in Congress next month that would increase the federal minimum for the first time in a decade -- to $7.25 an hour in the spring of 2009, reaching that level in three steps from the present $5.15 an hour.
 More than 13 million workers earning less than $7.25 an hour today, or just above that, would get raises. The majority are adults working full time, mainly in the South and Southwest. The 29 states that have jumped ahead of the federal government now have minimums that range from $6.15 to $7.63 an hour, lifting 70 percent of the nation's work force well above the federal level of $5.15. Most of these state minimums have escalators built into them.
 As a result, even in the unlikely event that none of the states took any further action, 12 of them, representing 33 percent of the work force, would still have minimums either equal to or above $7.25 an hour in 2009, according to projections by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. 
 Many of the state minimums were enacted over the last decade. Indeed, when the federal minimum rose to $5.15 an hour in 1997, less than 5 percent of the work force enjoyed higher state minimums.
 ''What you have are a growing number of states more oriented toward workers than in the past,'' said Richard B. Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, adding: ''The left is uneasy about states' rights, but people are becoming more progressive at the local level. They can see what is happening to their neighbors, and they are more sympathetic toward the poor, whom they can also see.''
 Starting in the early 1980s, after Ronald Reagan was elected president, increasing the federal minimum wage by more than token amounts ran into a buzz saw of opposition. Conservative economists contended that regular increases distorted the free supply and demand for workers. Citing longstanding economic research, they said it did more harm than good, prompting employers to drop marginal workers not worth the higher minimum. 
 That was still the prevailing view in the early 1990s when two labor economists, David Card, now at the University of California, Berkeley, and Alan B. Krueger at Princeton, found that modest increases in low minimum wages had no impact on employment, and in fact might reduce turnover.
 The states themselves became tests of this finding. As more of them increased their minimums without measurable effect on employment, the opposition faded. Even the chief critic of the Card-Krueger position, David Neumark, a labor economist at the University of California, Irvine, has softened his position, though he still sees little if any advantage in a higher minimum wage.
 ''A congressman once said to me, 'Suppose you are right and the minimum wage reduces employment; does that mean we should not raise the minimum?' '' Mr. Neumark said in an interview.
 ''And I said, 'No, I don't know; it depends,' '' he went on. ''There is some cost to raising the minimum, but there may be some benefit. If I thought one guy would lose his job and a thousand would be lifted out of poverty, I would say that is a pretty good trade-off. But my research says there is no evidence you reduce poverty.''
 Even the higher state minimums are often not enough to keep millions of workers out of poverty. Consider Elvia Rios, a 43-year-old college graduate from Panama who worked as an executive secretary there before immigrating to the United States three years ago. She earns the New Jersey minimum of $7.15 an hour as a stockroom employee, working 40 hours a week at a large retail store in the center of the state.
 Ms. Rios and her 2-year-old daughter are living in a homeless shelter run by the Interfaith Hospitality Network, a nonprofit organization. She gets help with her daily expenses, particularly child care, from charities as well as the state. When Ms. Rios moves into an apartment next month, the state will pay 70 percent of the $1,200-a-month rent for two years. It will do so under an assistance program for women who are victims of domestic violence.
 ''The $7.15 an hour is just not enough,'' Ms. Rios said. ''I don't pay any rent right now, but I soon will and I will also have to buy what the child needs.'' 
 How much income would be enough? At least $9 an hour, she said, ''to live not well but without falling into poverty.''
 Trying to reach beyond that goal, Ms. Rios plans to enroll in a course that will train her by early spring to care for the elderly -- work that in New Jersey pays $12 or $13 an hour, she says.
 ''The job I do now, I don't like,'' Ms. Rios said. ''I prefer to take care of elderly people or ill people or children.'' 
 The decades immediately after World War II were the heyday of the federal minimum wage. Without following any particular formula, Congress periodically ended up setting it at roughly one-half the average hourly pay of the nation's production workers. That average is nearly $17 an hour today; half would be $8.50. By 2009 it is likely to be close to the $9 that Ms. Rios seeks. 
 Spurred on by last month's election results, the populist wing of the Democratic Party is calling for a return to the old standard. Sherrod Brown, newly elected to the Senate from Ohio, is in that group. So is the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which says that its success in getting out the vote this fall entitles it to a bigger voice in Democratic Party policy. 
 But they are meeting political resistance from the moderates in the party. Trying to push the populist case, the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research center, posted a statement in late November calling for an increase in the minimum to $8 an hour in 2009 instead of the $7.25 proposed by the party leaders. That recommendation was quickly withdrawn, however, under pressure from the leadership. 
 ''Ourfriends on Capitol Hill said our statement would be heard as criticizing the Democrats,'' said Ross Eisenbrey, the institute's policy director. ''It would not be perceived as encouragement to do more; it would be perceived as raining on the parade.'' 
 In a second statement, issued this month, the Economic Policy Institute finally endorsed the increase to $7.25, stipulating that once Congress approved this amount, a second bill should be introduced to raise it to a higher $8 in 2009. 
 Senator-elect Brown and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have taken similar stands, wanting more but nevertheless endorsing the bill that the Democratic leadership intends to introduce in the first 100 hours of the new Congress. 
 No Democrat has pushed harder in Congress for increases in the federal minimum wage than Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the bill's author. He was the chief sponsor of the last increase, enacted a decade ago. He first tried to introduce the current proposal in 2004, but was unsuccessful in a Republican-dominated Congress. 
 Now he and other party leaders argue that they cannot go above a $7.25 minimum wage without risking a presidential veto. Once it becomes law, Senator Kennedy plans to push for an increase beyond $7.25. Still, he acknowledges that the initiative may indeed have passed to the states.
 ''States have always been the laboratories of democracy, and I am proud of the leadership they have shown on this issue,'' Senator Kennedy said in a written response to a question. ''Philosophically, are we O.K. with leaving the minimum wage in their hands?''
 Liberal economists and policy makers are divided on this point. Mr. Alperovitz says there is no other choice but to go with the states. At the federal level, he argues, the Democrats are no longer a powerful source of progressive legislation.
 They have lost their influence for three reasons, he said: the decline in union power; the defection of the South to the Republican Party; and the absence of a riveting economic crisis, like the Depression, that demands national solutions.
 The problem with letting the initiative shift to the states, argues Ronald Blackwell, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is that the variety of state minimums encourages companies to shift jobs to the lower-wage states.
 Mr. Freeman, the Harvard economist, argues in response that the various minimums are useful, reflecting different living costs across the country. 
 Mississippi, for example, like most Southern states, simply adheres to the federal minimum of $5.15 an hour. If it were forced to go to a $9 federal minimum, the drastic increase, even spread out over two or three years, would eliminate many of the low-end jobs that have migrated to the state, Mr. Freeman said.
 On the other hand, that same $9 an hour would be no problem for Washington State, where the minimum is already $7.63 and will rise to $7.94 next year.
 ''The fight at the federal level is really no longer over how high the minimum should go,'' Mr. Freeman said, ''but where the low end should be.''

HEADLINE: To-Do List: Wrap Gifts. Have Baby.

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
For decades and decades, the busiest day of the year in the nation's maternity wards fell sometime in mid-September. Americans evidently do a lot of baby-making during the cold, dark days of December, and once a baby has been made, the die for its birth date has largely been cast.
 Or at least that's the way it used to be. In the last 15 years, there has been a huge increase in the number of births that are induced with drugs or come by Caesarean section. In either case, parents or doctors can often schedule a baby's arrival on a day of their choosing.
 Not surprisingly, they tend to avoid weekends and holidays, when doctors have other plans, hospitals are short of staff and the possibility of an unfortunate birthday -- Christmas Day, anyone? -- looms. During holiday weeks, births have become increasingly crowded into the weekdays surrounding the holiday. 
 Over this same period -- since the early 1990s -- the federal government has been steadily increasing the tax breaks for having a child. For parents to claim the full amount of any of these breaks in a given year, a child must simply be born by 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31. If the baby arrives a few minutes later, the parents are often more than a thousand dollars poorer.
 Unless you're a cynic, or an economist, I realize you might have trouble believing that the intricacies of the nation's tax code would impinge on something as sacred as the birth of a child. But it appears that you would be wrong. 
 In the last decade, September has lost its unchallenged status as the time for what we will call National Birth Day, the day with more births than any other. Instead, the big day fell between Christmas and New Year's Day in four of the last seven years -- 1997 through 2003 -- for which the government has released birth statistics. (The day was in September during the other years; conception still matters.) Based on this year's calendar, there is a good chance that National Birth Day will take place a week from tomorrow, on Thursday, Dec. 28. 
 ''It's phenomenal what's happening in late December,'' said Amitabh Chandra, a Harvard economist who provided many of the numbers here. ''December is not really a particularly busy time for babies to be born. So to see a spike that's equal to September is astounding.''
 Obviously, there are reasons beside taxes that someone might prefer having a baby in late December rather than early January. Many people will be on vacation next week, with extended family in town to see a new baby and help around the house. The stress of having relatives visit may also be enough to send some expectant mothers into labor.
 So to see if taxes were truly the culprit, Mr. Chandra and another economist, Stacy Dickert-Conlin of Michigan State, devised some clever tests. They found that people who stood to gain the most from the tax breaks were also the ones who gave birth in late December most frequently. When the gains were similar, high-income parents -- who, presumably, are more likely to be paying for tax advice -- produced more December babies than other parents.
 It's also telling that the year's final week was not the first part of the calendar to replace September. For a few years in the mid-1990s, a day on either side of the long July 4 weekend was National Birth Day.
 But July lost the honor as the tax code became ever kinder to families with children. The child tax credit, now worth $500, made its debut in 1998, and the earned-income tax credit, an anti-poverty policy that's more generous to large families than small ones, became much larger in the 90s. The personal exemption, for its part, has risen along with inflation, reaching $3,300 this year. 
 By my calculations, about 5,000 babies, of the 70,000 or so who would otherwise be born during the first week in January, may have their arrival dates accelerated partly for tax reasons. When Mr. Chandra interviewed one mother in central Kentucky, she told him her doctor encouraged her to schedule a late-December birth well in advance, to be sure she got a delivery room. Anecdotes aside, Mr. Chandra thinks my estimate of 5,000 is conservative, based on his own more sophisticated statistical analysis.
 In addition to being an entertaining bit of trivia, the end-of-the-year baby boom also raises a legitimate policy question: just because we have the medical ability to do something, does that necessarily mean it's such a good idea? 
 Induced births and Caesarean sections are considerably more expensive than natural births on average. There are clearly cases when labor needs to be induced for a baby's health or the mother's. It's much less clear, however, that the health care system should be subsidizing parents' desire for a smaller tax bill. 
 The health effects of scheduled births are also murky. A big study led by a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that voluntary Caesareans increase the risk of infant mortality. Another study found that weekday births are slightly more risky than weekend ones, all else equal, suggesting that a drug-induced birth can also cause health problems. The differences are small, but the stakes are big enough to take any change seriously. 
 ''When you induce labor, you compress this long process into a few hours,'' said Dr. Emmet Hirsch, the director for obstetrics at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare near Chicago. ''When you do that, you can run into all sorts of problems.''
 To minimize those problems, the largest medical provider in Utah, Intermountain Healthcare, now discourages women from electively inducing labor before their 39th week of pregnancy. ''This is what's best for moms and babies,'' said Janie Wilson, a nurse who helps run the newborn program at Intermountain. ''It just seems like a no-brainer.'' 
 Before the policy went into effect in 2001, Intermountain, based in Salt Lake City, had more December births than January births. It doesn't anymore. 
 The solution to this situation seems simple enough to me, and it comes back to the tax code. If Congress changed the all-or-nothing aspect of the child tax breaks, it would reduce the incentive to rush a fetus along in the final days of the year. A child born in December could be eligible for one-twelfth of a deduction or a credit rather than the whole thing.
 But maybe I'm just biased. When my mother was getting ready to give birth to her first child, she would tell friends and family that Jan. 1 was the only day she didn't want the baby to arrive. She figured the hospital would be dealing with the aftermath of New Year's Eve, and she couldn't stand the idea of giving birth to New York's much-publicized first baby of the year.
 I suspect most people thought she didn't have much to fear, given that the due date -- my due date -- was Dec. 22. But she apparently knew what she was talking about. I arrived late on the afternoon of Jan 1. The doctor complained about missing the Rose Bowl, and my parents missed out on one of the few ways that a child can be a financial windfall.

HEADLINE: Sheldon Fox, Architect and Manager, Dies at 76

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Sheldon Fox, who was part of the founding triumvirate of Kohn Pedersen Fox, one of the country's most successful architectural firms, died on Saturday at his home in Fairfield, Conn. He was 76 and had until recently been a longtime resident of Stamford, Conn.
 The cause was complications of brain cancer, his family said. 
A native New Yorker, Mr. Fox was the operations manager of a partnership that began in 1976 and quickly rose to the top rank of American architectural firms with international reach. It now has offices in New York, London and Shanghai.
 Mr. Fox, an architect, acted as partner in charge of some of the firm's most prominent projects, including the imposing World Bank headquarters in Washington; 333 West Wacker Drive in Chicago, a curving, green-glass tower along the Chicago River; and the cluster of buildings on the West Side of Manhattan for the ABC television network.
 The firm -- KPF, as it styled itself -- thrived on close coordination among the partners and a clear division of labor among them. William Pedersen became the principal designer. A. Eugene Kohn was the chief marketer, shopping the right concepts to the right clients. And Mr. Fox took on the tasks of manager, overseeing the back office and choreographing the many facets involved in large architectural projects, from conception to the ribbon-cutting. 
 Mr. Fox's role was to build consensus among clients, their consultants and building managers and to get projects built within budget and on time. He frequently put on a hard hat and toured muddy construction sites. He tended to payrolls and the firm's financial health and organized staff members of the firm as it grew to about 300 people during his 21 years as managing partner.
 In the case of the Washington headquarters for the World Bank, completed in 1996, KPF won the international competition with Mr. Pedersen's design, which incorporated existing buildings by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Vincent Kling into a new 13-story, 1.3 million-square-foot modernist structure facing Pennsylvania Avenue.
 Mr. Fox oversaw the project to its completion. He developed a comprehensive plan and spent long days in negotiations to preserve the design over conflicting budgetary demands. In the end, the firm credited his determination as much as Mr. Pedersen's design for getting that and other jobs done on time. 
 Sheldon Fox was born in the Bronx and received a bachelor's degree in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 1953. He then served as a first lieutenant in the Army in Korea. He began his career in 1955, as a draftsman for Kahn & Jacobs, Architects, where he later became a partner. In 1972 he moved to John Carl Warnecke & Associates as a senior vice president. 
 Mr. Kohn, a former classmate of his at the University of Pennsylvania, was a partner at Warnecke, and Mr. Pedersen, who had earlier worked for I. M. Pei & Associates, was a vice president. Four years later the three teamed up to found Kohn Pedersen Fox Architects. Mr. Fox retired 10 years ago. He was active in civic affairs in New York and in Stamford and lectured on architectural management. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and of the Architectural League of New York.
 He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Judith Landa Fox; two sons, Peter, of Bridgeport, Conn., and Jeffrey, of Providence, R.I.; a daughter, Mindy Fox Pritchard, of Fairfield, Conn.; two sisters, Joan Norman, of Whitestone, Queens, and Phyllis Kraft of Los Angeles; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Study Predicts Foreclosure for 1 in 5 Subprime Loans

BYLINE: BY RON NIXON

 BODY:
About one in five subprime mortgages made in the last two years are likely to go into foreclosure, according to a report released yesterday, ending the dream of homeownership for millions of Americans.
 At that rate, about 1.1 million homeowners who took out subprime loans in the last two years will lose their houses in the next few years, the report said. The foreclosures will cost those homeowners an estimated $74.6 billion, primarily in equity.
The report, written by the Center for Responsible Lending, a research group in Durham, N.C., was based on data supplied by Moody's Economy.com. Researchers examined more than six million mortgages made from 1998 until the third quarter of 2006; the report is the first nationwide study on the performance of subprime mortgages. It includes projected foreclosure data for all major metropolitan statistical areas. The highest default rates are expected to be in cities in California, Nevada, Michigan and New Jersey as well as Washington, D.C. 
 The report offers a somber assessment of loans that had helped millions of Americans with blemished credit attain homeownership. About 2.2 million borrowers who took subprime loans from 1998 to 2006 are likely to lose their homes.
 Subprime loans are made to borrowers with unfavorable credit. 
 Mortgage companies, banks and investors began aggressively marketing and trading the loans in the early part of the decade because their higher interest rates make them more profitable. 
 As a result, subprime loans now make up more than a quarter of the mortgage market, more than $600 billion in 2005. ''This is no longer a niche part of the market that can be dismissed,'' said Keith Ernst, senior housing counsel at the research center and one of the authors of the report. ''It's a major component of the mortgage market and the growing rates of foreclosures should be a cause for alarm.''
 The report cited several factors for the increase in subprime mortgage foreclosures -- including adjustable rate mortgages with steep built-in rate and payment increases, prepayment penalties, limited income documentation and no escrow for taxes and insurance. The report said the features caused a higher risk of default regardless of the borrower's credit score.
 ''This means that people are not going into foreclosure just because they have low incomes,'' Mr. Ernst said. ''The foreclosures are higher than they need to be because a number of loan features in the subprime market place borrowers at unnecessary risk.''
 Minority homeowners take out a disproportionate share of subprime loans. The most recent Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from lending institutions show that over half of African-Americans and 40 percent of Hispanics received subprime loans.
 The report projects that 10 percent of the African-American borrowers and 8 percent of Hispanic borrowers will be affected by foreclosure. In contrast, only 4 percent of recent white borrowers are expected to be affected.
 The center suggests that risky lending practices could lead to the worst foreclosure crisis in the modern mortgage market. 
 Douglas Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, called the center's study overly pessimistic.
 ''Every forecast models makes assumptions, but it seems they picked the worst case scenario,'' Mr. Duncan said. 
 Mr. Duncan said the banker's association's numbers did show an increase in foreclosures but that was because there were more borrowers.
 The center's report comes as more attention is paid to subprime lending. State regulators have cracked down on what they see as predatory practices by many lenders.
 Federal regulators have issued new guidelines that will tighten lending standards, aiming chiefly at adjustable-rate mortgages. And the federal government, through the Federal Housing Administration, has attempted to reform its lending programs to better compete in the mortgage market.
 The House has approved a proposal by the F.H.A. to eliminate the minimum down payment and raise the loan limits, allowing it to offer loans that would enable borrowers to avoid the risk of subprime mortgages. 
 Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, praised the proposed changes but said other efforts were needed.
 ''We need rules to curb predatory lenders, but we also need prime lenders to step up for this expanding market of borrowers,'' Henderson said. ''The lending community needs to step forward and take responsibility. It should not let itself be defined by its worst actors.''

HEADLINE: Sharp Rise in Prices Shows Inflation Is Still a Threat 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Wholesale prices unexpectedly shot up in November, a sobering reminder that inflation remains a threat to the economy despite recent signs that prices may be settling down. 
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that the Producer Price Index, which measures what businesses charge one another for everything from iron ore and diesel fuel to cases of soft drinks, rose 2 percent from October to November when seasonally adjusted. The index had not risen by that much in a single month in 32 years.
The rise was much steeper than economists had forecast, and it came after several months of data that showed inflation easing at both the consumer and wholesale levels. But most economists said there was no reason to think that prices were on the verge of a run-up. 
 ''This shows you that we're not completely out of the woods yet,'' said Andrew Tilton, an economist with Goldman Sachs. ''But I think that taken as a whole, the information over the past couple of months is clearly good news on inflation.''
 Major factors in sending prices soaring were two notoriously volatile components of the index -- automobile and energy prices. After falling considerably in October, the wholesale price of gasoline rose 17.9 percent. Prices of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans spiked 13.7 percent as automakers began selling new 2007 models. 
 The rise in vehicle prices helped push up the core rate of wholesale inflation, an index that excludes food and energy prices, by 1.3 percent, compared with a drop of 0.9 percent in October. The last time the core rate rose that fast was in 1980. 
 The figures reinforced the message coming from the Federal Reserve that inflation has not been vanquished, and seemed to diminish the odds that the Fed would begin reducing interest rates, which some investors had hoped for, as early as next spring. 
 Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a speech in Longview, Tex., yesterday that inflation remained the biggest risk to the economy. ''We cannot yet say with conviction that we have turned the corner and have this problem fully contained,'' he said. 
 Separately, a Commerce Department report on housing construction yesterday showed that the number of building permits fell in November for the 10th consecutive month. Permits declined by 3 percent, seasonally adjusted, and were 31.3 percent lower than a year earlier.
 But the same report showed that the number of homes actually begun by builders rose 6.7 percent in November, seasonally adjusted. 
 Economists said that a November rebound in the housing-starts was expected, because October's level was the lowest in more than six years. 
 ''It doesn't change the bottom line,'' Richard F. Moody, chief economist for Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm, said in a research report. ''While there is a bottom out there for the housing market, we just don't know where it is yet.''
 In the last year, authorized building permits have fallen sharply across the country. From November 2005 to November 2006, the rate dropped 41.1 percent in the West, 30 percent in the Northeast, 33 percent in the Midwest and 25.7 percent in the South. 
 In its latest policy statement, issued last week, the Fed made its clearest acknowledgment to date that economic growth was faltering, particularly in the housing market.
 Still, economists said the Fed would probably want more evidence of weakness before thinking about easing off the monetary brake pedal. Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers, said the central bank was likely to wait several months ''before making any judgments about the condition of the housing market.''
 The government reported last week that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in November largely because of falling fuel prices.

HEADLINE: A Suburb's Big Project Is Outpacing Hartford's 

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
In 2000, the State of Connecticut committed $1 billion in development money for Adriaen's Landing, a project here with a convention center, science museum and residential and retail spaces. Two years later, West Hartford, the big town next door, gave enthusiastic backing to Blue Back Square, a $180 million multiuse development with housing, restaurants and stores, without any state subsidies. 
 At this point, the smaller investment is much further along. While Blue Back Square is already seen as an important step forward for West Hartford, much of the Hartford project still does not exist. 
 Adriaen's Landing, developed by the Capital City Economic Development Authority, a quasipublic agency, was intended to bring life to a city that had struggled for years to attract spending to its downtown, which has suffered decades of decline amid the flight of the middle class to the suburbs and cutbacks by insurance companies, the city's foremost industry.
 The 540,000-square-foot Connecticut Convention Center and a 409-room Marriott Hotel opened in 2005, and work on the Connecticut Center for Science and Exploration has begun. While officials say they are happy with the business generated by the convention center and the hotel so far, there are no upscale restaurants within walking distance of Adriaen's Landing. 
 By contrast, Blue Back Square, developed by Street-Works, a White Plains developer, and JDA Development of Cromwell, Conn., is piggybacking on an already successful downtown district, West Hartford Center, that has been revitalized during the last 20 years. In effect, West Hartford, whose population was 61,000 in the middle of 2005, has become a regional destination for dining and shopping, a role that the capital city, with a population twice as large, formerly played. 
 Ronald Van Winkle, West Hartford's director of community services, stood on the rooftop of the Town Hall recently and looked over the adjoining development, named for the blue-covered spelling book of Noah Webster, a West Hartford native. ''This creates a real neighborhood, a place to go,'' he said. ''People like me will be able to go to dinner, a movie, the library, and then when we go home, the younger kids will come out to the restaurants.''
 The five buildings of Blue Back Square are either finished or in progress, with a final completion date of November 2007. Each of the five buildings now under construction has a ground floor of shops, totaling 220,000 square feet of retail space. Medical office space will encompass 137,000 square feet, and other professional offices will total another 62,500 square feet. Two 500-space parking garages are already built, and a six-screen Criterion Cinema is planned.
 A year ago, a Whole Foods Market adjacent to the site opened its doors. Although it is not part of the Blue Back development, it has clearly increased the area's attractiveness as a shopping destination. Tenants that have already signed on for Blue Back include Crate & Barrel, REI, Barnes & Noble, the Cheesecake Factory, Fleming's Steakhouse and the National Jean Company. 
 By contrast, mounds of dirt now mark the Front Street District, a residential and retail development in Hartford. Progress has been slowed by the departure of two developers and negotiations with a third, the H. B. Nitkin Group of Greenwich, Conn., which has trimmed back the original proposals and has asked to do the project in phases. 
 The first phase of the Front Street District, which is being designed by the architect Robert A. M. Stern, will include 115 units of housing, along with 60,000 square feet of commercial space, which would be about 75 percent restaurants and 25 percent stores. No work has started yet, and Bradley Nitkin, the company's president, was not ready to say what retailers had committed to the project.
 The second phase has not been determined, Mr. Nitkin said. The. Nitkin Group will provide about $24 million of the $45 million cost for the first phase, said Michael Cicchetti, the assistant director of the Capital City Economic Development Authority. State and federal grants will provide the rest. 
 But the latest plan is a significant retrenchment from that of the previous developers, who had at various times proposed up to 240 luxury apartments, 170,000 square feet of retail and restaurants and a multiscreen movie theater. 
 Jerry Collins, the owner of the Arch Street Tavern, a pub that is one of the few places to eat in the vicinity of Front Street, looked wistfully outside his windows on a recent Thursday at the project's dirt piles, his only scenery for months. Mr. Collins's restaurant managed to weather the closing of the access street to the restaurant some months ago (it has since reopened), among many other inconveniences. But he has waited years for his view to change, and he said he was hoping that Mr. Nitkin would be able to get the earth to move again. 
 ''Brad's trying,'' Mr. Collins said. ''The market changed on him -- interest rates went up and housing slowed -- and I'm sure he's being careful. It's become the incredible shrinking site.'' Mr. Nitkin estimated that the first phase would be open by the summer of 2008. 
 Hartford and retailing have long been a difficult mix. The thousands of workers who flow into Hartford every morning tend to eat there, but do their shopping elsewhere. There is no grocery store downtown, and few thriving retail establishments. 
 ''Hartford has a long history of trying to force retail downtown,'' said Richard Heapes, an architect and principal in Street-Works, who also previously worked on the Front Street project when the Manhattan developer Richard Cohen was involved with it.
 ''Ask any mayor of a new growth city, and they'll tell you the way to get viable retail is to get residential down there,'' Mr. Heapes said. ''Slowly, they're adding units downtown, which will add people to the streets, but it is going to have to evolve.''

HEADLINE: The Corporate Housing Solution

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Longwood Towers, a brick apartment complex in Brookline, Mass., built in the 1920s, was being converted into condominiums last spring when the market slowed. Since some tenants had already moved out, the developer, the Radco Companies of Atlanta, appeared to have two options: leave the apartments empty and lose the revenue, or advertise for new tenants and risk turning off potential buyers.
 Radco chose another strategy. Through a management company, the developer leased 25 furnished apartments to Harvard University for short-term use by professors and researchers. Similarly, in 2002, Radco hired a corporate housing provider to find temporary tenants after it acquired a failed condominium project in Atlanta, the River West, in which three-quarters of the units were vacant.
''You don't want to send a mixed message to the marketplace that we're renting when we're not,'' Norman Radow, president of Radco, said. Enumerating the advantages of corporate housing, he said: ''There were no ads in the newspaper that apartments were for rent. There was no buzz in the marketplace, and you didn't have 10 people a day coming to look at apartments.'' 
 Corporate housing -- generally apartments leased to companies that furnish them, equip them with linens and dishes and rent them out for a month or more -- is mainly intended as an alternative to hotels for executives or employees either on temporary assignment or in the midst of relocating. But it can also be a boon for developers during a building's transition from rental to condominium or for condominium investors facing a sluggish market.
 ''We can work in almost any cycle,'' said H. Lee Curtis, the president of BridgeStreet Worldwide, a division of Interstate Hotels and Resorts, and one of four corporate housing providers with apartments in multiple locations. The other industry leaders are Oakwood Worldwide, which dwarfs its rivals with 18,000 units; Marriott ExecuStay, a division of the hotel company; and Equity Corporate Housing, a division of Equity Residential, the nation's largest apartment real estate investment trust. A relatively small and fragmented slice of the real estate industry, corporate housing is also offered by hundreds of local companies.
 Like the hotel industry, this sector was hard hit by the recession that began in 2001, but it ''is now getting back to pre-9/11 levels,'' Mr. Curtis said.
 Not surprisingly, corporate housing's performance is closely tied to economic growth, said Craig Leupold, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., that focuses on real estate investment trusts. ''When the economy is adding jobs -- that's when business is best,'' he said.
 But Howard Ruby, the chief executive and founder of Oakwood Worldwide, said his business was growing because it was going after new customers like baby boomers seeking to visit grandchildren for a month at a time without imposing on their children. The private company, which last year sold 7,000 apartments to Archstone-Smith, an apartment REIT, and leased them back, now bills itself as a provider of ''temporary'' rather than ''corporate'' housing.
 In a recent study, the Highland Group, a consulting company for the lodging industry, counted nearly 60,000 units of corporate housing in 34 metropolitan areas, an increase of about 12 percent since 2004. In those areas, revenue for 2005 was close to $2 billion, up from about $1.53 billion during the recent recession, and the average stay was 82 days. 
 Peggy Berg, Highland's president, said the number of corporate apartments throughout the country was not known because there were so many different providers. ''Sometimes a broker will have two or three apartments available,'' she said.
 With about 4,800 units, New York ranks third in inventory after the Washington-Baltimore and Los Angeles areas, according to the Highland report. A tight rental market has made it difficult for operators to find apartments, leading to higher rents, the providers say.
 ''Some landlords try to charge a premium,'' said Frank Laufer, the president of Alternative Business Accommodations, which has apartments in 20 buildings in the New York area. 
 Rents in the New York area averaged $170 a night, compared with $100 nationwide, according to the Highland report. Manhattan prices can run much higher. At 1600 Broadway, a sleek new residential tower overlooking Times Square, Bridge-Street and its partner, a local company, Furnished Quarters, as well as Alternative Business Accommodations, offer one-bedroom condominiums for $225 and up a night. Since 2005, corporate apartments rented in New York for less than six months have also been subject to city hotel taxes.
 Given that New York hotel rates, even at those that specialize in long-term stays, exceed $300 a night, ''the benefits of a fully furnished apartment become very apparent,'' said Bill Hoffman, the president of Equity Corporate Housing.
 Unlike the owners of 1600 Broadway, most condominium associations in New York and some apartment building landlords, like Glenwood Management, prohibit leases with corporate housing providers, Mr. Laufer said. The Related Companies allows temporary use of its apartments but does not allow them to turn over more than twice a year, said David J. Wine, a vice chairman.
 The corporate housing industry is under scrutiny in New York because of reports that apartments intended for permanent housing are being rented to tourists. The city has received 200 complaints in the last few months, primarily in Manhattan, and is using undercover investigators to examine the extent of the practice, said John Feinblatt, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's criminal justice coordinator. The violators include individuals renting out their own apartments as well as condominium conversion sponsors and corporate housing providers, he said. 
 ''This is a growing problem that doesn't follow one specific fact pattern,'' said Mr. Feinblatt, who declined to provide details. Though the 30-day minimum is not enshrined in city law, stays of that duration have traditionally been allowed, but Mr. Feinblatt would not say if this policy should continue. ''Thirty days is not any magical elixir,'' he said. The city is trying to find a way to balance a need for corporate housing with the safety and quality-of-life needs of permanent residents, he said.
 Last year, Swig Equities, the owner of the Sheffield, a rental building at 322 West 57th Street that was undergoing a conversion to condominiums, leased about 85 unoccupied apartments to Furnished Quarters, said Steven H. Brown, its president.
 Nancy Rovelli, the president of the tenants association, said in an e-mail message: ''For the tenants, life became a nightmare: hordes of tourists hellbent on having a good time in the Big Apple; late-night parties in the hallways; and a complete breakdown of security, as doormen could no longer distinguish who belonged in the building and who did not.''
 In September 2005, Swig was fined $800 by the city Environmental Control Board for violating its certificate of occupancy by allowing daily rentals through the Furnished Quarters Web site. But Mr. Brown said all the apartments were rented for 30 days or longer, though that may not have been clear to the permanent residents. ''We did not do hotel stays there,'' he said.
 Kent M. Swig, the president of Swig Equities, contended that Furnished Quarters had only 36 apartments in the building, and none were used for short stays. He said his company had paid the fine because it was cheaper than challenging the city in court.
 Mr. Brown said unscrupulous operators who treat apartments like hotel rooms were tarnishing his industry. ''There are people out there whose business is built solely on short stays, with tour buses pulling up and listings on Travelocity,'' he said. ''It's not what our business is.''

HEADLINE: After Thai Stocks Plunge, A Policy Shift Is Revised 

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Alarmed by a one-day plunge of about 15 percent in the country's stock market Tuesday, the Thai government stepped in to reverse some capital controls imposed a day earlier by the country's central bank. 
 Investors across the region had criticized the controls as a weak attempt at halting a sharp rise in the Thai currency, the baht. After benchmark indexes in Malaysia and Singapore dropped on Tuesday by roughly 2 percent, whole those in India fell 2.5 percent and Indonesia posted an almost 3 percent decline, Finance Minister Pridiyathorn Devakula announced that the military-appointed Thai government would revise a rule imposed Monday that effectively taxed short-term foreign investment. 
''This was not a mistake,'' Mr. Pridiyathorn said after the market closed Tuesday, in an attempt to defend the original decrees. ''Measures always have side effects. Once we knew the side effects, we quickly fixed it.'' 
 The sudden market turmoil on Tuesday in Southeast Asia seemed to echo the 1997 currency crisis, when a devaluation by Thailand's central bank prompted panicky sell-offs of currencies, ultimately resulting in an economic setback across Asia. 
 The main difference Tuesday was that rather than trying to stop a plunge in the baht, Thailand was acting instead to stop sharp increases in its currency. The baht hit a nine-year high against the dollar Monday, topping off a rise of 16 percent this year. 
 The controls that Bangkok employed were intended to push the currency down by dissuading foreigners from buying baht. Governments across Asia are grappling with a dollar that is rapidly declining against their currencies. This phenomenon raises the price of Asian exports for consumers in the United States and other dollar-based economies. 
 Thailand has suffered the most in Asia in that regard. ''What Thailand is doing is, in a way, a precursor to what others might be contemplating but in their own cost-benefit analysis don't yet have the guts to do,'' said Venkatraman Anantha-Nageswaran, an economist at Bank Julius Baer in Singapore. 
 The concern among policy makers in Southeast Asia is that, as they learned during the 1997 financial crisis, foreign funds can flow out as quickly as they flow in, devastating financial markets in their wake. The capital controls, similar to ones adopted and eventually rescinded by Malaysia in the 1990s, were announced Monday by the newly appointed central bank governor, Tarisa Watanagase. 
 Foreign investors were required by Monday's decree to put 30 percent of incoming funds in reserve for one year. The reserve funds would not earn interest and would be subject to a 10 percent tax if the money was withdrawn before one year. 
 After the market shock Tuesday, Mr. Pridiyathorn consulted with brokers, investors and representatives of foreign banks and announced that the reserve requirement would no longer apply to stocks. The rule remains in place for bonds and commercial paper. 
 Investors lost more than $20 billion in paper wealth Tuesday when stocks in Thailand suffered their largest drop in over a decade. They were particularly angered by Mr. Pridiyathorn's comment late Tuesday that ''just one day of stocks falling is not considered much damage.''
 ''He was far too nonchalant,'' said Korn Chatikavanij, a former president of the Thai arm of J. P. Morgan Chase who is deputy secretary general of the Democrat Party. ''Genuine damage was caused today that needs to be acknowledged.'' 
 Outside Thailand there are no signs that other central bankers will impose similar capital controls. Central bank officials in Indonesia and South Korea said Tuesday that they did not consider any policy changes necessary. Malaysia specifically ruled out such controls. 
 The Bank of Thailand may well have done the job for them, economists said. Analysts said that with the year-end holidays approaching, investors were typically on the lookout for any news that would justify selling their positions and closing the books. 
 The Bank of Thailand may therefore have inadvertently provided the pinprick to a six-month rally in emerging Asian markets that has been pushing stocks and currencies to record highs since May, when fears of rising United States interest rates brought an abrupt halt to the previous appetite for Asian equity. 
 ''The liquidity has not died away,'' said Amy Auster, a regional economist at ANZ Bank in Melbourne, Australia. ''We are in an environment with a strong risk appetite, and that will favor Asia.'' 
 According to data compiled by Nomura, roughly $2.8 billion has poured into Thailand's stock market from overseas this year despite political turmoil that culminated in the September coup. Likewise, equity investors have plowed more than $1 billion into the Philippines, $1.78 billion into Indonesia and $8.3 billion into India.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Ex-Worker at Drug Giant Was Out to Damage Computer Data

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS; David Randall contributed reporting from Newark, Nate Schweber from Montville, N.J., and Brad Stone from New York.

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
A federal grand jury has indicted a former systems administrator for the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager on fraud charges, saying he installed a ''logic bomb'' on company computers, a program that could have erased critical prescription information for 60 million Americans. Among the records that could have been destroyed were those pharmacists use to determine whether there are dangerous combinations in an individual's prescribed drugs.
 Yung-Hsun Lin, 50, had worked for seven years for the company, Medco Health Solutions of Franklin Lakes, N.J., before being fired in 2005 during the investigation that ultimately led to his arrest near dawn Tuesday at his yellow, Cape Cod-style home in Montville. 
Prosecutors contend that, fearing layoffs in the fall of 2003, Mr. Lin set the program in the computer system to be activated on his birthday the following April. But prosecutors said that a glitch in the code prevented the program from running, and that Mr. Lin wrote a new code that would have been executed in April 2005 had it not been discovered by a colleague in January 2005. 
 ''The potential damage to Medco and the patients and physicians served by the company cannot be understated,'' Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. ''A malicious program like this can bring a company's operations to a grinding halt and cause millions of dollars in damage from lost data, system downtime, recovery and repair.''
 But Mr. Lin's wife, Linda, and lawyer, Valerie Wong, said he was simply trying to develop a program to automatically erase data rather than remove it manually as some of the company's 70 servers were decommissioned.
 ''We do not deny that he designed the code, but what they call a logic bomb was a way to handle things more efficiently,'' Ms. Wong said. ''The program was in a testing phase and he never used it. He tried to explain that to Medco at the time and he was shocked that they were investigating him.''
 Mr. Lin, who was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1987, used a Chinese translator during a brief court hearing Tuesday at which his bail was set at $500,000. He will formally enter a plea at arraignment, scheduled for Jan. 3. He could face 10 years in prison if he is convicted.
 It is the second recent prosecution of New Jersey residents accused of planting logic bombs in company computers. Last week a former employee of UBS PaineWebber, said to be angered that his 2002 bonus was less than promised, was sentenced to eight years and ordered to pay $3.1 million in restitution for crashing 2,000 of the company servers.
 In 1996, an information technology administrator with Omega Engineering in Bridgeport, N.J., used a logic bomb that activated 20 days after he was fired from the company to erase all of its data.
 Dawn M. Cappelli, a senior member of Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team, said logic bombs are typically put in place by disgruntled employees bent on revenge. They are designed to erase data and wreak havoc when a set date arrives or other external conditions are met. Unlike viruses, which originate outside of a system and which must go through firewalls and other intrusion detection devices before doing damage, logic bombs are internal and harder to detect ahead of time, Ms. Cappelli said.
 At Medco, the bomb was discovered by a systems analyst on the trail of an unrelated computer problem. A company investigation led to Mr. Lin being dismissed from his $125,000-a-year job for misconduct, and the case was referred by Medco to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Cybercrime Unit. After an investigation of nearly two years, in which Mr. Lin himself was frequently interviewed, an indictment was handed up this week.
 It charges that Mr. Lin first installed the logic bomb at a time when Medco, formerly a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical giant, Merck, was being spun off as a separate company, and he expressed fear of widespread layoffs to co-workers.
 Mr. Lin, who has an 18-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter, has not worked in computers since leaving Medco in 2005, and most recently worked as an office manager for a friend from his church, the Christian Chinese Church of New Jersey, a Presbyterian congregation.
 In an interview at the federal courthouse after the hearing, his wife said that over the last 18 months Mr. Lin ''had prayed to God every day because he knew he didn't do anything wrong.''
 His lawyer, Ms. Wong, accused the government of selectively prosecuting Mr. Lin because of his race, comparing the situation to that of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist who was accused of leaking highly classified warhead data to China. After a five-year investigation, Mr. Lee pleaded guilty in 2000 to a single felony count of mishandling secrets and was released, having spent nearly nine months in solitary confinement.
 The United States attorney's office denied that Mr. Lin's prosecution was racially motivated.
 The case highlights the increasingly important role of private, managed care health systems in the country. Medco, a company which had $38 billion in revenue in 2005 and which employs 15,000 people as well as 2,200 pharmacists, is what is known as a prescription benefit management company. Employer health plans use such companies to keep track of prescriptions; dispense them, often by mail; help set reimbursement rates; designate preferred medications and even dosages for particular conditions; and help negotiate the price that a plan will pay to a pharmaceutical company.
 Such companies also deal with retail pharmacies that can access their data banks when filling a plan member's prescriptions. A local pharmacist would then have the cost allowed by the plan for the prescription as well as a history of the patient's medications. Dr. John L. Colaizzi, dean of the Ernesto Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers University, said that such records allowed the pharmacist to perform the all important ''Drug Utilization Review'' so that patients ''do not get in trouble with drug interactions.''
 Soraya Rodriguez-Balzac, a spokeswoman for Medco, said that the company's pharmacists could provide the same kind of review. But the real value of Medco's data, she said, is as a research tool to determine the best and most economical drug treatments for many chronic conditions.

HEADLINE: Looking South, With Heart And Cash

DATELINE: NYACK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
When Kathy Riedlinger first stepped into the devastated hulk that would become her middle and high school after Hurricane Katrina blew apart New Orleans, it was a disaster zone of mold and ruin, 164,000 square feet of hurt with 182 broken windows.
 When students began school there in August, it had no telephone, no gym, no Internet service, no cafeteria, no water fountains, no textbooks. 
Now some things are better (a few phones, Internet, textbooks), some are still getting there (still no cafeteria or water fountains, two boys' and two girls' bathrooms for 683 students). But nothing is normal in a school on two campuses where 60 percent of the students are still displaced from the homes they had lived in before Katrina. 
 Ms. Riedlinger, the principal of the Lusher Charter School, came to Nyack last week in search of music -- specifically a tribute to New Orleans that raised close to $8,000 for musical instruments to replace those destroyed by the storm. But she came away with something as important -- the recognition, for a night at least, that people still remembered, still cared, still knew how much needed to be done 15 months after Katrina blew her world to bits.
 Being an educator in New Orleans, a place where dysfunctional schools have long been the rule, has never been easy. But compound a failing school system with a city still recovering from the storm, and you have the challenge of a lifetime. That's what Ms. Riedlinger faced. She got permission from Louisiana officials to operate as a charter school, managed to reopen an elementary and middle school with 875 children last January and the new combined high school and middle school in August. Since then, it's been a matter of looking for money -- a gift here, a grant there -- and doing jobs a piece at a time. It is similar to crawling, then walking toward a school day that most other people take for granted.
 So when about 150 people showed up for readings, music and photographs celebrating New Orleans at the new Riverspace arts center in Nyack, they were not going to solve all her problems. That won't happen for a decade or more.
 But maybe they could solve a few. The event got its start when Suzie Devoe, a local actress, got the idea from a benefit she attended in Manhattan. She asked a Nyack resident, Rob Brown, who was working in New Orleans, for places to support. He mentioned Lusher, one of the more lauded educational efforts in New Orleans. She took the idea to the fledgling Riverspace arts group. Artists like the actress Kathleen Chalfant and the director Jonathan Demme were among those who agreed to participate. 
 THERE were readings about New Orleans from Mark Twain, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and others. There were photographs of the city, including some from Arnold Roufa, a retired doctor who attended the school that now houses the Lusher upper school. There was a showing of segments of a documentary on New Orleans being filmed by Mr. Demme.
 There was a sweet logic to it all. Nyack isn't New Orleans. What is? But it's happily eccentric, full of artists, proudly diverse -- racially and economically -- and on the water. Not a bad match.
 Ms. Riedlinger said that any euphoria about survival and homecoming are long gone from New Orleans. People are resigned to a long, slow comeback in which some parts of the city may never come back at all. 
 ''Kids can't wait 5 to 10 years,'' she said. ''So if we have to accept how slow some things will be, we have to have a sense of urgency, too. They only go to school once. You can't come back in 10 years and do what you can't do now.''
 But if you have to be patient about some things, you can't be about others.
 ''We need to have a commitment not just to give them what they would get ordinarily, but a commitment greater than that because of all the things they're dealing with,'' Ms. Riedlinger said.
 You can't save a city in a night, and $8,000 goes only so far when a baritone sax can cost $2,500. The lesson goes further.
 So, as the narrator announced, after a reading from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ended the evening: ''There is still much to be done in the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. Do not forget. Thank you for your help. Keep us in your thoughts and prayers. Good night.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Diamonds Are for Never?'' (Thursday Styles, Dec. 14): 
 Since there is still doubt that diamond buyers can be assured that they are not buying conflict diamonds, the time is ripe for fair-trade diamonds to boost the economy of African nations and benefit workers.
Envision an industry where diamonds are mined, polished and made into final products within Africa. Workers are paid living wages with benefits, have good working conditions, with no child or slave labor, and the ability to freely organize -- all verified by independent oversight. 
 The continent's economy will benefit by producing final products, not just raw materials. And buyers could then feel good about their purchases.

HEADLINE: A Growing Stream of Illegal Immigrants Choose to Remain Despite the Risks 

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
More Mexican immigrants are in the United States illegally -- without the proper authorization to reside or work here -- than ever before.
 The newest arrivals from Mexico are putting down roots for longer periods and settling in states that have rarely encountered Latin American immigrants, places like North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Minnesota. These new immigrants are also bringing young families with them, a trend that has strained some schools and other public services.
An estimated 6.2 million illegal immigrants from Mexico now live in the United States, about half the total number of all Mexicans residing here, according to data compiled by the Pew Hispanic Center, a research group in Washington. In all, more than 10 percent of Mexico's 116 million citizens now live in the United States as legal or illegal immigrants. 
 Mexicans have been migrating to the United States for more than a century, but until recently most did so legally. The heavy stream of illegal immigration did not begin until the 1970s. In 1970, the United States was home to 750,000 Mexicans, primarily legal immigrants, census figures show. 
 The late 1990s saw a spike in the population of illegal workers entering the country, drawn by the boom in the economy, particularly in the service and construction industries. Of the Mexican immigrants now living here, 85 percent arrived here without authorization, the Pew center estimates.
 Ask Mexican immigrants why they risk coming to the United States illegally, and the reasons seldom vary: better wages, plentiful jobs, family ties and future opportunity.
 ''It's the same things you and I want for our families,'' said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
 For most Mexicans, obtaining a visa to live here is next to impossible because either there are too few visas available or the wait is too long. It is also increasingly difficult for Mexicans, particularly poor Mexicans, to obtain tourist visas since the American government tries to screen out people who are likely to remain here illegally.
 Immigrants who get caught living in the United States without authorization typically face deportation and are barred from re-entering the country legally for as long as 10 years. For most Mexicans, that prohibition does not dissuade them from returning but means daunting complications of time and money. Often they must pay a smuggler to help them cross back into the United States at a cost of thousands of dollars, which can take years to save or pay back.
 Moreover, immigrants who have been deported once and are caught again can face prosecution and a prison sentence. In recent years, the United States government has been stricter in pursuing these cases to send a message to other illegal immigrants.
 Increased enforcement along the border in recent years -- especially since the Sept. 11 attacks -- appears to have deterred few immigrants, Mr. Papademetriou said, but has resulted in a greater demand for smugglers, higher prices for smuggling and more deaths from crossing the border. It has also discouraged people from going back home.
 A number of Mexicans also enter the United States with border-crossing cards and then remain here, although it is impossible to know how many. The card allows Mexicans to visit for short periods, between 72 hours and 30 days, and they must stay within 25 miles of the border. People often use these cards to make quick shopping trips. More than 732,000 of the cards were issued last year.
 Today's new wave of illegal immigrants, many of them with children in tow, has rippled through the nation's schools. Communities where immigrants gather face challenges to educate children speaking only Spanish whose parents often had limited schooling at home. 
 Because they fill low-wage jobs with no or few benefits, Mexicans also suffer a high poverty rate. In some labor markets, they compete for jobs with the nation's most disadvantaged, especially young blacks without high school diplomas, scholars at the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University found.

HEADLINE: Fear and Hope in Immigrant's Furtive Existence

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO 

 BODY:
Veronica keeps her foot steady on the pedal. She turns onto a side street, where trouble is easier to avoid. A yellow traffic light flashes and she stops; running it is not an option.
 Veronica, 31, does not take chances. In her mind, she already took the biggest chance of her life by moving here illegally from Monterrey, Mexico, with a husband and three young children. Now she has too much to lose.
Border Patrol agents routinely monitor the main roads near her house on the outskirts of this sprawling city in south-central Texas, so Veronica and her friends and relatives have informal alert networks in place. ''My husband just called to tell me he saw them right now on the street,'' she said, clicking shut her cellphone, before leaving the house.
 Spanish-language radio also does its part; ''limones verdes'' -- or green limes -- ''are sprouting'' near the highway, an announcer warns over the radio, using shorthand for the agents' green uniforms. 
 ''We're careful,'' Veronica said. 
 And why not. After six years in America, her list of accomplishments would be the envy of most everyone in the ramshackle neighborhood where she grew up.
 There is the little house, stone and stucco, with a browning yard, a battered trampoline and rusty plumbing. The family's two used cars (a minivan and a Ford Focus) sit in the driveway. 
 Her common-law husband, Jose, has a job other immigrants covet, $15 an hour working for a boss who offers no benefits but gives generous presents: a refrigerator, a washing machine, tickets to SeaWorld. Her children speak to each other in English and bring home mostly A's and B's. Her eighth grader is in the National Honor Society, and a son was recently rewarded with a GameCube for doing well in school. 
 It may not seem like much, Veronica says, but in Monterrey's working-class ''colonias'' she lived in houses with cardboard walls and zinc roofs. Growing up, she shared a single damp box spring with eight siblings and coffee cans. The cans were there to catch the rain. And Veronica was the lucky one of the bunch, she said: she made it to eighth grade, with the help of her siblings' wages, and, as the baby of the family, escaped her father's beatings.
 Two of her sisters, Raquel Rodriguez and Irma, and one of her brothers have also ventured to San Antonio for better lives. (The last names of Veronica and other family members who have immigrated illegally are not being published here.)
 Though separated by years, distance and degrees of success, their journeys have crisscrossed time and again, an up-close version of the broader immigrant experience that has Mexicans, legal and illegal, shuttling between hope and despair, between leaning on friends and relatives and going it alone.
 Even before Veronica's arrival here, Raquel's green card, her legal residency document, cast a special glow on the whole family. Raquel was the fixer, the one who made it possible even to imagine a path out of the thicket of poverty, the one who offered up a relatively soft landing in America, at least for a few months.
 ''Raquel was already here, and she got us so enthusiastic,'' Veronica said, remembering her sister's pitch about jobs and a better life during her visits home. ''She kept at us. We thought no, no. Then we said, 'Let's make a go of it.' Raquel did it. She helped us.''
 Irma, who had no green card, also took advantage of Mrs. Rodriguez's welcome but later gave up on America, returning three years ago to Monterrey to a dreary cinderblock house with an outdoor bathroom; Mrs. Rodriguez still lives here about 10 miles away, but her world is also far removed from Veronica's: Mrs. Rodriguez has a steady job with benefits and can move about without fear of getting caught for being here illegally.
 Like millions of other illegal immigrants, Veronica and Jose first entered the United States on tourist visas, which they were able to get from the American consulate in Monterrey. Veronica had secured hers as a child and was able to extend it. The family was waved in at the checkpoint in Laredo, except for her two daughters from her earlier marriage who hid under a blanket in the back seat.
 Veronica's visa is still good, for five more years, but there are conditions. She can stay only for six months at a time and cannot work. Veronica has violated both rules, making her an illegal immigrant, or in the Mexican vernacular, someone ''sin papeles,'' without papers.

Neighborhood Safety Zones
 In a country of dedicated spotlight seekers, Veronica makes a habit of kicking attention away like a stray ball. She prefers to shrink into the background of her modest neighborhood and operate within its safety zones, an area of about five square miles where people don't ask her to flash cards she doesn't have. Insurance card. Social Security card. Credit card. Green card.
 Caution corrals her hopes and expectations. She doesn't dare drive the 200 miles to Houston to visit a close cousin. The road, so open and busy, is pockmarked with risk. That popular little taco restaurant on the road about a mile away? Veronica heard it was a favorite refueling stop for Border Patrol agents. 
 This summer, when word filtered down that ''la migra'' -- immigration -- was staking out Wal-Mart and the flea market, Veronica stayed away. ''Now no more Wal-Mart, and in Wal-Mart they gave you layaway,'' she lamented.
 In the garbled game of immigrant telephone -- where messages trundle past cultural miscues and language hurdles -- bad information gets passed along like extra coupons. It took her five years to get a driver's license because she heard it was not safe for someone ''sin papeles'' to apply. She also heard she had to take a test on a computer and she had never used a computer before. 
 ''I said, 'God, you are my Social Security card and my driver's license,''' Veronica said. ''We were afraid to go and get it. But then you meet people who have done it, and you figure out it's O.K.''
 Her social life is just as constrained. As Veronica walks out of her house, she spies a neighbor across the street and gives her a quick wave. She doesn't know her name. She doesn't want to know. People on her block learn to avert their eyes.
 ''You never know,'' Veronica said. ''There are bad people in the world. We could have a problem with immigration. There is a lot of envy in the world, so we are careful.'' 
 She has one constant friend, Belinda, a sweet Mexican woman who recently had a job earning $3.50 an hour making tacos. Belinda lives in a dusty trailer park nearby with her two daughters and an American husband who charges her to use the family car. Being with Belinda reminds Veronica that her life, however difficult, is blessed.

An Exercise in Humiliation
 No rules are too small for Veronica, and she tries hard to live as a lawful illegal immigrant, an oxymoron she shrugs off.
 Her husband, a shy, handsome man who works 50 hours a week as a machinist, relaxes after work by fixing up old cars. One day not long ago, a code enforcement officer told him that broken-down cars had to be kept off driveways. Veronica panicked. Jose now fixes the cars in the backyard.
 One mistake, Veronica explained, and it's back to Monterrey, back to borrowing money for diapers. 
 Even in her daily routine, Veronica said, it is hard to forget that she is illegal, and sometimes unwelcome. 
 A few months ago, she and Jose ventured into a big-box store to return a faulty microwave oven. It was an exercise in humiliation, she said. The employee refused to take it back.
 ''I told them we are paying customers,'' Veronica said. ''We are not asking for things for free.''
 Finally, Jose's boss called the store and the microwave was swapped.
 Mexican-American cashiers have pretended not to understand Spanish when Veronica, who can't speak English, asks a question. It is a power play among Spanish speakers designed to haze and embarrass the newest immigrants.
 ''Sometimes they call you mojados to your face,'' said Veronica, using the Spanish word for ''wetback.''
 But then, she said, there is the flip side. Santa Claus visits their house every Christmas, courtesy of a local charity. The nurses and doctors at the hospital where she had her fourth child, a girl, also saved her elementary school boy after his appendix burst. ''They treat you better here than in Mexico,'' Veronica said. ''Living here without papers is still better than living there.''
 She worked for a while, when Jose was still pounding out car dents and hustling odd jobs for $200 a week. The underground network led her to a man who sold fake Social Security cards and to a job at a factory, making cots for the military for $5.15 an hour. Her boss was kind and gave her extra shift work.
 But she noticed her son, at the time her only child not in school, had grown listless. A few questions revealed that the woman who watched him for $60 a week secluded him in one room and fed him scraps to save money. He became anemic, and that ended Veronica's job. Now she works some weekends cleaning her husband's boss's offices.
 Mostly she labors at home. She mops the green linoleum floors every day, cooks two meals for her husband and feeds her children in the evening. She brings order to the bedrooms, even the makeshift ones with hanging sheets as doors and dividers, each with a bed, queen or twin. Her children all share beds. The youngest daughter, a 4-year-old born in San Antonio, proudly brings forth her toys: a book, a doll's head, a plastic dollhouse. 
 Bargain hunting is a second job. She drives around the neighborhood Fridays and Saturdays with her friend Belinda looking for ''garajes,'' garage sales. Veronica is assiduous in her bargaining.
 ''Cuanto?'' she asks, holding a set of sheets in someone's driveway.
 ''Cuatro dolares,'' the seller says. Four dollars.
 ''Te lo compro por dos,'' Veronica says, bringing her down to $2.
 For $6, Veronica walks away with strappy sandals, two pairs of pants, towels and the sheets.

Working Off the Books
 Veronica is grateful to be here, even as a shadow. But she earns her keep. ''I get angry when you hear on television that we don't pay for things and don't pay taxes,'' Veronica said.
 She yanks her property tax bill out of a file. It is more than $1,800. Here is her home insurance bill, $713 a year. Social Security is deducted from her husband's paycheck even though he bought his Social Security card on the black market.
 Veronica works off the books so does not pay taxes on her wages; her sister Raquel, the legal resident, got her a cellphone, which also required a Social Security number. 
 Veronica and Jose have learned to navigate the underground economy to get ahead. At first they shied from opening up a bank account, but the fees at the check-cashing place ($1 for every $100 cashed) drove them to it. All it required was a tourist visa and a taxpayer identification number, which allows workers to pay tax to the federal government.
 She pulled out her $1,000 bill from the hospital for her son's appendectomy. She is paying it bit by bit. That was all she was charged, she said, because she didn't have enough money to pay the whole bill. The hospital told her the government would pay the rest.
 Buying their house was tricky. Without a credit trail, Veronica said she didn't even think about a mortgage, so they took another route, one without lawyers and credit reports. They met with the owners of the house and the four of them signed a piece of paper, banking on nothing but trust that in about 15 years the house would be theirs. Veronica goes to the bank every month and deposits $537, which includes 10 percent interest. That money pays off the owners' mortgage.
 Veronica frets that the house could be snatched away from them, by the government, by the owner. When that happens, she prays. She pushes the negative thoughts out and takes a leap of faith. 
 ''The owner is a nice person,'' she said. ''But who knows? It is in God's hands.'' 

Uncertainty and Longing
 Veronica speaks about God with the passion of a new convert. It is her way of fending off the uncertainty at home and the longing she feels for her family in Monterrey. When her days seem too tenuous, Veronica prays, usually alone in her bedroom with her Bible.
 She asks God to protect her family from harm, to keep her strong, to help her relatives in Mexico buy a hot water heater. She asks that her husband's boss stay faithful to him. She prays that her children stay far from drugs and sex. Some of her 17-year-old girl's schoolmates are already pregnant. 
 She talks to God about helping her go home to visit her mother and brothers, and her sister Irma, who left San Antonio three years ago. But her deepest prayers center on legitimacy, on getting a green card. She has heard on television about the election last month, and she is hopeful the changes in Washington might make it easier for her to stay here. 
 Veronica found God the usual way; she stumbled across him when she needed him most, in her case during an emergency room visit for pain in her uterus that wouldn't let up. The pain in her heart, Veronica said, cut just as deeply. She was depressed. Jose picked up a pamphlet on a table; it was an invitation to an evangelical church.
 Now the tiny church nearby -- no more than a converted garage in the back of a house where she prays to Jesus in Spanish -- is her solace. It is one of the few places she visits regularly without fear.
 ''Since then, I have not been sick,'' Veronica said of her churchgoing. ''It's the prayers. I feel so much better. Thank God.''
 ''God has his plan,'' Veronica added. ''None of it is coincidence. Because of him, we are better off.''
 On her knees, with her hands raised high as the youth choir sings and jams, Veronica finds that she fits in perfectly with the 50 or so other members, all of them Latino, many of them also one slip from misfortune. Her children sit with her, singing, studying. This is her community and she dresses up for it, with highlights in her hair, a long, tight-fitting skirt and an elegant black top. Her face is subtly lit by makeup. Despite her hardships, Veronica manages to look her age.
 ''We praise you Lord,'' the choir leader, a teenage girl, says over and over as the guitar player riffs. ''Te alabamos Senor. Te alabamos Senor.''

Struggles With English
 Back home, sitting down on her imitation leather sofa, Veronica watches as her 4-year-old daughter fixates on ''Dora the Explorer'' beaming from their large-screen television set, the family's most prized possession.
 Veronica has just finished cleaning her pots and pans. She had made chicken mole for Jose's boss and his workers earlier that day. She cooks once in a while to say thank you, whether he decides to pay her or not.
 The other children come home and do their homework. Veronica knows she should learn English. She can't check the homework -- the older children must help the younger ones -- and she can't understand what they say to each other, which makes her both nervous and proud. But finding a good English class requires more money, time and confidence than she has.
 ''I went to some free classes and learned a bit,'' she said, smiling, acknowledging that the classes offered up more gossip than English. ''I can say hello, order some hamburgers.''
 Photographs of Veronica's family in Mexico are all over the house. Most people don't give their photos a second glance. Veronica looks at them repeatedly, hungrily. The telephone is expensive. The Internet is not an option. Her family in Mexico is not wired, and her own secondhand computer crashed this summer.
 When a new pile of photographs arrives, Veronica scoops them up. ''Look, it's Shakira,'' Veronica said, poking sweet fun at her niece Lupita, Irma's daughter, who had dyed her hair light, like the singer's. 

A Father's Funeral Missed
 Of all the hardships she has faced -- grueling jobs, mice-infested apartments, illness, insults -- the worst, Veronica said, is not being able to hug her mother or idly chit-chat with her brothers and sisters.
 When Jose's father died, he could not go home for the funeral. He would not risk getting stranded in Mexico.
 ''To not go and put flowers on his father's grave, that is hard,'' Veronica said. ''He still cries about it.''
 Her husband, a gentle, strapping man who does not drink, spends most weekends working and has not taken a vacation in two years. Nothing like her first husband, who beat her. In Mexico, Jose had his own machine shop, and still they could not pay the bills.
 ''And it was not because my husband was not a good worker,'' Veronica said.
 Veronica, despairing, lost her willpower three years ago and went back to Mexico for a visit. At the border on her return to San Antonio, inside a car with a legal resident, she was questioned. The agent had found her Texas identification card in the computer database, a giveaway that she was not a tourist.
 Her heart racing, Veronica concocted a story on the fly. She had applied for the card for a visit to Las Vegas, she told the agent. Somehow it was convincing enough; he waved her through.
 ''It was too big a scare,'' Veronica said, vowing never to try such a journey again. ''I won't risk the future of my children.''

HEADLINE: Military Action Against Iran Would Be 'Disastrous,' Annan Says

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan said Tuesday that confronting the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program militarily would be ''disastrous,'' but that he expected the Security Council would come up with a negotiated settlement instead.
 Mr. Annan's comment was part of an answer to a question at a farewell news conference over whether there were lessons to be drawn from the military operation in Iraq for Iran. 
 ''I don't think we are there yet, or we should go in that direction,'' he said. ''I think it would be rather unwise and disastrous.''
 The United States has refused to withdraw the option of a military strike if Iran continues to defy Security Council demands that it suspend its nuclear program. But Washington has stressed that such a move is a last resort, only in the event that negotiations fail.
 Those negotiations, now in their fourth month, continued Tuesday through two inconclusive meetings of the ambassadors from Germany and the five permanent members of the Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
 Hopes of an imminent settlement were raised earlier on Tuesday when Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, told an interviewer in Moscow that the current revised draft of a sanctions resolution against Iran largely met Russian concerns and could become the basis of consensus.
 But the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, warned: ''There is a certain distance between basic agreement and final agreement. We are trying to cover this distance, and so far we are not there yet.''
 Wang Guangya, the ambassador of China, cautioned that the remaining differences were not small. ''Sometimes it looks like a technical difference, but sometimes it looks like a difference in principle,'' he said.
 Iran defied an Aug. 31 Security Council deadline to suspend uranium enrichment, which can produce fuel for nuclear plants and weapons, after turning down economic and political incentives offered in June by Britain, France and Germany.
 Iran says it is developing nuclear power for peaceful reasons, but Western governments contend that the real purpose is to build bombs.
 For months, the United States and Europe have been pressing for a sanctions resolution against Tehran, while China and Russia have been working to strip the resolution of punitive steps, which they argue are counterproductive and undermine the objective of bringing Iranians back into negotiations.
 In Washington, Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said patience was running out for holding a vote. ''We think it's time,'' he said. ''We are now in extra innings; I think we hit the ninth inning back in October.''
 The current text places a travel embargo and an asset freeze on agencies and people identified as being involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. In an effort to meet Russian and Chinese objections, the European authors of the text have narrowed the list down to those with direct connections to weapons development, but Mr. Churkin said Russia still wanted the travel ban eliminated entirely.
 ''Delegations have very firm views on issues, so we keep plugging away,'' said Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador. ''There are still some tough issues left,'' he said, adding that the travel ban was ''a priority and an important element of this resolution, and we will continue to push for it.''

HEADLINE: In This Town, Even a Mall Rat Can Get Rattled

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., Dec. 15 

 BODY:
It is fitting that the first store drivers heading south on Route 17 see as they enter town is a Stop & Shop. After all, Paramus is one of the nation's strongest shopping magnets, generating roughly $5 billion a year in retail sales, an amount about equal to the gross domestic product of Cambodia, Nicaragua or the sultanate of Brunei.
 There are larger malls and there are fancier malls elsewhere, but few places rival the sheer concentration of stores in this otherwise unremarkable suburb 18 miles northwest of Times Square. In an already densely populated state, Paramus has more parking spots than people.
Four major malls and dozens of smaller shopping centers are packed into 10 square miles. Paramus is home to Garden State Plaza, New Jersey's largest mall, whose two million square feet of stores attract 20 million shoppers a year. The town has 27,000 residents, and about 2,700 stores. There is a Saks Fifth Avenue and a Sears; at least two dozen chains, including Borders, Old Navy and Macy's, have more than one outlet within Paramus's boundaries. 
 It is a Faustian bargain that brings 200,000 cars a day into town during December, turning the roads into virtual parking lots, but also keeps property tax rates in Paramus relatively low -- $1.55 per $100 of assessed value, compared with $3.88 in Maywood, the next town over.
 And there is no sign of letup: two of the four malls are spending $100 million each to spruce themselves up, big-box stores are sprouting where strip malls and bygone department stores once sat, and traffic seems to get worse each year. All of which has made residents like Paul Giblin III seem a lot like Scrooge.
 Growing up in Paramus, a bedroom community with many white-collar workers, Mr. Giblin considered the malls a playground. Later, he saw them as a convenient place to get a lot done at once. But this year, the stores and roads have become so packed that Mr. Giblin, a 30-year-old financial adviser, said he was buying half his gifts online and the rest at smaller shops.
 ''I don't have the time to deal with the traffic and the malls,'' he said over chicken fingers and fries at the Suburban Diner on Route 17. ''My wife lives to shop, but she didn't go to the malls this year, either.''
 Residents have groaned about the traffic for years, but largely put up with it because of how much money visitors spent in the town's stores. They also won reprieves on Sundays, when the town prohibits sales of practically everything, making Paramus a virtual ghost town.
 Over all, analysts expect retail sales this season to be up about 4 percent over last year; owners of the Paramus malls would not provide specific figures about how they are doing. Yet while nearly all the available construction space in Paramus has been exhausted, developers keep adding movie theaters and restaurants in hopes of getting consumers to spend more during each visit.
 Among the attractions is that New Jersey has a lower sales tax than New York City (7 percent compared with 8.375 percent), and none on clothing and shoes -- New York has no state sales tax on clothing and shoe purchases of less than $110. And Paramus sits in wealthy Bergen County, where the average household income is $71,000 a year, 41st in the nation for counties with more than 65,000 residents. 
 ''Other than New York and Beverly Hills, where else do people go to shop as their profession? Paramus,'' said Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst at NPD Group, a market research firm. ''You can go there on a Wednesday afternoon and still see people shopping. 
 ''For the last 20 years, the industry has felt that the area was saturated,'' Mr. Cohen added, ''but to everyone's amazement, it still grows and attracts people from all over.''
 Paramus has no town center per se, but it seems to have a mall to suit every shopper's personality.
 Visitors from New York traveling west on Route 4 first hit Bergen Town Center, with a middle-market collection of shops, like the discount clothier Century 21. Upscale outfits like Brooks Brothers and Abercrombie & Fitch are among the 285 stores at the huge Garden State Plaza, where Wall Street analysts and investors flock for hints of how well the Christmas shopping season is going. 
 A bit north on Route 17 is a 45-acre plot featuring Ikea, Sports Authority and Bed, Bath & Beyond -- and room for 2,800 cars. And a mile up the road are the Fashion Center and Paramus Park malls, the latter with a sweeping second-floor food court overlooking child-friendly Build-A-Bear Workshop, Lego and Disney stores. 
 While outsiders gravitate to the malls, residents try to avoid the congestion. Irma Weishaupt and her husband, Lou, who have lived in Paramus for 45 years, say they stick to side streets and sometimes leave town to shop.
 ''Rule No. 1 is to avoid Route 17 in either direction,'' Mrs. Weishaupt said. ''It's the worst around Thanksgiving, but we're always questioning what's happening because it is getting worse.''
 Though a headache for residents, traffic has a silver lining for retailers: If cars crawl along at half the 50 mile-an-hour speed limit, potential customers have more time to size up the stores, and are more likely to stop someplace they might have otherwise passed.
 The mayor, James J. Tedesco III, considers the malls ''a double-edged sword.''
 ''For the benefit of almost 50 percent of the taxes being paid for by the business community, we have to put up with congestion,'' Mr. Tedesco said. ''You can say during the holiday season, the traffic is exasperating. It's a constant battle.''
 The battle began in the 1950s, when both the Bergen Mall, which was recently renamed Bergen Town Center, and Garden State Plaza were built. The suburbs in northern New Jersey were growing, and the main roads that crisscross Paramus and head in every direction were a retailer's dream. 
 But the traffic the malls generated swamped the roads. They have been widened repeatedly to accommodate the cars, with recent improvements to off-ramps and intersections, but it never seems to be enough.
 And the building continues. The Westfield Group, which manages Garden State Plaza, is expected to finish a $100 million renovation, adding shops and entertainment options, early next year; Vornado, which bought Bergen Town Center last year for $146 million, is just starting a $100 million overhaul of its own.
 Already, Paramus has 320 stores with more than $1 million in annual sales each, second in the country only to the 10021 ZIP code on the East Side of Manhattan. The vacancy rate for stores is 3 percent, several percentage points below the rate for similar real estate elsewhere. Some properties are filled even before the previous tenants move out. 
 ''Paramus is a town with a waiting list,'' said Chuck Lanyard, a commercial real estate broker at the Goldstein Group in Glen Rock.
 One sign of the malls' success is the booming valet services in their parking lots. Pro Valet Event Parking, which has 50 spots near the Papa Razzi restaurant in the Garden State Plaza, doubled its prices to $10 this holiday season.
 While the traffic is overwhelming for some in Paramus, the commercial frenzy has its rewards -- chiefly, businesses that pick up much of the tax burden. That has created a measure of jealousy in Maywood.
 A half-century ago, developers wanted to put a mall in Maywood and the parking lots in Paramus. Eager to preserve their town's character, Maywood residents rejected the proposal and instead got the lots, which generate little tax revenue. The town also has to grapple with the occasional stolen car, and for a fee, sewage from Bergen Town Center.
 ''We have gotten the short end of the stick for 50 years,'' said Thomas H. Richards, mayor of Maywood, which unlike Paramus still has something resembling a small-town Main Street.
 Maywood recently approved Vornado's plan to build three stores in Bergen Town Center on its side of the border, a decision that could add $250,000 to the town's tax rolls, Mr. Richards said, calling it ''a dream come true.'' 
 ''We'd like our share of the pie,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China Tightens Adoption Rules For Foreigners 

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK and JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
China plans to tighten rules on foreign adoptions, barring people who are single, obese, older than 50 or who fail to meet certain benchmarks in financial, physical or psychological health from adopting Chinese children, according to adoption agencies in the United States.
 The restrictions are in response to an enormous spike in applications by foreigners, which has far exceeded the number of available babies, said leaders of American adoption agencies who were briefed by Chinese officials earlier this month.
The new regulations, which have not yet been formally announced by the government-run China Center of Adoption Affairs, or C.C.A.A., are expected to take effect on May 1, 2007, and have raised concern and anxiety among prospective adoptive parents in this country.
 China has in recent years been the No. 1 source of foreign-born children adopted by Americans -- in the fiscal year 2006, the State Department granted 6,493 visas to Chinese orphans -- and its regulations on who can adopt have been less restrictive than those in some other countries, adoption agencies said. 
 Now, however, the agencies said, the Chinese government has formulated guidelines intended to recruit adoptive families with qualities that Chinese officials believe will provide the greatest chance that children will be raised by healthy, economically stable parents. 
 ''They need somehow to cut down on the number of families that are submitting'' adoption requests, said Jackie Harrah, executive director of Harrah's Adoption International Mission in Spring, Tex. 
 ''Their feeling is that while singles can be good parents,'' Ms. Harrah said, ''it is better for a child to be raised in a two-parent family, it's better for a parent to be educated, it's better for a parent not to be obese because they have a chance of living longer. What C.C.A.A. really wanted was the cream of the crop.''
 Several agencies said they had been flooded with confused, anxious or disappointed calls and e-mail messages from people wanting to adopt or those going through the application process. Most of those who had already initiated adoption applications were told that if they got all their paperwork in by May 1, they were likely to be approved.
 But international adoption agencies have already begun turning away applicants who did not meet the new criteria. 
 The guidelines include a requirement that applicants have a body-mass index of less than 40, no criminal record, a high school diploma and be free of certain health problems like AIDS and cancer. Couples must have been married for at least two years and have had no more than two divorces between them. If either spouse was previously divorced, the couple cannot apply until they have been married for at least five years.
 In addition, adoptive parents must have a net worth of at least $80,000 and income of at least $10,000 per person in the household, including the prospective adoptive child. 
 Parents can be as old as 55 if adopting a child with special needs.
 Timothy Sutfin, executive director of New Beginnings Family and Children's Services, an international adoption agency in Mineola, N.Y., said the new guidelines put China in the middle of the spectrum of countries -- not as restrictive as South Korea, but stricter than places like Guatemala or Vietnam. 
 Keith Wallace, the chief executive of Families Thru International Adoption, based in Evansville, Ind., said that adopting an American child could also be restrictive, with standards for the health, economic situation and marital status of the family.
 Despite the new rules, adoption agencies said they did not believe that the numbers of Chinese children adopted by Americans would decrease. Since 1991, Americans have adopted 55,000 Chinese children. Adoptions cost about $15,000, according to agency Web sites.
 Since one agency, Great Wall China Adoption in Austin, Tex., posted the new rules on its Web site last week, ''we've had about 400 e-mails and phone calls a day,'' said Heather Terry, director of regional offices for the agency. ''Some families were just turned down today. One was a couple where the husband had social anxiety disorder and takes Zoloft,'' a violation of the new guidelines that bar people who are taking medication for anxiety or depression. 
 One person who is disqualified is Tony Velong of Temple Terrace, Fla. Mr. Velong and his wife, Tracey, had previously adopted two girls from China and were considering applying for a third. But they are too old: he is 59 and she is 51.
 ''I'm sure anybody who is healthy and eligible to adopt a child and couldn't because of the age rule would be disappointed at least,'' said Mr. Velong, who was 55 when the first child was adopted.
 There is no question he is physically fit: he is the police chief of Temple Terrace. 
 ''I'm still working the street,'' Mr. Velong said, ''and you have to be in good shape. In reality, today's 60 was yesterday's 40, and I don't think that's fully understood.''
 A major reason that Chinese babies, most of them girls, are available for adoption is China's two-decade-old population control measure known as the ''one child policy.'' 
 The C.C.A.A., which was known to be developing the new guidelines for months, refused a request in recent weeks for an interview on adoption policy, and yesterday a call to the Chinese Embassy in Washington was not returned. An unidentified official cited by The Associated Press confirmed that the government was adopting new guidelines but declined to discuss specifics.
 Some of the guidelines are a culmination of what had been a previous tightening of criteria, agencies said. For the past few years, for example, to whittle down the applicant pool, China has limited the number of single parents allowed to adopt to 8 percent of the total, partly on the theory that if a single parent dies, the child has no other parent to turn to, agencies said.
 The ease of China's earlier standards was probably one reason for the deluge in applications, agencies said. But China is also popular because its system is well organized and efficient and because Chinese orphans are generally well cared for and have a good chance of being healthy when adopted.
 Foreign parents have become a common sight in cities like Guangzhou or Changsha, where they usually travel in groups and stay in the local five-star hotel for a few days as they acclimate themselves to their new baby.
 The quality of the Chinese system and the health of the children is what prompted Mindy and Michael Henderson of Austin to apply for a Chinese child this year, a girl, Grace, who they adopted last month. Under the new rules, Ms. Henderson, 33, would have been disqualified because she uses a wheelchair for a neuromuscular condition. As it was, she said, her adoption agency had to lobby hard to gain approval, and was successful only because Grace is 5, not an infant.
 ''It's really a shame,'' Ms. Henderson said of the health-related restrictions. ''I'm really, really active. I use a motorized wheelchair so I can get around by myself. I drive my own car, I've got a master's degree and I work a full-time job in management. My husband doesn't have any sort of a disability.''
 Adoption agencies differed on who would be most affected by the restrictions. Ms. Terry said, ''The body-mass index and the anxiety and depression are probably the two most significant blows. These are really common diagnoses here in America.''
 Ms. Harrah said that the age limit would exclude a lot of eager applicants, and that the marriage requirement of five years for a second marriage would mean for many that ''by the time they have been married for five years they will be over 50.''
 Others lamented the singles exclusion.
 ''It's a very sad day,'' said Peggy Lee Scott, president of the Northern California chapter of Families With Children From China. Ms. Scott, a single mother who adopted a Chinese baby 13 years ago, said a third of her chapter's families were headed by single mothers. 
 ''There always were a limited number of countries willing to adopt to single parents,'' she said. ''China was willing and recognized we could do a good job.''
 Ms. Scott's daughter, Abigail, concurred.
 ''Just because you don't have another adult doesn't mean you miss out on anything,'' Abigail said. ''In my opinion, having one parent is cool and makes you unique.''

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption yesterday with the continuation of a front-page article about plans by China to tighten rules on foreign adoptions referred incorrectly to Nancy Humphrey, a member of the Northern California chapter of Families With Children From China. She is coordinator of the chapter's single mothers group, not coordinator of the chapter.
A front-page article last Wednesday about plans by China to tighten rules on foreign adoptions misstated the percentage of families in the Northern California chapter of Families With Children From China that are headed by single parents and attributed the figure erroneously. About 10 percent of the families are headed by a single parent, not a third. The erroneous figure was given by a member of a single mothers group, not by the chapter president, Peggy Lee Scott.

HEADLINE: The State of Iraq: an Update

BYLINE: By NINA KAMP, MICHAEL O'HANLON AND AMY UNIKEWICZ. 
Nina Kamp is a senior research assistant at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Michael O'Hanlon is a senior fellow at Brookings and the co-author of ''Hard Power.'' Amy Unikewicz is a graphic designer in South Norwalk, Conn.

 BODY:
AS 2006 winds down, two developments inside Iraq stand out: the failure of the previous year's election to produce any sense of progress, and the commencement of Iraq's civil war, dating back to the Feb. 22 bombing of the hallowed Shiite mosque in Samarra and escalating ever since. 
 It is still possible to find signs of hope in our running statistics on Iraq -- the number of Iraqi security forces who are trained and technically proficient, the gradually improving economic output, the number of children being immunized. But those same children cannot feel safe on the way to school in much of today's Iraq; economic growth is a top-down phenomenon having little effect on the unemployment rate or well-being of Iraqis in places like Anbar Province and the Sadr City slum in Baghdad; and those increasingly proficient security forces remain politically unreliable in many cases, just as inclined to stoke sectarian strife as to contain it.
Despite some unconvincing comments from President Bush in the prelude to the November midterm elections that ''absolutely, we're winning,'' most Americans now agree on the diagnosis of the situation in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group warned of a further ''slide toward chaos.'' Colin Powell said on Sunday that he thought we are losing, even if all is not yet lost. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates admitted in his confirmation hearings that we aren't winning, even if he holds out hope that we also aren't losing. His predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, in a memo leaked several weeks ago, recognized that Iraq is going badly and put out a laundry list of potential options that we may have to consider, including multiparty negotiations modeled on those that ended the war in Bosnia. 
 Significant changes are clearly needed. At a minimum, we will probably require some combination of the options now being offered the president by the Iraq Study Group, the Pentagon and others -- a large program to create jobs, a surge of perhaps 25,000 more American troops to Iraq to improve security in Baghdad, an ultimatum to Iraqi political leaders that if they fail to achieve consensus on key issues like sharing oil, American support for the operation could very soon decline. 
 If such steps fail, last-ditch options may well be needed within a year, including the sort of ''soft partition'' of Iraq by religion and ethnicity that Mr. Rumsfeld and Senator Joseph Biden have been discussing, combined with a plan to help people move to where they feel safer within the country. Although it has been said before about previous new years, it seems very likely that 2007 will be make or break time in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Google Steps More Boldly Into PayPal's Territory

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Steven Grossberg, who sells video games online from his home in Wellington, Fla., recently sent an enticing offer to 20,000 customers: $10 off any purchase over $30 using a new payment service, Google Checkout.
 Traffic on his site more than tripled, and best of all, he said, Google picked up the tab for the promotion.
''I think it's fantastic,'' he said. ''I'm selling the product. Google is getting tons of customers to sign up for Checkout. Customers are happy because they are getting a monster deal.'' 
 And Google is not charging merchants any processing fees through the end of 2007. 
 As a result, getting customers to use Checkout will increase profits, Mr. Grossberg said. 
 So starting next year, he plans to take some of the money he spends to list items on eBay and try a new marketing strategy: placing ads alongside Google's search results.
 That is exactly what Google wants to hear. 
 When Google introduced Checkout in June, it was seen as a formidable rival to PayPal, eBay's online payment service. And with Google aggressively promoting Checkout during the holiday season and beyond, its use with some merchants has already surpassed PayPal's. 
 But Google's plan for Checkout has always been about more than online payments. The service is a calculated effort to expand Google's base of advertisers, which provide the bulk of the company's revenues.
 And Google has made a substantial financial commitment to the service's success. Goldman Sachs estimates that Checkout promotions will cost Google about $20 million in the current quarter. 
 The campaign to promote Checkout also says something else about Google: As rivals Yahoo and Microsoft are working on getting the basics right in their search and advertising systems, Google is racing ahead to consolidate its lead. 
 ''I believe that Google's advantage is widening with time and this is one example,'' said Scott Devitt, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Company. ''Checkout could be a game changer, and the competitors are doing nothing of the sort.''
 Unlike PayPal, a full-fledged payment system that can be used to transfer money between individuals and can draw funds directly from bank accounts, Checkout merely offers users an easy way to use their credit cards. Checkout users enter their credit card information, shipping and billing address into Google's system. Then, they can pay with Checkout at participating stores without having to enter their personal information again and again. 
 Google says thousands of merchants are using the service. That is dwarfed by PayPal, which has millions of merchants and 123 million users around the world. In the most recent quarter, PayPal processed $9.1 billion in transactions, up 37 percent from a year earlier. While most of those were payments between eBay buyers and sellers, the number of PayPal transactions outside eBay rose 59 percent, to $3.3 billion.
 Google has not released figures on the number of Checkout users. Still, there are signs that with the heavy promotions, the service is making significant inroads. 
 GSI Commerce, a company that runs about 60 online stores, including toysrus.com, levis.com and timberland.com, said that one in five holiday sales at its partners' stores through the end of November were completed with payment systems other than credit cards, which include PayPal, a service called BillMeLater and Checkout. Of the three, ''Google is the biggest by far,'' said Michael Rubin, chief executive of GSI Commerce.
 At StarbucksStore.com, Checkout transactions topped PayPal transactions by about a third, said Tracy Randall, president of Cooking.com, which operates StarbucksStore.com. 
 Checkout's gains have not necessarily heralded a PayPal decline. A Goldman Sachs report this week said that based on conversations with various merchants, Checkout appeared to be making gains against traditional payment options and that PayPal's share of online transactions was also growing. 
 Regardless, it is clear that the promotions have played an important role in Checkout's quick adoption.
 When Google introduced Checkout in June, it charged merchants 20 cents plus 2 percent of the purchase price for every transaction. (PayPal charges 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent plus 30 cents a transaction, while credit companies typically charge about 1.95 percent and 30 cents for every purchase.) 
 Yet, to lure merchants to its advertising system, Google offered them $10 worth of free transaction processing for every $1 in advertising they spent on Google.
 But Google recently got more aggressive. On Nov. 8, it waived transaction fees for all merchants, regardless of whether or not they were Google advertisers, through the end of the year. Then, on Nov. 27, it began offering Checkout users $10 off $30 purchases at many e-commerce sites and, in some cases, $20 off $50 orders. And on Dec. 5, it announced that transaction processing would remain free to merchants through the end of 2007. 
 In other words, Google plans to lose money on every Checkout transaction for more than a year. Yet the company believes it will be worth it. 
 ''It's a way to incentivize more merchants to join our network,'' said Benjamin Ling, a product manager for Checkout. ''We want everyone who sells online to be a Google advertiser.''
 The incentives offered by Google could benefit merchants and the company in several ways, according to online marketing experts.
 Consider first that the ads of stores who accept Checkout are highlighted with an icon -- a Checkout shopping cart. That increases the likelihood that users will click on those ads, which creates revenue for Google. What's more, once users click on an ad, the availability of Checkout makes it more likely that they'll complete a transaction. 
 In other words, Checkout generates more sales leads for online retailers -- what online advertisers call click-through rates -- and more of those leads turn into actual sales. 
 But the system offers merchants ancillary benefits, said Scot Wingo, the chief executive of ChannelAdvisor.com, an e-commerce services company that helps independent store owners sell on multiple online marketplaces, including eBay, Amazon and their own Web sites. 
 Google ranks ads based on a secret algorithm that combines factors like the price advertisers are willing to pay and the click-through rate of a particular ad. The idea is that ads that are clicked most frequently are those that users find more relevant. 
 So by having a Checkout icon that increases click-through rates, over time advertisers will have to pay less to get the same ranking for their ads. Or, they could pay the same amount for more ads with better placement, Mr. Wingo said. 
 ''When you factor all of these together, it can have a pretty significant impact on your economics as a retailer,'' Mr. Wingo said, adding that many merchants are likely to plow any savings back into Google.
 There are other ways in which Google could benefit from Checkout, according to analysts. Checkout gives Google detailed knowledge of its users' buying habits, which the company could use to customize the delivery of ads or search results to specific users. 
 And the system could make it easier for Google to develop a new advertising model in which advertisers pay only when a user completes a transaction, rather than every time a user clicks on an ad. This model, known as ''pay-per-action,'' could bring additional revenue to Google.
 Mr. Ling said Google had no plans to tie search results to buying habits or to use Checkout to move to a cost-per-action ad model. But he added: ''If there is a service that is of value to consumers, we will consider it.'' 
 Not everything has been smooth sailing for Checkout. In the middle of the holiday shopping season, the electronics merchant J & R suspended the use of Checkout, telling customers that it was experiencing delays in processing orders due to the popularity of the system. And Ms. Randall, of Cooking.com, said there had been some ''operational issues'' with Checkout at StarbucksStore.com, but that Google had worked quickly to resolve them. 
 Google acknowledged the problems. ''We have experienced some growing pains,'' said Douglas Merrill, a vice president of engineering at Google who is responsible for Checkout. ''Whenever we find issues, we drop everything else to fix them.''
 That is in part why laptopsforless.com, a retailer in Anaheim, Calif., chose to expand payment options by implementing PayPal first, said Jeff Gardner, vice president for marketing and e-commerce. ''We feel like we want to wait until the bugs are worked out before jumping into it,'' he said about Checkout. But come next year, he added, ''it is our intent to offer our customers both.''

HEADLINE: Public Universities Vie to Join the Top 10 in Academic Rankings

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: GAINESVILLE, Fla. 

 BODY:
If there is any goal that the University of Florida has pursued as fervently as a national football championship for the Gators, it is a place among the nation's highest-ranked public universities. 
 ''We need a top-10 university, so our kids can get the same education they would get at Harvard or Yale,'' said J. Bernard Machen, the university president.
To upgrade the university, Dr. Machen is seeking a $1,000 tuition surcharge that would be used mostly to hire more professors and lower the student-faculty ratio, not coincidentally one of the factors in the much-watched college rankings published annually by U.S. News & World Report. This year, that list ranked Florida 13th among public universities in the United States. 
 Like Florida, more leading public universities are striving for national status and drawing increasingly impressive and increasingly affluent students, sometimes using financial aid to lure them. In the process, critics say, many are losing force as engines of social mobility, shortchanging low-income and minority students, who are seriously underrepresented on their campuses. 
 ''Public universities were created to make excellence available to all qualified students,'' said Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, an advocacy group, ''but that commitment appears to have diminished over time, as they choose to use their resources to try to push up their rankings. It's all about reputation, selectivity and ranking, instead of about the mission of finding and educating future leaders from their state.''
 While a handful of public universities have long stood among the nation's top institutions -- the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan among them -- many have only recently joined their ranks. 
 At some of the best public universities, selectivity is up: at the University of Florida, the average student high school grade point average now exceeds 4.0, a feat achievable only with high grades in honors or Advanced Placement classes. And student interest in these institutions is soaring. At the University of Vermont, where three-quarters of the freshmen are from other states, applications have more than doubled since 2001. 
 The demands on such universities are growing, too, particularly with many states questioning their spending on higher education. Increasingly, these colleges are expected to bolster their states' economies by attracting research grants and jobs. To do that, they say, they must compete with elite private universities. 
 So the universities face a tough balancing act: should they push for higher status and higher tuition revenue by accepting more top-achieving, out-of-state students, or should they worry about broadening access for low-income, in-state students? Is their primary goal to serve the people of their state or to compete nationally with private research universities? Can they leave the less prestigious state colleges to serve the bulk of in-state students?
 ''It is increasingly challenging to manage all of those inherently conflicting goals,'' said Mark A. Emmert, president of the University of Washington, adding that global competitiveness required world-class scholarship: ''When we think about our peers now, we don't just think about the publics, we throw in Stanford and the Ivies.'' 
 In some ways, the University of Washington outdoes its peers. Dr. Emmert says proudly that his university is second only to Harvard in research financing from the National Institutes of Health. 
 In certain respects, flagship public universities have become more like private institutions. Public universities are still far less expensive, but with their tuition rising rapidly, enrolling low-income students has become as much an issue for them as it is for private universities. 
 From 1995 to 2003, flagship and leading public research universities quadrupled their aid to students from families with incomes over $100,000, while aid to students from the poorest families declined, according to the Education Trust. The best public universities, the group said, have come to resemble ''gated communities of higher education.''
 And their aid policies are paramount, because aid given by the universities dwarfs what students get from the federal government. 
 ''The rise in the quality of public flagships across the country is in principle a good thing,'' said William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University System of Maryland. ''What's begun to cross the line, though, is when in the pursuit of excellence, our financial aid gets distorted in a way that high-achieving, low-income students who are qualified to go to our best public institutions can't.'' 
 In an implicit recognition of this distortion, several public universities have started programs to help low-income students.
 The Carolina Covenant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was the first such program. Started in 2004, it guaranteed low-income students enough aid to graduate debt-free.
 This year, about 8 percent of the freshman class qualified, in the process helping diversify the student body, which for the first time is less than 70 percent white. 
 The University of Virginia followed with a similar program. And this fall, the University of Washington did, as well.
 The University of Florida, as much as any, is grappling with these issues. 
 ''Florida wants a top-10 university because it's clear that our economic development is increasingly tied to research,'' Dr. Machen, the president, said. ''The state's fired up to invest in this university when it sees our projects with the Burnham Institute for Medical Research and Scripps Research Institute.''
 The university's financial situation is unique. It has the lowest tuition of the flagships, $3,206 a year. In addition, the state pays 75 percent to 100 percent of tuition and fees for students with high grades and test scores, including more than 90 percent of freshmen.
 Still, the students at the sprawling Gainesville campus, with its historic buildings, lawns and lush vegetation, are so affluent that those who must work to help support themselves are sometimes put off by the fancy cars, the stylish clothes and what they see as a sense of entitlement around them. 
 ''The way they dress, what they talk about, the 'I drive this, I drive that,' it gets annoying,'' said Angela Momprevil, a sophomore whose parents, Haitian immigrant business owners, did not attend college. 
 Dr. Machen said that when he became president of the university in 2004, he was troubled to learn that the average student's family income was $100,000. 
 ''That bothered me, because public education is supposed to be a ladder to success,'' Dr. Machen said. ''We don't want to be an elitist institution. We want to be a mirror of society.'' 
 Ever since, he said, he has struggled to balance the quest for higher rankings with the push to serve minority and low-income students. Two of the university's efforts, the tuition surcharge and a new program for low-income students, could almost stand as the yin and yang of his agenda. 
 Dr. Machen said the university needed the surcharge to supplement its inexpensive tuition and bring in 200 new faculty members. 
 ''How can I tell parents that the education their children can get here is on a par with Michigan or North Carolina,'' he said, ''when my student-teacher ratio is 21 or 22 to 1, and Michigan's is 15 to 1, Chapel Hill's 14 to 1?'' 
 The surcharge proposal, for next year's new students, has caused little upset on campus and was endorsed by the Student Senate. But some students had concerns. 
 ''I worry that there will be highly qualified students who won't be able to pay an extra $1,000,'' said Sal Picataggio, a junior. ''It's a fine line. I want it to be prestigious, to be top 10, but I also want it to be more accessible.'' 
 Even as the cost of education at the University of Florida goes up, Dr. Machen is working to bring in more low-income students. 
 ''We found a significant number of accepted students, from the families of the working poor, who didn't come because they didn't have the money to pay the costs,'' he said. ''Loans weren't attractive to them, and we wanted them here.'' 
 So this fall, the university started a program covering the full cost of college, living expenses included, for students from families with incomes under $40,000, if neither parent went to college. The program also attracted more minority students, helping to raise the proportion of blacks among this year's freshmen to more than 13 percent, from about 10 percent in the two previous years. 
 ''It turns out that using 'first generation in the family to go to college' is a pretty good surrogate for diversity,'' Dr. Machen said. 
 The university is also cutting back merit aid. For years, Gainesville paid dearly to attract National Merit scholars, the students who scored highest on the Preliminary SATs. Scholars from out of state pay no tuition at the University of Florida and receive an additional $38,000 over four years. 
 As a result, the university has drawn hundreds of merit scholars, sometimes nearly as many as Harvard. But next fall, the amount of those awards will be cut to $17,000 for out-of-staters. 
 ''It gave us a kind of bragging rights,'' Dr. Machen said, ''but it didn't help in the world of our peers, because they knew we were buying them.'' 
 This is higher-education code: peer ratings are the largest component of the U.S. News & World Report rankings, so anything that does not impress other educators is not likely to help the rankings. 
 Manny A. Fernandez, chairman of the board at the University of Florida, talks as frankly as Dr. Machen about rankings. 
 ''I want to be on the cocktail-party list of schools that people talk about, because that influences the decisions of great students and great faculty,'' Mr. Fernandez said. ''I don't apologize for trying to get the rankings up, because rankings are a catalyst for changes that improve the school.''

HEADLINE: Report on China Is Notably Softer on Currency Valuation 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, softening its tone of criticism toward China, reported to Congress on Tuesday that the Chinese had made strides in revaluing their currency, but that the progress was ''considerably less than is needed.''
 The muted tone, in contrast with a finding more than six months ago, came in a report that is required twice a year. It was issued four days after a trip to China by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and six other Cabinet-level officials. And it appeared to reflect Mr. Paulson's preference for quiet persuasion over confrontation.
 The administration has called on China to open its economy further, crack down on product piracy and let the value of its currency, the yuan, rise. Many economists contend that the Chinese have deliberately undervalued the yuan to promote exports. A low value for China's currency makes its exports relatively cheap in the West and its imports more expensive. 
 The administration's report used mild language in calling on China to change its ways.
 ''China's cautious approach to exchange rate reform continues to exacerbate distortions in the domestic economy and impede adjustment of international imbalances,'' it said, referring to the ''imbalances'' of the $200 billion trade deficit with China and China's possession of $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.
 If the criticism of the Beijing policies was muted, so was some of the reaction among business groups and, to a degree, among China critics in Congress. 
 ''There's no way Paulson would take half the cabinet to Beijing, come back and take a baseball bat and whack the Chinese on the side of the head,'' said Franklin J. Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.
 Mr. Vargo said the manufacturers and other business groups that favored a higher exchange rate for the Chinese currency would probably wait and see before pressing Congress to punish China.
 ''We'll see if this works,'' he said. ''But if things don't move faster in the next six months, that will be a trigger for Congress to act.''
 Still, some critics said the administration should have been more forceful by formally calling China a manipulator of the value of its currency, which could have initiated retaliatory measures in Congress.
 ''After five years of work on this issue, we are not satisfied,'' Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement. ''If the administration still won't call China a manipulator, how can we ever expect them to get China to play fair?'' 
 In May, the Treasury's report on China said the administration was ''extremely dissatisfied'' with China's progress on the currency issue. 
 The Treasury secretary at the time, John W. Snow, criticized China at a news conference even while declining to label it a currency manipulator, because such a ruling would have required a finding of intent on the part of the Chinese.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Paulson made no public appearance or comments in connection with the report. A Treasury official, briefing reporters on the condition that he not be identified, said it continued to be ''difficult, if not impossible'' to discern intent. 
 Another factor in the toned-down report was that, as of last Thursday, China had allowed the value of the yuan to rise by 5.88 percent since July 2005, as the report noted.
 In the view of the administration, China is engaged in an internal debate -- with currency reformers saying that the yuan's value should be allowed to rise and officials associated with the export industries, a major part of national economic output, opposed to such a step.
 The Bush administration sees China as trying a step-by-step approach toward its currency, hoping that a gradual revaluation over a long period will give manufacturers time to adjust and the broad economy time to transform itself into one powered more by domestic consumption than by exports.

Trade Terms Reached With Panama
By Bloomberg News
 Panama and the United States agreed to terms of a free trade agreement yesterday that would end tariffs and determine rules for investment, setting up a potential trade fight in Congress next year.
 The accord follows by two months voter approval in Panama of a plan to invest $5.3 billion to expand the Panama Canal. If approved, the agreement would guarantee that United States companies have an opportunity to help build the canal project, according to the United States trade representative's office.

HEADLINE: London Exchange Scorns Nasdaq Offer Even as Euronext Stockholders Back NYSE Deal

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The London Stock Exchange dug in its heels on Tuesday, hoping to foil Nasdaq's takeover attempts, even as Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange moved closer to the first trans-Atlantic exchange deal. 
 The London market said it would have a larger-than-expected increase in 2006 earnings, and a higher dividend next year, as it urged shareholders to reject Nasdaq's ''wholly inadequate'' $5.3 billion hostile takeover offer.
The Nasdaq Stock Market has been pursuing the London exchange since March, but has been unable to persuade London executives even to meet to discuss a deal. It formally made its unsolicited offer on Dec. 12. 
 The London exchange's chief executive, Clara Furse, who has brushed off takeover attempts in recent years, was unapologetic about refusing to enter into talks. Nasdaq's offer of $:12.43 a share, she said in a telephone interview, was so far from her company's real value that there was no reason to meet the New York bidders. ''They're either close on price or they're not -- and they're not,'' Ms. Furse said. Consequently, it is ''not in our shareholders' interests to validate Nasdaq's efforts or tactics'' by agreeing to meet with them, she said. The London exchange would not elaborate as to how far Nasdaq's offer might be from what Ms. Furse thought her company was worth. 
 London said its earnings for 2006 would be at least 50.4 pence a share (currently 99 cents), an increase of 58 percent from last year, and higher than most analysts' expectations. The exchange also said it would increase its 2007 dividend by 50 percent, to 18 pence a share. 
 Based on the earnings revisions, Nasdaq's offer represents 24.7 times 2006 earnings a share, below the trading multiples of most other major exchanges, the London market said in a report urging shareholders not to sell their shares to Nasdaq. 
 In New York on Tuesday, Nasdaq stock fell $1.94, to close at $34.05. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 7 pence here, to $:13.10. Short-term investors, including hedge funds, have bought 30 to 40 percent of the London market's shares, and are betting that Nasdaq will improve its offer. 
 Nasdaq, which bought 28.75 percent of the London exchange on the open market, said last month that the $:12.43 bid was its final offer unless another bidder stepped in, or its bid won the approval of London's board. Neither seems likely. 
 Nasdaq will have to walk away from the bid for a year if it cannot get just over 50 percent of the London exchange's shares by a February deadline. 
 Not surprisingly, London market executives' comments had an unyielding quality. ''Their constraints are self-imposed,'' Ms. Furse said, referring to Nasdaq's calling its bid a ''final offer.'' That was a ''tactic intended to get our share price down.'' 
 The president of Nasdaq, Robert Greifeld, said the London exchange was ''ignoring the elephant in the room at its peril.'' London, he said, was not considering the future effects of increased competition, adding that the exchange's current share price was sustainable only because of Nasdaq's offer. 
 While Nasdaq and the London market bickered, trans-Atlantic cooperation flowered in other parts of Europe. Euronext shareholders voted overwhelmingly Tuesday in favor of a $14 billion deal with the NYSE Group, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, which is expected to create a trans-Atlantic market with $100 billion in daily trading volume and bolster the Big Board's international expansion plans. 
 The vote was the culmination of seven months of discussions between those exchanges, numerous appeals to their shareholders and regulators, several rounds of negotiation and renegotiation of deal terms, and long sessions quieting the concerns of European politicians. Creation of the trans-Atlantic exchange still faces some hurdles, but analysts and investors in both regions said Tuesday that they were confident it would go through. 
 The deal would allow the huge pools of investor capital in the United States to flow into stocks in France, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as Euronext's derivatives-trading platform. European investors will get easier access to American capital markets and to the huge scale of the New York Stock Exchange, which is planning to expand in Asia as well. Just over 92 percent of the shareholders represented at Euronext's special meeting in Amsterdam voted for the deal, more than expected. 
 The future of stock markets may be global, but analysts said that trans-Atlantic deal making was going smoothly for one New York exchange and not for the other because of specific local details. 
 London exchange management has never been interested in the idea of a merger with Nasdaq because it needs derivatives trading, but not new technology. ''Nasdaq doesn't bring them that much,'' said Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. But Euronext, which was eager to avoid a deal with the Frankfurt market, saw the NYSE Group as a white knight, he added. 
 Some predict that London may be in for tough months ahead. ''There is no doubt,'' Mr. Steil said, ''the L.S.E. management is under significant pressure to find someone to do a deal with or maintain exceptional growth.''

HEADLINE: New Iraq Strategy Emerges: First Security, Then Politics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The debate over whether to increase the American military presence in Baghdad is much more than a dispute over troop levels. It reflects a more fundamental dispute over the American mission.
 In proposing to send tens of thousands of additional troops, proponents of reinforcing the American military effort argue that the violence in Iraq is increasing at such an alarming rate that Washington can no longer wait for the newly minted Iraqi security forces to take on the main burden of securing the Iraqi capital.
The United States, they assert, needs to expand its mission by making the protection of the Iraqi population its primary objective. 
 The calculation is that by sending additional troops and taking up positions in mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods, the American military can finally break the escalating cycle of sectarian killings. Only after restoring some semblance of security, the proponents of a troop increase maintain, can the Bush administration reasonably expect Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to rein in the Shiite militias. 
 As President Bush mulls his Iraq strategy, the idea of deploying 20,000 additional American troops or more, at least temporarily, has emerged as a leading option. Mr. Bush intends to unveil his plan in early January, and the realization that the White House is approaching a fateful decision on the level of American involvement in Iraq has set off a spirited debate among retired officers, lawmakers and policy experts.
 By most accounts, a decision to substantially increase the American military presence in Baghdad would signal an important strategic shift. For years, the generals have argued that their military strategy could not work unless the Iraqis simultaneously made progress toward political reconciliation, a development that American commanders calculated would reduce the support among Sunnis for the insurgency and ease sectarian tensions.
 In effect, the advocates of sending more troops have turned that logic on its head by arguing that the Iraqis cannot make political headway toward overcoming their sectarian differences until military action is taken to blunt the Sunni-led insurgency, and security is improved. That could lessen the increasing dependence on militias by Iraqis who feel the need for protection against sectarian violence. 
 The idea of sending reinforcements to Baghdad is not a new one. The United States dispatched a Stryker brigade and several Army battalions to the capital in August as part of a joint American and Iraqi operation to improve security there. Those additions brought the number of American troops involved in the Baghdad operation to 15,000.
 Sectarian killings initially declined, only to soar after death squads adapted to American tactics. 
 Some critics of the Bush administration's approach in Iraq have argued that the effort begun in August shows that more American troops are not the answer. Expanding the American military presence in Baghdad, they say, will only increase American casualties, add to the strain on an overburdened military and put off the day when the Iraqis begin to take over their own security.
 ''The Iraqis need to understand that the responsibility for their future is theirs,'' said Ike Skelton, a Missouri Democrat and the incoming chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ''We should at least begin to do some redeployment right away to show the American people that we are not there to stay forever.''
 Advocates of sending additional forces acknowledge that troops can be only part of the answer. To be effective, the strategy must include efforts to train the Iraqi Army and deal with political and economic issues. But they also say that too few reinforcements were sent this summer to decisively improve security. 
 ''It was not done to the necessary scale and not to the point where the people felt they were secure and protected,'' said Daniel Dwyer, a retired major who served with the Army's Third Armored Cavalry Regiment in Baghdad and Tal Afar. ''The people right now feel that there is no tactical design toward securing them, that we come in and conduct operations that are short-lived and leave, and their problems don't go away.''
 Another problem with the Baghdad security operation, critics say, is that it depended on Iraqi policies that were never adequately carried out. The Iraqi Army supplied only two of the six battalions that American commanders requested. Iraqi-funded reconstruction projects to generate jobs and win popular support have been too few or too late.
 To address these shortfalls, some advocates of sending reinforcements have proposed that the United States substantially expand its military mission. There are a variety of possible options for adding troops.
 Gen. Jack Keane, a former Army vice chief of staff, has argued for sending four or five additional brigades to Baghdad, effectively doubling the American military presence there. The United States would also change its concept of operations in Baghdad.
 Instead of limiting themselves to conducting patrols from bases in the capital, American troops would take up new positions in 23 mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods to better protect the population. Millions of dollars in new American reconstruction assistance would be provided. Iraqi forces would also be involved in the operation.
 American forces would not initially confront the Mahdi Army, which is controlled by Moktada al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric. Once security was improved, Prime Minister Maliki would be encouraged to negotiate with the Shiite militias to stop attacks against Sunnis. 
 There is a risk that an adversary could wait out the American forces, evading major combat until American troops levels began to subside. For that reason, General Keane has argued that the United States should be prepared to carry out the expanded mission for 18 months, or perhaps longer, a far cry from the increase of several months that some Democratic lawmakers support. 
 Whether the Bush administration will opt for such a demanding strategy is far from clear. It would be an approach with huge political risks and one that would dramatically escalate American involvement in Iraq. President Bush has, however, taken one step that is a prerequisite for any effort to sustain expanded military operations in Iraq: he has signaled his intention to increase the size of the American armed forces.

HEADLINE: Advo and Valassis to Merge After All 

BYLINE: By RITA K. FARRELL

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Dec 19 

 BODY:
Valassis Communications, the largest provider of newspaper inserts, and Advo, the direct-mail marketer, settled their differences Tuesday and agreed to compete a merger first announced in July.
 The two companies came to terms after the board of Advo agreed late Monday to drop its asking price to $33 a share from $37, and Valassis acknowledged that it had found no evidence to support its claim of having been defrauded by Advo.
 In September, Valassis, based in Livonia, Mich., filed suit in the Delaware Chancery Court, seeking to back out of its agreement to buy Advo for $1.3 billion and claiming the company had misrepresented its financial results in the second quarter. 
 Advo of Windsor, Conn., known for its ''Have You Seen Me?'' postcard campaign to locate missing children, countersued, asking the court to enforce the merger.
 The trial, which began last week, had been closely watched by arbitragers who packed the courtroom of Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. last week. 
 An analyst at Lehman Brothers, Evren Ergin, said in October that Valassis faced an uphill battle in trying to get out of the merger with a claim that it had relied on Advo's misrepresentations of its finances. 
 A lawyer who monitored the trial, Andrew H. Lippstone, of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, recalled that in 2001, Judge Strine rejected a similar claim by the meat processor Tyson Foods when it tried to get out of a merger with Iowa Beef Processors.
 Mr. Lippstone said many of the arbitragers attending the trial appeared to represent funds hoping to take a ''significant short-term position to capitalize on the expected fluctuations caused by the litigation.''
 A professor at Widener University Law School, Lawrence A. Hamermesh, a former corporate litigator, said, ''I've always thought that cases like this settle for good practical reasons.''
 If the buyer can achieve any price break by doing a settlement ''especially if it addresses their economic concerns about the seller, then they are just that much better off,'' Professor Hamermesh said.
 ''From the seller's side, a settlement enables them to keep a bird in the hand,'' he said, ''and salvage some deal rather than run the risk of losing the case and being damaged goods that nobody wants anymore.''
 The lawyer for Advo, Eric M. Roth, of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, said there had been settlement discussions before the trial began but the ''momentum picked up over the weekend.'' 
 The trial was recessed Monday to allow the talks to continue.
 Mr. Roth said Advo was drafting a proxy seeking shareholder approval of the amended merger, now valued at $1.2 billion, which includes Advo's $125 million in long-term debt. 
 The companies said the merger was expected to close in the first quarter.
 A person familiar with the transaction said that Valassis had until Feb. 28 to close the deal or two business days after Advo shareholders approve it, whichever comes later. 
 The chairman of Valassis, Alan F. Schultz, said in a joint statement with Advo, ''We are pleased to have reached this amended agreement with Advo and put the litigation behind us.'' 
 The chief executive of Advo, S. Scott Harding, said, ''We look forward to focusing our energy on creating value through combining and growing our businesses.''
 The combined company will create the largest media services provider in the United States, serving 20,000 advertisers worldwide, including 94 of the top 100, the companies said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Appoints Four Staff Members to Attorney General's Office

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Attorney General-elect Andrew M. Cuomo yesterday announced four senior appointments to oversee operations when he replaces Eliot Spitzer next month, drawing top officials from the offices of the United States attorneys in Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
 Mr. Cuomo said that the newly named officials were people with whom he had had little or no relationship before their selection by his transition committee. He also said he was seeking to fulfill a campaign pledge to make appointments that reflected the diversity of the state. The first four senior appointments include three women, one of whom is black and another Hispanic.
Mr. Cuomo appointed Robin L. Baker, who is the deputy chief of appeals for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, as his executive attorney general for criminal justice. Ms. Baker has worked in the office of the United States attorney for 10 years, mainly prosecuting cases of gang activity, terrorism, organized crime and narcotics.
 Mr. Cuomo named Eric O. Corngold as his executive deputy attorney general for economic justice. Mr. Corngold is chief assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where he has worked since 1990. For six years, he headed the office's business and securities fraud unit and prosecuted white-collar crimes.
 Mr. Cuomo named an official in the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mylan L. Denerstein, as the executive deputy attorney general for social justice. Ms. Denerstein is the deputy commissioner for legal affairs for the New York City Fire Department. She is also the highest-ranking black woman in the department.
 Before going to the Fire Department, Ms. Denerstein worked in the United States attorney's office, Southern District, from 1996 to 2003, serving as deputy chief of the criminal division.
 Mr. Cuomo announced the appointment of Jenny Rivera as the special deputy attorney general for civil rights. Ms. Rivera is a professor at the City University of New York law school. She is also a member of the New York City Commission on Human Rights and a former associate counsel for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund.
 The selections brought praise from some independent legal experts yesterday, assuaging concerns that Mr. Cuomo might not follow the lead of his predecessor, Mr. Spitzer.
 ''They all seem to be extraordinarily well qualified, diverse and people with a broad range of experience,'' said Nils Olsen, the dean of the law school at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
 ''These sound like excellent appointments that have significant experience in the highest level of public law. It sounds like a good start. I think we can look forward to continued excellence that the attorney general's office displayed under Mr. Cuomo's predecessor.''

HEADLINE: General Opposes Adding to U.S. Forces in Iraq, Emphasizing International Solutions for Region

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
As the new secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, takes stock of the war in Iraq this week, he will find Gen. John P. Abizaid, the senior commander in the Middle East, resistant to increasing the American fighting force there.
 General Abizaid, who is completing the final months of a highly decorated military career, acknowledges that additional American forces, favored by some of President Bush's top advisers, might provide a short-term boost in security. But he argues that foreign troops are a toxin bound to be rejected by Iraqis, and that expanding the number of American troops merely puts off the day when Iraqis are forced to take responsibility for their own security. 
While American forces may be repositioned within Iraq to meet growing security challenges, especially in Baghdad, the answer is not solely military, and even the leading role in combat cannot long rest on American forces, General Abizaid says. 
 ''The Baghdad security situation requires more Iraqi troops,'' he said in a recent interview as he traveled around Iraq, meeting with American commanders.
 His assessment, which includes plans to increase the number of American trainers embedded with Iraqi units, is supported by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the senior American commander in Iraq, as well as by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who must provide the forces and have resisted an increase without first clearly defining the goals it would try to achieve on the ground.
 But the generals are facing a different assessment from a growing number of civilian officials in the Bush administration, who see a sharp increase in troop strength as an effective means to stabilize Baghdad and as a dramatic initiative for the president to announce in January.
 General Abizaid argues for a broader approach to Iraq than that of looking solely to putting out the fires in Baghdad.
 ''You have to internationalize the problem,'' General Abizaid said. ''You have to attack it diplomatically, geo-strategically. You just can't apply a microscope on a particular problem in downtown Baghdad and a particular problem in downtown Kabul and say that somehow or another, if you throw enough military forces at it, that you are going to solve the broader issues in the region of extremism.'' 
 His views are out of sync with those of some officials in Washington. 
 General Abizaid has been pounded by senators of both parties for what they said was status quo advice on force levels in Iraq, and for sharing responsibility over a strategy that the Iraq Study Group said was failing. At the same time, he rankled many of his civilian bosses by not sticking to administration talking points for the war, offering accurate, if blunt, public assessments of the Iraq mission since taking charge of Central Command in July 2003.
 General Abizaid was the first to label Iraq a guerrilla war, even when the White House and Pentagon dismissed the description. And he was the first four-star general to warn that the rise of sectarian violence in Iraq, after the mosque bombing in Samarra in February, had replaced terrorism and Sunni insurgents as the greatest security challenges there, telling Congress that Iraq risked sliding toward civil war.
 But in a bitter exchange last month during testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told the general, ''I'm of course disappointed that basically you're advocating the status quo here today, which I think the American people in the last election said is not an acceptable condition.'' 
 General Abizaid's reluctance to endorse a spike in American forces is not born of philosophical differences over questions like whether the United States can rely on fewer troops in combat zones abroad because of advanced technology. General Abizaid, who is of Lebanese descent, served a tour with United Nations forces in Lebanon, attended the University of Jordan and earned a master's degree in Middle Eastern studies from Harvard. 
 He emphasizes that the threat to American national security interests ranges far beyond any one country in his area of responsibility.
 ''When you take a look at the reach of the extremism as exemplified by Al Qaeda, it's not just in Afghanistan, it's not just in Iraq -- it's in Pakistan, it's in Saudi Arabia, it's in Great Britain, it's in Spain,'' he said. ''It attacked the United States. It is organized in the virtual world in a way that is very unique, very modern, very dangerous.''
 Ask for a solution to Sunni insurgents in Anbar Province, and he talks about their supporters in Syria and implications should Saudi Arabia overtly take sides against the Shiites of Iraq. 
 On the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan, General Abizaid says the only course includes understanding tribal loyalties in Pakistan. Turn the conversation to Middle Eastern terrorists, and he describes the military's efforts to preclude their establishing havens in ungoverned corners of Africa.
 General Abizaid is credited with coining the phrase, ''the long war,'' to describe the challenge of combating terrorism, especially radical Islamic terrorism. He still uses, but no longer favors, the label, according to his aides, because too many people focused only on ''war'' and a military solution.
 He says the United States government is inadequately organized for the new type of threat, and that success in the counterterrorism mission, in Afghanistan, Iraq and beyond, requires all of the government to go to war, and not just the military.
 ''I think our structures for 21st-century security challenges need to adapt to this type of an enemy,'' he said. ''The 21st century really requires that we figure out how to get economic, diplomatic, political and military elements of power synchronized and coordinated against specific problems wherever they exist.''
 Long before the Iraqi Study Group advocated a solution for Iraq that included negotiations with Iran and Syria, General Abizaid argued that combating Islamic extremism required a regional approach. The general declined to disclose his private advice to the White House, Pentagon and State Department on direct negotiations with Iran and Syria, or on future force levels for Iraq.

HEADLINE: Talking at the Chinese

 BODY:
One upshot of last week's all-talk, no-action economic meetings in Beijing is that it will be harder for the Bush administration to fend off knee-jerk protectionism from Congress. Another, we fear, is that the administration will twist its lack of progress into yet another excuse to continue its misguided economic policies at home. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and his power delegation -- including a third of President Bush's cabinet and the chairman of the Federal Reserve -- spent two days lecturing the Chinese about what they should be doing to improve the global economy. The flaw is that both countries are responsible for the serious imbalances in trade and finance. The administration would have a far better chance of persuading Beijing to shift policies if it made clear what it was prepared to do differently.
There is no question that China's currency, the yuan, is undervalued, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage and deepening the United States' trade deficit. But the yuan is not the main culprit behind America's indebtedness or competitive difficulties. Nor can it explain subpar job growth, weak wage gains and growing inequality of income. Those problems are mostly homegrown, with roots in bad domestic policies, including enormous deficit-financed tax cuts and a corresponding dearth of public investment and private savings. 
 To ensure America's security and competitiveness -- and to take the lead in correcting global imbalances -- Washington has to start on a harder and higher road: saving more, borrowing less, investing in infrastructure and education, and building a safety net for workers displaced by a global economy. 
 Mr. Paulson tucked a pledge to improve America's savings rate into his closing remarks at the Beijing meeting. But so far, his main idea for saving federal dollars is cutting Social Security spending, essentially repackaging Mr. Bush's failed attempt to ''reform'' the program in 2005. 
 The United States is right to be tough with China in trade talks. Beijing must take greater responsibility for its side in trade disputes, especially those involving intellectual property. It also needs to start weaning itself from export-driven growth in favor of greater domestic demand, including adopting a more flexible yuan. Whatever China does or does not do, the United States has to cure its own ills. It should start by admitting that most of its problems are of its own making.

HEADLINE: Delta Rejects Rival's Bid as It Files Plan to Exit Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
In a plan to exit bankruptcy, managers at Delta Air Lines valued the carrier at $9.4 billion to $12 billion and said its board had rejected US Airways' $8.5 billion bid.
 The announcement begins the second phase of what could be a drawn-out battle for control of the country's third-largest airline.
Delta also projected strong and uninterrupted growth in revenue and profits through 2010, despite the airline industry's history of regular and sharp downturns. The plan relies on a continuing shift of planes from domestic service to international routes, where there is less low-cost competition. 
 Gerald Grinstein, the chairman and chief executive of Delta, who has said little publicly since US Airways' hostile bid on Nov. 15, disparaged the offer, a sign that the battle could turn nastier.
 Noting that US Airways has not yet fully integrated America West Airlines after their merger a year ago, Mr. Grinstein said in an interview, ''They basically have an undigested meal and they're trying to eat another one.''
 He said US Airways had scored lower than Delta on customer satisfaction surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, a consumer research firm. ''From a passenger point of view, it's a nightmare,'' he said. Delta also repeated assertions that the US Airways proposal could not win antitrust approval and would so upset workers that service would suffer.
 US Airways, in a statement after the filing of the Delta bankruptcy plan, said, ''We remain a disciplined and determined bidder.'' W. Douglas Parker, chief executive of US Airways, has said that the proposed merger would result in $1.65 billion of annual savings, on top of whatever results that Delta projects.
 No announcement was made by the official committee of Delta creditors, whose claims in the bankruptcy will convert into new Delta common shares, giving them control over the carrier's future. Daniel H. Golden, a lawyer for the committee at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, did not return a call seeking comment.
 The committee could endorse the Delta plan, effectively ending US Airways' bid. It could order Delta to allow US Airways to conduct due diligence on Delta, which would also signal to other airlines that competing bids might be welcome. Or it could try to extract improved terms from US Airways or even a different exit plan from Delta, perhaps one that paid out a combination of cash and stock to creditors.
 An adviser to US Airways, who spoke on the condition of not being named because of a continuing role in the negotiations, said the creditors might not signal their intentions until after the first of the year. It also may take US Airways that long to analyze Delta's disclosures about its financial prospects and decide if it wants to raise its bid.
 With Delta not planning an exit from bankruptcy until next spring, ''there's not a big hurry here,'' the adviser said.
 At an estimated $9.4 billion to $12 billion, the value would pay unsecured creditors 63 percent to 80 percent of their claims against Delta. Existing shareholders would receive nothing.
 In its forecast, Delta said it expected to report net income of about $1 billion a year by 2008. Revenue from passengers is forecast to rise an average of 6 percent a year from 2007 to 2010 as Delta's fleet expands, its planes fly fuller and fares rise.
 The projections assume an increase in fuel costs of just 5 percent a year from 2008 to 2010.
 In other words, just about everything is expected to go Delta's way, in an industry that rarely enjoys such good fortune. Edward H. Bastian, the chief financial officer, said the carrier's relatively low costs, low debt loads and ability to shed assets through renegotiated leases would make it less vulnerable in a downturn.
 ''Projections are made to be broken and they're usually broken on the downside,'' said Roger King, an airline analyst at CreditSights, ''because only optimists pay for them.''

HEADLINE: The Low Life And High Life, Hand in Hand

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
WHERE are the harlots of yesteryear? Where are the creatures of glorious plumage that for so long inhabited a fixed place in urban consciousness -- and also a lot of real estate in the landscape of New York music, fashion, literature and art? Who now remembers the soiled doves of the Five Points, besides historians of story or song? 
 For that matter, what ever became of the male hustlers plying their trade in tight Levis at the corner of 53rd Street and Third Avenue, the guys about whom Dee Dee Ramone once composed a famous, and possibly even autobiographical, tune and whom Andy Warhol lured to the Factory to transform into incandescent although disposable underground stars.
The trigger for this onrush of association is a show, ''Gangs of Kabukicho,'' at the Andrew Roth gallery in Manhattan through tomorrow of works by Watanabe Katsumi, a semi-obscure itinerant street photographer who took pictures of Tokyo's prostitutes and drag queens and rockabilly types and supertanned ganguro girls and tough-guy yakuza in the 1960's and 70's. 
 As unexpected as Mr. Watanabe's photographs are, their more urgent appeal is as social documents laden with information about style and sex roles, and the mutating masks of identity in postwar Japan. They also have a lot to say, by implication, about what happens when the loamy subsoil of low life is paved over by luxury housing and the grittier dimensions of cities are sanitized. 
 The function street life plays in pop culture is old news at this stage in history; it was probably old news at the court of Louis XVI. Cultural mandarins have siphoned information and inspiration from the streets for a long time. Fashion, in particular, has reaped the benefits. This was true in the days of Marie Antoinette and true again in the 1980's, when Karl Lagerfeld slummed in the East Village and used what he found to enliven that most fusty of costumes, the Chanel suit, with his version of the cartwheel earrings favored by hip-hop girls and the piled-on chains that, in those days, provided a clanking soundtrack to any walk across St. Mark's Place. 
 There are plenty who maintain that the streets of New York continue to serve as a rich source of design inspiration. ''Every designer of the entire world comes to New York to get inspired,'' Diane Von Furstenberg, the designer and new president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America said last week. ''What is inspiring is the streets, the kids and how they put themselves together,'' she added. ''New York is quite vibrant right now.''
 Perhaps that is so. Yet a person could be forgiven for questioning whether Lou Reed would be moved to write ''Walk on the Wild Side'' by the Bugaboo platoons massed in Washington Square or whether the designer Stephen Sprouse's fabled graffiti collection would ever have happened had Dondi and his fellow Wild Style writers not gotten there first. ''The economy has changed, and the downtown values, with rent control and cheaper housing, gone,'' Deborah Harry, the lead singer of Blondie, lamented not long ago. ''What's happened with the growth of N.Y.U. into the East Village is the whole student look has taken over,'' added the singer, whose disheveled punk Marilyn look evolved from a yeasty downtown scene where Dumpster and thrift shop pickings were still rich, and where old clothes had not yet been rebranded as vintage and sold at Bloomingdale's. ''Downtown is starting to look bland, like a penal colony,'' Ms. Harry said. ''To me that's one of the worst things that have happened in New York.''
 Is it willful to lament the loss of the style that drag queens, hookers, hustlers and pimps once brought to big cities? It probably is. Yet, as the long-delayed ''Factory Girl'' finally makes it to select theaters late this year, it seems reasonable to point out that the look of both the real (biologically speaking) and pretend girls at Andy Warhol's Factory was largely the invention of speed-addled transvestites with ash-blond dye jobs and 25-cent lipstick from subway vending machines.
 And the gaudy 1980's styles now undergoing a loving revival among fashion types in London and Paris owe a substantial debt to the hookers who once worked a stretch of Eighth Avenue known as the Minnesota Strip. 
 As little survives of that place and time as of Kabukicho, the district in Tokyo that Mr. Watanabe recorded just before its love hotels and hostess bars were plowed under to make way for high-end real estate. The drag queen geishas, the rockabilly rent boys are gone from Kabukicho. So, too, are the Times Square sex workers whose damaged poignancy was preserved by the photographer Joyce Baronio in her classic book ''42nd Street Studio.'' The notorious gay theaters are gone. The hustlers and prostitutes rarely bother with the streets. Why should they? In an age of online hookups, who needs to merchandise the goods with curb appeal? 
 And as perverse as it may seem to remark of the men and women (and men dressed as women) who once inhabited Times Square that they were creatures of extravagant style and presentation, there is proof to be found in work produced by the many artists who tracked their inspiration to its source. Look no further than Larry Clark or Jane Dickson or John Ahearn or the various other artists -- some now museum darlings like Kiki Smith and Nan Goldin -- who made an early splash at the celebrated Times Square Show in 1980. 
 That the people from the time and the place that Mr. Watanabe depicted in Tokyo bear a superficial resemblance to their counterparts in lowlife neighborhoods across the world may be coincidence. Yet the likeness is striking and, in its own way, radiates emotional urgency: Mr. Watanabe's people don't merely embrace their outsider status. They make it clear that, in Kabukicho at least, it was the so-called normal people who stood out. 
 Born in the Japanese boondocks, Mr. Watanabe moved to Tokyo in 1962 and soon found his metier in the city's blue-light district, called that to distinguish it from the capital's red-light district, where prostitution was legal and controlled. 
 His gift was for capturing his subjects' unbridled pretension, their love of striking effects and the way they got themselves up for the evening (it was always evening) in bleached hairdos, cowboy clothes, rumpled baby-doll dresses, cheap platform shoes, geisha wigs and the thick rows of eyelashes that lent them the air of small nocturnal predators. 
 That they aped Western style and also seemed to parody it anticipated by decades the antics of the now notorious street poseurs known as Harajuku girls. To the conventions of ordinary dressing, Mr. Watanabe's subjects added their own eccentric styling (mesh slippers with suits) and sexual bravura that was always outsize. They battled for a living on the fringes of what the critic Iizawa Kotaro called ''violence and Eros,'' with the aid of some highly specialized armor. 
 Ludicrous they may seem at times, and also jaunty and improvisatory and even elegant. Yet their most moving dimension, which shines through Mr. Watanabe's photographs, was their determination to abide by street law and never to come off as soft.

HEADLINE: Land Deal to Push Pataki Over the Million-Acre Mark in Preservation of Open Space

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: PUTNAM VALLEY, N.Y., Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Speaking softly and carrying a big hiking stick, Gov. George E. Pataki turned from the wooded trail here to the environmentalists who had gathered for a valedictory hike through woodland they had all helped protect.
 ''Everyone ready?'' the governor asked, planting his hiking stick in the ground.
''Yes,'' answered Rose Harvey, the mid-Atlantic regional director for the Trust for Public Land, a conservation group. ''But why are we hiking past land you've already protected? We should be going past land in danger of being developed, so you'll buy it.'' 
 Governor Pataki has bought a lot of land that way, to protect parks from the encroaching McMansions or to link trails or to keep forests from becoming subdivisions. Quite a lot of land. 
 This week, in his second to last one as governor, Mr. Pataki reached a milestone: he secured a deal to increase the amount of land that he has preserved to more than one million acres, more land than exists in the entire state of Rhode Island.
 Those land deals give Mr. Pataki a record on land preservation unmatched by any New York governor since Theodore Roosevelt, that other outdoorsy governor with a big stick.
 The final piece of the puzzle, which the governor plans to announce on Thursday, is the acquisition of a conservation easement on 51,000 acres upstate in St. Lawrence County from Rayonier, a forestry company.
 The state will pay $6.5 million for the easement, which will expand hiking, fishing, boating and camping opportunities for the public, and Rayonier will agree to practice sustainable forestry on the land. 
 ''It's something that I have been passionate about since I was a little kid,'' Governor Pataki, wearing faded jeans and a baseball cap instead of a pinstriped suit, said in an interview during the hike.
 ''I was like 6 or 7 or 8 years old, and I remember typing with two fingers to all the Western parks commissioners for maps of their state parks and recreation areas, and waiting. All of a sudden these maps would be coming in from Montana and Wyoming. I just always loved the outdoors. I grew up outdoors.'' 
 Now, as Governor Pataki prepares to leave office at the end of the year, he spends a lot of time talking about his legacy. He usually talks about crime, tax cuts, the state's finances and Sept. 11 -- issues that can become clouded by questions about who deserves the credit for the drop in crime, or the state's continuing high tax burden and its long-term fiscal outlook, or the slow pace of redevelopment at the World Trade Center site.
 To many environmentalists and even to critics, it is Mr. Pataki's record on land preservation that stands out as his most concrete, perhaps most enduring legacy. 
 His successor, Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, called the million-acre milestone a ''remarkable achievement.'' 
 ''Protecting a million acres of open space is a remarkable achievement for which Governor Pataki deserves enormous credit,'' Mr. Spitzer said in a statement. ''All New Yorkers have benefited from his vision to preserve natural resources and enhance the state's great outdoor tradition.''
 With the new easement agreement in upstate New York, Governor Pataki has secured agreements to protect 1,020,000 acres in New York, from new sections of the Pine Barrens and a new state park in Jamesport on Long Island, to huge swaths of land in the Adirondacks, at a cost of $658.4 million, officials said.
 Only a little more than half of those agreements are done deals, officials said.
 All told, the deals protecting 553,721 acres are done; the deals for the rest of the acreage, state officials said, are in the contract phase, or are awaiting complex title searches, or have been purchased by nonprofit conservation groups, which will sell them to the state. 
 The deals were made possible by his successful campaign for a $1.75 billion environmental bond act in 1996 and his decision to set aside money in the budget for environmental projects. 
 While some environmental groups have criticized the governor for not doing more in the areas of regulation and enforcement, the governor's success in preserving land is almost universally praised by them (although it has met with resistance in some parts of the Adirondacks, which is starved for economic development). 
 For his farewell hike, Mr. Pataki chose Clarence Fahnestock Memorial State Park, a site 50 miles north of New York City that has more than doubled in size during his administration.
 He led a small entourage of aides and administration members and environmentalists and a couple of state troopers up the granite-flecked trail to Candlewood Hill, stopping along the way to taste some wintergreen leaves. (Being in the Pataki entourage can be a rustic experience: one of his troopers once lost a police radio during an off-trail scramble through a bramble.)
 Once he reached the top of the hill (followed by his state parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, who at times seemed less than thrilled by the uphill hike), the governor looked out at a vista of hemlock forests and hills and valleys, with the odd glassy lake, and even a slice of the Hudson. Below was a 261-acre swath of land that he had worked to preserve in 2004 near Oscawana Lake. 
 ''They were preparing a subdivision, and had even cut the road,'' the governor recalled. 
 Then, although the planned hike was over, the governor let himself be talked into another hike, up one of the hills overlooking Oscawana Lake. Some of the entourage groaned. But from the top, there was a view of 2000 feet along the front of the lake that were preserved.
 ''Once it's gone,'' the governor said, ''it's lost forever.''
 After the hike, over a late lunch, Ms. Harvey, of the Trust for Public Land, asked Mr. Pataki if he saw the environment as his great legacy.
 ''Well, I always say that the most important thing the government does is protect its citizens,'' the governor said, discussing the anticrime laws he pushed for and then talking about his fiscal policies.

HEADLINE: With Colorado Projects, Companies Hope to Learn From Mistakes of the Past

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. 

 BODY:
Oil shale has never made an American company more than a nickel or two; quite a few, in fact, have lost countless millions over the last century trying to cook oil out of the rock. R. Glenn Vawter, who has worked as an executive for many of the losers, knows all that only too well.
 Oil shale's many starts and stops have driven Mr. Vawter's career but have also unsettled his family life, forcing 37 moves during one 25-year spell early in his career.
But Mr. Vawter is still a true believer. His rock garden is adorned with huge shale boulders weighing over a hundred pounds, which he has lugged from job to job. His house is filled with shale bookends and shale paperweights engraved with names of companies he has worked for, including one that he had to shut down, laying himself off, during the last shale bust, in the 1980s. 
 Some may think Mr. Vawter a glutton for punishment. But suddenly at age 68, Mr. Vawter and his holy grail are back. Last month, the Bush administration opened up five large parcels of land in the Piceance Creek Basin in Colorado for oil shale research and development projects, and Mr. Vawter has bounded out of retirement to manage the efforts of EGL Resources, which will begin pilot tests early in 2007. 
 Government estimates of recoverable shale oil in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming put the reserves at 800 billion barrels -- more than triple the proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. So aside from Mr. Vawter, now many in Washington have their eyes on a big prize, not in small part for the promise it might hold to ease national security concerns. ''It could literally shake the world,'' Senator Pete V. Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico, told a recent Senate hearing. 
 But there are plenty of good reasons no one has ever come up with a profitable, environmentally acceptable method for extracting oil from shale. Not only were the previous efforts too expensive and too energy- intensive to compete with conventional oil resources, they also laid waste to the land, produced lots of air pollution and threatened scarce groundwater in one of the driest regions of the country. 
 So it is no surprise that Shell, Chevron and Mr. Vawter's EGL Resources, the three companies that won the 160-acre leases, say they are going to go slow with their experiments before they begin considering commercial production of synthetic fuel. The initial outlays are small, in the millions or tens of millions. 
 They are all looking over each others shoulders, wondering if any of their new techniques, aimed at overcoming the previous obstacles, can hit the jackpot. Each is refining its own method, but they say they are cautiously optimistic that they can succeed where so many others have failed.
 ''The resource scale is enormous,'' said Donald L. Paul, vice president and chief technical officer at Chevron. ''We believe there are opportunities for it to become commercial. Otherwise, we wouldn't do the R&D.''
 Despite the fresh starts, skeptics abound.
 ''The jury is still out whether oil shale can make it,'' said James T. Bartis, an energy policy expert at the RAND Corporation, an independent research firm. ''Right now we have no idea what one of these plants will look like. There are no designs on the books, no one has given detailed estimates on the pollution, the footprint, the ecological impact or even for that matter, the economic value to any company that is to build one of these plants. So there is a lot of uncertainty.''
 The three companies are rejecting old mining techniques that failed in the past in favor of experiments that heat the shale underground. The idea is to melt the organic material into a form of oil and gas and then pump it to the surface for refining into fuel. 
 The companies hope that approach -- known as in situ, or on site -- will be more efficient and produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions than previous efforts, although some of their experts acknowledge that a method still must be developed to capture and store carbon emissions to ensure that shale oil does not become a large producer of greenhouse gases.
 ''I didn't think I would live long enough to see a rebirth of oil shale development in our country,'' Mr. Vawter said. ''It feels great.''
 Given the modest size of the experiments planned so far, shale oil will not be arriving anytime soon, until at least the 2020s. But this is still the biggest push for shale oil since the Carter administration handed out hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies to shale developers a few years after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo drove up prices and inspired one of the first of several failed drives to achieve the post-embargo dream of American energy independence.
 The Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Energy Department operation best known for its development of the atomic bomb during World War II, also worked on shale mining technologies in the 1970s and is also jumping back into the oil shale research business in partnership with Chevron. 
 Los Alamos scientists are applying modeling and monitoring technologies developed from carbon sequestration experiments and underground testing of nuclear weapons, storage of nuclear waste and cleaning of nuclear weapon components. 
 For any underground technique to work, scientists say they must find a way to prevent the leaching of shale remnants into groundwater. Even small releases of toxic substances like arsenic and selenium could cause great harm to the Colorado River drainage basin, a lifeline for the entire Southwest. 
 The Los Alamos scientists said they would also try to find ways to safely and efficiently handle hazardous gases and explosives that might be used by Chevron to break down kerogen, the fossilized material in shale that can be converted into oil. 
 EGL says it is ready to commit at least $30 million to its 10-year experimental effort, and the larger companies are expected to pony up considerably more money. Shell says it hopes to decide whether to begin commercial production by the end of this decade.
 Shale holds much promise for American companies, because it is abundant and most of it is found in the United States. A RAND Corporation study says that the bounty could fuel American cars and homes for more than 400 years, if shale could meet a quarter of the current American demand, which is about 20 million barrels a day.
 ''It gets to the national security question,'' said Duncan W. McBranch, a senior scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who is working with Chevron. ''What if you didn't have to rely on the Middle East or other volatile parts of the world for energy?'' 
 Such visions of synthetic shale fuel have been around a long time, at least since before World War I, when the Taft administration decided that shale was so potentially important for fueling the nation's growing Navy that it created the Naval Oil Shale reserve. 
 Dozens of oil shale companies were formed and went bust during and after both World Wars. At various times from the early 1950s through the mid-1980s many of the largest oil companies invested up to $2 billion on various experimental techniques in the American Rockies but hardly a drop of oil was ever sold.
 Ruins of old mines and drills and water pumps from long-forgotten projects litter the western Colorado mountain valleys. One entire housing development Exxon began building to house 25,000 people is now a retirement community.
 Exxon and the Tosco Corporation invested the most money -- more than half a billion dollars -- in their joint Colony shale mining plant, now abandoned, a few miles north of Parachute, Colo. Twenty years later Mr. Vawter and about 20 Tosco colleagues and their wives tried to hold a reunion at the old Colony site, but Exxon Mobil denied them entrance for liability reasons at the site the company still owns. 
 ''We felt put out, so we went as close as we could get outside the locked gate of the property,'' said Mr. Vawter as he drove through a canyon near the old Colony site recently. ''We hired a caterer to take us on a wagon ride and a cookout and sat around telling old stories.''
 This time Mr. Vawter is starting well behind Shell, which has never completely given up hope in shale since the last bust. From tests going back to the early 1980s in Houston and on their own Mahogany test field in Colorado, Shell researchers have come up with a more complex but seemingly ingenious in situ approach.
 On the new lease, Shell plans to drill vertical holes 2,000 feet into the shale and heat the rock below ground with electric heaters. The shale will be slow-cooked at about 650 degrees Fahrenheit for two to three years with the hope of producing a far higher-quality oil and gas product than the faster cooking techniques of the 1980s. 
 To protect groundwater, Shell is testing a ''freeze wall'' in which ice walls will be created by circulating refrigerant liquids through a closed system of pipes.
 ''We're getting close and closer to a financial investment decision, hopefully by 2010,'' John D. Hofmeister, president of Shell Oil, told the National Press Club in Washington in October. ''We hope that the technology works.'' 
 Chevron's approach is still a work in progress. One possible method would use injection wells to circulate hot carbon-dioxide-rich gases through the fractured shale formation. For efficiency purposes, the heated gases from initial chemical reactions would be reused repeatedly to help process new shale. 
 Chevron is hoping to aim at smaller portions of shale than Shell to minimize the environmental footprint, and use shale formations themselves as walls to avert seepage into groundwater through monitoring techniques developed at Los Alamos. 
 ''We are going to be smarter this time,'' said Robert Lestz, Chevron's oil shale technology manager. ''If you are using yesterday's technologies you can expect yesterday's results. Using today's technology, you should expect totally different results.''
 The EGL method, the simplest of the three, is roughly akin to a boiler putting 700 degree Fahrenheit steam or other hot fluids through an intricate radiator system dug underneath the shale formation. Pipes will pump to the surface the vapors and liquid hydrocarbons that are emitted from the rock.
 To alleviate the underground water problem, the company plans perimeter wells to pump water continuously out of the area.
 ''We're just beginning and of course you have to reflect upon what happened the last time,'' Mr. Vawter said. ''That so many good people have broken their picks on this is humbling.''

HEADLINE: IN OVERHAUL, CITY SEEKS TO EXPAND LOWER-COST UNITS

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The City Council yesterday approved the first major overhaul of the most popular tax break for apartment building developers, adopting a plan intended to induce them to build tens of thousands of apartments for people other than the well-heeled.
 The changes, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg supported and which would go into effect in 2008, significantly increase the areas of the city in which developers who want the tax break must make one out of every five apartments they build affordable to lower-income people. The boundaries of those areas would be reconsidered every two years in light of trends in the housing market. 
In addition, and for the first time in the 35-year history of the program, those lower-priced apartments would have to be included in each building and could not be built elsewhere in the city. There would be a cap on the size of the tax break given for market-rate apartments, to limit the degree to which the program might be said to subsidize gentrification.
 The revamped program would also include a $400 million trust fund for developing low- and moderately priced housing, especially in the city's 15 poorest neighborhoods, including Soundview in the Bronx and parts of Bushwick in Brooklyn. 
 Housing officials estimate that the program, which is said to have fueled the construction of 110,000 units since 1971, will generate 20,000 new units of lower-priced housing over the first 10 years. The apartments, for rent or sale, will be set aside for New Yorkers making no more than 80 percent of the median household income, or $56,720 for a family of four.
 ''This is the single most important element of the largest affordable housing plan in the nation's history,'' said Shaun Donovan, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, referring to the mayor's plan to create or preserve 165,000 units of lower-priced housing by 2013. ''No other single change that we will make, or new policy, will have as broad an impact.''
 Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who sponsored the measure, said, ''The bill will create even more affordable housing, encourage development in communities where it is still needed and protect taxpayer dollars from oversubsidizing new luxury development.''
 But Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a real estate trade association with 11,000 members, said of the bill, ''I believe it will result in less production of housing, as well as less production of affordable housing.'' He suggested that the changes would alter the economics of development in certain neighborhoods, limiting the incentive for developers to proceed with their projects there.
 The bill represented a compromise between an administration bill and a more radical proposal initially backed by as many as 20 members of the 51-member Council.
 The impact of the changes, which cannot go into effect until the State Legislature renews the program, known as 421-a, next year, is likely to be greatest in former industrial areas like the Brooklyn-Queens waterfront that seem poised for large-scale residential redevelopment. The changes will also be felt in places like downtown Brooklyn and along Fourth Avenue where recent rezoning has opened up the possibility of new building.
 The 421-a program, which costs the city hundreds of millions of dollars a year in forgone tax revenue, was begun in the 1970s to spur housing development. Under the program, developers could get a 10- to 15-year exemption from the increase in taxes that resulted from their work. In poor neighborhoods, the tax break lasted up to 25 years.
 When the real estate market in Manhattan revived in the 1980s, the program was modified to require developers in central Manhattan to build lower-cost units if they wanted the tax break. Many of those units were built outside Manhattan. The designated area of Manhattan, known as the exclusion area, was expanded in recent years to include areas along the Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront.
 But there has been a growing consensus in favor of broader reforms. In February, Mayor Bloomberg appointed a task force of developers, affordable housing advocates, bankers and others to look into changes. Based on the group's report, the administration in October proposed some expansion of the exclusion area, a limit on the tax benefit for market-rate apartments, a $300 million trust fund and other changes.
 Last month, more than a third of the City Council submitted a counterproposal under which no developers anywhere in the city would get the tax break without making at least 30 percent of the apartments in their buildings affordable to lower-income people. Under their plan, the low-priced units would have been required to be affordable for households earning no more than 50 percent of the median income, or $35,000 for a family of four.
 Ms. Quinn's compromise, which passed by 44 to 5, expands the exclusion area to include Manhattan south of 136th Street in West and Central Harlem and south of 117th Street in East Harlem, as well as an area between 124th and 126th Streets in East Harlem. It also covers Downtown Brooklyn, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill and Park Slope, as well as most of Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, Williamsburg and Greenpoint, and parts of Sunset Park and Bushwick.
 The bill limits the total tax break for market-rate apartments so that buildings with average apartment prices of more than $650,000 will receive abatements for no more than the first $650,000. The changes also limit the number of low-priced units that go to households making 60 percent to 80 percent of the median income, to ensure that most go to households making less than that.
 Mr. Donovan, the housing commissioner, estimated that the new $400 million trust fund would produce 7,200 lower-priced units over 10 years; another 6,600 would come from $300 million in new tax revenue generated by changes in the plan. On top of that, he said, about 6,000 more units are expected to be created as a result of the increased incentives.
 Julie Miles, director of Housing Here and Now, a coalition of affordable-housing advocacy groups and others that campaigned for change, said she was now looking to the state to require even more radical reform. But she also said, ''I think this coalition of council members and housing advocates standing together had a real impact on long overdue reform of the 421-a program.''

HEADLINE: State Approves Major Complex For Brooklyn 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
A state oversight board voted yesterday to approve the Atlantic Yards project near Downtown Brooklyn, removing the last regulatory hurdle for one of the biggest real estate projects in the city's history.
 The vote by the Public Authorities Control Board capped three years of battles between opponents and supporters of the $4 billion project. The version approved yesterday -- eight million square feet over 22 acres along Atlantic Avenue -- includes a huge residential housing complex with about 6,400 market-rate and subsidized apartments, a basketball arena for the Nets, and a smattering of office space, with a design punctuated by elaborate towers that dwarf nearby residential neighborhoods.
The approval of Atlantic Yards, which would be built by Forest City Ratner Companies, came after several other ambitious development projects in New York City -- like a West Side football stadium and the Moynihan Station, both in Manhattan -- were rejected or stalled by community opposition and political rivalry. Atlantic Yards still faces two lawsuits, with more probably on the way, but Forest City officials say they are confident that they will prevail in court. 
 Yesterday's vote followed days of intense negotiation between officials at the Empire State Development Corporation, which is overseeing the project, and aides to Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, who has one of three votes on the control board. Gov. George E. Pataki and Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate leader, control the other two votes on the board, which must vote unanimously for a project to be approved.
 In recent days, Mr. Silver expressed concerns about the financing of Atlantic Yards. But on Tuesday, the development corporation provided his staff with a detailed accounting of about $554 million in infrastructure costs, of which $200 million will be paid for by the city and state, and a full analysis of the project's expected tax revenues, which the development corporation recently revised downward by about one-third.
 As yesterday's vote approached, Forest City also offered new concessions to sweeten the deal. At least 200 of the market-rate condominiums will be subsidized and made affordable to first-time homeowners, and Forest City agreed to spend $3 million to improve parks near the development. 
 The developer also agreed to shrink considerably the complex's highest tower -- the 620-foot building called Miss Brooklyn by the project's architect, Frank Gehry -- so that it will be shorter than the nearby Williamsburgh Savings Bank, Brooklyn's tallest building at 512 feet. But critics said the changes were far too modest to allay their concerns over the project's size and scale.
 ''The changes are positive, but they're small,'' said Assemblyman James F. Brennan of Brooklyn, who with several colleagues had pushed for a much larger reduction in the project's density.
 Mr. Silver said yesterday that he was certain that more changes would be forthcoming next year. But in the end, he rejected calls to delay the approval vote, a testament in part to the unusually broad base of support Forest City built for the project, including Mr. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, dozens of unions and elected officials, and Acorn, the advocacy group for low-income people.
 The project sparked an energetic and determined opposition, centered around the group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and elected officials who expressed concerns about traffic in the already congested area and the project's impact on the low-rise neighborhoods nearby, including Park Slope and Fort Greene. But the critics lacked the resources for a protracted battle against Forest City, which spent millions of dollars on lobbying, direct mail and public relations.
 Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy and a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against the project, vowed yesterday to stop it in the courts.
 ''The federal eminent domain lawsuit brought by citizens protecting their constitutional rights is rock-solid, and without those plaintiffs' properties, Atlantic Yards as we know it cannot be built,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 Since the project was proposed three years ago, Forest City has worked to dampen opposition and build support in Brooklyn and beyond. (Forest City Ratner is also the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company.)
 A once-sizable chunk of office space was given over to yet more apartments, to woo Brooklynites eager for housing, and to allay potential concerns by Mr. Silver that the project would compete with commercial properties in the speaker's Lower Manhattan district. 
 On paper, the project grew to a peak of more than nine million square feet, before shrinking back to the roughly eight million square feet originally planned -- a decrease that did little to mollify those residents and officials who said that the project had been far too big and dense from the beginning.
 The developer has yet to divulge precisely how much money it will make on the project. But Mr. Silver yesterday played down concerns that the developers were using public subsidies to generate excessive private profits, noting that the board's official review powers were limited to vetting the state's contribution to the infrastructure costs.
 ''Our role is not to measure the profits that the private investors will make,'' Mr. Silver said yesterday. ''Our role is to make sure that state liability on the project will be limited to what they say it will be. And we were satisfied about that, plain and simple.''
 According to a KPMG audit commissioned by the Empire State Development Corporation, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times, Forest City estimated that the overall rate of return on the $4 billion project, excluding the arena, at about 10 percent over 30 years. The accounting firm estimated the return at about 7 percent. 
 In a statement, Governor Pataki praised the vote, saying that now ''we can build critically needed housing including affordable housing, new community facilities, grand open spaces and increase economic development all across Brooklyn.''
 Opponents of the project strongly criticized yesterday's decision.
 ''From the beginning, the project has been a public-private partnership in which the public has not been represented,'' said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, part of a coalition of civic groups known as Brooklyn Speaks that had urged Mr. Silver to delay the project. ''The vote today reflected a process that simply did not allow New Yorkers to shape the project, and the result is a plan that will not work for Brooklyn.''

HEADLINE: Outsize Profits, and Questions, In Effort to Cut Warming Gases

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: QUZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Foreign businesses have embraced an obscure United Nations-backed program as a favored approach to limiting global warming. But the early efforts have revealed some hidden problems.
 Under the program, businesses in wealthier nations of Europe and in Japan help pay to reduce pollution in poorer ones as a way of staying within government limits for emitting climate-changing gases like carbon dioxide, as part of the Kyoto Protocol.
 Among their targets is a large rusting chemical factory here in southeastern China. Its emissions of just one waste gas contribute as much to global warming each year as the emissions from a million American cars, each driven 12,000 miles.
 Cleaning up this factory will require an incinerator that costs $5 million -- far less than the cost of cleaning up so many cars, or other sources of pollution in Europe and Japan. 
 Yet the foreign companies will pay roughly $500 million for the incinerator -- 100 times what it cost. The high price is set in a European-based market in carbon dioxide emissions. Because the waste gas has a far more powerful effect on global warming than carbon dioxide emissions, the foreign businesses must pay a premium far beyond the cost of the actual cleanup. 
 The huge profits from that will be divided by the chemical factory's owners, a Chinese government energy fund, and the consultants and bankers who put together the deal from a mansion in the wealthy Mayfair district of London. 
 Arrangements like this still make sense to the foreign companies financing them because they are a lot less expensive, despite the large profit for others, than cleaning up their own operations. 
 Such efforts are being watched in the United States as an alternative more politically attractive than imposing taxes on fossil fuels like coal and oil that emit global-warming gases when burned. 
 But critics of the fast-growing program, through which European and Japanese companies are paying roughly $3 billion for credits this year, complain that it mostly enriches a few bankers, consultants and factory owners. 
 With so much money flowing to a few particularly lucrative cleanup deals, the danger is that they will distract attention from the broader effort to curb global warming gases, and that the lure of quick profit will encourage short-term fixes at the expense of fundamental, long-run solutions, including developing renewable energy sources like solar power.
 As word of deals like this has spread, everyone involved in the nascent business is searching for other such potential jackpots in developing countries.
 As for more modest deals, like small wind farms, ''if you don't have a humongous margin, it's not worth it,'' said Pedro Moura Costa, chief operating officer of EcoSecurities, an emissions-trading company in Oxford, England.
 The financing of the chemical factory's incinerator here and other deals like it are now drawing unfavorable attention. Canada's environment minister, Rona Ambrose, announced in October that her government would withdraw from the trading program. 
 ''There is a lot of evidence now about the lack of accountability around these kinds of projects,'' she said.
 Another concern is that the program can have unintended results. The waste gas to be incinerated here is emitted during the production of a refrigerant that will soon be banned in the United States and other industrial nations because it depletes the ozone layer that protects the earth from ultraviolet rays.
 Handsome payments to clean up the waste gas have helped chemical companies to expand existing factories that make the old refrigerant and even build new factories, said Michael Wara, a carbon-trading lawyer at Holland & Knight in San Francisco. 
 Moreover, air-conditioners using this Freon-like refrigerant are much less efficient users of electricity than newer models. The expansion of large middle classes in India and China has led to soaring sales of cheap, inefficient air-conditioners, along with the building of coal-fired plants to power them, further contributing to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer.
 The program is at the forefront of efforts to address the most intractable problem in climate change: how to limit soaring emissions from the largest developing countries. Sometime in 2009, China's total emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important global warming gas, are expected to surpass those from the United States, according to the International Energy Agency.
 While the challenge of addressing global warming is daunting, so are the consequences of inaction. Scientists warn that rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases could result in more severe storms, wide crop failures, the spread of tropical diseases and rising sea levels endangering some coastal cities.
 Programs like the one the United Nations supports are increasingly common in Europe. In general, they allow companies to buy rights on the market to exceed their limits on global warming gases from other companies prepared to reduce emissions elsewhere at a lower cost. Many economists consider emissions-trading systems, which are driving participants to the cheapest cleanups with the biggest impact, as the most efficient way to address pollution. 
 But a study commissioned by the world organization has found that the profits are enormous in destroying trifluoromethane, or HFC-23, a very potent greenhouse gas that is produced at the factory here and several dozen other plants in developing countries. The study calculated that industrial nations could pay $800 million a year to buy credits, even though the cost of building and operating incinerators will be only $31 million a year.
 The situation has set in motion a diplomatic struggle pitting China, the biggest beneficiary from payments, against advanced industrial nations, particularly in Europe. At a global climate conference in Nairobi, Kenya, in November, European delegates suggested that in the case of Freon factories now under construction in developing countries, any payments for the incineration of the waste gas should go only into an international fund to help factories retool for the production of more modern refrigerants that do not deplete the ozone layer.
 But the Chinese government blocked the initiative, insisting that money for Chinese factories go into the government's own clean energy fund. Negotiators ended up setting up a group to study the issue.
 Even as hundreds of millions of dollars from the program are devoted to the refrigerant industry, countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which were originally envisioned as big beneficiaries of emissions trading, are receiving almost nothing. Just four nations -- China, India, Brazil and South Korea -- are collecting four-fifths of the payments under the program, with China alone collecting almost half.
 Two-thirds of the payments are going to projects to eliminate HFC-23. 
 Those payments also illustrate conflicting goals under Kyoto and the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 agreement that requires the phasing out of ozone-depleting substances. The problem is that the trading program backed by the United Nations, known as the Clean Development Mechanism, is helping support an industry that another international organization is trying to phase out.
 And while ozone depletion is a separate problem from global warming, some gases, like HFC-23, make both worse. The separate secretariats under the protocols have little legal authority to resolve this quandary. 
 ''It's tricky in that we don't have a mechanism other than the Security Council, and who cares there about HFC's?'' said Janos Pasztor, the acting coordinator of the organization that oversees the program.
 In the end, officials say, there should be more projects aimed at providing renewable energy and sustainable economic development for the world's poorest people.
 ''If people only do HFC-23 projects, then they miss the whole idea,'' Mr. Pasztor said.
 Richard Rosenzweig, chief operating officer of Natsource, a company in Washington arranging emissions deals between poor and rich countries, said it was not fair to look only at incineration costs and compare them with the size of payments from industrial nations. The administrative costs of the program are high, he said, and at least disposal of the waste gas is taking place.
 If the world tried to reduce emissions through an outright ban or regulation alone, as many environmentalists recommend, it might not happen at all, he said. The United Nations-favored program may have flaws, he added, but ''it's a pilot phase -- this is a 100-year problem.''
 Environmental groups say that governments in developing countries should either require factories to incinerate the waste gas as a cost of doing business, or receive aid from wealthier countries to cover the relatively modest cost of incinerators. 
 ''Couldn't we pay for the cost, or even twice the cost, of abatement and spend the rest of the money in better ways?'' Mr. Wara asked.
 DuPont produces HFC-23 as part of its output of Teflon, but has routinely burned the colorless, odorless waste gas without compensation for many years, even though it is not required by law to do so, a DuPont spokeswoman said.
 The secretariat of the Clean Development Mechanism estimates that a ton of HFC-23 in the atmosphere has the same effect as 11,700 tons of carbon dioxide. James Cameron, the vice chairman of Climate Change Capital, which organized the chemical factory deal here, said there were considerable costs and risks in setting up plans that required elaborate certification by consultants, acceptance by developing-country governments and approval by a United Nations secretariat. 
 For small projects involving less than $250,000 worth of credits, fees for deal makers, consultants and lawyers can far exceed the cost of installing equipment to clean up emissions.
 Even the Chinese government, the main seller of carbon credits and a defender of the program, is expressing some misgivings.
 ''We do not encourage more HFC projects,'' a statement by Lu Xuedu, deputy director of the Office of Global Environment Affairs at the Ministry of Science and Technology, said. ''We would prefer to have more energy efficiency and renewable-energy projects that could help alleviate poverty in the countryside.''
 But for now, the projects involving industrial gases like HFC-23 are where most of the action is.
 ''You can do those quickly,'' Mr. Rosenzweig of Natsource said, ''and it's worth the investment.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Britain to Add Ships To Persian Gulf in Alert to Iran

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The United States and Britain will begin moving additional warships and strike aircraft into the Persian Gulf region in a display of military resolve toward Iran that will come as the United Nations continues to debate possible sanctions against the country, Pentagon and military officials said Wednesday. 
 The officials said that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was expected this week to approve a request by commanders for a second aircraft carrier and its supporting ships to be stationed within quick sailing distance of Iran by early next year. 
Senior American officers said the increase in naval power should not be viewed as preparations for any offensive strike against Iran. But they acknowledged that the ability to hit Iran would be increased. One purpose of the deployment, they said, is to make clear that the focus on ground troops in Iraq has not made it impossible for the United States and its allies to maintain a military watch on Iran. 
 The officials said the planned growth in naval power in the gulf and surrounding waters would be useful in enforcing any sanctions that the United Nations might impose as part of Washington's strategy to punish Iran for what it sees as ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons. And the buildup would address another concern: that Iran could try to block oil shipments from the gulf in retaliation for United Nations sanctions. 
 Steps are already being taken to increase the number of minesweeping vessels and magnetic ''sleds'' carried by helicopters to improve the ability to counter Iranian mines that could block oil-shipping lanes, Pentagon and military officials said. After the first of the year, the British Navy plans to add two mine-hunting vessels to its ships that already are part of the international coalition patrolling waters in the Persian Gulf. 
 A Royal Navy news release said the ship movements were aimed at ''maintaining familiarity with the challenges of warm water mine-hunting conditions.'' But a senior British official said, ''We are increasing our presence. That is only prudent.'' 
 As opposed to ground and air forces that require bases in the region, naval forces offer a capacity for projecting power in parts of the world where a large American presence is controversial. Many of the ships could be kept over the horizon, but close enough to project their power quickly if needed.
 Vice Adm. Patrick M. Walsh, commander of naval forces across the military's Central Command, said that while ''Iranian tone and rhetoric creates an environment of intimidation and fear,'' the United States ''must be careful not to contribute to escalation.'' In an interview from his headquarters in Bahrain, Admiral Walsh declined to discuss the specifics of future deployments. ''To assure our friends, we have to have capabilities to secure the critical sea lines of communication,'' he said.
 ''They need reassurances that we expect to be part of the effort here for the long term, that we will not run away from intimidation and that we will be part of the effort here for security and stability at sea for the long term,'' he added. 
 Other military and Pentagon officials did describe specifics of the planned deployments in order to clarify the rationale for the movement of ships and aircraft, but they would not do so by name because Mr. Gates had not yet signed any deployment orders.
 Pentagon officials said that the military's joint staff, which plans operations and manages deployments, had recently received what is called a ''request for forces'' from commanders asking for a second aircraft carrier strike group in the region, and that a deployment order was expected to be signed by the end of the week by Mr. Gates. 
 The aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its strike group -- including three escort ships, an attack submarine and 6,500 sailors in all -- entered the Persian Gulf on Dec. 11 after a naval exercise to practice halting vessels suspected of smuggling nuclear materials. A carrier had not been inside the gulf since the Enterprise left in July, according to Pentagon officials. The next carrier scheduled to sail toward the Middle East is the Stennis, set to depart Bremerton, Wash., for the region in late January, Navy officers said. 
 Officials expressed doubt that the Stennis and its escorts would be asked to sail before the holiday season, but it could be ordered to sea several weeks earlier than planned. It could then overlap for months with the Eisenhower, which is not scheduled to return home until May, offering ample time to decide whether to send another carrier or to extend the Eisenhower's tour.
 Doubling the number of carriers in the region offers commanders the flexibility of either keeping both strike groups in the gulf or keeping one near Iran while placing a second carrier group outside the gulf, where it would be in position to fly combat patrols over Afghanistan.
 But these same officials say Iran is the focus of new deployments, as administration officials view recent bold moves by Iran -- and by North Korea, as well -- as at least partly explained by assessments in Tehran and North Korea that the American military is bogged down in Iraq.
 Adm. Mike Mullen, the chief of naval operations, has made the case that the United States should seek to create ''a thousand-ship Navy.'' That would be impossible for the United States alone given current budgets, so instead it would be accomplished by operating more closely with allied warships.
 He said that such a cooperative naval concept would be a ''global maritime partnership that unites navies, coast guards, maritime forces, port operators, commercial shippers and many other government and nongovernment agencies to address maritime concerns.''
 As an example, at present there are about 45 warships deployed in the Persian Gulf and waters across the region from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, with a third of those supplied by allies, who this month include Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Pakistan and Britain.

HEADLINE: With a Ceremony From the Past, Iraqis Take Charge in Najaf

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: NAJAF, Iraq, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
They slit the rabbit's belly, ripped it open and feasted on the still beating heart. The commandos of the Iraqi Army were celebrating. The Americans had handed over control of Najaf Province. 
 On Wednesday, more than three years after the invasion and two years after American forces put down a revolt here by the militia of Moktada al-Sadr, Najaf became the first province under American control to be handed over to the Iraqis. Two previous transfers involved provinces under British control.
Even as debate continues in Washington about what should be done to help pacify much of the country, especially Baghdad, coalition officials still say they plan to turn over all of Iraq's provinces by the end of next year. 
 With the transfer, the Iraqi government gained control over its Eighth Army Division, which has about 10,000 soldiers. Shiite leaders, who control both this province and the national government, have been anxious to get more operational control over the army, which the United States has been laboring to train.
 But security in the sacred city of Najaf was already largely under Iraqi control, as American forces mostly withdrew from the area after putting down an uprising in 2004 by the Sadr militia, known as the Mahdi Army.
 As the center of Shiite scholarship and the home of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most influential and revered cleric, Najaf has not been plagued with the kind of sectarian violence that is tearing Baghdad apart. 
 But there have been fights between Shiite factions, and residents privately express concern that many Mahdi militiamen are still armed and ready to fight if provoked. 
 Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Iraq's national security adviser, attended the transfer ceremony and used the trip to meet with Ayatollah Sistani and discuss the problem of militias. 
 Briefing reporters after his conversation, he said he had told Ayatollah Sistani of the government's plans to integrate the militias and armed groups in the country's military forces, and said the ayatollah agreed with this goal.
 The local authorities closed all the roads in the city before the transfer ceremony, and while the security situation is relatively stable here, foreigners still had a military escort to travel the five miles from the heliport at the old American military base to the ceremony. 
 In a soccer stadium at the heart of the city, the Iraqi Army and troops from the police, border control and fire brigade paraded for more than an hour before a delegation of American and Iraqi military officials. 
 Maj. Gen. Kurt A. Cichowski, deputy chief of staff for the coalition forces, who attended the ceremony, said, ''It is a major step forward in improving security and strengthening the authority of the government.''
 There was music and chanting and a karate demonstration. Dozens of new vehicles, many paid for by the occupying forces, were driven around the stadium, adorned with plastic flowers.
 The general public did not attend. Much of the audience was made up of powerful tribal leaders, who sat beneath a sign that read: ''We are the sons of those who drove the British out in 1920.''
 Outside the stadium, foreign military officials said the $137 million spent on reconstruction in the province was beginning to have an impact. They expect that as tourism continues to thrive, driven by the one million pilgrims who visit every year, the economic situation will improve.
 As soldiers paraded by a reviewing grandstand, commandos with their faces blackened gathered for a demonstration of their courage.
 Each man reached into his right pocket, pulled out a frog and bit its head off. They threw the squirming legs to the ground as the group's leader held aloft a live rabbit. He slit the belly and plunged his mouth into the gash. The carcass was then passed around to the rest of the soldiers, who took their own bites.
 It was explained later that this practice was especially popular among Saddam Hussein's feared Fedayeen militia, whose members had done the same thing with live snakes and wolves.

114 Iraqis Dead in Baghdad

By The New York Times
 BAGHDAD, Dec. 20 -- Violence continued across the capital on Wednesday. At least 114 Iraqis were killed or found dead, Iraqi officials said.
 Among the dead were a comedian, a law professor, a schoolteacher and the bodyguard of the director of the Central Bank. In the most lethal attack, a suicide bomber blew himself up near Baghdad University's central campus, killing 9 people, including some students, and wounding 29. Six people died in central Baghdad when a car bomb exploded near a bus filled with people on the way to the airport. 
 The American military announced that two soldiers were killed by roadside bombs in Baghdad. It also announced the capture of a Sunni insurgent leader in Mosul on Dec. 14. The leader, whom the military did not identify, was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths and had housed foreign fighters who were to be suicide bombers, the military said.
 In Washington, President Bush signed a bill that extends the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, an independent agency that oversees $32 billion in American expenditures on the rebuilding of Iraq, into 2008. 
 The office would have gone out of existence next year under a measure that had been pushed by Duncan Hunter, a House Republican from California with presidential ambitions, but he later dropped his opposition to the extension.

HEADLINE: For Divided Family, Border Is Sorrowful Barrier 

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico 

 BODY:
She tells her story from a windowless bedroom in a cinderblock house carved into four apartments that share two showers and two toilet stalls outside. Her kitchen has no refrigerator or sink. To cook, she buys perishables on the same day. To wash dishes, she fills buckets from a faucet in the front yard.
 ''Look how I live,'' Irma tells a visitor. ''I was used to something else.''
Not so long ago, Irma, 44, had achieved her own modest version of the American dream about 300 miles from here in San Antonio, where she lived illegally for more than six years. She had left Mexico with three of her four daughters, escaping financial turmoil and marriage to a man so violent that she considered suicide, twice slipping a rope over a beam to hang herself. 
 In Texas, she had learned how to drive and owned not one but two cars. She held two jobs and, after years of sharing homes with her older sister, Raquel Rodriguez, the family's only legal resident, and other relatives and friends, moved with her daughters into a small rented house furnished from flea markets.
 ''My daughters were in peace,'' Irma recalled, proud in that accomplishment, her last name and those of some relatives not being disclosed here because they have been illegal immigrants. ''No one bothered us.''
 Then one night over dinner, three years ago, her daughter Mayra, a high school senior, stunned her with the news that she was pregnant and intended to marry her boyfriend. Another daughter, Barbie, not yet 16, was adamant that said she, too, was getting married and moving out. 
 ''I was so depressed,'' Irma said. ''All I wanted was to pick up my stuff and leave.''
 Disillusioned and feeling abandoned, she attended her daughters' courthouse weddings on a Wednesday but did not stick around for the weekend parties. She made a quick round of goodbyes to her sister Raquel and another sister, Veronica, who was also living illegally in San Antonio.
 By Friday she was on her way back to Mexico with her youngest daughter, passengers in a pickup truck that joined the exodus of immigrants who at some point cross in the opposite direction to go back home. Even with the benefit of having sisters nearby, the kind of support that many immigrants cannot do without, Irma felt she could not stay without Mayra to give her a hand with the driving, child care and other needs that can become particularly daunting for a single mother.
 She left one daughter her dining room set, washing machine and refrigerator; the other got her living room set, king-size bed and two dressers.
 ''I doled out everything,'' Irma said. ''I cried so much because it took so much sacrifice to avail myself of things and I had to get rid of them.''
 Now all she has to show for her migration to the United States, she said, is the heartache of separation.
 Her youngest daughter, Lupita, and another daughter, who is married and has three children, now live together just a few blocks from her. But the other two are still in Texas, still illegally, now with one American-born child each. 
 The border is now a barrier between the Mexican and American sides of her family, and now Irma feels the pull of her absent daughters. The older one has faced her own marital troubles, and both of their families recently moved into an uncle's house to share expenses. If some illness or emergency befell her girls, Irma worries, she could not be there to help them.
 ''I still feel that I should be with them, supporting them,'' Irma said. ''They're still children.''

Back to the Old Neighborhood
 In sweltering heat one evening, with an ear out for ''Duel of Passions,'' the telenovela on the television in the bedroom, Irma performed a culinary magic trick. She transformed $5 in groceries into a meal of rice with corn, fried potatoes and steamed nopales, cactus, with vegetables to feed two daughters, three grandchildren and two visitors, and still have enough waiting for Gilberto, a tractor-truck mechanic she fell in love with upon her return to Monterrey.
 ''I always got my daughters used to the food from over here,'' she said, perspiring heavily despite the gusts from a stand-up fan. ''They're 100 percent Mexican. None of that pizza.''
 Irma has taken up once again in her old neighborhood, a cluster of lower-middle-class and poor homes at the foot of a mountain called Cerro de la Silla, or Saddle Mountain, in this industrial city of 1.1 million. 
 The streets in Irma's insular world are lined with ficus trees, and the homes are in varying stages of completion, giving the area the character of a work in progress. Residents buy the land and then build their houses over time, evolving at the pace of their means. Floors are still without tile and zinc roofs have yet to be replaced with cement, though gang graffiti spreads faster than kudzu on the exterior walls. 
 Irma works part time as a bar waitress and lives in the sparsely furnished home she shares with Gilberto, 35, who makes $120 a week and foots most of the couple's household expenses, including the $150 monthly rent. The house where she lived before meeting Gilberto is still in disrepair, with partly exposed rooms, missing walls and open sections of the roof. Her daughters still live there, their clothes hanging from bare walls moist from the recent rains and the sofas and light fixtures worn out or broken.
 At first she stayed in her sister Raquel's second home, a large corner property with an empty swimming pool and rental units, known as La Quinta, that her family in Monterrey -- Irma's mother, a sister and four brothers -- used for celebrations. 
 Then she set out to rehabilitate her old five-room house -- which she said her estranged husband had been using ''as his little hotel'' for trysts with women -- and bring her family back under one roof. But like a recurring nightmare, her husband, whom she said she could not afford to divorce, still harassed her when he came to visit his daughters.
 More and more, her days here are filled with daydreaming about crossing back. A six-hour drive is all that separates her from her daughters in San Antonio. But Irma said she was stuck, with no money to pay for an illegal crossing and no prospects for a tourist visa because she did not own property, hold a full-time job or offer any evidence that she had ties to Mexico that would compel her to return after a visit.
 For now, the telephone must do. Twice-a-week calls from San Antonio are her only connection to the life she once had. One morning in October, one of her daughters, Mayra, called and Irma savored each word, careful to shield her own emotions.
 ''It's been raining. Every day?'' she asked. To her delight, Mayra stayed on the phone for more than two hours when her younger sister Lupita got on the line.
 Adjusting to Mexico has been even tougher for Lupita, who turns 16 in December and wears her blond hair waist-long and favors outfits that expose her midriff. A drop earring cascades from her navel. She changed schools five times before she dropped out and took a job in customer service and billing with a cellphone company. Lupita hated the schedule of afternoon-only classes, and resented having to pay for her textbooks, something unheard of in Texas.
 ''It makes me quite sad that she's not in high school,'' Irma said. ''I tell my daughters, 'You don't have to struggle like me.' If I had studied, I'd be in an office, not a bar.'' 

'Over There'
 Fanning herself with bare hands in the midday heat, Irma walks around a flea market, casting a disdainful eye over the secondhand shoes, clothes and trinkets spread out on blankets and tables, and sometimes in piles over the dirt of the soccer field. She settles on a pair of bright yellow beach thongs for $1 for herself and two pairs of jeans for Lupita.
 She is starting over, from scratch. But she was not thrilled with today's finds. ''Over there you pay less and it's new,'' she said with authority about Texas.
 She says it again and again. ''Over there'' -- that world that taught her what she is missing. Irma knew only poverty when she went to San Antonio.
 She left school at 12 to start work cleaning houses. At 17 she learned to sew and worked in a factory. At 20, after three years of courtship, she married a neighbor and began a new cycle of deprivation. It was the untenable marriage, more than economic hardship, that compelled her to follow in the footsteps of her sister Raquel, the first in her family to immigrate north and who remains the family's mainstay in San Antonio.
 A fading wedding picture in the living room of the home where her daughters live shows the couple in posed embrace, with a darker-haired Irma in white gown and long train and her mustachioed husband holding her by the waist. Irma said the newlywed bliss lasted only two years. Her husband soon started cheating and beating her, once even breaking her nose, she said.
 At one point she left with the girls, staying with siblings and moving from house to house. The husband would not give her economic support. Things got so bad, she said, that twice she planned her suicide, but changed her mind when she heard her daughters coming into the house.
 ''I was tired and desperate,'' she said of her marital situation. ''That wasn't a life.''
 Her daughter Mayra left for Texas first. The girl was driven across the border with false identification papers. She went to live with her Aunt Raquel in San Antonio and attended middle school there. Irma followed later, leaving her other daughters in Monterrey.
 ''It went badly for me,'' she said of that first and toughest year in the north. ''I wasn't happy here or there. I had Mayra, who was my solace.''
 Irma eventually found work as a seamstress, making military uniforms in a maquiladora in San Antonio, a job that paid, by the piece, $400 to $500 in a good week, and enabled her to send $200 to $300 home weekly. But when her family sent word that her husband, a welder, had suffered a severe leg injury at work and was dying and asking for her forgiveness, she returned to Monterrey. A month later, he had recovered and she was back in San Antonio and at Raquel's, this time with two more daughters in tow.
 The maquiladora jobs had vanished, so she went to work cleaning and washing dishes at a Mexican restaurant. She had been promoted to cook and substitute restaurant manager, making $5.75 an hour, by the time the two daughters announced their wedding plans.

A Chance Meeting
 Despite her sad eyes and unsmiling face, Irma presents a youthful exterior -- brown eyes under tattooed eyebrows, short honey-colored hair pinned back with girlish barrettes, form-fitting tops over tight jeans, tattoos on her lower back and left leg and upper arm. A victim of domestic violence by both her father and husband, she said she had long stopped looking for a man.
 Then last year, at a girlfriend's birthday party, she met Gilberto.
 ''We danced and we were giggling and all of a sudden we were kissing,'' she said. Gilberto has kind eyes and a calm demeanor, but he also had a drinking problem. Irma became his confidante, a supportive friend, but did not agree to live with him, she said, until last summer, when she was convinced he had dealt with his own demons.
 Irma's days are now split between Gilberto, her work, her daughters, her grandchildren and, increasingly, her longing for ''over there.''
 She first found work cleaning in a factory for $80 a week. Last March she got a better position as a waitress at a pool hall three days a week for $90. She works Thursday through Saturday, the 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift, also getting up at 5 a.m. on weekdays to cook Gilberto's breakfast and pack him a lunch of rice soup or potatoes with chorizo. She watches the news and then walks two blocks to play with her grandchildren. 
 ''The family-oriented lifestyle has not changed for me,'' said Irma, who prefers a quiet home life after work, with the occasional outing to a karaoke bar or the public swimming pool. 
 One afternoon, she walked her 6-year-old granddaughter, Briseiry, to school for the United Nations World Food Day. Dressed as a strawberry, Briseiry performed two dance numbers in the school yard, with classmates in grape and potato costumes. Irma and her daughter Mireya laughed and clapped from the sidelines.
 From the produce ranks, Briseiry flashed her grandmother a toothless smile, and Irma smiled back with tenderness. But even in this revelry, she pointed out the school's flaws -- the chairs without desks and bathrooms that lacked doors and toilet lids.
 ''The differences are many,'' she said, comparing Monterrey with San Antonio.

Another American Grandchild
 Her brush with American life has made Irma less tolerant of the poverty, quick to find fault with her surroundings. The urge to start over in Texas is the strongest it has been since she returned. Her daughter Barbie gave birth to a second child in December. Once again, Irma missed out on welcoming a new grandchild. And as usual, Irma will wait for one of her sister Raquel's visits to see pictures of her growing American family.
 She has her fantasy return planned out. She would take Lupita and Gilberto with her, get a higher-paying job at a restaurant, or cleaning houses, that would allow her to help her daughters in Texas and send money to Mireya in Monterrey to get a tourist visa. 
 Getting through the border, Irma noted, is not as daunting as coming up with the $2,000 she said she would need to pay for fake identification papers and a coyote to drive her through as his wife or sister. When she first crossed by car in the late 1990s, as the coyote's ''wife,'' she paid only $500.
 ''Imagine that, together we'd need $4,000,'' Irma told Gilberto one night.
 It would be easier to buy a car, he replied.
 Another hope is that Irma's daughters in San Antonio, or maybe her sister Raquel, would become citizens and sponsor her for permanent residency. But that would be years away.
 Sometimes Irma looks so melancholic that Gilberto asks if she has misgivings about having returned. She tells him no, because she wouldn't have met him.
 ''I don't regret having come because, after so many years of being alone, I found Gilberto, who treats me well, who loves me and takes care of me,'' she says.
 But that is only half the truth. 
 One Thursday afternoon, Irma left home shortly before 3 p.m. for her job at the billiard hall, a short walk through a busy commercial area with restaurants, tortillerias, clothing stores and auto repair shops.
 A burly man yelled from across the avenue that he had the reconditioned refrigerator she had been looking for. When she signaled ''how much?'' he held up five fingers to signal 500 pesos, or about $50. 
 The rent was due, she said, so the purchase had to wait.
 ''That's why you don't get ahead here,'' Irma said of the low salaries. ''What you make here in a week, over there you collect daily, even just cleaning up yards.''
 Irma's workplace is a bar with six pool tables and wall decor that ranges from pictures of Pancho Villa to a calendar featuring topless women.
 Three television sets are tuned to Animal Planet.
 That night about a dozen men in their 20s and 30s focused on their game and $2 bets. Irma, in jeans and a sweater, moved about at a relaxed pace serving beer and picking up empties from tables.
 Most customers summoned her with an ''Irma, cerveza!'' Many greeted her with a kiss. On busy nights, Irma and another waitress serve up to 200 patrons at a time. No one tips like in Texas, where Irma sometimes ended the night at the restaurant with an extra $40. She has to wait until Saturday to get paid for the three days.
 And it is, after all, a bar. ''The bad thing here is that people drink until they crawl,'' she said. ''Over there, if they see you drunk, they don't sell to you.''
 During a break, sitting in a plastic chair and sipping a beer sent over by a customer, she fought back tears as she pondered her future. A customer was grilling meat over firewood in one corner for Irma and his friends. A childhood friend, Antonio Flores, walked in and kissed her on the cheek.
 ''She was very good and very beautiful,'' Mr. Flores said, reminiscing of Irma as a teenager. 
 Irma smiled in appreciation, but on this night, her cocoon in Monterrey felt like a prison.
 ''If I had the money I'd leave today,'' she repeated, barely audible over the ranchera playing on the jukebox.

Traditional Round Trip for Workers Is Becoming a One-Way Migration North
By MIREYA NAVARRO

 In the crossings at the United States' southern border, tens of thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants head each year in the direction of Mexico. While no statistics are kept on this reverse migration, researchers in both countries suggest that the numbers have declined as border controls have tightened.
 Returning Mexicans, researchers say, have generally been divided between ''sojourners,'' those with temporary or seasonal jobs in the United States who cross once or more a year, and ''settlers,'' those who move to the United States for an extended period but at some point choose to return home.
 ''The Mexican migration was always round trip,'' said Jorge Durand, director of the Mexican Migration Project at the University of Guadalajara, a research program in conjunction with the Office of Population Research at Princeton. ''It was a migration of workers, not immigrants.''
 But several factors are causing more illegal immigrants to stay in the United States. Increasingly, immigrants are finding jobs away from the agricultural sector, meaning they have more stable employment that is not subject to seasonal ups and downs, researchers say. More immigrants have also moved to destinations beyond the border states of the Southwest, making the journey back home longer, more expensive and less convenient.
 Most important, some researchers say, increased vigilance along the border has led to higher costs and risks associated with crossing back into the United States, disrupting what had been the traditional circular movement of the migrants. Border enforcement began to tighten in the mid-1980s, but has become much more vigorous since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 ''Having run the gantlet of enforcement resources at the border, migrants grew reluctant to repeat the experience and hunkered down to stay, causing rates of return migration to fall sharply,'' said Douglas S. Massey, a sociologist who directs the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton.
 Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said that ''the primary effect of hardening the border has been one of locking people in.''
 The 2005 census in Mexico counted 242,000 Mexicans who said they had lived in the United States and had returned to Mexico from 2000 to 2005. By comparison, a 1992 survey counted 955,000 people who said they had returned in the previous five years.
 The average probability of return for illegal immigrants was 47 percent during 1979-84 but fell to 27 percent during 1997-2003, Mr. Massey said.
 Such probability diminishes the longer the stay, researchers found.
 Even sojourners, who are mostly young and male, have been extending their stay in the United States, from an average of 5 1/2 months in the mid-'90s to more than 12 months now, according to some research in Mexico.
 Those immigrants most likely to return home, some studies suggest, have strong family ties in Mexico or property and other investments. Some studies have found the return rates are higher among men, the elderly and those with little education.
 Anecdotal evidence indicates that most go back to reunite with their families, to invest savings and set up businesses, to retire or because they just gave up, says Rodolfo Tuiran Gutierrez, a demographer and sociologist who served as secretary general of the National Population Council, a government agency in Mexico.
 He said that unlike those making the journey north, Mexicans returning home face no hurdles, easily flying, driving or even walking across the border. 
 Dr. Tuiran Gutierrez said those who returned often had to deal with negative consequences of their migration, like split families and the lack of pensions or Social Security benefits in Mexico because they did not work there. He and other researchers said the decision to return usually came after migrants weighed the costs of living in the United States against the benefits, not all of them material.
 At some point, for example, Mr. Durand said, making $8 an hour does not seem worth the discrimination many face in the United States, or the stress of trying to speak English. 
 ''The moment comes when they say, 'What am I doing here?' '' Mr. Durand said. ''They look at quality of life and say, 'I'm better off in my homeland than in the United States.' ''

HEADLINE: U.S. Negotiator Notes an Improved Tone in Talks on North Korea 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The chief American negotiator at talks to address North Korea's nuclear program said Wednesday that the parties could reach a new agreement on rolling back North Korea's bomb-making effort this week, but the prospects for a meaningful breakthrough remained uncertain.
 The chief negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters that the United States, North Korea and the four other countries participating in the Chinese-sponsored talks had begun discussing details of how to carry out a 2005 draft agreement on ending North Korea's nuclear program. He said the tenor of the often tortuous discussions had improved. 
''The discussions for us have been very useful,'' said Mr. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. ''Certainly we are talking about much more than just agreeing on things on paper. We're discussing actual developments on the ground, and for that reason these discussions are not easy.''
 The negotiations are part of a series of talks sponsored by China that have continued for more than three years and have failed to make tangible progress in slowing North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
 On Oct. 9, North Korea exploded a nuclear device for the first time, prompting the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions. After a frenzied round of Chinese diplomacy, North Korea agreed to return to the six-nation talks for the first time in more than a year.
 The talks opened on an unpromising note Monday, when the senior North Korean negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, declared that as a new nuclear power North Korea would engage only in ''arms control'' negotiations, implying that it had no intention of eliminating its nuclear program. 
 But during a series of one-on-one sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday, North Korea's attitude turned more pragmatic, Asian diplomats participating in the talks said, adding that concrete proposals for freezing North Korea's weapons program on the way to a broader accord were under active discussion.
 Many analysts say that North Korea is not likely to give up its quest to become a full nuclear power and that any talks are merely a stalling tactic or an attempt to foster good will from China, its main aid supplier.
 Others say that North Korea may at some point prove willing to make concessions on its nuclear program in exchange for a big aid program to bail out its closed, ailing economy.
 Mr. Hill said he was pleasantly surprised that the talks had moved beyond posturing, and he raised the possibility that they could produce an agreement before the end of the current round this week.
 ''To be frank, Monday was kind of a difficult day, and the idea that I'd still be here Wednesday night telling you it was useful to continue -- I frankly didn't think I would be saying that,'' he said.
 He said China, as the host and mediator, had begun drafting the text of an accord that would commit the parties to concrete steps to carry out a vaguely worded 2005 agreement.
 In September 2005, North Korea agreed to end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for security guarantees, diplomatic recognition and economic and energy aid from its neighbors and the United States.
 The 2005 accord, though hailed as a breakthrough at the time, collapsed almost immediately after it was reached. North Korea publicly renounced the text. 
 ''The whole purpose is to take the September agreement and start getting it implemented,'' Mr. Hill said of the current talks.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Awards 5 Slot-Machine Licenses

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa., Dec. 20 

 BODY:
A casino company executive wept tears of joy and others expressed disappointment on Wednesday, as the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board approved five licenses for slot-machine casinos in the state. 
 After a year of debate and review, the seven-member board unanimously approved slot-machine casino licenses for two sites in Philadelphia, one in Pittsburgh, one in Bethlehem, and one in the Pocono Mountains.
 Also Wednesday, the gaming board granted permanent licenses for slot machines at six horse racing tracks that had been approved several weeks ago. 
 Like other states that have approved gambling in recent years, Pennsylvania is hoping for a tax windfall from the casinos. 
 Besides a fee of $50 million per license, Pennsylvania estimates that the 11 approved casinos will generate nearly $3 billion in ''gross terminal revenue,'' which the state defines as money left over after the bettors have taken their winnings but before the casinos have paid salaries, upkeep and other expenses. 
 Casinos will pay out 55 percent of that revenue in taxes, among the highest gambling tax rates in the nation. Of that 55 percent, 34 percent will go to property-tax relief statewide, 12 percent to the horse-racing industry, 5 percent to tourism and economic development funds, and 4 percent to local and county governments where the licenses were awarded. 
 Winning bidders are required to be up and running within two years after receiving final approval, which should come within the next month, when paperwork is completed, said Douglas P. Harbach, a spokesman for the state board.
 The license winners were not the only ones pleased on Wednesday. A group of residents and history enthusiasts who had vigorously opposed a license to open a casino near the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg were elated when they realized they had been successful.
 ''People should never underestimate their power to affect the quality of life in their community,'' said Susan Star Paddock, chairwoman of No Casino Gettysburg, as she hugged some 20 fellow group members who had traveled about an hour to view the vote at the Forum, an auditorium near the Capitol. 
 The Philadelphia licenses were awarded to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, which owns the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, and HSP Gaming. Both groups plan to open casinos along the Delaware River in Philadelphia.
 Don Barden, who owns the Majestic-Star casino chain, wept when it was announced he had been awarded a license to open a casino on the north shore of the Ohio River in Pittsburgh. ''They're tears of joy,'' said Mr. Barden, who turned 63 on Wednesday and said he had never cried over a business announcement before. ''I was so excited,'' he said. ''I was just overwhelmed.''
 One of two at-large licenses, given to operators outside major cities, was awarded to a Pennsylvania businessman, Louis A. DeNaples, who plans to turn Mount Airy Lodge, a former Pocono resort in Paradise Township, into a modern resort, including a casino with 5,000 slot machines. 
 The other at-large license was awarded to the operators of what is to become the Sands BethWorks casino on the site of the former Bethlehem Steel plant in Bethlehem. 
 After hearing the news, Ed Pawlowski, the mayor of Allentown, Bethlehem's neighbor and a competitor for a license, walked dejectedly from the auditorium before the board was finished meeting. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Pawlowski handed out a statement from the mayor that said he was, ''of course, disappointed.''
 Others who were disappointed included Donald J. Trump, whose celebrity status did not help the TrumpStreet casino development team win a license in Philadelphia, and the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team, which had hoped to build a new home arena downtown with $290 million from its casino partner, Isle of Capri. 
 Losing bidders have 30 days to appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but none of them indicated that they were planning to do so.

HEADLINE: G.E. Stock Rises as an Economic Cycle Winds Down

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
GENERAL ELECTRIC'S shares are being brought to life.
 After years of being stuck in the low to mid-30s, they have climbed 7.5 percent in the last week, to close at $38.15 yesterday. And few predict they will fall back anytime soon.
G.E. thinks it is about time. 
 ''We believe the market is seeing what we see -- a company built for the future that is investing and delivering for its shareowners with double-digit earnings growth, expanding margins, strong cash flow and increasing returns,'' said Russell Wilkerson, a G.E. spokesman.
 Maybe so -- but G.E. has been saying that for several years. And analysts have long been part of the chorus. According to Thomson Financial, analysts have had a buy rating on G.E. shares for more than a year. Still, G.E. shares have been mired in the low to mid-30s for nearly two years. 
 But now, investors are bidding them up again. Analysts say G.E.'s newfound attractiveness is as much a function of the global economy as of anything new in company strategy. ''G.E.'s emphasis on services makes it easy to count on predictable, consistent earnings growth, so a portfolio manager who thinks the economy is slowing down is going to want to overweight G.E.,'' said Daniel J. Rosenblatt, an analyst for Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, an investment firm that owns G.E. shares.
 Deane M. Dray, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, put it more succinctly, saying, ''G.E.'s portfolio was built for this stage of the cycle.''
 It is as plausible an explanation as any. After all, it is not as though G.E. has set new strategy or broken news. When Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, played host to analysts in New York on Dec. 12, he pretty much reaffirmed what he had said all year.
 Yes, G.E. will show 2006 earnings of $1.97 to $1.99 a share. Yes, revenue will continue to grow at two to three times the growth rate for the gross domestic product. Yes, it will improve margins and return on invested capital, and increase earnings 10 to 13 percent. Yes, it will finally turn its ailing NBC Universal unit around -- and yes, Vivendi will hold onto its 20 percent stake. And yes, G.E. will continue to concentrate on increasing sales in Europe and developing countries. 
 What little news there was would have been more notable in its absence. For example, G.E. said it would raise its quarterly dividend 12 percent, to 28 cents a share. But G.E. has paid a dividend every year since 1899, and this was the 31st consecutive year in which it raised the amount. ''It would have been a shock if they had not increased the dividend,'' Mr. Dray said. 
 According to Thomson Financial, the consensus among analysts was that G.E. was a good buy before the meeting, and it remained so afterward. ''The fundamental outlook in the portfolio is quite strong,'' Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst at Citigroup who expects G.E. shares to hit $45, wrote to investors. 
 A few rumors may have bumped up the stock. Last week, Mr. Sprague suggested in a research report that G.E. was poised to sell its plastics business, which has been unable to pass along spiking raw material costs with price increases. 
 That rumor has surfaced before, and Mr. Immelt, as is his wont, has never confirmed nor denied it. But where in the past investors have drawn a blank on a possible buyer, this time many are saying that private equity may step up to the plate. 
 ''There's a lot of private equity money around, and if they finally do sell plastics, that could really drive the stock,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. Solaris does not own G.E. shares now, but Mr. Ghriskey said, ''We are continuing to evaluate it as we explore the rumor about a plastics sale.''
 But even if that rumor turns out to be false, G.E. shares are likely to keep moving up. Mr. Dray of Goldman Sachs now rates G.E. a ''conviction buy'' -- the industrial company in which he has the most confidence for near-term stock appreciation. To him and many other analysts, what has really changed, it seems, is not so much G.E. as the economy in which it functions.
 Investors tend to frown on conglomerates, and G.E.'s longstanding refusal to pare itself back to a few businesses has often steered investors away from the stock. In each of the past three years, returns to G.E. shareholders have been 9 percent, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose nearly 11 percent each year. In contrast, shares of other industrial companies -- Mr. Dray mentions Emerson, United Technologies, Danaher and Illinois Tool Works -- have soared.
 But in this type of economy, analysts say, G.E.'s conglomerate status serves as a welcome hedge. 
 Most economists say the American economy is moving into the last gasps of this growth cycle. G.E.'s power generators and aircraft engines, all so-called late-cycle businesses that do well after an extended period of economic growth has forced companies to expand capacity, are still doing robust business. 
 Few analysts expect that to continue much longer. But G.E. has steadily increased the percentage of revenue from services, and even when new-equipment sales slow, analysts expect contracts to maintain existing equipment will start swinging up. 
 Moreover, European economies are strengthening, and countries like China are still in full growth mode. G.E. recently announced a $1 billion deal to sell gas turbines to Saudi Arabia. G.E. is already close to deriving half of its revenue from outside the United States. 
 ''Jeff Immelt has aligned G.E.'s portfolio to perform well in an international economy,'' Mr. Rosenblatt of Marble Harbor said.
 Now, Mr. Immelt can only hope investors will continue to realign their portfolios to include more G.E. stock.

HEADLINE: A Bigger Military? Why, and How? 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''President Wants to Increase Size of Armed Forces'' (front page, Dec. 20):
 President Bush wants more bodies for the armed forces of the United States. How can this be done without reinstituting the draft? 
 I don't know of anyone who would encourage a family member to join the military so long as this administration is steering the mess in Iraq into even deeper trouble.

Dave Walker

Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor: 
 On Tuesday, the president quoted Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying of the war in Iraq: ''We're not winning. We're not losing.'' 
 I thought one of the principal ''lessons of Vietnam'' was that no president wants to lose a war and will go to extraordinary lengths to keep a losing battle going just to avoid the appearance of defeat. 
 President Lyndon B. Johnson knew that the war was a loser yet kept sending more troops. Richard M. Nixon was elected, taking over a war that others had started and escalated, yet refused to bring it to an end -- into his second term -- for the same reason, not to be seen as a loser.
 The history of warfare shows that great leaders know when to retreat. 

Charles Steiner Jr.
Jersey City, Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 President Bush is asking for an increase in our armed forces. Is this a euphemism for creating a perpetual presence of United States might around the world?
 How ironic, even though the United States is the only unmatched military power; no other country is threatening our democratic institutions, as was the case after World War II.
 We have dug ourselves a graveyard in increasing the armed forces at the level of enlisted men and women to satisfy the needs of an evangelical self-righteous politician in a quest of spreading democracy by the gun. 

Brahama D. Sharma
Pismo Beach, Calif., Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 History will be clear and simple about the Iraq war: President Bush inserted American troops between hostile Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, and when the Shiites and Sunnis went to war against each other, President Bush refused to pull out the Americans.

James G. Roberts
Oakland, Calif., Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 Has it occurred to anyone that a better way to spend some of the money we are spending on our military would be to hire young unemployed men in Iraq to rebuild their own country? 
 Over and over, I read that unemployment in Iraq feeds the insurgency. Young men need something constructive to do with their time to keep them out of trouble. 
 The Works Progress Administration worked in this country to relieve the hardship of the Depression. Why wouldn't it work in Iraq?

Beverly Kaiser

To the Editor:
 In ''New Iraq Strategy Emerges: First Security, Then Politics'' (military analysis, Dec. 20), you write, President Bush has ''taken one step that is a prerequisite for any effort to sustain expanded military operations in Iraq: he has signaled his intention to increase the size of the American armed forces.'' 
 In fact, any expansion of the American armed forces is irrelevant to the outcome in Iraq. Recruiting such troops is already nearly impossible; Army recruiters have already significantly lowered their standards and their recruitment goals to keep up the size of today's Army.
 Training the new recruits and exercising them properly would take upward of two years, making them available long after they would be useful in Iraq. 
 The answer in Iraq is not more troops but less. The answer to the Army's dilemma is to begin the withdrawal from Iraq now.

To the Editor:
 Re ''New Iraq Strategy Emerges: Security, Then Politics'': 
 There once was a hulking giant going peacefully about his business. One day he is attacked by bees. The brute can't swat the bees fast enough, so in frustration he attacks his neighbor, who had nothing to do with the bees. 
 The neighbor, angered by this injustice, fights back as best he can against the brute strength of the giant. The situation spirals out of control. 
 The United States in Iraq is like that giant. Do you think that President Bush will ever learn that the Army is not the correct tool for fighting terrorism? Sending more troops to Iraq will just arouse more bees.

HEADLINE: In Iraq, Let's Fight One War at a Time

BYLINE: By Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

 BODY:
ONCE again American officials are growing dissatisfied with an Iraqi government. In Baghdad and in Washington, officials privately and the press publicly suggest that the Bush administration would prefer that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki fell, and that Adil Abdul Mahdi, a French-educated economist who is a vice president, would replace him. Mr. Maliki is politically too dependent, the reasoning goes, on the young Shiite militia leader Moktada al-Sadr, a scion of a prestigious clerical family and the boss of a pivotal bloc of votes in Iraq's Parliament. 
 Mr. Mahdi may look like a good bet for Washington. He is a far more amiable gentleman than Mr. Maliki, and doesn't appear to be emotionally distressed when he is in the company of Americans. His group, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, was created in exile in Iran; its militia, the Badr Organization, has never had a serious clash with the United States military and is less prominent in the sectarian strife than Mr. Sadr's followers, the Mahdi Army. In addition, the Supreme Council's top man, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, has long dealt directly and pleasantly with American officials. 
Since President Bush is now immersed in a top-to-bottom Iraq review, in which a substantial surge of American soldiers into Baghdad seems ever more likely and the Army is again seriously considering directly confronting Mr. Sadr, the appeal of Mr. Mahdi and the Supreme Council may grow in Washington and Baghdad. 
 If so, the administration should nip in the bud such inclinations. Changing the Shiite parts of the Iraqi government and quickly taking on Mr. Sadr would do nothing to end the Sunni insurgency and the holy war of foreign jihadists against the new Iraq. 
 Indeed, such a tack would not likely diminish the appeal or the power of the Mahdi Army, which is largely made up of poor, radicalized young men whose families were brutalized by Saddam Hussein and have been savaged by Sunni Arab fighters since the fall of 2003. 
 Nor would changing prime ministers and confronting Mr. Sadr's militia advance the cause of reconciliation among the Sunni and Shiite Arabs and Kurds, allow the Iraqi government to operate more effectively, or let American troops leave Mesopotamia one day sooner. 
 In fact, attacking Mr. Sadr now and elevating the Supreme Council is likely to accomplish the exact opposite of what we want. And it shouldn't be that hard to see why: the sine qua non for peace in Iraq, and for a democratic future for the country, has always been unity among the Shiites. Any violent struggle between the Mahdi Army and Supreme Council could provoke anarchy throughout the entire Arab Shiite zone, including Iraq's holy cities and the oil-rich south. As bad as things seem now, such Shiite strife could impoverish all of Arab Iraq, dropping the non-Kurdish regions to an Afghan-like subsistence level. 
 In such a situation, we would likely see the hyper-radicalization of the Shiites, who have already become more militant owing to the tenacity and barbarism of the Sunni insurgency. In addition, whatever fraternal and nationalist bonds remain among moderate Sunni and Shiite Arabs would probably disappear in a Shiite-versus-Shiite bloodbath. 
 We would do well not to underestimate how these age-old familial and national ties and sympathies still diminish the sectarian strife. A genocidal Shiite-versus-Sunni conflict in Iraq -- a real possibility -- would be much more likely after an intra-Shiite war that destroys the traditional social and religious hierarchy that has remained vastly stronger among the Shiites than among Sunni Arabs since the American invasion. 
 Yes, the forces of the Supreme Council might be able to beat Mr. Sadr's militia, the Mahdi Army. Trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, the Badr Organization is a serious army that might handle Mr. Sadr's more numerous and passionate supporters. The mullahs in Tehran, who have aided both Mr. Sadr and Mr. Hakim, would probably throw their support to the latter's Supreme Council in the event of all-out war. Such a confrontation, beyond wrecking Iraq politically, would probably allow the worst elements in the Supreme Council -- those who envision a religious dictatorship along the lines of Iran -- to become more powerful within the party. 
 And an American assault on Sadr City, the impoverished Baghdad stronghold of the Mahdi Army, would be militarily and politically counterproductive if undertaken before the United States launches a serious new counterinsurgency against the Sunnis. 
 Even with a substantial surge of soldiers along the lines recommended by Jack Keane, a retired four-star general, and the military historian Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute -- approximately 35,000 more combat troops -- the United States still wouldn't have enough forces to fight a two-front war against the Sunnis and the Shiites, as it briefly did in 2004.
 In Iraq, the United States is much weaker than in 2004. So is Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the moderate bulwark of the Shiite establishment -- so the tentative support he gave yesterday for a plan to isolate Mr. Sadr should be taken with a grain of salt. Because of the nonstop insurgency, Shiite politics are fragile. We absolutely cannot afford to have an American effort to pacify Baghdad be seen as a ''pro-Sunni'' military assault on the capital's densely populated Shiite ghetto. 
 If the administration first focuses militarily on the Sunni insurgency, as called for in the Keane-Kagan plan -- and the press indicates Mr. Bush is taking the two men very seriously -- the United States and the Iraqi government would be better able to diminish sectarian violence. With more troops, we can clear and hold Sunni areas in Baghdad and thereby prevent Shiite militias from streaming out of Sadr City to attack defenseless Sunnis. 
 Shiite militias are clever predators. They fear American power -- the confrontation in Najaf in 2004, during which thousands from the Mahdi Army perished, taught them about the destructive capacity of the American military. If the Americans leave sufficient forces in cleared Sunni areas, they will stay away. But if we pass the holding part of counterinsurgency campaigns to ill-equipped units of the Iraqi Army and to the Iraqi police, who often aid Shiite militias, they will pounce. 
 Only after Baghdad's Sunni neighborhoods are fully secured can the Americans turn their attention to the Shiite quarters, ensuring that American and reliable Iraqi forces control the streets and municipal facilities necessary to sustain city life. We may eventually have to confront militarily the Mahdi forces inside Sadr City, but we want to do this only as the last step in counterinsurgency operations in the capital. 
 Mr. Sadr and his radicalized followers -- temperamentally, they are as much children of Saddam Hussein as are the savage Sunnis who glorify the murder of Americans and Shiite civilians -- are unlikely to become peaceful players in Iraqi politics. But Mr. Sadr's reputation can be reduced and his charisma countered if ordinary Shiites have more moderate alternatives, backed by American power, who can protect them from insurgency-loving Sunnis and death-squad Shiites. 
 It's unclear how Prime Minister Maliki will react to any American effort to diminish Mr. Sadr. His party, Islamic Dawa, is a bundle of mostly militant contradictions. In the end, President Bush may have to ignore the prime minister if the latter sides with Mr. Sadr. 
 And some Shiites, and perhaps most Sunnis, may threaten to walk out of Iraq's government and forsake reconciliation talks if the Americans get serious about pacifying Baghdad and the insurgency elsewhere. Let them. If the city's and country's Shiites, who represent about 65 percent of Iraq's population, see that the Americans are committed to countering the insurgency, any protest from Mr. Maliki or call to arms by Mr. Sadr will have increasingly less power. 
 No, it won't be easy -- but with American and Iraqi troops all over Baghdad and daily life returning to some normality, the situation will certainly be more manageable than what we confront now. The politics of peaceful Shiite consensus, which is what Grand Ayatollah Sistani has tried to advance since 2003, could again rapidly gain ground.
 No progress can be made in Iraq, however, if the Sunni Arabs, who have regrettably embraced the insurgency and holy war in large numbers, are allowed politically to check counterinsurgency operations.
 The key for America is the same as it has been for years: to clear and hold the Sunni areas of Baghdad and the so-called Sunni triangle to the north. There will probably be no political solution among the Iraqi factions to save American troops from the bulk of this task. The sooner we start in Baghdad, the better the odds are that the radicalization of the Iraqi Shiites can be halted. As long as this community doesn't explode into total militia war, Iraq is not lost, and neither is Mr. Bush's presidency.

HEADLINE: Chavez Backs Ecuador in Attacking U.S. Drug War

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela on Wednesday backed Ecuador's president-elect in his criticism of United States-financed spraying of Colombian drug crops, accusing Washington of hypocrisy in its war on drugs. 
 Mr. Chavez also insisted that the United States was using its antinarcotics drive to gain a military foothold in Latin America, and he accused the American envoy in Caracas of lying when he said drug smuggling was soaring in Venezuela.
''The battle against drug smuggling has been an excuse that imperialists have used for several years to penetrate our country, trample our people and justify a military presence in Latin America,'' Mr. Chavez told reporters at Caracas's airport during a visit by the Ecuadorean president-elect, Rafael Correa. 
 ''The big cause is over there, the consumption, the drug money, the banks that launder billions of dollars each year, but no one does anything about it,'' he said.
 Mr. Correa has argued that spraying herbicides on illegal Colombian crops along the Ecuadorean border ruins legal crops and harms people's health on Ecuador's side. Ecuador has withdrawn its ambassador to Bogota in protest. ''Colombia must look for other methods,'' Mr. Chavez said. Colombia insists that the fumigation is safe.
 Mr. Correa has also said he will refuse to extend the lease on a major United States counternarcotics operation based in the Ecuadorean port of Manta, from where American air crews fly missions over Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Mr. Correa, who takes office next month, is part of a growing alliance of leftist leaders in Latin America. During his visit, he and Mr. Chavez were to discuss increasing economic cooperation between the two countries. 
 In his comments on Wednesday, Mr. Chavez said that relations with the Bush administration would be stalled until the United States ambassador in Caracas, William Brownfield, retracted his charge that drug smuggling had soared in Venezuela. Mr. Chavez said that Mr. Brownfield had uttered a ''great lie'' in saying that smuggling had increased in part because Caracas severed cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration last year.

HEADLINE: A Taste of Cuba in California

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A LONG-TERM consequence of Fidel Castro's policies in the early 1960s is a thriving Cuban-emigre-owned food processing industry in the Los Angeles area that serves a growing market nationwide for Hispanic foods. 
 The founders of half a dozen companies that make and distribute beans and rice, specialty groceries, cheeses, coffee and baked goods left Cuba in 1961 and 1962, sometimes through a program called Pedro Pan in which more than 14,000 children were sent to Florida and cared for until their parents could follow.
Miami was crowded at that time with more Cuban immigrants than there were jobs to occupy them, so Catholic Welfare Services and other charitable groups sent some families to California. ''We went to Long Beach where there was a house for us to stay in and my dad had a job to go to in the morning,'' Jorge Rodriguez recalled. His father, Graciliano Rodriguez, went to work waiting tables in a private club and doing janitorial work on a second job. 
 But soon the elder Mr. Rodriguez, who had been a wholesaler of potatoes and onions in Havana, found a way to work for himself in food distribution. He opened a store in the Los Angeles produce market dealing in the kinds of beans, rice and peppers that people from Latin America favored. Today, at 91, Mr. Rodriguez still works daily at the warehouse complex in City of Industry, Calif., that serves as headquarters for Mercado Latino Inc., a company run by his sons and daughter that has become one of the largest processors and distributors of Latin groceries and household goods to the nation's supermarket chains and Wal-Mart Stores. 
 Similarly, C&F Foods Inc., also based in City of Industry, a 49-year-old industrial city east of Los Angeles, was founded in 1975 by a Cuban emigre, Jose Fernandez. It is run today by his grandson Luis Faura and has become a large processor and distributor of beans favored by Latinos: pinto, black, red and others. Beans have grown in popularity with rising appreciation among consumers for their high-fiber, high-protein health attributes and with the growth of Hispanic populations in all parts of the country.
 ''We have a distribution center in North Carolina that supplies the Southeast,'' Mr. Faura said. ''It never was a big market before but now there are people from South America and Mexico and El Salvador in Atlanta and Raleigh and everywhere.'' 
 The list goes on. A Cuban immigrant, Gilbert de Cardenas, started Cacique USA in 1973 and has made it a leading supplier of Mexican-style cheeses. F. Gavina & Sons Inc., named for the Cuban coffee grower Francisco Gavina, has brought robust coffees to supermarkets and McDonald's restaurants. 
 But establishing a business in specialty foods is anything but a slam-dunk. Growing Hispanic markets do not offer a free ride to anyone; to succeed demands determination and investment.
 At Mercado Latino, for example, the distribution of food and other products changed utterly with the growing abilities of information technology. In the company's early days, it served as a middleman for products of many food processors, delivering Hispanic foods and offering shelf-stocking and promotional services to retailers. But to growing supermarket chains like Kroger and Safeway, ''such middlemen services were an added cost they didn't want to pay,'' said Richard Rodriguez, Mercado's marketing vice president.
 ''So,'' he said, ''our company adapted to directly distributing our own branded products through our own warehouse centers.'' 
 Mercado Latino now has nine centers throughout the Western states for processing and distributing 3,500 products. It employs up to 400 full- and part-time workers depending on seasonal needs and has more than $110 million in annual sales.
 ''We invested in information technology -- you can never spend enough money on that,'' Mr. Rodriguez added. He recalled how his father pressed the children in 1975 to buy one of the first I.B.M. System 32 minicomputers to upgrade Mercado Latino's accounting abilities. ''That computer cost more than our company was worth at that time,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. But using it allowed the family to take on more products and spread its operations from Texas to the Canadian border. 
 C&F Foods, meanwhile, has grown to 285 employees and well over $100 million in annual revenue thanks in part to America's increasing demand for organic produce. ''It's a good business, and the profit is there,'' Mr. Faura said. ''But you have to be ready to bear the cost of getting into it.''
 To qualify as an organic food supplier, he explained, a company needs to invest in more costly fertilizers and new machinery for milling and packing the beans. When the organic food phenomenon took off in 2000 or so, he said, ''we debated whether it was a fad or a trend.''
 ''It took almost $8 million of investment,'' Mr. Faura recalled. ''But we decided to go for it, and now we have that first-mover advantage.''
 Still, with all the growth and promise of Hispanic markets, these companies are relatively small compared with food processing giants like Kraft and ConAgra. Will small entrepreneurs face a difficult future? Not yet, said Jorge Rodriguez, chief financial officer of Mercado Latino. ''The big outfits in my opinion are not embracing Latino markets,'' he said. ''They do a lot and say a lot, but marketing to immigrant consumers, whether Latino or Korean or whatever, you need to know what you're doing. If black beans are processed and polished too much, they lose their flavor.'' 
 He is saying, of course, that these are still specialty markets. A vendor needs to know not only which products to offer but how the customers like their native foods. In time immigrant specialties will grow into broad American dietary staples: it has been a long time, for example, since pizza was considered a specifically Italian dish. 
 Being a relatively small family company is no bar to success, Mr. Rodriguez said, ''if you know what to do and be good at it.'' 
 Finally, the younger generations of six Southern California Cuban business families, along with 300 other initial shareholders, backed the newly chartered Americas United Bank in Glendale this year. It is the first Hispanic-led bank in 40 years to be chartered in California, said Gilbert Dalmau, a 49-year-old Cuban-American, longtime banker and chairman.
 ''But don't stress the Cuban aspect,'' Mr. Dalmau said to an interviewer. ''This bank is to serve the whole Hispanic community and all the other small-business communities here.'' 
 The Rodriguezes and other families say their parents emigrated from Cuba 45 years ago because they feared for their children's future. But with hard work and a smart entrepreneurial spirit, the children and their children have made their own futures and brought something new to the whole American economy.

Previews and Openings

'THE SCENE' In previews; opens on Jan. 11. A buzz-maker at the Humana Festival, Theresa Rebeck's new play is about an out-of-work actor who doesn't solve his problems by having an affair. Tony Shalhoub (''Monk'') and Patricia Heaton (''Everybody Loves Raymond'') star (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. 


Broadway

'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley)

'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included.) Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'ANNIE' Daddy Warbucks and some elating musical numbers are the real stars of this holiday-season extravaganza about the beauty, fashion and socioecomic makeover of an eternally optimistic little orphaned redhead (2:30). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-4100. (Anita Gates)

'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)

'CARRIE' This deliberately cheesy comedy version of Stephen King's prom-night horror story has an absurdist attitude, on-target performances and puppets that bleed (1:40). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)

* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)

'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)

'MURDER MYSTERY BLUES' This musical adaptation of classic Woody Allen short stories comes off like a collection of loose parts (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)

'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger)

* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'STRINGS' Keir Dullea stars in Carole Bugge's intelligent but ultimately unsuccessful ''Copenhagen''-inspired drama about three scientists on a train (1:45). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-0329. (Gates)

'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'TRUE WEST' This perfectly pleasant new version of Sam Shepard's sibling rivalry drama tries something new: understatement (1:35). Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

Spectacles

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444); closing tonight. (Isherwood)

'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette)

* 'HOME' Almost nothing happens in David Storey's ''Home'' -- except to those lucky enough to be in the audience, who are likely to find themselves profoundly touched by this portrait of four lost souls in a home for the mentally challenged or disturbed. The play hasn't been seen much since it was on Broadway in 1970, but the Actors Company Theater's production makes you wonder why. The performances by the four leads, Simon Jones, Larry Keith, Cynthia Harris and Cynthia Darlow, are simply exquisite. Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moliere's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing on Sunday. (Gates)

'THE TAKING OF MISS JANIE' This revival of Ed Bullins's 1974 allegory about race relations and lament for the lost ideals of the '60s is well acted and politically elegant (1:25). The Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'THAT TIME OF YEAR' Who would have thought that fruitcake jokes could still be funny? But three singing fruitcakes are among the daffy high points of this original musical revue, which surprises repeatedly by getting laughs from standard-issue seasonal themes both Jewish and Christian. There are clunkers, but you leave feeling that the season's a bit brighter (2:00). Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'APOCALYPTO' (R, 138 minutes, in Maya) More blood from Mel Gibson, but more ''Braveheart'' than ''Passion of the Christ.'' Ultraviolent entertainment, well executed (so to speak) but not very surprising in the end. (A. O. Scott)

'AUTOMATONS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shot in silvery black and white with old eight-millimeter cameras, this shameless ode to '60s sci-fi depicts a blasted future where the few remaining humans wage a remorseless war of competing beliefs. With its retro look, cautionary theme and endearingly unsophisticated effects, ''Automatons'' leaves us with the comforting notion that the end of the world will look a lot like the beginning of television. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)

'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Manohla Dargis)

'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)

* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Dargis)

'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)

'CHARLOTTE'S WEB' (G, 113 minutes) Gary Winick's adaptation of E. B. White's great children's novel is faithful to the wit and feeling of the source. The celebrity-voiced animals are charming, and Julia Roberts is in fine form as the heroic spider, whose writing ability saves the life of a pig. (Scott)

'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' (R, 114 minutes, in Mandarin) The Chinese director Zhang Yimou aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann in this Tang dynasty melodrama roiling with incest, fraternal rivalry and madness-inducing fungus. As an emperor and empress fighting for control of their three sons, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li lend the film a core of marital toxicity that's deliciously unstable. Directing with operatic delirium, Mr. Zhang has created a movie in which the line between tragedy and black comedy has been all but erased. (Catsoulis)

'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)

'DEJA VU' (PG-13, 125 minutes) In Tony Scott's preposterous action flick, with Denzel Washington, the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies. (Dargis)

* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)

'ERAGON' (PG, 99 minutes) This lad-and-his-dragon fantasy set in a land bristling with Tolkienesque nomenclature and earnest British actors is as lacking in fresh ideas as Tim Allen's manager. Directed by the wonderfully named Stefen Fangmeier, it boasts the usual genre lineup: an evil king (John Malkovich), a whey-faced hero (Edward Speleers) and a serene warrior-maiden (Sienna Guillory), as well as the required rebel hordes and bucolic landscapes. Some of the characters won't be returning for the sequel, but no matter. In all likelihood, neither will the audience. (Catsoulis)

'FAMILY LAW' (No rating, 102 minutes, in Spanish) Exploratory variations on that old saw ''Like father, like son'' are the thematic heart of this third installment in the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood. The delicate, bittersweet comedy about the relationship of father-and-son lawyers prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives. (Stephen Holden)

* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expose of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)

* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)

'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer with a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)

* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)

'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar-nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, with the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)

'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)

'THE GOOD GERMAN' (R, 102 minutes) In his adaptation of the Joseph Kanon novel, Steven Soderbergh attempts to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking. It's no wonder George Clooney, who stars alongside a vamping Cate Blanchett, looks confused. (Dargis)

'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)

* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserve to be called art. (Dargis)

'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)

* 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)

* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)

* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)

'MATTHEW BARNEY: NO RESTRAINT' (No rating, 72 minutes) Alison Chernick's aptly-named documentary takes us aboard a Japanese whaling vessel to witness the filming of the artist Matthew Barney's ''Drawing Restraint 9,'' a love story in which he and his partner Bjork dress up, drink tea and transform into whales. But after a meager 72 minutes, the man who stretched an obsession with testicles into a five-film cycle remains as much of an enigma as ever. (Catsoulis)

'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earthshaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)

'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel lulls you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)

'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)

'ROCKY BALBOA' (PG, 102 minutes) Surprisingly, the sixth installment of this franchise is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners, it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility, except as a raw-boned fable. From the very beginning Rocky Balboa was about as lifelike a character as Popeye pumped up with spinach. But that may be the point of a series that peddles the notion that if you dream it hard enough, you can live it. (Holden)

'THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS' (No rating, 87 minutes) The heart and soul of this movie is the shattering 10-minute confession of a mysteriously glum, hearing-impaired young woman (Sarah Polley) to a burn victim (Tim Robbins) she is nursing on an oil rig in the Irish Sea. The strongest moments in the film, are those that focus on the central couple. (Holden)

* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)

'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)

'UNACCOMPANIED MINORS' (PG, 89 minutes) The title doubles as an advisory. Your kids may like it; pick them up when it's over. (Scott)

'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)

* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodovar, with Penelope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

JAI AGNISH, BEN AND VESPER, LENNY SMITH (Thursday) A night in Brooklyn with three underground songwriters from New Jersey. Mr. Agnish, an accomplice of Sufjan Stevens and a sincere indie-rock Christian, sings guilelessly about his faith (he gives a ''thumbs-up to Jesus'') in songs that join acoustic folk with jerky, silly electronics. The male-female duo Ben and Vesper play droopy, forlorn acoustic ballads, and the gospel-folk singer Lenny Smith might be called the father of the scene: his son is Daniel Smith, leader of the perhaps-sincere, perhaps-mocking Christian band Danielson Famile. At 9 p.m., Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Ben Sisario)

BENEVENTO-RUSSO DUO (Wednesday) The keyboardist Marco Benevento and the drummer Joe Russo have had a gradual rise on the jam-band circuit with kinetic meanderings that usually begin in peaceful soul-funk and end up in poundingly insistent climaxes that might as well be punk rock. They play a fifth-anniversary show at the Knitting Factory's tiny downstairs Old Office. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $25. (Sisario)

BOGMEN (Tonight and tomorrow night) The fence-mending reunion thing worked well for '90s alternative giants like the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., so what about the littler guys? A decade ago, the Bogmen were one of the biggest local draws in New York, mingling cynical lyrics with propulsive guitar riffs and funk rhythms. It was textbook alt-rock, but the Bogmen struggled to find a national audience and disbanded in 1999. The band's three-night return concludes this weekend. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)

BOUNCING SOULS, WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETy (Thursday) Bouncing Souls, the punk kings of New Jersey, have been going strong for nearly two decades and show no signs of slowing down. Their latest album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is, like each one before it, chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. The World/Inferno Friendship Society's ''red-eyed soul'' is a snarky mix of ska, punk and horn-driven retro R&B. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $16. (Sisario)

DAVID BROZA (Sunday) The Israeli songwriter David Broza has recorded songs in Hebrew, English and Spanish, singing earnestly and playing virtuosic guitar that connects the Middle East, flamenco and rock. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $45 and $65. (Jon Pareles)

THOMAS DOLBY, BT (Tomorrow) Thomas Dolby entered pop eternity in the guise of a wild-haired mad scientist, with the 1983 novelty hit ''She Blinded Me With Science.'' This year he returned after a long absence -- in his other life he has been an innovative creator of ring tones -- largely in the same gearhead persona (sans the hair). He shares a bill with BT, the king of garish house music. At 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100, canalroom.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)

ELYSIAN FIELDS (Tonight) Elysian Fields plays languid songs that sound best in a late-night haze, as Jennifer Charles's breathy voice hints at decadence and vulnerability while Oren Bloedow wraps the songs in slinky, deadpan guitar. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Pareles)

FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. For these two concerts, it will perform the White Album. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $35, sold out Wednesday. (Sisario)

* MICHAEL FEINSTEIN (Tonight and tomorrow night, Tuesday through Thursday) The strongest incarnation so far of the singer and pianist's annual holiday bash, ''Home for the Holidays,'' a live variety show featuring a six-member band and three backup vocalists, is a perfect showcase for Mr. Feinstein to balance his two sides: a gregarious stand-up entertainer and an intimate crooner dreaming out loud. (Through Dec. 30.) At 8:30, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover and $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)

FISHBONE (Thursday) Starting in the mid-'80s, this willfully manic Los Angeles group took up George Clinton's challenge that funk bands can play rock as well as anybody, and threw in ska, punk and metal, too, becoming a primary influence on generations of genre-jumbling bands. The current version of Fishbone includes only two original members, the bassist John Norwood Fisher and the top-hatted wild-man singer Angelo Moore, who could not possibly be replaced. With Shootyz Groove, Eclectic Collective and Butterbrain. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)

GOSPEL (Wednesday) As in the gospel of dense, throaty hardcore, ecumenically mingled with the complex prog-metal of the Mars Volta. With Ultra Dolphins, Birthday Boyz and Capsule. At 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario)

PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tuesday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer a meat-and-potatoes program of ''classic rock favorites.'' At 7 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $15. (Sisario)

GREY DOES MATTER (Tonight) Before he acquired his current band, Jason Crawford, the polymath who records as Grey Does Matter, used to take a reprogrammed Nintendo Gameboy along with him to help perform his spare, guitar-synthesizer songs of disconnection and boyish obsession (''The wind gets in and burns the skin like a battleground super ninja''). At 9:30, with Tall Hands and Hello Nurse, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8. (Sisario)

HADAG NAHASH (Sunday) Hip-hop has reached every corner of the planet, including Israel, where the personal inevitably becomes political. ''Nine is the number of times I was too close to a terrorist attack,'' goes one song by this Jerusalem group, one of the most popular in Israel, whose name translates as Snake Fish. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40 and $55. (Sisario)

HATEBREED (Thursday) Like a restaurant that serves only one dish, Hatebreed, a veteran metalcore band from New Haven, sticks steadfastly to a hyper-aggressive churn of mosh-ready guitar riffs and barked vocals that all seem to have one message: ''Destroy everything/Decimate what threatens me.'' Hey, it's more consistent than Denny's. Also on the bill are Sick of It All, Suffocation, Crowbar, Full Blown Chaos and Subzero. At 7 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)

'JEWLTIDE 4' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Jewish musicians have no better promotional gimmick than Christmas, and JDub Records, an independent label devoted to innovative Jewish pop (it gave Matisyahu his start), is not missing the opportunity for this quick tour, which comes to Brooklyn this weekend. Tomorrow features the power-pop LeeVees, whose signature song is ''How Do You Spell Hanukkah?''; Tim Fite, whose songs about ''kicking every can in New York City'' go from clean country to aggressive noise; and the comedian Michael Schowalter. Sunday is Golem, which plays rockish arrangements of Eastern European folk songs, and the D.J. SoCalled. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $12 in advance or $15 at the door tomorrow, $18 in advance or $25 at the door on Sunday. (Sisario)

JEFFREY LEWIS (Tuesday) A veteran of the scruffy antifolk circuit that produced the Moldy Peaches and Regina Spektor, Jeffrey Lewis has a severe case of logorrhea that is not confined to his music.

MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) A hitmaker with a rich, confident voice and that most important pop-country qualification, malleability, Ms. McBride concludes her ''Joy of Christmas'' tour, a multimedia spectacle of standards and carols in which, as one of the show's producers has said, ''one minute you're in a quaint village underneath a Christmas tree, the next minute you're in Bethlehem crossing the desert and the next you have a World War II, Bob Hope/Bing Crosby vibe.''

(Chinen)

BOB DOROUGH (Tomorrow) For the generation that came of age in the 1970s Mr. Dorough is best known as the tunesmith behind the more slyly informative ditties on ''Schoolhouse Rock.''

DAVID (FATHEAD) NEWMAN AND DR. LONNIE SMITH (Tonight through Sunday) David Newman, the soulful tenor saxophonist long associated with Ray Charles, joins Dr. Lonnie Smith, whose unaccredited honorific has always been justified by his authority on the Hammond organ.

Opera

* 'DON CARLO' (Tomorrow) The powerhouse tenor Johan Botha is a hefty man and a stiff actor. But he certainly brings the vocal goods to the title role of Verdi's noble masterpiece ''Don Carlo,'' in John Dexter's production at the Metropolitan Opera. The winning cast includes Patricia Racette as Elisabeth, Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo, Olga Borodina as Eboli and the astounding German bass Rene Pape as Philip II. James Levine conducts the score magnificently. The final performance of the season is tomorrow afternoon. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)

'THE FIRST EMPEROR' (Tuesday) A rare sighting: new opera at the Met. Tan Dun's East-West fusion promises all the bells and whistles of a grand opera spectacle. Let's hope for the music, too. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland)

'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its tiny quarters on the Bowery. Now on offer is Strauss's merry ''Fledermaus,'' performed with a rotating cast. The quality often varies, but the spirit is usually there.

* 'I PURITANI' (Wednesday) It's been a while since an opera singer reached such heights that she entered the popular consciousness, but the soprano Anna Netrebko is embarked on a dizzying, meteoric rise. It's a worthy package: she's got the looks, she's got the voice, and when she's onstage, the emotional aloofness that marked her earlier aria albums is replaced with dramatic involvement. This season she is taking on, for the first time onstage, two of the bel canto roles featured on her 2004 album ''Sempre Libera'': Anina in Bellini's ''Sonnambula'' in Vienna and Elvira in the same composer's ''Puritani'' at the Met now. Eric Cutler is her Arturo, John Relyea is Giorgio and Patrick Summers conducts. But Anna is the main attraction: for bel canto fans, long accustomed to a starvation diet from the Met, it should be a wonderful holiday present. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette)

'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos Alvarez has taken over the title role in this Metropolitan Opera revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production, which has its final performance of the season tonight. In his debut appearances at the Met, the young Polish tenor Piotr Beczala sings the rakish Duke of Mantua. The technically exquisite, if expressively timid, soprano Ekaterina Siurina sings Gilda. Friedrich Haider conducts. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining. (Tommasini)

'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) This revival of Julie Taymor's production continues tomorrow at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and convincing Pamina. Scott Bergeson conducts a cast that also includes Christoph Strehl as Tamino, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno, Cornelia Gotz as Queen of the Night, Stephen Milling as Sarastro and Robert Lloyd as the speaker. On Thursday, James Levine conducts and the mesmerizing German bass Rene Pape sings Sarastro. Tomorrow at 8:30, Thursday at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $220 tickets remaining tomorrow; sold out on Thursday. (Schweitzer)

(Kozinn)

'MESSIAH' (Tomorrow) Handel's oratorio is so ubiquitous in these parts at this time of year that it should be no surprise it's made the Guinness World Records book: the Masterwork Chorus, founded in 1955, has given the most complete performances of the work. Quality, not quantity, of course, should be the benchmark, but the experience means that the group, based in New Jersey and conducted by Andrew Megill, can be relied on to turn out a pretty good show. Kiera Duffy, Leah Wool, Tony Boutte and Steven Condy are the vocal soloists. At 3 and 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $100. (Midgette)

NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA (Sunday and Thursday) A tradition is a habit that people like. It is also a good description of the New York String Orchestra's Christmas Eve concert at Carnegie Hall. In the first of two evenings (the second is Thursday), young players from the United States and Canada led by Jaime Laredo will offer an all-Mozart program. Mr. Laredo will also play the viola next to Jennifer Koh on violin in the E-flat Sinfonia Concertante.

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to happen. This artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Benjamin Genocchio)

Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum : 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. This ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design as a whole, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas, sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velazquezes and Zurbarans and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalis and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velazquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)

* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (See above.) (Smith)

* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' through March 4. Saul Steinberg's famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Grace Glueck)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here looming majestically over brownstones and in another incarnation, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951) portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Glueck)

* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Mr. Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Glueck)

Queens Museum of Art: 'Queens International 2006: Everything All at Once,' through Jan. 14. The 52 artists and two collaboratives in this exhibition are natives of various regions of North America, as well as Bosnia, China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Peru and Venezuela. The only common ground, perhaps, is that they all live in Queens. Instead of arranging the work according to medium, ethnicity or generalized themes, the curators follow the edict of the exhibition's subtitle. The exhibition tries to balance the interests of the art crowd and local residents. Sometimes these concerns dovetail nicely, as in Sophia Peer's quick-cut video ''Everyday,'' which shows her aging parents moving around their cramped home in Queens like latter-day, empty-nest Bunkers. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, www.queensmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)

Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for this modest-size first-time United States survey of designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)

Galleries: Uptown

* 'AMERICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE MUNSON-WILLIAMS-PROCTOR ARTS INSTITUTE' This Utica, N.Y., institution, celebrating its educational alliance with New York City's Pratt Institute, is showing more than 75 paintings, drawings, sculptures and furniture pieces, from the 18th to the 20th centuries. A highlight is the original version of Thomas Cole's moving allegory ''The Voyage of Life'' (1839-40), which in four monumental canvases compares the journey from childhood to old age with the winding course of a river. A smashing portrait of the Revolutionary War general Peter Gansevoort (about 1794) by Gilbert Stuart is a distinguished entry from the earlier part of the show. Post-WorldWar II paintings by Pollock and Rothko add to the buzz. Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810, hirschlandadler.com, through Dec. 29. (Glueck)

* 'THE ODYSSEY CONTINUES: MASTERWORKS FROM THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART AND FROM PRIVATE NEW ORLEANS COLLECTIONS' Nearly 100 European and American objects covering six centuries, from the New Orleans Museum of Art but also from private lenders, are displayed. They range from the Venetian-born Lorenzo Lotto, whose forceful study of an authoritative figure, ''Portrait of a Bearded Man'' (1530-35), is a highlight, to works by contemporary Americans. A showstopper is a full-length portrait of Marie Antoinette (about 1788) by Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, in which the doomed French queen wears an enormous feathered concoction on the head she was eventually to lose. Sculptures by Rodin, Brancusi, Louise Bourgeois and Louise Nevelson are also part of the treasures on view. The show is a benefit for the New Orleans Museum, whose building -- though not its art -- was battered by Hurricane Katrina. Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, wildenstein.com, through Feb. 9. (Glueck)

Last Chance

DENNIS BALK: HAShISH Abstract Expressionism meets Graffiti photography. Cy Twombly in Cyberspace. Existential physics. The trajectories of car bombs. These phrases came to mind in front of Dennis Balk's garbled computer-generated drawings on canvas and digitally mixed color photographs. Randomness, violence and information overload are intimated with a handful of portrait-snapshots of Arab men, taken at a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, functioning as still points. Michael Steinberg Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-6232, michaelsteinbergfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

DAVID BATES This Texas painter's 14th New York solo show since 1983 features still lifes that bristle like carpentered objects, bayou swampscapes that make nature seem both beautiful and doomed, and portraits of angry Gulf Coast residents (taken from television) who got the short end of the stick when Hurricane Katrina passed through. The residents bring into the open the smoldering aggression that always keeps Mr. Bates's canvases from sitting quietly on the wall and give it the force of immediate human emotions and events. D. C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes today. (Smith)

SLATER BRADLEY: 'THE ABANDONMENTS' This show features six new, contemplative video works. In ''Dark Night of the Soul'' (2005-6), which invokes Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a figure in a space suit is shown wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, (212) 279-9219, teamgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)

Nathan Carter On the surface, Mr. Carter's work is all about communication, transportation and networks. Big, sprawling sculptures and rough collages recreate the hectic spaghetti of subway lines and the intricate wiring of radio circuitry. The work itself cultivates the look of the amateur, the hobbyist with a ham radio or a backyard workshop and a jigsaw churning out crudely built constructions that look as if they might topple over at any second. At the same time, there's an offhanded vapidity to these references that suggests they are little more than visual candy for the graphically attuned eye. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes today. (Schwendener)

* JOHN CURRIN The leading bad boy of figurative painting is trying his best to be even more provocative. While he usually paints in series, here he has many options under consideration: pornography, romance, still life, portraits of all kinds. The result is a Currin medley that functions as a kind of installation brought off with a new, somewhat vacuous facility. But the paintings with the most Currinesque goofiness and distortions are still the best. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com; closes today. (Smith)

CHRIS DUNCAN: THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF PINK AND BROWN In his New York debut, this young artist from Oakland, Calif., continues the tradition of men who draw (and glue) by sewing that dates back at least to Alan Shields. His richly colored, semi-abstract works on paper, sometimes sewn together into expansive surfaces, combine geometric structures with scattered drips, accrue into playful but quietly magnetic melanges of decorative and mystical, and East and West. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, baileygallery.com; closes today. (Smith)

ALLAN McCOLLUM: THE SHAPES PROJECT Long interested in works that question notions of originality and invention, Mr. McCollum has devised a computer program that could eventually generate a unique abstract motif for everyone in the world. In the meantime, he has produced and framed 7,056 of them (at small scale) and arranged them on a floor-to-ceiling ramp with 98 steps. The effect -- a stadium full of art looking at you, the viewer -- is quite amazing. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* GEORGE ORTMAN: EARLY CONSTRUCTIONS, NEW SCULPTURE In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Ortman combined paint, canvas, plaster and wood into geometric reliefs whose every element was physically discrete. Hailed as exemplary ''specific objects'' by Donald Judd, they took some tips from Jasper Johns's flag and target paintings and gave others to Judd's own work. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6242, mitchellalgus.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

STEPHEN PRINA: THE SECOND SENTENCE OF EVERYTHING I READ IS YOU A quietly delirious multimedia environmental listening lounge that incorporates on painting, sculpture, design, appropriation, music and performance as well as its own shipping crates. The choral music, written and recorded by the artist and incorporating phrases from writing on art and economics, is especially nice. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* TL SOLEIN: INSULATUS In these large, ingeniously made works on paper, which combine stenciling, bright cutout collage and washy fields of color, Mr. Solein brings his considerable pictorial sense to bear on ''Moby-Dick.'' He borrows from 19th-century illustration and folk art as well as personal memory, creating intimate stage-set-like scenes that can evoke anything from puppet shows to Cubism. The results frequently dazzle and sustain comparison with equally well-sourced but better-known paper wizards, from Donald Baechler to Jockum Nordstrom. Luise Ross Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161, luiserossgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Generosity on Display: An Artful Give and Take

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Better get busy with that checkbook. The season for giving is as brief as its days are short. Then it's back to that other season, the long one of earning, saving, spending, claiming what's ours.
 What's ours? ''With one hand I take thousands of rubles from the poor, and with the other I hand back a few kopecks,'' wrote Tolstoy late in his life, when he was in despair about how life worked and how he, rich and famous, master of servants and serfs, had lived it. In the end he wanted nothing. He wanted to give back everything, give everything away.
 Generosity means different things to different people. For some it's a fixed sum, a payment of moral dues; an act of charity. For others it's qualified; a negotiated transaction: I will do this for you now if you will do that for me later. For still others it is a frame of mind, an ethical condition, a sustained discipline. For them giving may be pleasurable, but it is never optional. In a world with unfathomable disparities in fortune, generosity is simply justice. 
 In Vietnam in the mid-1960s, some 200 civilians were at one point trapped between battling South Vietnamese and Vietcong forces and seemed to be doomed to die in the crossfire. Suddenly a band of 18 monks and nuns appeared -- unarmed and politically unaligned -- and walked into the combat zone. The shooting stopped. They escorted the civilians to safety. The Buddhists had given the right gift to the right people at the right time and asked nothing in return. If there is such a thing as a perfect gift, that is it.
 The kinds of generosity we most often encounter -- present-giving, hospitality, companionship -- are of course far less dramatic, but in some ways they are more complicated. And art has a lot to say about these complications, as a holiday visit to New York museums can reveal. 
 You could actually think of museums as ultra-exclusive gift shops. Mostly they contain luxury-item presents exchanged between privileged parties in the past, usually for calculated rewards. Even simpler, humbler offerings came with a price tag. 
 Shaker ''gift drawings,'' small ink-and-watercolor designs combining symbolic forms and words in minuscule script, were produced by the hundreds during a few years in the mid-19th century, a time the celibate Shaker sect was losing members and feeling an urgent need to return to historical roots. The drawings -- a fine example is on view at the American Folk Art Museum this winter -- took the form of spiritual billets-doux sent from long-dead Shaker ancestors, including the sect's charismatic 18th-century founder, Ann Lee, to members of the living community through the medium of artists. 
 They are appealing things, like valentines exchanged by sweethearts or family. But these unasked-for gifts were not really free. Their purpose was to emotionally reinforce commitment to Shaker membership. In their dainty fashion they demanded loyalty. ''Be encouraged to keep my way,'' exhorts the drawing in the museum. It is signed, ''from your loving Mother Ann.'' 
 Liberality is often manipulative, entangled in contractual twists and turns. By all means, pray to the Tibetan Buddhist god of wealth, Jambhala, who holds court at the Rubin Museum of Art these days, for that magic Lotto number. But know that he's part of an elaborate system of karmic checks and balances in which avarice is inevitably punished, by Jambhala himself in payback mode, and acts of selfless generosity may actually win you the jackpot.
 But selflessness is, to say the very least, rare. Most giving exacts compensation. A sensational headdress, with glinting shell inlay and an eagle-down fringe, in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian, and a dance mask at the Brooklyn Museum must once have charmed guests at lavish feasts that the elite Tlingit families of Canada staged for one another. These purse-draining bashes could last for weeks but were worth the cost. They reinforced the social hierarchy, reasserted the political might of the host and promised reciprocal no-expense-spared celebrations. 
 Hospitality on a smaller, more casual scale may be less overtly about politics, though if art is part of the mix, matters of power, who has it, who doesn't, are never far away. A splendid porcelain wine jar at the Brooklyn Museum probably served as the visual centerpiece for gatherings of noble friends in 14th-century China. Literate and sophisticated, they would have admired its faultless craftsmanship and understood the flatteringly inside joke embedded in its imagery: its fish-and lotus design is a rebus for the phrase ''honest and incorruptible.'' Drink deeply of good fellowship! may be the basic message of this convivial, coded object's message. But it also encourages you to congratulate yourself on your learning, your wealth and your taste in classy pots. 
 Usually when people refer to generosity, they are thinking of personal largess, though this too seldom comes without strings attached; it is usually rooted in a desire for recompense, material or psychic. Some would say that generosity propelled by self-interest -- what Buddhists call the ''I''-habit -- is not generosity at all. The magnanimous all too easily see themselves, not their blessings, as large. The Shakers understood this delusion and offered a corrective in what they called Humility songs. 
 Great I, little i, Great I can see.
 Little i is pretty i, so little I will be.
 Little i is pretty i, and little i is free.
 Little i is pretty i, so little i will be.
 Yet it is worth remembering that the ego, so uncharitably self-protective, includes memory and imagination, the plenteous sources of art. Marc Chagall's ''I and the Village,'' at the Museum of Modern Art, draws enchantingly on both. Conceived in a kind of pixilated version of Cubism -- not autopsical slicings-up, only gently curving intersections -- it is a vision of the Russia of Chagall's childhood as a larky paradise where gravity has no pull.
 Here personal and communal generosity feel mutually reflected, as they certainly are in a wooden feast ladle tucked away in the Metropolitan Museum's galleries of Africa art. Carved by Dan artists of Ivory Coast, such a spoon was awarded by a community to a woman deemed large-spirited to an exceptional degree. Carried in ceremonies, it became a public emblem of her virtue, and she became a model to learn from. 
 Teaching itself, as a profession or avocation, can be a form of amplitude, a nurturing. The artist Joseph Beuys (1921-86), for whom the political and the aesthetic were inseparable, once said that he considered his teaching to be his finest work of art. The careers of his many extraordinary students, among them Rosemarie Trockel and Imi Knoebel, support that self-assessment. 
 Beuys's spirit remains active in recent art based on collaboration, social intervention and on an economy of sharing and gift-giving. Rirkrit Tiravanija's hospitality-based art of the 1990s offered free meals and shared shelter. William Pope.L's peripatetic ''Black Factory'' operates out of a truck to take issues of racial difference on the road. It recently pulled into the South Bronx, and you'll find its traces in a 25th-anniversary show at Longwood Arts Project. 
 Finally there are collectives, many now. One called Gelatin makes handcrafted art on demand and then gives it away; another, LTTR, approaches artmaking on a workshop model, with a broad-based criteria of expertise. If you show up, you are in. 
 Even at its most idealistic, though, art is never innocent, and given the tenacity of the ego, generosity cannot be pure. Tolstoy, who denounced his own art and life, was tormented by this reality. And reality it seems to be. Surely even those Buddhist monks and nuns, walking into the face of fire, had some gainful motive -- though what on earth could it be? -- for doing so. 
 And I had a motive for writing all this. It was to be able to present one of my favorite poems as a holiday gift (though it's good for any season). You probably know it. It's ''Love (III)'' by the 17th-century English poet George Herbert, preacher, poet, modest man. You can take it as a religious allegory or as an overheard everyday conversation. Herbert wouldn't have cared; he was generous that way. Here it is:
 Love bade me welcome. Yet my soul drew back
 Guilty of dust and sin.
 But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
 From my first entrance in,
 Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,
 If I lacked anything.
 A guest, I answered, worthy to be here:
 Love said, You shall be he.
 I the unkind, ungrateful? Ah my dear,
 I cannot look on thee.
 Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,
 Who made the eyes but I?
 Truth Lord, but I have marred them: let my shame
 Go where it doth deserve.
 And know you not, says Love, who bore the blame?
 My dear, then I will serve.
 You must sit down, says Love, and taste my meat:
 So I did sit and eat.

HEADLINE: Housing Lag Contributed to Lethargic Economic Growth in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The economy grew more sluggishly this summer than initially thought, as a sharp contraction in the housing market held overall growth down to barely a third of the pace recorded at the beginning of the year.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the gross domestic product, the nation's output of goods and services, grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, from July through September. The department's earlier estimate for the period, issued last month, was 2.2 percent.
After roaring along at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter, growth in the gross domestic product has slowed considerably this year. Growth fell to 2.6 percent in the second quarter, and many economists expect the fourth quarter to be no better. 
 The economy showed further signs of lethargy yesterday as the Conference Board reported that its outlook for growth over the next several months -- a gauge that considers everything from the labor market to stock prices -- rose just 0.1 percent this month. In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported yesterday that its index of business activity in the mid-Atlantic dropped unexpectedly in November. 
 The news sent stock prices into retreat yesterday, with the Dow off 42 points and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite both slipping moderately. Bond prices rose by the most in three weeks, a sign that investors expect economic growth to weaken further.
 The biggest reason for the slowdown in the third quarter was contraction in the housing market. A drop in residential construction subtracted 1.2 percentage points from the overall growth rate. That was slightly more than the government first reported, and reflected the sharpest decline in building activity in 15 years.
 Slower consumer spending on services and a rise in imports also contributed to the downward revision to third-quarter G.D.P.
 ''Clearly, the housing downturn is even worse than we've been thinking,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist with Global Insight. ''But the good news is, so far, it doesn't seem to have spilled over into other parts of the economy.''
 Spending by consumers, businesses and government remained strong in the third quarter, and corporate profits almost tripled from the second quarter. A belief that the effects of the housing slowdown will not be widespread is one of the reasons economists expect economic growth to remain in the black next year.
 But whether economic growth will slow so much that the Federal Reserve will consider lowering interest rates is far from clear. Many investors and economists are expecting the central bank to start reducing rates sometime in the first half of 2007, but the Fed has so far sounded a hesitant and cautionary note on growth, while keeping its attention mainly on lingering threats of inflation. 
 ''There's a good chance the Fed might take out some insurance, but we see the probability of a soft landing as quite good,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, an economist with Bank of America, who said he believed the Fed would lower interest rates only once next year. 
 The G.D.P. report showed that price increases, too, may be starting to cool. A broad measure of inflation that is closely watched by the Fed, known as the core personal consumption expenditures index, rose 2.2 percent in the third quarter, compared with a 2.7 percent rise in the second quarter. The Fed considers any reading over 2 percent to be too high for comfort.
 Separately, the number of people filing unemployment claims rose 9,000, to 315,000 last week. The four-week jobless claims moving average fell to 325,750, which compares with 327,750 last week.

HEADLINE: Thai Stocks And Currency Reflect an EbbIn Confidence

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Thai financial markets resumed a downward slide Thursday as investor concern grew that the financial policies of the military-appointed government were in disarray.
 After imposing capital controls Monday and then lifting most of them the next day when stock prices plunged 15 percent, Thai officials were working to convince markets that the decisions were consistent and that the government had not overruled the central bank. 
 ''This isn't a policy flip-flop,'' Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said in Bangkok, speaking for the first time on the matter. Mr. Surayud said he supported the central bank's Monday decision, calling the revisions announced by the finance minister a modification, not a reversal.
 But his reassurances only deepened concern about the future of foreign investment in Thailand in the wake of the September coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a prominent executive.
 ''If Thaksin had been there, this wouldn't have happened,'' said Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at CIMB-GK Research in Singapore. ''Being a business person in charge of listed companies, he would have known what the effect would be.''
 The benchmark Thai stock index, after rebounding Wednesday by 11 percent, dropped 15.45 points on Thursday, or 2.23 percent, to close at 676.10, and analysts blamed declining confidence. The Thai currency, the baht, lost 1.6 percent against the dollar in Asian trading, then rebounded somewhat in New York to settle down slightly from Wednesday at 36.50 to the dollar.
 The central bank imposed the capital controls to stem a surge of speculative flows into the country, particularly in the bond market. Economists said policy makers in Bangkok and elsewhere in the region had few other options to alleviate the pressure on currencies from these short-term capital flows. 
 ''The best thing to do is probably to keep doing what the Chinese are doing,'' said James McCormack, senior director at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong. To keep its currency linked to the dollar, China buys dollars coming into the country, paying with newly minted currency, which in turn pushes down the value of the Chinese yuan. This process helped swell China's foreign currency reserves to more than $1 trillion in October. 
 Other Asian central banks already pursue this policy to some extent. Japan has $897 billion in reserves, Taiwan has $265 billion and South Korea, $234 billion. Reserves in Thailand have risen to $62.3 billion.
 Ultimately, economists say, the solution for Asians is to wean themselves away from too much reliance on exports by reducing state influence in their economies and stimulating private investment in goods and services for domestic use. This is something Asian leaders have pledged to do since the financial crisis of 1997-98, but have yet to fully achieve. It would bolster imports and production, enabling nations like Thailand to grow economically.
 ''If we do a proper job of investing in ourselves,'' said Supavud Saicheua, an economist at Phatra Securities in Bangkok, ''we can live with a stronger baht.''
 On Thursday, in a piece of positive data, the government said that exports grew 20.7 percent in November from a year earlier, for a record monthly surplus of $1.74 billion.

HEADLINE: Tensions Flare Over Custody In Rape Case In Philippines

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
The commander of American forces in the Pacific announced Thursday that he had canceled a huge annual military exercise with the Philippines in a dispute over custody of a marine lance corporal convicted of raping a local woman.
 The commander, Adm. William J. Fallon, said he also would halt aid and reconstruction programs carried out by the American military in the Philippines until he was confident that the troops' legal rights would be protected under bilateral agreements governing visiting United States forces.
The bilateral pact that governs American forces in the Philippines, the Visiting Forces Agreement, requires that American military personnel be held in American custody during criminal proceedings, including appeals, until a final resolution of the matter. 
 But after Lance Cpl. Daniel Smith was convicted of rape and sentenced early this month, a judge ordered him held in local police custody even though his case went straight to appeal.
 The rape case, which concluded Dec. 4 with a conviction and a sentence of 40 years in prison, has tested relations between the countries and challenged the validity of the bilateral agreement. It also has sharpened a political division between Filipinos with nationalist resentments and those with affection for the former colonial power -- or at least those who cite the economic and security benefits of ties to the United States.
 In a telephone interview from Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii, Admiral Fallon said that he already had ordered the withdrawal of an aid team in the Philippines that was assessing needs of a typhoon-ravaged area. He said that he also had canceled a number of visits by American ships.
 American military officers said the Philippines armed forces supported the legal position of the United States, and the political officer at the Philippine Embassy in Washington agreed Thursday that the United States' position was correct.
 ''Regarding the Corporal Smith case, the United States government and the executive branch of the Philippines government are on the same side of this issue,'' said Patricia Paez, the embassy's political officer here. ''We believe Corporal Smith should be in the custody of the U.S. Embassy because of the terms and conditions of the Visiting Forces Agreement.''
 Ms. Paez said that responsibility for the dispute rested with the judicial branch of her government, and that her nation's president and Parliament were constrained on ending the dispute.
 ''Just like the United States, we have a separation of branches of government that are co-equal and independent,'' Ms. Paez said. ''We are making our best efforts to make sure the provisions of the Visiting Forces Agreement are enforced.''
 In a decision with repercussions for regional counterterrorism efforts, Admiral Fallon said he had canceled the field exercise portions of this year's bilateral military exercise, which was to begin in coming weeks and was to involve 4,700 American military personnel and 3,000 from the Philippines.
 The annual exercise has taken on greater significance since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as the Philippines battles internal terrorist threats.
 ''I'm not the judge of the guilt or innocence of the individual,'' Admiral Fallon said. ''The issue is only one of custody. I am responsible to our people in uniform. I have to have guarantees that I can trust their safety to an international agreement.''
 The cancellation of the exercise and other American military visits to the Philippines jeopardizes disease-prevention programs, water-purification efforts, and more broadly, counterterrorism cooperation between the nations.
 The rape case dates from Nov. 1, 2005, when, according to testimony at the trial, four marines from Okinawa who were in the Philippines for training took a 22-year-old woman from a bar where they had met to a van, where one of them raped her.
 During the trial, Lance Corporal Smith did not deny having sex with the woman, but said it was consensual. The court heard testimony that the woman was so drunk that she could not have agreed to sex, with one witness saying Lance Corporal Smith had carried her to the van.

HEADLINE: Arizona Displaces Nevada As Fastest-Growing State

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; John Dougherty contributed reporting from Tempe, Ariz.

 BODY:
An influx from California helped make Arizona the fastest-growing state, displacing Nevada for the first time in nearly two decades, according to census figures released yesterday.
 At the same time, North Carolina delivered an indignity to New Jersey, bumping it from the ranks of the 10 most-populous states for the first time since the 1920 census. [The Metro Section, B3.]
Refugees fleeing Hurricane Katrina cost Louisiana 5 percent of its population, swelling the count in Texas and Georgia. As a result, Louisiana is likely to lose one of its seven seats in the House of Representatives, according to a study by Election Data Services, a Washington consulting firm. 
 And after nine years in the top spot, New York is no longer losing more people to migration than any other state. This past year, more people moved from California and Louisiana than from New York. Nonetheless, a continued exodus of young people upstate produced New York State's first population loss over all since the 1970s, 9,538 people. 
 Rhode Island and Michigan also suffered losses, but, like New York's, each was well under 1 percent. 
 In the one year covered by the latest estimates, from July 1, 2005, to July 1, 2006, Texas gained 579,275 residents, more people than live in either Boston or Washington. Nonetheless, the annual increase fell short of records set in California in the early 1980s. 
 In raw numbers, Texas gained more people than any other state -- a quarter million more than second-ranked Florida, which was followed by California, Georgia and Arizona. More people moved to Texas from elsewhere in the United States than moved to any other state. Texas ranked second, between California and New York, in foreign immigration. 
 Measured by rate of growth, Arizona was first, followed by Nevada, Idaho, Georgia and Texas, Utah, North Carolina, Colorado, Florida and South Carolina. For 2005-6, Colorado and South Carolina displaced Delaware and Oregon. Arizona's estimated population grew by 213,311 to 6.2 million, an increase of 3.6 percent. Most of the increase was driven by more people moving in from other states than leaving -- most from California. But immigrants also contributed to the growth, as did more than twice as many births as deaths. (By comparison, in West Virginia, deaths outnumbered births.)
 In 26 states, more new residents moved in from abroad than relocated from other states.
 ''The story is movement inward from 'unaffordable America' among domestic migrants with immigrants following along to the big gainers, as kind of a badge of success,'' said William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
 ''Arizona used to be merely a retirement magnet for Midwest seniors,'' Mr. Frey said. ''Now it's also a front door for immigrants from Mexico and an escape hatch for Californians seeking affordable housing. Add the retiree population, which will be soon bubbling with baby boomers, and you have America's demographic success story -- or nightmare, depending on how you see the challenges of rapid growth.''
 Arizona's in-migration is visible at motor vehicle offices. In 2005, 117,500 people surrendered California driver's licenses, with Illinois licenses a distant second with 23,200, followed by Texas with 22,800.
 Arizona is also benefiting from foreign citizens attending the state's three major public universities. 
 Arjun Rajagopal, 22, of India, transferred the California license plate on his motorcycle yesterday at a Scottsdale motor vehicle office. Mr. Rajagopal is seeking his master's degree in industrial engineering at Arizona State University.
 ''If I find a permanent job after graduating, I may stay here,'' he said.
 From 2004 to 2005, about 12,000 people left Louisiana, but immigration and births combined to produce a net gain of 12,000. In the latest year, though, 241,000 people moved away, producing a net loss of nearly 220,000, equal to the population of Baton Rouge, the state capital. 
 ''Most of that was due to Hurricane Katrina,'' said Greg Harper, a demographer with the Census Bureau. ''We don't know if it's permanent or not, but as of July 1, 2006, we were still showing more out-migration.''
 In New York, officials said the slight decline was not statistically significant and would probably be contested, as it has been successfully in recent years.
 ''We will likely engage in another round of challenges, and the 2006 numbers will be adjusted and then reported in 2007,'' said Warren A. Brown, a demographer at Cornell University. 
 But there was no contesting the fact that the Northeast grew by only 62,000 people, the slowest of any region. The West grew fastest, followed by the South, which, by the Census Bureau's definition, now accounts for 36 percent of the nation's population.
 Since 2000, about 1.2 million people moved from New York, or about as many as moved into Florida from other states. But New York gained 820,000 immigrants, which placed it second between California and Texas. 
 ''Even within the South you see slower migration into Virginia, Florida -- both pricey urbanized areas -- and bigger gains for Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee,'' Dr. Frey said. ''Texas is also doing quite well, as its housing costs have remained low as its economy picked up. In the West, the flight toward affordability is hitting Idaho, Montana and Utah.'' 
 California remains the most-populous state with 36.5 million, followed by Texas (23.5 million), New York (19.3 million), Florida (18.1 million) and Illinois (12.8 million).

HEADLINE: STUDY SUGGESTS INCENTIVES ON OIL BARELY HELP U.S.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
The United States offers some of the most lucrative incentives in the world to companies that drill for oil in publicly owned coastal waters, but a newly released study suggests that the government is getting very little for its money.
 The study, which the Interior Department refused to release for more than a year, estimates that current inducements could allow drilling companies in the Gulf of Mexico to escape tens of billions of dollars in royalties that they would otherwise pay the government for oil and gas produced in areas that belong to American taxpayers.
But the study predicts that the inducements would cause only a tiny increase in production even if they were offered without some of the limitations now in place.
 It also suggests that the cost of that additional oil could be as much as $80 a barrel, far more than the government would have to pay if it simply bought the oil on its own. 
 ''They are giving up a lot of money and not getting much in return,'' said Robert A. Speir, a former analyst at the Energy Department who worked on the report. ''If they took that money, they could buy a whole lot more oil with it on the open market.'' 
 Oil closed Thursday at $62.66 a barrel in regular trading.
 The Interior Department study, commissioned to analyze the costs of royalty incentives and their effectiveness at increasing energy supplies, was completed in fall 2005. But the study was not released until last month because senior officials said they considered it incomplete.
 After repeated requests, the department provided a copy to The New York Times with a ''note to readers'' that said the report did not show the ''actual effects'' of incentives. Indeed, Interior officials contended that the cost of the incentives would turn out to be far less than the study concluded.
 They also said that the nation benefits from even small amounts of additional domestic fossil fuels.
 But industry analysts who compare oil policies around the world said the United States was much more generous to oil companies than most other countries, demanding a smaller share of revenues than others that let private companies drill on public lands and in public waters. In addition, they said, the United States has sweetened some of its incentives in recent years, while dozens of other countries demanded a bigger share of revenue.
 In the United States, the federal government's take -- royalties as well as corporate taxes -- is about 40 percent of revenue from oil and gas produced on federal property, according to Van Meurs Associates, an industry consulting firm that compares the taxes of all oil-producing countries. 
 By contrast, according to Van Meurs, the worldwide average ''government take'' is about 60 to 65 percent. And that figure, of course, excludes countries that do not allow any private ownership in oil production. 
 Democratic leaders in Congress have already vowed to roll back royalty incentives and tax breaks for drilling companies when they take control of the House and Senate in January.
 ''Royalty relief is the gift that keeps on giving,'' said Representative Nick J. Rahall, Democrat of West Virginia, who will become chairman of the House Resources Committee. ''It seems painfully obvious that when the government gives tax breaks in the form of royalty relief to Big Oil, the American people are footing the bill.''
 Supporters of drilling incentives say they make sense for a country that wants to reduce its dependence on foreign oil and whose biggest untapped reserves are in water thousands of feet deep where the cost of drilling a dry hole can hit $100 million.
 ''The amount of exploration investment that a company has to endure to find and develop reserves in the U.S. is far more than in a place like Angola,'' said Michael Rodgers, a senior economist at PFC Energy, a consulting firm that analyzes the tax regimes in oil-producing countries. 
 As oil and gas prices have surged in recent years, moreover, many countries have forced companies to give up a bigger share of revenues. Venezuela, Nigeria and Kazakhstan are among several dozen countries that have forced foreign oil companies to pay more money through either higher taxes or bigger equity stakes for the government. 
 ''They've become emboldened by higher oil prices but they're also being emboldened by muted response from investors,'' said Michelle Billig, director of political risk analysis at the PIRA Energy Group in New York. ''Companies don't have the luxury of contesting and taking a hard line.''
 Starting this year, Britain imposed the second of two new supplemental taxes on petroleum revenue from the North Sea, pushing the government's share to 50 percent. Norway keeps at least 70 percent of revenues, but the government share increases automatically as oil prices rise and tops out at 78 percent. 
 Norway is on the growing list of countries that have adopted ''progressive'' systems that automatically increase the tax rate on oil and gas production as energy prices climb. Several Canadian provinces have adopted similar policies, and Alaska approved a tax system in August that automatically inches up as oil prices climb above $55 a barrel.
 ''The United States is not extracting sufficient benefit from oil and gas production,'' said Pedro Van Meurs, president of Van Meurs Associates.
 ''The U.S. system worked fine when oil was $20 a barrel, but it wasn't changed when prices went up,'' added Mr. Van Meurs, who advised Alaska legislators on their tax system. When oil prices soar, he said, political leaders almost inevitably view the immutable bargain as too generous to industry.
 In principle, the federal government has its own form of a progressive system. It offers royalty relief to companies that drill in very deep waters, but companies are supposed to pay the full rate -- 12 to 16 percent -- if oil prices climb above about $34 a barrel.
 In practice, it does not always work out that way. Companies that signed leases in 1998 and 1999 enjoy an unintended loophole that entitles them to royalty-free oil and gas regardless of how high prices climb.
 Last week, the Bush administration persuaded five companies to give up the loophole. But about 50 other companies have thus far refused to follow suit.
 The Bush administration scaled back the incentive for newer leases, but in 2004, the administration offered lucrative new royalty incentives for companies that drill extremely deep natural gas wells in shallow water. Congress, meanwhile, added several billion dollars worth of new tax breaks in 2004 and 2005 for exploration and drilling.
 James A. Watt, chief executive of Remington Oil in Dallas before it was acquired by Helix Energy Solutions in July, said the federal incentives help reduce the risks and high cost of exploring in more difficult areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
 ''Tax issues are extraordinarily important,'' Mr. Watt said, in an interview this year. ''Having said that, my view is that we just drilled a $50 million dry hole. That swamps the tax benefits we're getting.''
 The big issue for both lawmakers and the Interior Department is whether royalty relief has much of an impact.
 The new study, prepared under contract to the Minerals Management Service of the Interior Department by Innovation and Information Consultants of Concord, Mass., is one of the few attempts to assess the impact through a rigorous econometric analysis.
 The report estimates that the current incentives would have a tiny impact that is far exceeded by swings in market prices.
 The report predicted that the current incentives would lead to the discovery of only 1.1 percent more reserves than if there had been no incentives at all. Total oil production from 2003 to 2042 would be about 300 million barrels more, or less than 1 percent, than it would have been anyway. Natural gas production would be 0.6 percent greater than it would have been otherwise. 
 But the cost of those royalty incentives would be high: about $48 billion less in royalty payments over the 40-year period. That loss would be offset by a slight increase in the prices that companies pay when bidding for leases in government auctions, but analysts said the net cost would still be above $40 billion.
 The Interior Department, in a written response to questions, said the actual cost of its incentives would be much lower than $40 billion because most leases in the Gulf of Mexico include an escape clause that requires companies to pay full royalties if prices are above $34 a barrel.
 But officials conceded that oil companies are still poised to escape billions of dollars in royalties in the next five years alone.
 Dozens of companies signed leases in the late 1990's under a Clinton administration program that offered highly generous incentives and, apparently because of a bureaucratic error, omitted the escape clause. The government has estimated that it would have received as much as $10 billion more over the next five years if the mistake had not been made. It is trying to renegotiate the terms.
 But as much as half of that money is out of reach. The Bush administration also endorsed a new royalty holiday for ''deep gas'' drilling in shallow waters even if natural gas prices climb above today's levels. According to internal budget estimates last year, the deep gas incentives account for half of the $10 billion that the government stands to lose.
 To be sure, the newly released study found that the extra incentives prompted companies to pay more money upfront when bidding on offshore drilling leases and predicted that they would lead to a small increase in exploration and production. 
 The actual impact of the incentives depends on what happens to oil prices. But under any of the projections, the cost ended up exceeding the market price for oil. 
 Analysts said the meager impact of royalty incentives was not surprising: for oil and gas companies deciding whether to drill in deep water, the potential money involved in royalty incentives is small compared with the money at stake in changes of market prices. 
 Eliminating royalties on oil or gas will save a company 12 to 16 percent on some of its production. But those savings are minuscule compared with the nearly fourfold increase in oil prices from $15 a barrel in 1999 to more than $70 this summer.
 At today's prices, even the risk of a $100 million dry hole is not so daunting.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Weak Data in Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks pulled back yesterday after economic data pointing to weakness in regional manufacturing and slower economic growth weighed on investor sentiment. Trading was light in advance of the holiday weekend.
 Prices fell after the December business index of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which gauges regional manufacturing activity, was reported at a negative 4.3 compared with a positive reading of 5.1 in November. It was the weakest showing since 2003.
Before release of the Philadelphia Fed report, investors seemed to shrug off news that the economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter than previously reported. The increase in the gross domestic product fell to 2 percent in the third quarter amid the cooling real estate market; the Commerce Department estimated a month ago that the reading would be closer to 2.2 percent. 
 Still, there was not a lot of anxiety. Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, commented: ''I think with the low volume, nobody is really around to trade the stuff. So I wouldn't put too much credence in this pullback.''
 In dealing yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.62 points, or 0.34 percent, to 12,421.25. Broader indexes did a little worse. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 5.23 points, or 0.37 percent, at 1,418.30. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index lost 11.76 points, or 0.48 percent, falling to 2,415.85. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies dropped 2.66 points, or 0.34 percent, to 782.90.
 Declining issues outnumbered those advancing by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 1.35 billion shares, compared with 1.37 billion on Wednesday.
 Crude oil fell $1.06 a barrel yesterday, settling at $62.66 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Comments from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., who has dissented from the central bank's recent decisions to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, served as a counterweight to market optimism. According to the text of a speech prepared for delivery in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Lacker said, ''The risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk.''
 Among active stocks yesterday, profit reports from the drugstore chain Rite Aid and from ConAgra Foods lent some support to the notion that companies would still squeeze out growth in a slowing economy.
 Rite Aid rose 10 cents, to $5.47, after reporting a narrowed fiscal third-quarter loss amid stronger pharmacy sales and increased prescription volume. The company reiterated its profit forecast.
 ConAgra advanced 49 cents, to $27.34, after its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 44 percent. It increased its forecast for the year.
 Horizon Health gained $3.23, or 20 percent, to $19.36, after the company, which operates mental health treatment facilities, agreed to be acquired by Psychiatric Solutions for $321 million and the assumption of $105 million in debt. Psychiatric Solutions rose $1.52, or 4.2 percent, to $37.60.
 Jabil Circuit fell $2.44, or 9.2 percent, to $24.12. Its fiscal first-quarter results disappointed Wall Street despite a 34 percent increase in revenue.
 PMC-Sierra, which makes chips used in communications and networking equipment, fell 29 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $6.60, after cutting its profit forecast for the quarter.
 A financial services company, International Assets Holding, plunged by $15.63, or 32.6 percent, to $32.30, after a fiscal fourth-quarter loss amid volatility in commodity prices.
 In the bond market, prices rose on the weaker economic data. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 11/32, to a price of 10020/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.55 percent from 4.59 percent.

HEADLINE: The Night Of the Living Dioramas

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In ''Night at the Museum,'' gigantism rules. This season's answer to ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' it's an overstuffed grab bag in which lumps of coal are glued together with melted candy. 
 Yes, the bag does hold some clever robotic toys, but many are broken. If you were to line up the niftiest thingamajigs created for this tale of a would-be inventor-turned-night-watchman, you might have something resembling '' 'Jumanji' Meets 'The Wizard of Oz' With a Dash of 'Home Alone.' '' But the fable arrives smothered in an uneasy blend of wisecracks and pallid inspirational blather. 
A self-described action-adventure comedy, ''Night at the Museum'' is exactly that: it wants to be all things to all people under a certain age. Shawn Levy (the ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' movies, the ''Pink Panther'' remake), who directed from Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon's adaptation of a book by Milan Trenc, subscribes enthusiastically to the current Hollywood philosophy that coherence doesn't matter if enough stuff is thrown onto the screen. Contributing to the bulk is a score (by Alan Silvestri) that rivals the ''Star Wars'' soundtracks in pounding grandiosity. 
 It's fair to say that ''Night at the Museum'' is better than the insufferable Jim Carrey ''Grinch,'' a landmark of holiday film excess. It knows how to build excitement by steadily accelerating the pace and widening the spectacle. Almost in spite of itself, it sets off occasional little bursts of cinematic magic.
 The movie begins as a droopy family comedy about the divorced, unemployed Larry Daley (Ben Stiller, ably going through the motions), who is so down and out he may have to move from Manhattan to (gasp!) Queens. It quickly builds to a C.G.I. extravaganza unleashed in the halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. There (where the movie wasn't actually filmed, except for exteriors), its hapless protagonist takes a job as the museum's night watchman. 
 Larry, oblivious to the strange looks on the faces of the three guards he's replacing -- Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) -- has no idea what's awaiting him. No sooner have they departed, handing him the keys with strict instructions that nothing leave the museum, than the place stirs to life. In no time Larry is playing frightened ringmaster to a rampaging circus of exhibits that have come to life through the magic of a priceless Egyptian tablet. 
 A Tyrannosaurus rex hops off its pedestal and like a famished zombie begins clumping after Larry, who discovers that if he throws it a bone, it fetches like a dog. Cute. A stone head from Easter Island demands bubble gum. And a cheeky monkey named Dexter steals Larry's keys, tears up his instructions and engages him in a face-slapping routine. 
 At first it seems as though the menacing wild animals (both prehistoric and contemporary) will be Larry's nemeses. But ''Night at the Museum'' squeezes the most juice from its historical figures, some life-sized, others miniature, some in dioramas and others on pedestals. The most amusing image is of Mr. Stiller, wide-eyed and floppy-eared, besieged by bands of tiny, finger-sized warriors furiously hurling spears and darts at him. 
 Of the historical figures, Robin Williams's Teddy Roosevelt is the noisiest. Once this statue steps off his equestrian roost, he behaves like a bossy, slogan-dispensing drill instructor, whipping Larry into moral shape. But beneath his bluster, the facsimile of the 26th president is an emotional basket case, who admits in a weak moment that he is a synthetic product manufactured in Poughkeepsie. For most of the film, he pines silently after Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck), the famous Indian tracker locked inside the glass case of a Lewis and Clark diorama. 
 Profitable screen time is devoted to the continuing territorial squabble between tiny figurines of Octavius (Steve Coogan), the Roman general, and Jedediah (Owen Wilson, uncredited), a rootin'-tootin' American cowboy. Bizarrely, the movie gives their dispute a gay subtext. In a slip of the tongue, Octavius addresses Larry as Mary, and Jedediah, quoting from ''Brokeback Mountain,'' tells Octavius, ''I can't quit you.'' I guess it means that nowadays such smidgens of ''South Park'' humor are thrown into family movies to make everybody feel terribly knowing. 
 But when ''Night at the Museum'' returns to Larry's personal life, it dies. The movie doesn't even make a pretense of being interested in the scenes between Larry and Nick (Jake Cherry), the 10-year-old son whose respect he is losing. And its cynical lack of concern for giving the characters human feelings is a grave drawback for a movie that wants to engage children.
 ''Night at the Museum'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 23, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A film review in Weekend yesterday about ''Night at the Museum,'' directed by Shawn Levy, erroneously attributed a director's credit to him. While he directed the 2003 remake of the 1950 film ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' he did not direct the sequel, ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2.'' Adam Shankman did.

HEADLINE: Can Freedom Be Exported? 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''God's Gift?,'' by Orlando Patterson (column, Dec. 19):
 Mr. Patterson faults George W. Bush for believing that freedom can be imposed on a land whose customs are inimical to such concepts. But world leaders who condone torture, extraordinary rendition, domestic spying and the abrogation of due process are, historically, not much interested in the spread of freedom.
 Mr. Bush's faith in capitalism, however, seems borne out, considering the multibillion-dollar no-bid contracts awarded to an army of independent contractors now flourishing in Iraq. For a president whose response to 9/11 was to exhort a grief-stricken nation to greater shopping, mission seems all but accomplished. 

Steve Kronen
Winter Park, Fla., Dec. 19, 2006

To the Editor: 
 Orlando Patterson rightly questions the primacy of freedom, too easily equated in the West with democracy, as an immediate global goal and a cornerstone of United States foreign policy.
 For the vast majority of people on the planet, the search for a dignified life is centered on gaining ample access to food, shelter, security and stability, which in the richness of our American lives we take for granted. Freedom itself does little to assuage these conditions and in this context is a luxury.
 The insidious consequence of this doctrine is that it construes freedom and democracy as the prerequisites of stability and security, not the outcomes.

Jeffrey A. Zawadsky
San Francisco, Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 Orlando Patterson suggests that freedom is a ''distinctive product of Western civilization'' and argues against the use of force in spreading it to other parts of the world.
 Although his intentions are noble, this particular suggestion is a Western myth that has always provided a justification for colonial ventures under the guise of ''civilizing'' the rest of the world. 
 Portraying freedom as a uniquely Western concept glosses over what is in some ways a uniquely Western history of slavery, colonialism and imperialism. A discussion of what freedom means in specific social and cultural contexts is certainly a legitimate exercise. However, in a world characterized by an unequal distribution of resources and in which historic wounds of colonialism and slavery have yet to heal, it is patronizing to suggest that freedom is a product solely of Western civilization.

Ninad R. Bondre
Oxford, Ohio, Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 Building on Orlando Patterson's argument, I believe that the complete miscalculation by the United States of what would follow the fall of Saddam Hussein stemmed from a lack of historical understanding of the Middle East within the Departments of State and Defense. 
 Instead, many policy makers have their backgrounds in law and political science, which, as taught at most universities, rely solely on Western notions of freedom, democracy and justice that are not universally shared.
 The complete misjudgment of the government concerning the Iraq war demonstrates the problem with basing foreign policy solely on Western political theory while paying little attention to historical fact.

Josh Asher
New York, Dec. 19, 2006

To the Editor:
 Orlando Patterson may be correct when he criticizes President Bush and his advisers for their failure to appreciate the cultural differences in Western and non-Western conceptualizations of freedom. But there is no evidence that support of basic human freedoms has ever been of primary importance to those responsible for misleading the nation into invading and occupying Iraq.
 In selling the war and its disastrous results to the public, the president and his advisers cynically conflated the appeal for human freedoms with their self-serving plan to impose a new, nominally democratic order in the Middle East -- one that would be reliably favorable to American economic and other geopolitical strategic interests.
 Iraqis and other Middle Easterners might not recognize that definition of human freedom? Neither would most Americans and other Westerners.

Steven Gutterman
Ann Arbor, Mich., Dec. 19, 2006

To the Editor:
 I read Orlando Patterson's column about Iraq and the folly of forcing freedom on those who don't want it, and I felt especially frustrated and disheartened because in 2002, I wrote to my senators about that very issue: ''NO to war against Iraq more killings, more hate, more killings, more hate. You're dealing with a culture unto itself and needs to be considered as such.''
 If a no-name citizen in the scheme of things was wary that the great cultural divides between Western beliefs about freedom and Iraqi tenets would pose impenetrable barriers to political and social harmony, how alarming that a president, a vice president, a secretary of state and other government officials from both major political parties were so naive and wrong?
 How can we citizens feel any sense of security for today, for tomorrow?

Geraldyn Eckber
Bridgeport, Conn., Dec. 19, 2006

To the Editor:
 Orlando Patterson describes the belief held by some that ''freedom is a natural part of the human condition.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. If it were true, we could expect to find free societies spread throughout human history. We do not. Instead, what we find are every sort of tyrannical government from time immemorial.
 Whether they were monarchies, theocracies, oligarchies, dictatorships or some combination, the human condition is far from naturally free. We are prone to repressive leadership that seeks power for its own pleasures. We form democratic governments to limit governmental power.
 Individual and economic freedoms have been hard won by people who banded together to throw off the heavy yoke of kingly repression. Though the idea of freedom can spread, it cannot be spread through benign repression or well-intended military action.
 No indeed, it is not God's gift; it is the gift of previous generations to our descendants, for which we are only granted the honor of temporary guardianship.

HEADLINE: Bickering Saudis Struggle for an Answer to Iran's Rising Influence in the Middle East

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Rasheed Abou al-Samh contributed reporting from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and Helene Cooper from Washington.

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
At a late-night reading this week, a self-styled poet raised his hand for silence and began a riff on neighboring Iraq, in the old style of Bedouin storytellers. 
 ''Saddam Hussein was a real leader who deserved our support,'' he began, making up the lines as he went. ''He kept Iraq stable and peaceful,'' he added, ''and most of all he fought back the Iranians.'' He continued, ''His one mistake was invading Kuwait.''
Across the kingdom, in both official and casual conversation, once-quiet concern over the chaos in Iraq and Iran's growing regional influence has burst into the open. 
 Saudi newspapers now denounce Iran's growing power. Religious leaders here, who view Shiism as heresy, have begun talking about a ''Persian onslaught'' that threatens Islam. In the salons and diwans of Riyadh, the ''Iranian threat'' is raised almost as frequently as the stock market. 
 ''Iran has become more dangerous than Israel itself,'' said Sheik Musa bin Abdulaziz, editor of the magazine Al Salafi, who describes himself as a moderate Salafi, a fundamentalist Muslim movement. ''The Iranian revolution has come to renew the Persian presence in the region. This is the real clash of civilizations.''
 Many here say a showdown with Iran is inevitable. After several years of a thaw in relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Saudis are growing concerned that Iran may build a nuclear bomb and become the de facto superpower in the region. 
 In recent weeks, the Saudis, with other Persian Gulf countries, have announced plans to develop peaceful nuclear power. Saudi officials publicly welcomed the Iraqi Harith al-Dhari, whose Muslim Scholars Association has links to the insurgency, during a visit in October, and they have indicated that they may support Iraq's Sunnis over the majority Shiites with links to Iran. All were meant to send a message to Iran.
 ''You need to create a strategic challenge to Iran,'' said Steve Clemons, senior fellow and director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation. ''To some degree, what the Saudis are doing is puffing up because they see nobody else in the region doing so.'' 
 Yet a growing debate here has centered on how Iran should be confronted: head on, with Saudi Arabia throwing its lot in with the full force of the United States, or diplomatically, with a grand bargain Iran would find hard to refuse? 
 The apparent split burst into the open last week when Prince Turki al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Washington, abruptly resigned after just 15 months. The resignation is seen by many here as part of a long-running battle over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy. 
 On Tuesday, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the country's ailing foreign minister, confirmed the ambassador's resignation, citing personal reasons. Privately some Saudi officials and analysts with knowledge of the situation say Prince Turki resigned over deep differences with Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the national security minister and former Washington ambassador, over how to deal with Iran. 
 Prince Bandar is believed to favor the tough American approach of confronting Iran, analysts say, while Prince Turki advocates more diplomatic tactics, including negotiating with Iran. 
 If this is the case, then the successor to Prince Turki as Saudi ambassador -- Adel al-Jubeir, a foreign policy adviser to King Abdullah -- is a wild card, Saudi and American officials said Thursday. 
 Polished and American-educated, Mr. Jubeir, 44, once worked for Prince Bandar when he was ambassador to Washington. Mr. Jubeir became well known as the public face of Saudi Arabia, defending Saudi policy after the Sept. 11 attacks, appearing on talk shows and escorting NBC's White House correspondent at the time, Campbell Brown, around town. 
 But Saudi officials said that Mr. Jubeir did not necessarily share Prince Bandar's opinions. ''Basically, the king is putting his own man in America,'' one Saudi official said. ''Adel will be a direct line between the king and the administration.''
 Mr. Clemons, whose blog, The Washington Note, first reported Mr. Jubeir's appointment on Wednesday, said Mr. Jubeir ''is someone who can help de-escalate tensions between quadroons of the royal family. I don't think he necessarily brings Bandar's views on Iran to the table.''
 Just days before President Bush met with the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the outlines of what seemed to be a new plan were made public by Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi security consultant. In an op-ed article in The Washington Post, he said that if the United States withdrew from Iraq, the Saudis would back the Sunnis ''to stop Iranian-backed Shiite militias from butchering Iraqi Sunnis.''
 Saudi Arabia said Mr. Obaid did not speak on its behalf, and he was subsequently dismissed from his position. He is widely expected to return to the government in some capacity. And King Abdullah warned Vice President Dick Cheney during a meeting in Riyadh three weeks ago that Saudi Arabia would back the Sunnis if the Americans withdrew from Iraq and a civil war ensued.
 ''The possibility of having conflict is very high,'' said Abdelrahman Rashid, managing director of the satellite news channel Al Arabiya and a respected Saudi columnist. ''Who will face the Iranians tomorrow? Just the Israelis alone? I don't think that is possible.'' Prince Turki, Mr. Clemons and palace insiders say, had lobbied Washington for a broader policy that eschews a military confrontation in favor of a policy that will strike Iran's interests. In effect, Mr. Clemons said, Prince Turki had sought a plan mirroring some of the recommendations in the Iraq Study Group report but with a harder edge. 
 ''Turki is not playing nice guy at all,'' he said. ''Essentially, the Saudis are engagers. They want to weave together a blurry ambiguity to what they want to do.''
 A member of the Saudi royal family with knowledge of the discussions between Mr. Cheney and King Abdullah said the king had presented Mr. Cheney with a plan to raise oil production to force down the price, in hopes of causing economic turmoil for Iran without becoming directly involved in a confrontation. 
 Shortly afterward, Mr. Obaid's op-ed article was published, building on earlier public comments that Saudi Arabia intends to get serious about Iran and may back Sunnis in Iraq in the event of an abrupt United States pullout. Neither Prince Bandar nor Prince Turki was available for comment for this article. An adviser to Prince Bandar said there were no divisions over policy, and many officials have been at pains in recent days to prove there is no split.
 Many Saudis have grown openly critical of the country's policy on Iraq, citing its adherence to an American-centric policy at the cost of Saudi interests. More pessimistic analysts here say the country has lost significant strength and stature in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian areas, while Iran, with its populist, anti-American agenda, has benefited.
 ''The Saudis made a big mistake by following the Americans when they had no plan,'' said Khalid al-Dakhil, a professor of political sociology at King Saud University in Riyadh. ''If the Saudis had intervened earlier and helped the Sunnis they could have found a political solution to their differences, instead of the bloodshed we are seeing today.''
 Last week, a group of prominent Saudi clerics and university professors called on the government to begin actively backing Iraq's Sunnis. The clerics described what they called a Persian-Jewish partnership besieging the Sunnis. 
 ''There is a segment in this country that will do everything the U.S. wants,'' said Turki al-Rasheed, who runs a group that seeks to encourage democracy in the Persian Gulf. ''But fortunately the big leaders know this whole agenda will take us to hell.''

HEADLINE: Saner Voices in Iran

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has not been having a very good month, which is good news both for the beaten-down people of Iran and for the outside world. 
 The populist demagogue, it seems, is not so popular with important elements of Iranian society growing uneasy over the price Iran may have to pay for his belligerent pursuit of nuclear technology. This week, Mr. Ahmadinejad's oil minister acknowledged that foreign banks were pulling back from financing Iranian oil projects because of the worsening nuclear dispute.
The clearest evidence of Mr. Ahmadinejad's troubles came in last week's elections for municipal offices and the national council that oversees the work of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr. Ahmadinejad's supporters fared surprisingly poorly. The main gainers came from two very different opposition groups, one aligned with former President Ali Rafsanjani, an establishment conservative, and the other with remnants of the cautious reform movement led by former President Mohammad Khatami.
 Mr. Rafsanjani, a venomous foe of Israel (with his own nuclear appetites), is so notorious for the corruption that marred his presidency that his political career had almost gone into eclipse. Mr. Khatami's followers are more high-minded, but still managed to fumble Iran's best chance for reform in decades. What distinguishes them from Mr. Ahmadinejad's supporters is their recognition that Iran exists in the real world. They understand that its future requires good relations with foreign investors, trade partners and educational institutions. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has been systematically dynamiting those relations, by defying the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations and with his loathsome circus of Holocaust denial. Though meant to whip up voters, that travesty failed to save his supporters from electoral defeat.
 Last week, in a remarkable show of courage, students at one of Tehran's elite universities openly denounced Mr. Ahmadinejad as a dictator and a fascist, forcing him to cut short his planned address. 
 Their anger had been stoked by a blatantly political purge of professors and students, a crackdown on basic personal freedoms, and worries that economic mismanagement and diplomatic provocations were blighting their future. Two weeks ago, the students chanted, ''Forget the Holocaust -- do something for us.'' Last week, one of them told a reporter: ''A nuclear program is our right. But we fear that it will do more harm than good.'' 
 Indeed it would, and it is encouraging to hear from Iranians who recognize that threat. Washington needs to keep pushing for effective economic sanctions that will compel Mr. Ahmadinejad to recognize it as well.

HEADLINE: Democrats And The Deficit

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Now that the Democrats have regained some power, they have to decide what to do. One of the biggest questions is whether the party should return to Rubinomics -- the doctrine, associated with former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, that placed a very high priority on reducing the budget deficit.
 The answer, I believe, is no. Mr. Rubin was one of the ablest Treasury secretaries in American history. But it's now clear that while Rubinomics made sense in terms of pure economics, it failed to take account of the ugly realities of contemporary American politics. 
And the lesson of the last six years is that the Democrats shouldn't spend political capital trying to bring the deficit down. They should refrain from actions that make the deficit worse. But given a choice between cutting the deficit and spending more on good things like health care reform, they should choose the spending.
 In a saner political environment, the economic logic behind Rubinomics would have been compelling. Basic fiscal principles tell us that the government should run budget deficits only when it faces unusually high expenses, mainly during wartime. In other periods it should try to run a surplus, paying down its debt. 
 Since the 1990s were an era of peace, prosperity and favorable demographics (the baby boomers were still in the work force, not collecting Social Security and Medicare), it should have been a good time to put the federal budget in the black. And under Mr. Rubin, the huge deficits of the Reagan-Bush years were transformed into an impressive surplus.
 But the realities of American politics ensured that it was all for naught. The second President Bush quickly squandered the surplus on tax cuts that heavily favored the wealthy, then plunged the budget deep into deficit by cutting taxes on dividends and capital gains even as he took the country into a disastrous war. And you can even argue that Mr. Rubin's surplus was a bad thing, because it greased the rails for Mr. Bush's irresponsibility.
 As Brad DeLong, a Berkeley economist who served in the Clinton administration, recently wrote on his influential blog: ''Rubin and us spearcarriers moved heaven and earth to restore fiscal balance to the American government in order to raise the rate of economic growth. But what we turned out to have done, in the end, was to enable George W. Bush's right-wing class war: his push for greater after-tax income inequality.'' 
 My only quibble with Mr. DeLong's characterization is that this wasn't just one man's class war: the whole conservative movement shared Mr. Bush's squanderlust, his urge to run off with the money so carefully saved under Mr. Rubin's leadership. 
 With the benefit of hindsight, it's clear that conservatives who claimed to care about deficits when Democrats were in power never meant it. Let's not forget how Alan Greenspan, who posed as the high priest of fiscal rectitude as long as Bill Clinton was in the White House, became an apologist for tax cuts -- even in the face of budget deficits -- once a Republican took up residence.
 Now the Democrats are back in control of Congress. They've pledged not to be as irresponsible as their predecessors: Nancy Pelosi, the incoming House speaker, has promised to restore the ''pay-as-you-go'' rule that the Republicans tossed aside in the Bush years. This rule would basically prevent Congress from passing budgets that increase the deficit.
 I'm for pay-as-you-go. The question, however, is whether to go further. Suppose the Democrats can free up some money by fixing the Medicare drug program, by ending the Iraq war and/or clamping down on war profiteering, or by rolling back some of the Bush tax cuts. Should they use the reclaimed revenue to reduce the deficit, or spend it on other things? 
 The answer, I now think, is to spend the money -- while taking great care to ensure that it is spent well, not squandered -- and let the deficit be. By spending money well, Democrats can both improve Americans' lives and, more broadly, offer a demonstration of the benefits of good government. Deficit reduction, on the other hand, might just end up playing into the hands of the next irresponsible president.
 In the long run, something will have to be done about the deficit. But given the state of our politics, now is not the time.

HEADLINE: U.N. Postpones Vote on Penalties for Iran

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
The Security Council postponed voting Friday on a resolution aimed at halting Iran's nuclear program, after Russia objected that the document restricted legitimate business activities.
 After a full day of negotiations, however, the resolution's European sponsors were optimistic that the Security Council would approve a slightly altered version by the end of the day on Saturday. The altered version of the resolution is aimed at satisfying Russia's demands without weakening the measure in such a way that it would be unpalatable to the Americans and Europeans.
The 11th-hour negotiations on Friday were the latest glitch in a protracted effort by Germany and the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia -- to agree on precise terms of the resolution, which would ban the import and export of materials and technology used for uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missile systems. 
 Talks about possible sanctions began after Iran flouted an Aug. 31 deadline to suspend enrichment, which can produce fuel for nuclear plants and weapons. Iran has insisted that it has the right to cultivate nuclear power for peaceful energy purposes, while the Americans and Europeans maintain that its efforts are geared toward the production of nuclear weapons.
 Since the earliest drafts of the resolution started circulating in October, there have been various revisions. Perhaps most significant, the six countries on Wednesday all but eliminated a travel ban on a dozen people deemed to be involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
 While older drafts had mandated that all states ''prevent entry'' of the dozen people named, as well as others who could be designated in the future, Wednesday's draft simply ''calls upon'' states to ''exercise vigilance'' over who crosses their borders. It also eased a freeze on the assets of those people and other prohibited companies.
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, had applauded the relaxing of the travel ban. But early Friday, Mr. Churkin, whose country has strong economic ties with Iran, said the resolution continued to be too sweeping and prohibited activities that could be legitimate. He said the resolution was not intended to be punitive and should aim at encouraging Iran to negotiate.
 ''We must make sure that perfectly legal, innocent activities which have nothing to do with the risk of nuclear proliferation can proceed normally,'' Mr. Churkin told reporters. ''This is our interest.''
 The latest, revised version of the resolution would give countries more latitude to authorize the unfreezing of certain assets. It also no longer spells out certain exceptions to the asset freeze, apparently to drive home the point that the ban is aimed only at prohibited nuclear activities and not legitimate business deals.
 Diplomats said the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, would review the resolution at a meeting with advisers on Saturday morning in Moscow. Wang Guangya, China's United Nations ambassador, was noncommittal, saying, ''Now we have to go back to capitals.''
 Emyr Jones Parry, the British ambassador to the United Nations, said the latest changes ''increase the chances of agreement.''
 Also on Friday, Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is days away from the end of his term, announced a new policy prohibiting United Nations staff members who work in procurement from immediately taking jobs with contractors or vendors they have dealt with during their last three years of United Nations service. That prohibition is limited to one year after the staff members leave the United Nations. 
 Under the new policy, former staff members must wait two years before working with the United Nations on behalf of outside groups or vendors on matters that concern their former procurement responsibilities.
 Mr. Annan's spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said the regulations were a response to abuses in the oil for food program as well as other alleged improprieties among procurement officials.
 Mr. Dujarric described the policy as ''unprecedented,'' saying the United Nations has never had a policy regulating staff members' future employment.
 Mr. Annan also issued a protocol for making available the findings of the United Nations investigation into the oil for food program. The investigation was led by Paul A. Volcker.

HEADLINE: Talks End on North Korea's Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program ended Friday without tangible progress, and Pyongyang quickly renewed threats to ''improve its nuclear deterrent.''
 American and Asian diplomats said that during five days of negotiations in Beijing, the North Korean delegation had declined to discuss disarmament in formal sessions, insisting it would do so only after the United States removed financial measures that have further isolated North Korea from the international economy.
China, the host for this and previous rounds of the inconclusive negotiations, said the participants in the talks -- the United States, China, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia -- had agreed to ''reconvene at the earliest opportunity.'' An American official involved with the talks said they could resume early next year. 
 But the latest impasse may signal the increased difficulty -- some analysts say the near impossibility -- of persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear program now that it has tested a nuclear device and declared itself a nuclear weapons state.
 Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy at the talks, said that the American side did not leave ''empty-handed,'' arguing that North Korea had at least nominally recommitted itself to a 2005 draft accord to scrap its nuclear weapons. ''We are disappointed that we were unable to reach any agreement,'' Mr. Hill said Friday evening.
 But, he also suggested, the United States remains committed to finding a diplomatic solution.
 ''Diplomacy is not an easy task, but like many things in life, you have to look at the alternatives,'' he said.
 North Korea's chief negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, blamed the United States for the stalemate.
 Referring to the Treasury Department's decision in 2005 to blacklist a Macao-based bank that held North Korean assets, he said financial penalties must be removed before his government would discuss steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
 ''The U.S. is using a tactic of both dialogue and pressure, carrots and sticks,'' Mr. Kim told reporters. ''We are responding with dialogue and a shield, and by a shield we are saying we will further improve our deterrent.''
 The Bush administration says the move against the Banco Delta Asia in Macao stemmed from North Korean counterfeiting of American dollars and the laundering of proceeds from drug running. The administration said the financial issue had no direct relationship to the nuclear talks.
 But Treasury Department officials accompanied Mr. Hill's State Department negotiating team to Beijing, and held one-on-one sessions with the North Koreans on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 Those sessions were described by the American side as useful. But the Treasury team left Beijing without resolving the financial standoff.
 ''We have requested the U.S. to release the sanctions first and then go into a discussion on substantive issues'' on the nuclear question, Mr. Kim said.
 Mr. Hill said that that all sides had agreed to keep the financial dispute on a separate track while continuing progress on nuclear issues. He suggested that North Korea was using finances as an excuse to avoid engaging seriously in the negotiations.
 ''One day it's financial issues, another day it's something they want but can't have, another day it's something we said about them that hurt their feelings,'' he said.
 But he said the United States had not abandoned its faith in the cumbersome six-party format.
 Mr. Hill said that the North Koreans, midway through the talks this week, had briefly shown interest in negotiating the core issues, but that his hopes had faded abruptly when the North Koreans reverted to talking exclusively about financial pressure.

HEADLINE: Flurry of Calls About Draft, And a Day Of Denials

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU; Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
As the de facto media contact for the Selective Service System, Dick Flahavan is the Maytag repairman of government press people. With the military draft out of business since 1973, the Selective Service just doesn't get a lot of calls these days. 
 But by midday Friday, Mr. Flahavan's office had fielded dozens of inquiries, not just from reporters but from some anxious parents as well, all with some variation of the same urgent question: Are you reinstituting the draft? 
So adamant was the denial that Mr. Flahavan, a bit beleaguered, had his staff members post an unplanned update Friday morning at the top of Selective Service's Web site: ''No Draft on Horizon!'' 
 What prompted all this was a Hearst wire service article noting that the Selective Service was making plans for a ''mock'' draft exercise that would use computerized models to determine how, if necessary, the government would get some 100,000 young adults to report to their local draft boards. 
 The mock computer exercise, last carried out in 1998, is strictly routine, Selective Service officials said, and it will not actually be run until 2009 -- if at all. The exercise has been scheduled several times in the last few years, only to be scuttled each time because of budget and staffing problems, and Mr. Flahavan said he would not be surprised if it was canceled this time around, too. 
 No matter. With President Bush saying that he wants to increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, the military strained near the breaking point and the secretary of veterans affairs suggesting publicly this week that a reconstituted draft could ''benefit'' the country, even the notion of a mock exercise seemed to strike a nerve.
 Since the start of the war in Iraq, some Democrats and Internet bloggers have been stirring up talk of a ''secret plan'' by the Bush administration to resume the draft, and the mere mention of the idea summons Vietnam-era images of birthday-generated draft lotteries and draft evaders fleeing to Canada. 
 Mr. Flahavan, an associate director of the Selective Service who has worked there for nearly two decades, has seen fears of a draft enflamed before -- most notably at the start of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the start of the Iraq war in 2003, as anxious parents would call to ask what effect their son's heart murmur would have on his draft status. He said he understood the anxiety caused by this week's latest round of reports, even if he found the whole thing somewhat irksome. 
 ''People think, 'Aha, they're having an exercise, dusting off the plans, a draft must be right around the corner,' '' he said. 
 The reality, said Mr. Flahavan, who spent most of Friday tamping down the fears, is that ''this is much ado about nothing.''
 ''None of that is accurate,'' he said. 
 White House officials did their part to dampen the speculation as well. 
 ''The president's position has not changed,'' said Trey Bohn, a spokesman for the White House. ''He supports an all-volunteer military, and the administration is not considering reinstating the draft.''
 Although senior military officers agree that the armed forces are stretched, they also agree that a return to the draft is not the best way to fill the ranks. Draftees, they say, are not as motivated as volunteers, and tend to leave as soon as possible, after spending much of their time in costly training. Re-enlistment rates are much higher among volunteers.
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, has championed the idea of bringing back the draft, calling attention to what he sees as social and economic inequities in the volunteer military. The House rejected his bill in 2004, by 402 votes to 2. Mr. Rangel has said he will try again, but other Democratic leaders have been cool to the idea.
 The exercise planned for 2009 would run computerized models to assign random lottery picks by birthday and simulate the processes for notifying those selected and for lodging conscientious objector claims. 
 William A. Chatfield, director of the Selective Service, said Friday that ''we try to send out a signal of strength that we're prepared.'' The Selective Service, he said, needs to be ready ''if something totally unforeseen should come upon us.'' 
 But for now, the chances of that happening are ''very, very, very low,'' Mr. Chatfield said. ''There's nothing even being discussed in a remote fashion, but you have people trying to create fear when there's nothing there.''

HEADLINE: Many Leads, but No Arrests In Killings of Four Prostitutes 

BYLINE: By SERGE F. KOVALESKI

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Five weeks after the barefoot bodies of four slain prostitutes were found in a ditch near here, investigators are seeking information about a host of possible suspects, including two men from Howard Beach, Queens, and a crack dealer from Philadelphia who lived for a while with one of the victims.
 Last week, the authorities also questioned a 55-year-old man in Atlantic City who had a room for most of October at the same seedy hotel on Pacific Avenue where two of the prostitutes had occasionally stayed. A manager and a guest at the hotel recently notified the police about the man after seeing a criminal profile of a theoretical serial killer with a foot fetish and a collection of women's shoes.
The man, Mark A. Hessee, said in an interview on Thursday that he had nothing to do with the deaths but had long warned prostitutes about ''the sins'' of drug use and of their trade, which he said was no different than working for ''blood money and serving Satan.'' 
 Mr. Hessee, who is unemployed and describes himself as a ''minister of God and a man of love,'' was released last year after serving four months in jail for illegally possessing a stun gun. He said that the two detectives who came to his rooming house on Dec. 15 said that they would follow up with him and that they planned to talk to two friends of his, one of whom knew the four slain prostitutes.
 Since the discovery of the women's bodies three days before Thanksgiving, law enforcement officers have been receiving tips about possible suspects from prostitutes and motel workers.
 Denise Hill, a 43-year-old prostitute, said she contacted the police last month about a ''white, greasy-haired, potbellied guy with a scruffy beard,'' who frightened her by bragging about having killed some people. 
 She said that during the night she spent with him at the Best Western motel on Pacific Avenue, the man massaged her and obsessed about her shoes, slip-on Skechers.
 Shawn Taylor, another prostitute, recalled that she talked to the police two weeks ago about a man who picked her up one evening on Pacific Avenue in a gray van, the type of vehicle that some here think may have been involved in the killings.
 ''The guy seemed really uptight and kept telling me to 'Shut up, whore,' '' said Ms. Taylor, 26. ''I had a really bad vibe, so when we stopped at a traffic light, I just jumped out.''
 There are lots of leads but no arrests in a case that appears to be baffling and frustrating for the task force, which is being run by the Atlantic County prosecutor, Jeffrey S. Blitz, and includes representatives of local and state police agencies as well as the F.B.I.
 More recently, law enforcement authorities from Montgomery County, Md., arrived to pitch in, something a spokeswoman for Mr. Blitz declined to explain.
 Mr. Blitz did not return calls to his office and home over the last three days seeking comment about the progress of the investigation. The task force has obtained mounds of information from motels along Pacific Avenue that are known to be hubs of prostitution. Asmat Hussain, a manager at the Flamingo Motel, said that investigators had taken more than 1,000 registration cards for the months of October and November and copied the motel's security video for the same period.
 The unsolved case continues to unnerve the prostitutes who work the seamy streets in the shadows of the grand casinos.
 Tiffany Morgan, 28, said that she now solicited clients on the streets only in the company of one or two of her peers and that she had recently bought a pocketknife to carry along with her pepper spray.
 ''I had to pull my blade out once when a guy got freaky with me and wasn't going to let me out of the room,'' Ms. Morgan said. ''It all makes you wonder how long you are going to be alive.''
 The bodies of the four victims, whom friends and family members described as crack-addicted prostitutes, were found on Nov. 20 in a murky drainage ditch behind a stretch of squalid motels off the Black Horse Pike in Egg Harbor Township, just outside Atlantic City. Their feet were bare and their heads were facing east toward the city, details that have provoked endless speculation.
 The medical examiner said the women, ages 20 to 42, were dumped in the ditch over a period of several weeks. Kimberly Raffo was strangled, Tracy Ann Roberts died of asphyxiation, and the bodies of Barbara V. Breidor and Molly Jean Dilts were too decomposed for the cause of death to be determined. 
 Fear on the streets has fueled talk and rumors of other missing women, like a prostitute known as Peaches, who, as it turns out, has been in the Atlantic County jail for the last several weeks on a previous warrant. 
 Motels continue to display a missing-person flier for a 16-year-old prostitute named Brittini, last seen on Aug. 20, but the state police said on Thursday that she had been found in early October. Law enforcement authorities said that some prostitutes in Atlantic City evaded both warrants and the cold weather by working the so-called circuit, which includes Tampa, Fla., and Las Vegas. 
 ''It's not unusual for us to not see somebody for a few months,'' said Rafael Roman, a supervisor at the Oasis Drop-In Center in Atlantic City, a division of the South Jersey AIDS Alliance. ''Sometimes they leave town for a while to try to beat their addiction, incarceration or to try to reconcile with their families.''
 Steven Cicero, a friend of Ms. Raffo's, said that he was interviewed by the authorities late last week and that they asked about a crack dealer who had been sleeping in the living room of her Ocean Avenue apartment, and about two men from Howard Beach. Mr. Cicero, who is from Ozone Park, Queens, said the investigators indicated that they had been to Queens over the last two weeks.
 ''They showed me pictures of two guys from Howard Beach, one scruffy guy and one with big ears,'' Mr. Cicero said. ''They said these guys are from your neck of the woods. They asked me if I knew Lenny's Clam Bar in Howard Beach. I hate to say it, but it doesn't sound like they really got anything right now.''
 The owner and manager at Lenny's Clam Bar said on Friday that no detectives had come to inquire about the Atlantic City killings.
 Mr. Hessee, who stayed in Room 104 at the Fox Manor Hotel from Oct. 2 to Oct. 23, said he had met both Ms. Raffo and Ms. Breidor, who would each take a room at the hotel from time to time. He said that he was a born-again Christian who vigorously disapproved of prostitution, and insisted he was not involved in the killings.
 ''Prostitution is blood money,'' he said. ''A prostitute is already living in hell. It is a sin to pay for sex and a sin to take money for sex.'' He added, ''I do not associate on a social level with prostitutes or drug addicts.''
 Mr. Hessee also denied that he had kept women's shoes in his room at the Fox Manor, although a hotel manager and a female guest said they told investigators that they had seen about a half-dozen pairs. Mr. Hessee, who was wearing size 8 1/2 white sneakers, said that when the two detectives interviewed him late last week at a room he now rents on South Florida Avenue, they looked through his closet for women's footwear and found none.
 The female guest at the Fox Manor said she told investigators that Mr. Hessee had wanted to caress her feet and that he had given her a pair of women's shoes. Mr. Hessee, who said he once worked as a massage therapist, said he had offered to rub her feet because she was complaining about pain. 
 According to court records in Juneau, Alaska, where Mr. Hessee used to live, his wife at the time filed a domestic violence complaint in civil court in 2001, and a judge issued an injunction. Records show that after another domestic violence charge, the couple divorced in 2003.

HEADLINE: Hevesi Pleads Guilty to a Felony and Resigns

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
After calmly assuring a judge that he was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and agreeing to pay a $50 fee so that his DNA could be included in a statewide database of convicted felons, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi pleaded guilty Friday morning to defrauding the government and resigned from office.
 Mr. Hevesi, the state's top fiscal watchdog, told the court in a hoarse voice that one of the state workers he had assigned as a driver for his wife, Carol, had done much more than provide security for her. Prosecutors filed court papers revealing that the worker had also watered her plants, driven her to Bloomingdale's and dropped off her dry cleaning.
''I apologize to the court, but until this issue became a public matter, I did not plan to reimburse the state for his time,'' Mr. Hevesi told the court under oath, in a reversal of the statements he made this fall during his successful re-election campaign. 
 In a deal with the Albany County district attorney's office, Mr. Hevesi pleaded guilty to a single felony, agreed to pay a $5,000 fine on top of the more than $206,000 he has already reimbursed the state, and agreed to resign for the rest of his current term and for the term that begins Jan. 1. The agreement will spare him prison time.
 His resignation, which took effect immediately, left the comptroller's office being run by Thomas Sanzillo, the first deputy comptroller. The State Legislature, which will choose Mr. Hevesi's successor, is unlikely to do so until mid- to late-January at the earliest, officials said. That could lead to a constitutional showdown about the post. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki said Friday that he was concerned about the long lag time before the Legislature selects Mr. Hevesi's successor, given that the state comptroller is the sole trustee of the state's $145.7 billion pension fund and its investments. An aide to the governor said that Mr. Pataki was exploring whether he can appoint an interim comptroller -- something Assembly Democrats say he cannot do. 
 ''I'm concerned about, in the interim, what might happen here,'' Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in the Capitol. ''It's a more than $100 billion fund that is in trust for the people of this state, particularly the retired employees of this state, and the stock market and the world economy can be very volatile. And I am concerned that if there is another 10-week or longer process, as to how that office will function.''
 But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who has the most influence in picking a new comptroller, said that he was ''comfortable'' with Mr. Sanzillo serving in the interim, and questioned the governor's legal authority to fill the post. A spokesman for the State Senate said the Senate was looking into the issue.
 The comptroller's office recently blocked several large contracts the governor had sought.
 The resignation and the guilty plea capped a stunning fall from grace for an official who was first elected to the State Assembly 35 years ago, and who went on to serve as New York City comptroller for eight years before running unsuccessfully for mayor in 2001 and then being elected state comptroller in 2002.
 Mr. Hevesi arrived at the courthouse at 10:15 a.m. on foot, surrounded by his lawyers and his children, and exchanged pleasantries with the reporters and photographers who had gathered there before going inside to be processed, and to pose for a mug shot. An hour later, he entered his plea in a packed courtroom. 
 For more than half an hour, Albany County Judge Stephen W. Herrick went over the terms of the plea agreement and asked him routine questions like whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Then, the judge asked Mr. Hevesi, ''How do you plead to Superior Court Information 06-473 charging you with defrauding the government in violation of Section 195.20 of the penal law?'' 
 ''I plead guilty, sir,'' Mr. Hevesi replied. 
 The comptroller signed a letter addressed to Mr. Silver, the Assembly speaker, and Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, writing, ''I hereby resign my position as comptroller of the state of New York effective immediately.''
 The letter states that he also resigns his position for the term that begins Jan. 1, but Judge Herrick said Mr. Hevesi would need to send a second letter postmarked after Jan. 1 to resign from the next term. The judge set sentencing for Feb. 9. Officials said Mr. Hevesi is not expected to face jail time if he meets the terms of the plea. 
 Outside the courthouse, Mr. Hevesi faced a group of reporters and photographers and apologized to the people of New York, his family and ''the 2,400 professionals in the comptroller's office, who have done a remarkable job over the last four years, maybe unprecedented job, in protecting the taxpayers and leading a reform movement.'' 
 A deposition prosecutors filed in court on Friday detailed the many personal errands that the main driver assigned to Mrs. Hevesi, Nicholas Acquafredda, had done for her, including picking up dishes from her sister, driving her to Bloomingdale's and staying in the car while she shopped and picking up items for her at B.J.'s Wholesale Club. The deposition said that Mr. Acquafredda also performed work at her house, including taking out the trash, hanging curtains and picture frames, and moving her furniture.
 The plea agreement was a high-profile victory for the new Albany County district attorney, P. David Soares, who has vowed to bring more government corruption cases. Mr. Soares said that his office had received ''a number of tips of improprieties'' in government and that it would look into them, but lamented that his staff is small.
 The plea deal also removed a significant potential headache for Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat who had made it clear that he would seek Mr. Hevesi's removal from office next year if necessary -- which could have cost him significant political capital.
 Mr. Spitzer called the comptroller's resignation ''a sad but necessary action'' and went on to list some of the qualifications he would like to see in a new comptroller.
 ''He or she should have significant experience in financial matters,'' he said in a statement. ''This is imperative given the comptroller's role in managing one of the nation's largest pension funds; and he or she should be a person of unquestioned integrity who will act independently in the interests of taxpayers.''
 The next comptroller will be chosen by both houses of the 212-member Legislature voting together, meaning that the next comptroller will need the votes of 107 lawmakers, giving Mr. Silver and the 108 Assembly Democrats the upper hand in selecting Mr. Hevesi's successor. Mr. Silver said in a statement that the Legislature would do so ''in partnership with the governor-elect.'' Already a number of Assembly members, a county comptroller and others have expressed interest in the post. 
 The charge that Mrs. Hevesi used a state worker as a driver was first brought by J. Christopher Callaghan, his little-known, under-funded opponent, before he decisively lost the November election to Mr. Hevesi.
 ''Albany is constantly ridiculed as a dysfunctional state government,'' he said in a statement. ''But in this instance, when the people seem oddly content with an ethically challenged comptroller, Albany's standards were higher. It makes me hopeful.''

HEADLINE: Optimism Is Reason To Worry 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
STOCKS are about to finish a fourth straight winning year, the Federal Reserve may be engineering a soft landing for the economy, and valuations still seem reasonable. But instead of celebrating all that is going right entering 2007, it may be more sensible to consider what could go wrong.
 When investment advisers are asked to consult their inner skeptic, they tend to be more than up to the challenge. They can visualize potential pitfalls ranging from the financial (soaring bond yields, an oil shock, a hedge fund blowup) to the political (trade barriers, an escalation of tension involving Iran, Iraq or North Korea) and even the biological (an outbreak of SARS or bird flu). 
What these notions are mostly, is hypothetical. With the odd exception, portfolio managers, strategists and economists say they expect further gains for stocks and stress that they are not predicting these events, just raising their possibility.
 Because bull markets tend to end when sentiment is most positive, the rampant optimism -- affirmed in numerous rosy forecasts issued by investment banks and fund providers -- rather than any specific event may be the most formidable obstacle to another up year.
 How bullish is Wall Street? When asked what could halt the rally, Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, said the answer might be a more exuberant rally -- a ''melt-up'' driven by an overwhelming absence of investor anxiety.
 ''The bull market itself might set the stage for its own demise sometime next year,'' he said.
 As potential hazards continue to be discounted or ignored, inconsistencies are beginning to creep into the pricing of some assets, and investors are increasingly relying on rationalizations and leaps of logic to justify hopeful forecasts.
 Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research, noted that Treasury bond yields have fallen while yields on short-term debt have headed higher, signaling economic weakness. Meanwhile, he said, yields on low-grade corporate bonds have fallen even further, a move that makes sense only in an economy robust enough to keep cash flowing to shaky businesses.
 In another apparent contradiction, some analysts forecast subdued growth this year, yet they call for continued double-digit percentage gains in profits. They may acknowledge the discrepancy and invoke the prospect of cost cuts or productivity gains to try to explain, but that will only take them so far, said Ben Inker, director of asset allocation at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company. ''An individual company can become more profitable by cutting costs, but the whole economy can't,'' he said. 
 Mr. Inker is a rare pessimist. He expects stocks to be flat over the next seven years, after adjusting for inflation, as corporate profitability reverts to historical norms.
 ''We're concerned that profits as a percentage of gross domestic product are at all-time highs,'' he warned. ''There is very little direction for them to go but down.''
 The bulls could be right. The surprise may be that there are no negative surprises. Rates may stay low and profit margins high, with no new signs of political or financial instability. Mr. Inker conceded that he made the same forecast about shrinking margins a year ago.
 But with share prices high and risks emerging, even if they are dismissed by many, some cautious investment advisers encourage selling stocks in more speculative sectors that have had a good run, say in emerging markets or smaller companies, and replacing them with blue chips with high dividend yields. Mr. Inker goes further, urging investors to hold cash.
 ''I would have people be conservative, however conservative they are willing to be,'' he said. ''The really exciting thing about cash is it's really difficult to lose money on it and it has a decent yield.''
 Selling winners and limiting the opportunity for further gains takes self-control. But by Mr. Inker's thinking, it will pay to listen to your inner skeptic before everyone else starts listening to theirs.
 ''There's a lot of money these days that is greedy and willing to take risks,'' he said. ''If you flip the switch and that money becomes fearful, the market reaction will be very different.''

HEADLINE: Shares Post Biggest Loss This Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares had their biggest decline of the month yesterday and their worst week since July after the latest report on American manufacturing prompted concern the economy was slowing.
 The market dropped for a third day after the government said durable goods orders, excluding transportation equipment, fell more than economists had forecast. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was the slowest this year as investors left for the Christmas holiday, when markets will be closed. 
Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum producer, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold paced a retreat for raw-material stocks amid concern that factories may reduce output. Boeing and Intel led the Dow Jones industrial average lower.
 ''Mainstream industrial America, which has been humming along at a good clip, is finally starting to slow,'' said Daniel G. Bandi, who oversees $2.5 billion as chief investment officer at Integrity Asset Management in Independence, Ohio. ''That has spooked some investors.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the week down 1.1 percent, the worst five-day decline since July, because of concerns a slowdown in manufacturing signals that businesses are cutting production. The index lost 7.54 points yesterday, or 0.5 percent, to 1,410.76.
 The Dow average lost 78.03 yesterday, or 0.6 percent, to 12,343.22. The three-day losing streak for both averages is the worst since Nov. 3. The Nasdaq composite index slid 14.67 yesterday, or 0.6 percent, to 2,401.18, falling for a fifth day, the worst streak since June.
 Some 991 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the fewest for a full session in 2006.
 The Dow average has slipped 0.8 percent this week, while the Nasdaq has declined 2.3 percent.
 Excluding transportation equipment, durable goods orders fell 1.1 percent, after a 1.7 percent decline in October. The November report came a day after a Federal Reserve survey showed factory output in the Philadelphia area contracted last month.
 Alcoa slumped 6 cents, to $29.24. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, which is buying Phelps Dodge to create the world's biggest copper producer, lost $1.01, to $53.84. Phelps Dodge retreated $1.31, to $116.90.
 Boeing, the second-biggest maker of commercial aircraft, fell $1.18, to $88.76. Intel, the largest semiconductor company, slipped 29 cents, to $20.08. A measure of industrial companies fell 0.7 percent for the third-biggest decline in the S. & P.
 The manufacturing reports this week suggest factories have joined the housing market in restraining economic growth.
 Home builders in the S. & P. indexes fell for the fourth time this week, losing 0.7 percent. Skyline declined the most, losing $1.38, to $40.20. Pulte Homes, the largest American builder, lost 9 cents, to $32.28.
 ''I don't think there is a consensus'' on the economy, said Ronald Kiddoo, who manages $500 million as chief investment officer at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Ill. ''The reports are trendless, and that is adding to the market uncertainty.''
 In the bond market, prices declined on the weaker economic data. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined 19/32, to a price of 100 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.62 percent from 4.55 percent.

HEADLINE: Those Leaping Lords Don't Come Cheap 

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Higher wages pushed up the cost of perhaps the holiday's most elaborate and fanciful gift package -- from a partridge in a pear tree to 12 lords a-leapin' -- as listed in the classic carol ''The 12 Days of Christmas.'' 
 Each year, PNC Wealth Management, based in Pittsburgh, tabulates how much it costs to acquire the gifts listed in the song, using a Christmas Price Index that typically mirrors the federal inflation-tracking Consumer Price Index.
This year -- no surprise -- the song's gift list is more expensive than ever, mostly because the leaping lords, piping pipers, drumming drummers and dancing ladies ran up the bill. 
 It was the first time in nine years that the rise in labor costs outstripped inflation, said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, PNC's chief investment strategist, who oversees the index.
 ''After years of stagnation, wages for skilled workers, including the song's dancers and musicians, have increased as the labor market has tightened,'' Mr. Kleintop said.
 The 12 gifts would cost a total of $18,920.59, up 3.1 percent from last year. That is less than the 6.1 percent rise chalked up last year over 2004, though, when the threat of avian flu kicked fowl prices up.
 The cheapest item is the partridge, a bargain at $15, the same as last year. The price of turtle doves, French hens, geese and swans also remained the same -- still a steep $4,200 for the flock of seven trumpeter swans, which are expensive because their variable breeding cycle makes the supply uncertain.
 But the four calling birds -- canaries, actually -- went up 20 percent over last year at a national pet store chain. 
 Since the index started in 1984, PNC has found that prices for goods generally have fallen while prices for services have soared -- for example, the cost of the performing ladies and lords has gone up 300 percent in 22 years. The only labor bargain this year was the eight maids a-milking, who earned the federal minimum wage of $5.15 hourly, which has not risen in nearly a decade.
 Low unemployment rates helped push the cost of the nine dancing ladies to $4,759, up 4 percent over last year, according to Philadanco, a modern dance company in Philadelphia.
 The cost of engaging ballet dancers to leap like lords rose 3 percent, and the bill for the drummers and other entertainers went up 3.4 percent compared with 2005, according to a Pennsylvania musicians' union.
 The pear tree, had the greatest percentage price increase in this year's index, up 44.4 percent to $129.99, according to figures from a Philadelphia nursery. Mr. Kleintop said ornamental trees were in increased demand for commercial landscaping.
 For those hedge fund managers looking for a show stopper, giving the gifts repeatedly as listed in the song for the full 12 days of Christmas (a partridge in a pear tree each day, for instance, and five gold rings from Days 5 through 12), results in 364 items with a price tag of $75,122, up 3.5 percent from last year's $72,608.
 While surely a time saver, shopping online for the shippable items increased the price to $125,767 because of shipping costs, up from last year's $123,846.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 23 about the costs to acquire the gifts listed in the carol ''The 12 Days of Christmas'' misstated the gift for the 12th day. They are drummers drumming -- not the lords, who leap on the 10th day.

HEADLINE: A Historically Accurate Indicator for the U.S. May Not Apply Anymore 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A WORLDWIDE boom is heating up at an unprecedented rate. Or at least that is the signal from prices in metals that historically have been early indicators of booms and busts. 
 An index of spot metals prices, compiled by the Commodities Research Bureau and Reuters, has been around for a quarter-century. It concentrates on metals that move the fastest when economic conditions change, and that has made it volatile.
But even with that volatility, not until 2003 did it manage to go up 50 percent in a 12-month period, and that was an increase from the very depressed prices that came with the worldwide slowdown early in this decade. The rise left the actual price level well within historic norms.
 But starting in late 2005, the level of prices began to rise in a way that would have seemed normal to a technology stock investor in late 1999. At the end of last month, the 12-month increase was 99.6 percent. An index that first went above 400 a year ago topped 750 early this month.
 The index is based on prices of zinc and tin, as well as steel scrap, copper scrap and lead scrap.
 For most of its history, the index was a relatively good indicator of activity in the United States, the economy that used the most raw materials. But the American economy did not surge in 2006. Instead, it seemed to be slowing a bit, and the forecasts for 2007 are far from euphoric.
 A Merrill Lynch survey of 393 money managers found that 20 percent of them expect the American economy to grow stronger in 2007, while 60 percent believe it will weaken. And 24 percent think a recession is at least fairly likely next year. 
 But the United States is no longer sure to be the marginal buyer of economically sensitive materials. That honor now goes to Asia, particularly China. That Merrill Lynch survey found that nobody expects recession in the region China is in -- defined as the Pacific area less Japan, although most think the economy will become a little weaker.
 The metal indicator may, in fact, be starting to slow. This month it is up only a little from the end of November, and it is down from the peak reached in the first week of December.
 But in the past, it has plunged before world recessions began -- and sometimes when they were averted even though economic growth slipped. The fact it has not done so shows that demand for those metals is still very strong.
 For the United States, struggling with sharp downturns in housing and car sales, the lesson may be that it no longer rules the world economy. An American recession used to bring on lower commodity prices, which could help stimulate demand. This time, it might not have such an impact unless the newly important Asian economies also turn down.

HEADLINE: Quicker Pace For Spending By Consumers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Keeping the nation's cash registers ringing, consumers bolstered their spending in November by the largest amount in four months, raising some hopes that December will be much of the same. 
 The Commerce Department reported on Friday that consumer spending rose 0.5 percent last month. That was up from a 0.3 percent gain in the previous month and was the strongest showing since July.
 ''It is clear that Santa Claus came to town early with this report,'' an economist at Argus Research, Richard Yamarone, said. ''You can't underestimate the consumer.''
 Friday's report also showed that Americans' incomes -- the fuel for future spending -- rose a modest 0.3 percent for the second consecutive month.
 The income and spending figures are not adjusted for inflation.
 Wall Street investors, however, were not inspired and the Dow Jones industrials lost 78.03 points, to close at 12,343.22.
 In other economic news, manufacturers experienced a rebound in demand for big-ticket goods last month, the department said in a second report. Orders for costly manufactured goods went up 1.9 percent, a turnaround from an 8.2 percent plunge in October.
 Together the two government reports suggested that the economic expansion was not in danger of fizzling out, despite strains from the deepening housing slump.
 The ailing housing market was the main reason economic growth slowed to a 2 percent pace in the late summer.
 As troubles linger from housing, more sluggish performances are expected. But some economists -- bouyed by the latest consumer spending figures -- think economic growth in the current quarter could prove stronger than most had thought.
 Thus far, consumers are doing their part to help keep the economy growing.
 In November, consumers bolstered spending on big-ticket durable goods -- cars and appliances expected to last at least three years -- by a strong 1.2 percent, the most since July. Spending on nondurables like food and clothes, rose 0.7 percent, after a 0.6 percent cut the month before. Spending on services increased 0.4 percent, after a 0.6 percent rise.
 With spending growth outpacing income growth, Americans' personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- dipped to a negative 1 percent in November, the worst showing since August.
 In the manufacturing report, new orders to factories rose in November for computers and communications equipment, as well as cars and airplanes. But demand for machinery, electrical equipment and primary metals, including steel, ebbed.
 Manufacturers are having to deal with some fallout related to problems in the housing market as well as the struggling automotive industry.
 There was some encouraging news Friday about inflation.
 An inflation measure tied to the income and spending report showed ''core'' prices -- excluding food and energy -- -- moderated last month. These prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ended in November. That compares with a 2.4 percent gain in the 12 months ended in October.

HEADLINE: You've Hit The Jackpot. Now What? 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Yul Kwon just won $1 million on the television show ''Survivor: Cook Islands.'' What's he going to do with that windfall?
 Mr. Kwon, a Silicon Valley business strategic consultant, is showing the same intelligence and restraint that helped win him the money after 39 days on a South Pacific island.
''I have tried very consciously not to get too ahead of myself on what to do,'' he said in an interview this week. ''I plan on sitting on the money for a while so I can get my feet on the ground. I don't want to be rash about it.''
 It turns out that this is the single best piece of advice someone with a windfall can get. Many financial planners, at least those who have not immediately outstretched their palms, tell people who have unexpectedly received a large sum of money -- whether it is a lottery prize, an inheritance, capital gains from a stock or a house sale, or yes, game show winnings -- to do nothing initially. 
 If you do get lucky, the pause gives you a chance to think about the money, about yourself and how you relate to money, said Susan Bradley, a financial planner who runs a boot camp, called the Sudden Money Institute, for those with newfound wealth. ''Six months is not too long,'' she said. 
 Giving more advice on how to deal with a windfall is difficult because there are just too many variables, like how much it is, what form it comes in and how much you already have. Then there are the technical issues like how it affects your income taxes or the income taxes of the people who might share your largess. 
 But behavioral economists, and a few psychologists, have been thinking about this issue for some time and they have useful ways to approach it. People think of money in odd and sometimes irrational ways because money is wrapped up in emotion. 
 People tend to put their money in three mental accounts: income, assets and future income, behavior economists say. How much of it they spend depends on the mental account where the money is ''placed.'' Almost all money considered income is spent, though the conscientious may divert some of that into the two other accounts. Money regarded as future income is rarely touched, except in emergencies. 
 The middle category, assets, is trickier. That gets spent depending on a person's age -- the young need to spend a lot and the old do not spend enough of it -- and on the person's needs, a down payment for a house, for example, or seed money for a business. 
 Windfalls are so overwhelming for most people precisely because they can be dumped into any one of those mental accounts. 
 If it is a small windfall relative to income, people tend to think of it as income and spend it all. What about those $23.9 billion in bonuses that the Wall Street investment bankers are receiving? They get mentally sorted into the asset pile, so it is no surprise that real estate agents and luxury-car dealers are salivating at the prospect of a few quick sales of multimillion-dollar condominiums, vacation homes and trophy cars. 
 Windfalls that occur when a stock jumps in price tend to go into the asset pile, too. Sitting there, they have little impact on behavior. Michael D. Hurd, the director for the Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif., studied the impact of a windfall in the stock market on people nearing retirement. He found there was no evidence that people changed their plans and took an earlier retirement. 
 That could be because the stock gains were not enough to make a difference to most people who are not heavily invested in the market, he said. As for the wealthy who are, the gain does not make that much difference because they are already rich. 
 Mr. Hurd also looked at the effect that the disappearance of an anticipated windfall would have on those who thought they could retire early. Not surprisingly, there was a behavior change. They tended to retire later or went back to work if they had already retired. 
 Home equity loans are an interesting exception. People tend to keep the gains from a home in the same category. Even when homeowners extract equity, the money tends to be used to improve the home, in other words, reinvested into the same mental category as an asset or as a source of future income.
 Lotteries are a different animal, Mr. Hurd said. ''You'd see more behavior change because the reward is spread to people who don't have big resources.''
 A quick detour with a bit of advice on lotteries, just in case all this talk of windfalls has whetted your appetite for some easy money: If you are buying a single ticket when the pot gets above $100 million so you can enjoy two minutes of user-generated entertainment as you daydream about servants, Ferraris and playing bridge with Warren and Bill, it can't hurt. Buying several tickets or buying every week is not the basis of a sound retirement plan; lotteries are a waste of money. 
 So into what basket is Mr. Kwon sorting his $1 million? ''I am thinking of it as income flow,'' he admitted, even though he does not have a lot of money saved. Debt from college at Stanford and law school at Yale can do that. 
 The money is as good as gone, not that that is necessarily a bad thing. He wants to do something for his parents, who he said made a lot of sacrifices as he was growing up. ''My parents were definitely savers,'' he said. ''They exercised fiscal discipline.'' 
 The point of being aware of the mental categories is to deal with the emotional baggage that surrounds money. Anyone with a little luck is in for some soul-searching. The spendthrift has to decide if money is a means to an end or the end in itself: that spending is just so much fun. The security blanket types are compelled to hoard it because they fear they will never get it again.
 ''It isn't the rational space where it is coming from,'' said Michael Kitces, a financial planner in Columbia, Md. ''The emotional baggage about money will be carried around whether they get a windfall or not.'' The bad news: ''It will get a lot messier with a windfall,'' he said.
 Ms. Bradley warns her clients that they may not want money to have an emotional effect. But it does. They also have to realize that they will never make everyone happy. 
 ''I tell people, 'You can do anything you want but you can't do everything,' '' she said. ''It is a hard concept that people I work with grapple with.''
 Mr. Kwon's soul-searching surrounds wanting to contribute money to causes he believes in at the same time he invests in his own financial security. ''After you take out the taxes,'' he said, ''I suppose there would be enough to buy a small condo in Downtown San Francisco.'' 
 Looking at it that way, he said, $1 million doesn't seem like that much.

HEADLINE: Toyota Is Poised to Supplant G.M. as World's Largest Carmaker

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and MARTIN FACKLER; Micheline Maynard reported from Detroit and Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo. Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
After 75 years, the world automobile industry is about to get a new No. 1.
 The Toyota Motor Company of Japan issued a 2007 forecast Friday that would make it first in global sales, ahead of General Motors, which has been the world's biggest auto company since 1931.
Toyota, which had not even built its first automobile back then, expects to sell 9.34 million vehicles next year. That would exceed the 9.2 million vehicles that G.M. expects to sell worldwide this year. 
 G.M. has not issued its own forecast for 2007, but it is on a downward trajectory, closing factories and eliminating thousands of jobs, both in the United States and Europe. 
 Toyota, meanwhile, is opening factories and hiring more workers around the world to keep up with growing demand for its vehicles. 
 Toyota's dethroning of G.M. has been anticipated for some time. The first inklings of it came three years ago, when Toyota issued a series of goals for 2010 that would put it ahead of where G.M. was at the time.
 But Toyota's ascension is nevertheless remarkable for the simple reason that the carmaker has reached the top by borrowing many ideas from the American car business early on, only to improve them. 
 Even the first Toyota, the AA, introduced in 1936, was based on a Chevrolet. Toyota executives also spent months in the 1950s studying factories at the Ford Motor Company. In the same vein, their first American factory was a joint venture with G.M. in California.
 Later on, Toyota followed American auto companies into making minivans, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars, straying from Japanese automakers' original focus on fuel-efficient small cars.
 But Toyota departed from the Detroit model in a critical way. Where G.M.'s leaders followed the philosophy of ''a car for every purse and purpose'' set down by its president, Alfred Sloan, in the 1920s, Toyota has offered a limited lineup of vehicles for which durability and reliability were of paramount importance.
 Often criticized because its vehicles were too conservative, Toyota cars like the Camry and the hybrid-electric Prius are now often held up as models for G.M. and other Detroit companies to emulate.
 ''As far as pride, it hurts,'' said Ricardo Yrlas, 52, an assembly line worker at G.M.'s truck factory in Flint, Mich., one of the last remaining G.M. plants in a city where half the residents once worked for the company.
 But Ford's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, readily says he is an avid student of Toyota, something no Detroit leader in the past would admit. 
 For American consumers, Toyota vehicles have been ''a better value proposition'' than Detroit's products, said Mr. Mulally, who owned Toyota and Lexus cars before joining Ford in September.
 Already the industry's richest player, earning more than $12 billion in profits last year, Toyota has the cash to invest heavily in new technologies and products, forcing its competitors to keep pace or fall farther behind.
 But Toyota, for its part, took pains to avoid any appearance of celebration Friday. The company's results are ''wholly in thanks to the support of our customers in every region around the world,'' said Toyota's chief executive, Katsuaki Watanabe.
 Toyota's largest market will remain the United States, where sales are expected to rise 6 percent to 2.68 million vehicles in 2007.
 Speaking in Nagyoa, Japan, near Toyota's headquarters in Toyota City, Mr. Watanabe cautioned that economic conditions, like rising oil prices and instability in the Middle East, could interrupt the company's climb. ''There are grounds for concern,'' he said.
 Another perpetual concern at Toyota is protectionism. In the 1980s, the United States and European countries imposed limits on Japanese imports, moves that prompted Toyota to join other Japanese auto companies in building plants outside Japan. 
 Those threats are a reason Toyota has aggressively stressed its desire to be a good local citizen, supporting community programs in places like Georgetown, Ky., and San Antonio, where it opened a new truck plant last month. 
 ''If Toyota overtakes G.M., that is a very big deal,'' said Mark Hawkins, chairman of the United Automobile Workers union local at G.M.'s Flint truck plant. 
 G.M. and the union need to work together to at least try to prevent Toyota from displacing G.M., Mr. Hawkins said, because he worries G.M. would never be able to take back the top spot after losing it. ''Right now they've got a lot of momentum,'' Mr. Hawkins said of Toyota. 
 Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who will probably become chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee next year, said Toyota's strength came in part because it did not have to pay the full cost of health care coverage, a major burden for Detroit companies, and because it has benefited from the strength of the Japanese yen.
 ''If Toyota's worldwide production surpasses General Motors, it will simply provide further evidence of the need for the U.S. government to pursue policies that maintain and strengthen the U.S. industrial base,'' Mr. Dingell said in a statement Friday.
 A bigger concern for Toyota, however, may be its vehicles' quality. The automaker has been embarrassed this year by a spate of recalls, prompting it to begin a companywide investigation into the causes. 
 Mr. Watanabe, who made global headlines this summer when he bowed low in apology for the defects, expressed his regrets again in Nayoga on Friday. ''I believe it is vital that we faithfully hold to our belief that no growth can come without improving quality,'' Mr. Watanabe said,
 Yet that growth may be inevitable, at least in the view of Ford, which Toyota passed in global sales to take the world's second spot in 2003. Internal forecasts at Ford, which came to light this week, show Toyota will unseat it as the second-biggest player in the United States next year. 
 Looking back now, at least one former G.M. manager said he saw this moment coming. 
 ''We figured that we were going to have a problem,'' said Mr. Lynch, who retired from G.M.'s Parma, Ohio, parts plant in 1987. He often gave plant tours to visiting Japanese executives. 
 ''We taught them how to beat us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Seductively Easy, 'Payday Loans' Often Snowball

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: GALLUP, N.M., Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Earl Milford put up an artificial Christmas tree in the wooden house on the Navajo reservation near here that he shares with a son and daughter-in-law and their two little girls. 
 But money is scarce and so are presents. ''It's all right,'' he said, ''they know I love them.''
Mr. Milford is chronically broke because each month, in what he calls ''my ritual,'' he travels 30 miles to Gallup and visits 16 storefront money-lending shops. Mr. Milford, who is 59 and receives a civil service pension and veteran's disability benefits, doles out some $1,500 monthly to the lenders just to cover the interest on what he had intended several years ago to be short-term ''payday loans.'' 
 Mr. Milford said he had stopped taking out new loans, but many other residents of the Gallup area and countless more people across the country are visiting payday lenders this month, places with names like Cash Cow, Payday Plus and Fast Buck, to get advances of a few hundred dollars to help with holiday expenses. 
 While such lending is effectively banned in 11 states, including New York, through usury or other laws, it is flourishing in the other 39. The practice is unusually rampant and unregulated in New Mexico, where the Center for Responsible Lending, a private consumer group, calculates that nationally payday loans totaled at least $28 billion in 2005, doubling in five years.
 The loans are quick and easy. Customers are usually required to leave a predated personal check that the lender can cash on the next payday, two or four weeks later. They must show a pay stub or proof of regular income, like Social Security, but there is no credit check, which leads to some defaults but, more often, continued extension of the loan, with repeated fees.
 In many states, including New Mexico, lenders also make no effort to see if customers have borrowed elsewhere, which is how Mr. Milford could take out so many loans at once. If they repay on time, borrowers pay fees ranging from $15 per $100 borrowed in some states to, in New Mexico, often $20 or more per $100, which translates into an annualized interest rate, for a two-week loan, of 520 percent or more.
 In September, Congress, responding to complaints that military personnel were the targets of ''predatory lenders,'' imposed a limit of 36 percent annual interest on loans to military families. The law will take effect next October and is expected to choke off payday lending to this group because, lenders say, the fees they could charge for a two-week loan would be negligible, little more than 10 cents per day, said Don Gayhardt, president of the Dollar Financial Corporation, which owns a national chain of lenders called Money Marts.
 The new law will have little impact on the larger practice because military families account for only a tiny share of payday lending, which lenders defend as meeting a need of low-income workers.
 Mr. Gayhardt said the industry had prospered because more people worked in modestly paying service-sector jobs, and in a pinch they found payday loans cheaper and more convenient than bouncing checks, paying late fees on credit cards or having their utilities cut off. 
 Mr. Gayhardt, who is also a board member of the Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group that represents about 60 percent of payday lenders, said the frequency of extended rollovers and huge payments was exaggerated by critics. 
 He said the association supported ''fair regulations,'' including a cap on two-week fees in the range of $15 to $17 per $100, a level now mandated in several states, including Florida, Illinois and Minnesota. This translates into effective fees of about a dollar a day for those who repay on time, which he said was reasonable given the risks and costs of business.
 ''We want to treat customers well so they'll come back,'' Mr. Gayhardt said in a telephone interview from his headquarters near Philadelphia.
 Even so, higher fees and sorry stories are not hard to find. Payday lenders have proliferated over the last 15 years, including here in Gallup, a scenic but impoverished town of 22,000 with a mix of Indian, Hispanic and white residents and a striking density of storefront lenders.
 At least 40 lending shops have sprung up, scattered among touristy ''trading posts,'' venerable pawn shops and restaurants along the main street (old Route 66) and with as many as three crowding into every surrounding strip mall. 
 ''Payday lending just keeps growing, and it just keeps sucking our community dry,'' said Ralph Richards, a co-owner of Earl's, Gallup's largest and busiest restaurant. 
 Mr. Richards sees the impact among his 120 employees, mainly Navajo, some of whom become trapped by payday loans they cannot repay and, he said, ''develop a sense of hopelessness.'' 
 In one indication of how common the problems are, his restaurant alone gets 10 to 15 calls each day from payday lenders trying to collect overdue fees from his workers, Mr. Richards said. At any one time, under court order, he must garnishee the wages of about a dozen of his workers to repay such lenders. 
 The biggest problem, consumer advocates say, and the biggest source of profits to lenders, is that too many customers find, like Mr. Milford, that they must ''roll over'' the loans, repaying the same fee each month until they can muster the original loan amount. 
 Over several months, they can easily spend far more on fees than they ever received in cash and may end up by borrowing from multiple sites to pay off others. 
 One restaurant cashier here, Pat T., a 39-year-old mother of five who did not want to embarrass her family by giving her full name, said she had borrowed $200 last year when she could not pay an electric bill because ''it was so easy to do.'' It took her six months to repay the $200, and by then, she had paid $510 in fees. 
 Efforts to regulate the industry in New Mexico bogged down this year. Lenders hired lobbyists to push for mild rules, and consumer advocates were split between those who wanted to virtually shut down the industry and others, including Gov. Bill Richardson, who promoted rules like mandatory reporting of loans, limits on fees and rollovers, and an option for borrowers to convert loans to longer-term installment plans.
 Last summer, after legislation failed, Mr. Richardson issued regulations along those lines, but a court declared them illegal. The state has appealed. 
 The issue will be raised again in January's legislative session. Lt. Gov. Diane D. Denish, who described payday loans as ''stripping the wealth out of the low-income community,'' said she feared that the same political stalemate would prevail. In the meantime, Ms. Denish and many others say, efforts are needed to develop private alternatives to payday loans. 
 In an initiative that has attracted wide attention here, the First Financial Credit Union will offer an alternative payday loan plan, with a fee of $12 per $100 borrowed and a novel chance for customers to start building assets. 
 Customers who attend classes in financial planning and agree not to seek loans elsewhere will have 80 percent of their loan fees returned to them and put into their own personal savings account, said Ben Heyward, chief executive of the credit union. 
 ''We'll lick the payday lending problem when people learn how to save,'' Mr. Heyward said. ''When they kick the short-term loan addiction.''
 In the meantime, there is no shortage of borrowers. 
 Debbie Tang, a single mother of two, took out three $200 loans, with total fees of $180 per month, when her child support payments did not arrive last month or this month. Without a credit history to get a bank loan, Ms. Tang said she felt she had little choice but to visit payday lenders to pay the electric and gas bills until her grants for her nursing studies arrive in January. 
 Like Mr. Milford, Ms. Tang has put up a Christmas tree but has no presents underneath. She recently broke the hard news to her 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son: ''We'll just put Christmas off for a month,'' she said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about storefront money-lending shops that make ''payday loans'' misidentified the location of the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer group that said the loans totaled at least $28 billion in 2005. It is in Durham, N.C., not in New Mexico.

HEADLINE: Trump Fired Up

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
Donald Trump gives me an interview, though he has his doubts.
 ''I would like the interview to be in the Sunday paper,'' he says.
 He can't be worried about his exposure, so it must be his boundless appetite for bigger/taller/glitzier that makes him yearn for the larger readership of Sunday.
 ''Me, too,'' I reply. ''But the only way that's going to happen is if I give Frank Rich my notes and let him write the column.'' 
 ''I like Frank Rich,'' he says, his voice brimming with appreciation for a man whose circulation is bigger than mine.
 ''Me, too,'' I say.
 Kurt Andersen, who jousted with the Donald as an editor at Spy, celebrates the ''Daffy Duck'' of deal-making in New York magazine this week as one of the ''Reasons to Love New York,'' calling him ''our 21st century reincarnation of P. T. Barnum and Diamond Jim Brady, John Gotti minus the criminal organization, the only white New Yorker who lives as large as the blingiest, dissiest rapper -- de trop personified.''
 When I call De Trop Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he's still ranting about ''that big, fat slob Rosie O'Donnell.'' When he granted Tara Conner, the naughty beauty queen, a second chance this week, Rosie made a crack on ''The View'' about an oft-married snake-oil salesman not being the best person to pass moral judgments. He slimed back, and the Great American Food Fight was on.
 This past year was rife with mistakes -- global mistakes, bigoted tirades, underwear mishaps. Winding up 2006, I asked the celebrity arbiter of who-can-stay and who-must-go about redemption.
 In the case of Hollywood's overexposed and underdressed young ladies of the night, Mr. Trump judiciously notes that in some cases, carousing is good for your career. His rule is, the more talented you are, the less you should mindlessly party. But if mindlessly partying is your talent, go for it.
 ''Britney,'' he says, ''doesn't carry it off as well as Paris.''
 How about those other international party girls, the Bush twins?
 ''When you're a president who has destroyed the lives of probably a million people, our soldiers and Iraqis who are maimed and killed -- you see children going into school in Baghdad with no arms and legs -- I don't think Bush's kids should be having lots of fun in Argentina,'' he says.
 Should viewers give Katie Couric another look?
 If you can't get the ratings, he says, you're cooked: ''I like Katie, but she's hit bottom and she'll stay there. She made a terrible, tragic mistake for her career. She looks extremely unhappy on the show. I watched her the other night, and she's not the same Katie.''
 Can Gwyneth rebound from her comments comparing Americans unfavorably with Brits? ''Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress with average looks,'' he says. ''She likes to ride the high English horse. But when she puts down this country that gave her more than she should have had, it's disgusting.''
 Michael Richards and Judith Regan made irredeemable mistakes, in his view, as did Al Gore and John Kerry, when they couldn't win winnable elections, and W., Cheney and Rummy, when they invaded Iraq.
 ''No matter how long we stay in Iraq, no matter how many soldiers we send, the day we leave, the meanest, most vicious, most brilliant man in the country, a man who makes Saddam Hussein look like a baby, will take over and spit on the American flag,'' he says. ''Bush will go down as the worst and by far the dumbest president in history.''
 Colin Powell, he considers irredeemable as well: ''He's speaking up now, but he's no longer relevant. I call him a pathetic and sad figure.''
 He thinks John McCain has lost the 2008 election by pushing to send more troops to Iraq but that Hillary should be forgiven for her ''horrendous'' vote to authorize the war. ''Don't forget that decision was based on lies given to her,'' he says. ''She's very smart and has a major chance to be our next president.''
 He deems it ''not a good sign'' that Barack Obama got into a sketchy real estate deal with a sleazy Chicago political figure. ''But he's got some wonderful qualities,'' Mr. Trump says, and deserves another chance.
 And how about Monica Lewinsky, who just graduated from the London School of Economics? ''It's good she graduated,'' he says. ''She's been through a lot.''
 When it comes to having an opinion on everything, Trump towers.

HEADLINE: Decision on Catskill Casino Is Said to Rest With Spitzer

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Once again, it's wait-and-see time for proponents of a $600 million casino in the Catskills for the St. Regis Mohawk tribe.
 Somewhat unexpectedly, Gov. George E. Pataki has decided to leave the fate of the 10-year-old plan to build the casino next to the Monticello racetrack to his successor, Eliot Spitzer, according to a senior state official. 
The Mohawks and their supporters were upbeat about prospects for the Las Vegas-style casino last week, after the federal Interior Department announced that it was approving an environmental review, thereby eliminating a major obstacle for the project. The Interior Department has approved only three other off-reservation casinos since 1998.
 The tribe had hoped that Governor Pataki, who has long supported American Indian casinos as a key to reviving the Catskill economy, would formally concur next week with federal officials in determining that the project was in the best interests of the tribe and would not harm the surrounding communities. 
 But that does not appear to be happening.
 ''We won't move forward with a binding, long-term binding policy decision without the concurrence of the incoming governor,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 The official said that Mr. Spitzer, who has publicly supported Indian casinos, was concerned that his administration would lose leverage in the negotiations with the Mohawks if Mr. Pataki sent the Interior Department a concurrence letter. The state must also negotiate a gambling compact and a revenue-sharing agreement with the tribe before construction can begin. Mr. Spitzer's office did not return calls requesting comment.
 Although the Pataki administration completed talks on the compact several months ago, the document has not been signed. Empire Resorts, the company that owns the racetrack and would build the casino, signed an agreement recently not to transfer the casino land to the Mohawks until there is a compact, at the urging of the state. 
 Chief Lorraine M. White of the Mohawks said yesterday that officials should move quickly, given that the national political climate has increasingly turned against off-reservation casinos. 
 ''For these reasons, we call upon Governor Pataki and Governor-elect Spitzer to act quickly in the best interests of the Mohawk people, the citizens of Sullivan County and the State of New York,'' she said in a statement released yesterday.
 Last week, a federal official said the Interior Department had approved the environmental review of the casino, but the tribe and the Pataki administration did not get formal notification until Thursday night.
 State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who represents the area, yesterday called on Mr. Pataki to issue the letter of concurrence, as he has long indicated he would. 
 But Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly who owns a home 10 miles from the racetrack, said yesterday that while he still supported casinos in the Catskills, the governor should leave the critical decisions to Mr. Spitzer.

HEADLINE: More Liquor to Go With Faucets and Golf Balls 

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

DATELINE: DEERFIELD, Ill. 

 BODY:
Most chief executives are interviewed in their palatial offices, their rugs high with pile, their paintings straight from some record-setting Sotheby's sale. 
 But Norman H. Wesley, 57, chairman and chief executive of Fortune Brands, crosses the street in front of his headquarters building here and heads for a smaller building. And there, at the end of small conference room, is a bar and, on top of the bar, sits an assortment of Christmas-wrapped displays showing off many, if not most, of his company's most famous spirits.
Although the company has owned Jim Beam for a while -- and owns a wide range of other businesses making things like golf balls and kitchen cabinets -- last year Fortune Brands dug deep and bought a shopping list full of new liquor brands from Allied Domecq. 
 So perhaps it is not surprising that a lot of the conversation turned on whiskey. Following are excerpts:

Q. To run a $6 billion conglomerate, you have to be up on all the sectors, more so than in a regular one-focus business. Are you on top of all of these sectors?

A. First of all, we don't think of Fortune Brands as a conglomerate. We think of it as a diversified consumer business; and we're in three sectors: in the home products business and the spirits business and the golf business. And, as you might expect, they are very different product categories but there are many similarities.

Q. What are the similarities between home, golf and liquors?

A. All leading consumer brands. Across Fortune, 90 percent of our sales come from brands that are No. 1 or No. 2 in their category. All in what we believe to be good growth categories. There are retail components in all the businesses. So again, some similarities, some differences. For me, I ran the home business directly for a few years and I play golf and I drink -- and so it's very easy to get oriented to the spirits and the golf business.

Q. Tell me about the home business particularly, the Moen faucets and the different cabinets. The whole building market is off -- and you're off, too -- but you're off less than others?

A. First of all we haven't been off, we've been up, and even in the third quarter our sales were up. What we said was what we expect in the next three quarters. We didn't say we'd be down, but that we'd be seeing the impacts. When people think of that business, they think of large builders and the reality is two-thirds of the industry relates to repair and remodel, and only one-third to new construction. We're able to have less volatility than you would see in the normal building cycle. And then, separately, we have a history of outperforming the market. We think we've got good categories in kitchen and bath and in front entry doors and windows.

Q. For the last five years, your stock has been going wonderfully until the beginning of this year. Now it's recovering and in the s$80, but what happened then?

A. The market was anticipating a tough home market and my own belief is that there's an overcorrection. They painted everybody with a big, broad brush and they thought everyone was the same. We've worked hard to educate everybody how our company doesn't have the volatility. The market is looking out 12 to 18 months.

Q. Do you think it'll be 12 to 18 months to recover the building market?

A. No, that's how Wall Street thinks. We're now way into it, the building cycle. Some of the large builders and even some of the retailers have felt it this year. Some of our products go on at the tail end of the cycle, so we're delayed a bit. We've told people we'll see it in the fourth quarter and the first two quarters of next year. I'm not an economist, but I'm sure we'll work our way through it. This is a correction. Once the Fed quit raising interest rates, that was a real signal we'll work our way through it.

Q. I guess every chief executive is always shopping?

A. Sometimes your eyes can get a little bigger than your stomach. We wanted to take a breather.

Q. So now you can find something else?

A. We still have a fair amount of debt.

Q. We haven't talked much about golf. Perhaps you'll get to play with Tiger Woods when you sign him up to represent Titleist.

A. No, he just signed a new deal with Nike. He did play Titleist. And since he's gone, you might think that would be devastating. But since he left, our market share in golf balls is up 8 points.

Q. Are you a good golfer? A scratch golfer?

A. Oh, no. I'm a 15 handicap. I'm happy with that. My goal was always not to embarrass myself.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Higher Rates For International Mail 

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service said it planned to raise rates on international mail in May and rename the categories to make them similar to those used for domestic mail. For example, international ''airmail letter post'' and ''economy letter post'' would be combined into a single category to be known as ''first-class mail international.'' International rates would increase by an average of 13 percent. The price increase for first-class international mail would rise an average of 9 percent. The cost to mail a letter to Canada or Mexico would rise to 69 cents, from 63 cents.

HEADLINE: China Celebrates the Year of the Art Market

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
COLLECTORS of contemporary art had a new set of names to learn this year: those of Chinese artists whose careers are soaring in a new and frenzied sector of the market. Much of the art is politically charged, with references to Mao Zedong, Tiananmen Square and, increasingly, globalization and consumer culture. Among the hottest names are Zhang Xiaogang, whose ''Bloodline Series'' consists of portraits set during the Cultural Revolution; the painter Yue Minjun, whose portraits of Chinese men look very much like himself; and Zhang Huan, a conceptual artist who produces works like ''To Raise the Water Level in a Fish Pond.'' (That piece was part of a performance in which Mr. Zhang photographed local workers standing in a pool of water to show how little effect they had on the water.) 
 These images can be found in galleries, art fairs and auction houses in every one of the world's art-buying capitals, often fetching several million dollars apiece. Charles Saatchi, the London advertising magnate, collector and gallery owner, has begun snapping up works by Chinese artists, many of which he plans to exhibit in his new gallery, under construction on Kings Road in London.
 ''In a single year we sold over $60 million worth of Chinese contemporary art, whereas in 2005 we sold only about $15 million,'' said Henry Howard-Sneyd, Sotheby's managing director in Asia and Australia. In April, the auction house devoted a special New York sale to this category that brought $13.2 million. The prices have been climbing steadily ever since. 
 A November auction at Christie's, which holds its Chinese contemporary art sales in Hong Kong, brought in $68 million. Yet Christie's experts in New York and London think it's a mistake to market these artists in a narrow category. As a result the auction house also sprinkles such works into its general postwar and contemporary art sales. (Sotheby's holds auctions devoted strictly to Chinese contemporary art in New York and Hong Kong.)
 Whether the boom in prices for Chinese art will last is anyone's guess. ''It may feel like the first flush of fashion, but it's actually a much deeper market,'' said Brett Gorvy, one of the heads of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department worldwide. Mr. Howard-Sneyd said the soaring sales totals had more to do with years of underrecognition of these artists rather than inflated bidding. 
 So it may be an oversimplification to predict that this is a bubble about to burst. ''While there has been a rapid internationalization of Chinese contemporary art,'' Mr. Howard-Sneyd said, ''there's bound to be a correction, and then prices will simply level off.''

HEADLINE: On the High Line, Solitude Is Pretty Crowded

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
WE New Yorkers have a morbid fascination with pinpointing the death of a neighborhood scene. You wonder, for example, exactly when the seeds were planted for SoHo's grim destiny as an open-air mall. Was it 1971, when Leo Castelli opened his downtown gallery? The advent of Dean & Deluca's overpriced cheeses? Victoria's Secret underwear displays?
 But the artists who bemoaned SoHo's gradual reinvention as a tourist mecca in the 1980s would have been dumbstruck by the pace of gentrification wrought by the High Line, an abandoned stretch of elevated railway tracks that will be transformed into a garden walkway from the meatpacking district to Chelsea. 
Even before local activists picked the project's design team, Field Operations and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, two years ago, developers had begun circling the site like vultures. Today, the High Line risks being devoured by a string of developments, including a dozen or more luxury towers, a new branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art and a Standard Hotel. Already the area is a mix of the fashionable and the tacky, with tourists tottering from boutiques to nightclubs across its cobblestone streets, even as they recoil from the occasional whiff of raw meat.
 Not all of these are run-of-the-mill development projects: they include potential designs by renowned talents including Renzo Piano and the Polshek Partnership. And even more promising, a few younger, relatively unknown talents like Neil Denari and Work Architecture are getting the opportunity to design major projects. 
 But the frenzied activity surrounding the High Line shows how radically the development climate in Manhattan has accelerated. No longer content to allow gentrification to proceed at its own tentative pace, developers now view even the humblest civic undertaking as a potential gold mine. City planners who once had to coax developers to build in rundown neighborhoods are groping for strategies to keep them at bay. Pretty much everyone who has walked the length of the weed-choked High Line agrees that its magic arises largely from its isolation. Carving its way through the urban fabric two to three stories above ground, it is framed mostly by the backs of buildings and billboards, with occasional views opening out to the Hudson or across Manhattan. 
 The battle to preserve that ambience is being waged street corner by street corner, foot by foot. Last summer the city announced its final zoning regulations for the area, a document that is reassuring for its meticulousness. The guidelines require setbacks to protect some major view corridors; at other points, buildings are allowed to shoot straight up to maintain the sense of compression that is part of the High Line's charm. The core of several blocks, meanwhile, will remain zoned for manufacturing in the hope of maintaining some of the area's character.
 In rare cases, the Department of City Planning has negotiated directly with developers and their architects on a particularly difficult site. In a design by Mr. Denari for a residential tower, city officials allowed him to cantilever his building several feet over the High Line to compensate for his site's tiny footprint. In the rather dazzling result, the proposed tower gracefully bulges out over the elevated garden, a vertical tear appearing at its center as if the building were straining to squeeze into its allotted space. Views from the apartments would open up and down the length of the High Line. From below, the building would swell out over the garden walkway, adding a sense of vertigo. 
 But as long as they conform to the new zoning codes, the city will have little control over the form and appearance of most of the designs. And so far, few projects have risen to the standard of Mr. Denari's. Even more crucial, perhaps, is the question of access. As Richard Scofidio, one of the architects of the High Line, put it: ''We don't want hotels putting wicker chairs and tables all over the garden. We want it to feel that it belongs to everybody.''
 Striving to maintain that feel, the city has wisely limited the number of entry points. It will create four public stairways between Gansevoort and 20th Streets in the first phase. 
 Thankfully, the city has also limited the width of connections to the High Line from adjoining buildings to a maximum of five and a half feet. That way, any entry point from a specific building would function more as a bridge than an extension of the High Line.
 With guidelines in place, it will now be up to the Parks Department to determine which of the new buildings will get direct access to the garden. Already, many of the residential developers have sought permission to build lobbies that would open onto the High Line. This would undo the spirit of the project, giving residents of a few luxury towers a connection to the site that others would not share. They should use the public stairs like the rest of us.
 So far, there is no reason to doubt that the city will try to do the right thing. The partnership between city planners and High Line advocates has been one of the most sincere efforts in recent memory to protect the public interest from an onslaught of commercialization. And the Parks Department is working in partnership with Friends of the High Line, the nonprofit group that conceived the idea.
 But no planner can reverse the social and economic changes that are reconfiguring the city's identity. And the question next year will be what happens on the ground, as the neighborhood fills up with the usual cellphone stores, health clubs and Starbucks. What kind of sanctuary will the High Line be? Are we simply deluding ourselves into believing we can slow the pace of the inevitable?

HEADLINE: Art in Storage and Money to Burn, Museums Are Stretching the Walls

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
THE chorus of the country-and-western song ''I've Been Everywhere,'' popularized by Hank Snow and Johnny Cash, is a clackety-clack roll call of cities and towns, Reno to Fargo, Hackensack to Cadillac. 
 Over the last year the number of museums and art institutions that have built, are building or have announced that they will build a new wing or a whole new ''boldly transformed campus'' could easily add a new verse to the old song: Denver; Phoenix; San Diego; Boston; Toledo and Akron, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo. That is by no means a complete list, and it doesn't even look past America's shores to museums expanding apace in Europe and Asia.
If you add up the budgets just for the museums in the cities mentioned above, almost a half-billion dollars has recently been or is being spent on more room for art across the United States, much of it designed by brand-name ''starchitects.'' And this burst comes after several years in which museum renovation and expansion budgets had already grown tremendously. It's as if the institutional art world has adapted the old swim-or-die superstition about sharks: keep building or become irrelevant.
 In many cases the expansions have been driven by museums' desires to show more of their collections, especially more of their contemporary work, and to become destinations for large, crowd-generating touring exhibitions. But the projects are about much more than square footage and getting rid of the mothballs.
 Especially in some smaller cities they serve as cornerstones of urban renewal, emblems of civic ambition and high-profile announcements of the cities' intentions to compete for tourist dollars as the increasingly powerful draw of high-culture attractions is recognized.
 As the architect Daniel Libeskind said recently about his expansion of the Denver Art Museum, a $110 million project, ''They have an ambition to not just be a cow town in the Rockies.'' In a comment that could apply to almost any of the other expansion projects flowering around the country, he added, ''People began to see the museum not just as a building, but as part of a whole city.''

HEADLINE: Some Modest Gems And a Prodigious Opera

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
THE word ''Rediscoveries'' paired with a byline implies that the rediscoveries to follow will be autobiographical, like acquaintances lost over time and recently regained. Hearing in short order two Stravinsky orchestral pieces -- the Symphony in Three Movements (in Orange County, Calif.) and the ''Dumbarton Oaks'' Concerto (at the New York Philharmonic) -- took me back 40 years, to a young man making a right-hand turn in musical taste. More is good, these tight, spare, endlessly original pieces seemed to tell me at the time, but less is even better. 
 In October the Pacific Symphony, at its new Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall, could not quite get its hands around this difficult music, but a few days later the New York Philharmonic under David Robertson made the ''Dumbarton Oaks'' sound easy. The concerto appeared just before World War II, the symphony just after. For Stravinsky, ever the pragmatist and ever the chameleon, they stand historically between his so-called Neo-Classical period and his drift into serialism. Style and approach aside, economy guides both pieces. Music like this offered the possibility that more content could exist in, say, eight minutes of Schubert on the piano than in a two-hour post-Romantic symphony played by 110.
But in the interest of contrariness, I have to report great happiness at meeting up again with ''La Gioconda,'' Ponchielli's extremely grand opera, recently revived at the Metropolitan Opera. Sixteen years of absence and fading memories had not made this particular heart grow fonder, yet rarely was such fun to be had from such evil and bloodthirstiness. Excess and extravagance were everywhere, and the Met, with singers like Violeta Urmana and Olga Borodina in fierce competition for the audience's attention, wisely allowed Ponchielli's spirit to speak for itself. For someone spiritually married to Haydn and all he meant, ''La Gioconda'' controverts just about every principle I possess. Then again, husbands need the occasional night out.
 Another word of thanks to the year 2006 for Ian Bostridge's singing of Faure's ''Bonne Chanson'' at Zankel Hall in March. Listening to French songs, mainly through recordings of the great baritone Gerard Souzay, did almost as much to bend my young tastes as did Stravinsky. I have kept up with Duparc, Chausson and Debussy over the years, but Faure's exquisite sequence of nine songs had somehow drifted out of sight. The poems are by Verlaine, and in this performance a sextet of strings and piano replaced the usual keyboard accompaniments. Mr. Bostridge's sense of this music's quiet humor and discreet melancholy restored an acquaintanceship much valued.
 Since reticence and its opposite are the themes here, Morton Feldman as played by the pianist Aki Takahashi at Merkin Hall in October may be an appropriate closer. Mr. Feldman's music is more talked about than performed, but what a pleasure to hear once again its paradox of brief, quiet strokes laid over huge temporal spaces. That night Mr. Feldman seemed to me the Anton Bruckner of silence.

HEADLINE: That 'Free' Hotel Stay Gets Less Free 

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
WHAT makes a free night at a Hampton Inn in Daphne, Ala., suddenly worth 25,000 Hilton-chain award points instead of 20,000? Twenty-four-hour room service? Poolside servants? A swim-up bar? No -- guests actually are getting nothing significantly new in exchange for the additional 5,000 points.
 Call it category creep. Earlier this year, Hilton Hotels reclassified about a third of its hotels -- including the Daphne Hampton Inn -- placing roughly 800 of them in higher categories in its Hilton HHonors loyalty program and just 100 in lower categories. It didn't directly raise the prices for points holders, but it did increase the effective cost of a free night in any of those 800 hotels that moved up, requiring more points for a stay. 
Now, Hyatt and Starwood Hotels are responding with similar point-inflation moves, each adding a new award redemption category that requires more points for free nights. 
 Hyatt is creating a fifth award category that charges 18,000 points for a free night, up 20 percent from its current highest award rate of 15,000. About two dozen of Hyatt's best hotels, including the Park Hyatt Chicago, Hyatt Regency Grand Cayman Beach Suites and Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, will be bumped up to the new category starting Dec. 29. 
 Starwood is introducing a seventh category of award redemption, effectively raising the number of points needed to redeem free stays at nine of its top hotels, including the St. Regis Resort, Bora Bora; the W Retreat & Spa, Maldives; and Hotel Gritti Palace in Venice. A free night at hotels in the new tier, which goes into effect on Feb. 1, will cost 30,000 points in low season and 35,000 in high season. That's 10,000 more points than the current highest award rates of 20,000 to 25,000. Travelers might view this as a price increase in disguise.
 But hotel companies, which reimburse their individual hotels for free award nights, say their new categories reflect rising hotel rates and, to some extent, new features or amenities (though hardly major ones). Hyatt said its change is part of a plan to integrate its new hotel brands, Hyatt Place and Summerfield Suites, into its award structure next year. Starwood said it is charging the higher points in its new category for properties with special features like extra-large rooms. Hilton said its Hampton Inns have been getting better bedding.
 But for loyal hotel guests who are paying those higher rates at chains where they book regularly to earn points, the result is the same -- a devaluation of all the points they've been amassing. ''You are now getting less for your earnings for the same number of dollars spent,'' said Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, which tracks loyalty programs. ''The points truly have lost value.'' 
 The changes have spurred much discussion on Flyertalk.com, a frequent-flier Web site where travelers obsess over getting the most out of loyalty programs. ''I guess this is something of a rant,'' a Hilton HHonors member who goes by the name of Andy wrote on Flyertalk late last month, ''but I've been saving Hilton points for some time, and recently experienced what seems to be serious inflation in Hilton points.'' Andy said he was amazed, when planning a trip to Indiana for a family funeral, at the number of points required for free nights at Hampton Inns. He ended up using points from a different hotel awards program to stay elsewhere.
 Hotels say that changes like this are fair because prices for rooms have increased. When a customer uses points for a hotel stay, the hotel chain pays the hotel in dollars for that night. ''As room rates have gone up, the amount we have had to pay for the program has gone up,'' said Adam Burke, senior vice president of Hilton HHonors Worldwide. ''We're never trying to make a profit off of award rooms.'' But for the average guest, it's not easy to figure out whether the rise in hotel rates in the last few years really justifies all the point inflation. 
 In some cases, the point hikes correspond to the rise in national average daily room rates, which have increased about 14 percent over the six years ending in October, according to the latest data from Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., which compiles and analyzes information on the lodging industry. But the effect of Hilton's significant hotel reclassification, for example, is to require 14 to 33 percent more award points. 
 Mr. Burke, of Hilton, said that the discrepancy -- the faster rise of award-point prices than dollar prices -- can be attributed to high demand for some hotels. To encourage popular hotels to accept points for rooms on sold-out nights, he said, Hilton reimburses those hotels at higher rates. 
 At the far end of the point-inflation spectrum is the St. Regis Hotel, New York. A free night there or at any of the other eight hotels moving into Starwood's new highest award category will cost 35,000 points in high season, up 40 percent from the current 25,000. By comparison, since Starwood's loyalty program, Starwood Preferred Guest, was created and its redemption levels were set in 1999, room rates for luxury hotels in New York City like the St. Regis have risen about 30 percent, according to figures from Smith Travel Research.
 Starwood points out that its new higher category affects just nine of its hotels. But a posting on Flyertalk by the customer service coordinator for Starwood Preferred Services warns that more changes are to come: ''You might as well also be informed that a lot of other hotels are moving up in category for next year and very few are moving down in category status.''
 For frequent hotel guests who want to get the most out of their points, there is still some time to redeem for free stays at the current lower rates. Starwood Preferred Guest members can book at current award rates until Feb. 1 for hotel stays up to 18 months in advance. Hyatt Gold Passport members need to act sooner, before the Dec. 29 deadline.
 Travelers planning to use hotel award points should choose their dates carefully. Adding a few days onto a vacation after the new categories go into effect could result in a charge at the new rates -- a surprise some guests might not be ready for.

HEADLINE: When Art Stayed Too Long At the Fair

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
WITH so much hype generated, so much cash exchanged and so much new product churned out, how did the 2006 New York art season end up such a piddling affair? 
 The city's big museums are partly to blame, as their high-profile exhibitions abandoned any pretense of offering critically challenging views of the past. Boilerplate shows -- at the Met, ''Cezanne to Picasso,'' ''Americans in Paris, 1860-1900'' and ''Glitter and Doom: German Portraits From the 1920s''; the Whitney's ''Picasso and American Art''; and ''Spanish Painting From El Greco to Picasso'' at the Guggenheim -- went to the expense of assembling scads of sexy pictures, then not only failed to tell us anything fresh, but also reinforced every art-historical cliche we cherish.
 This is the museum treating its audience like kids in a candy store rather than like adults who can accept that art is as poisonous as it is sweet, that it tells as many lies as truths. 
 Once, we might have turned to contemporary art for alternative energy. But in 2006, it just complacently provided blasts of commercial triumphalism. The art fair matured into a kind of joke, a revenge on everything 1990s, with parties replacing politics and skill valued over ideas. In an age of universal competence and a democracy of art-schooled polish, criticism could have cast a cold eye on the field, but it took a pass on ethical issues and stuck to product placement instead. 
 Yes, the 2006 boom art market brought benefits -- the most important probably being that more New York artists could make a living from their work. But here, as in all else, the art world is just the real world writ small: the major share of profits ended up in a very few privileged hands. 
 But what's the point of kvetching? Art has always been attracted to money, and vice versa. And it has almost always been a servant to the elite, an advertisement for the status quo. Every so often art forcefully and collectively proposes alternative models -- but 2006, at least as played out in New York, was not such a time. Short of an economic bump, we're not likely to see it happen soon.
 So maybe we should stop pestering art to be some utopian undertaking, some zone for alternative thoughts and forms, and just enjoy it for the high-energy, no-impact game of trivial pursuit it has become.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Production (And Maybe Innovation)

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
AMERICAN manufacturers no longer make subway cars. They are imported now, and the skills required to make them are disappearing in the United States. Similarly, imports are an ever-bigger source of refrigerators, household furnishings, auto and aircraft parts, machine tools and a host of everyday consumer products much in demand in America, but increasingly not made here. 
 Import penetration, as it is called, worried economists and policymakers when it first became noticeable 20 years ago. Many considered factory production a crucial component of the nation's wealth and power. As imports gained ground, however, that view changed; the experts shifted the emphasis from production to design and innovation. Let others produce what Americans think up. 
Or as Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, put it: ''We want people who can design iPods, not make them.'' 
 But over the long run, can invention and design be separated from production? That question is rarely asked today. The debate instead centers on the loss of well-paying factory jobs and on the swelling trade deficit in manufactured goods. When the linkage does come up, the answer is surprisingly affirmative: Yes, invention and production are intertwined.
 ''Most innovation does not come from some disembodied laboratory,'' said Stephen S. Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy at the University of California, Berkeley. ''In order to innovate in what you make, you have to be pretty good at making it -- and we are losing that ability.''
 Mr. Cohen is a partisan. He was a co-author of the 1987 book ''Manufacturing Matters,'' one of the first to sound an alarm as imports began to displace domestic output. But even the National Association of Manufacturers, which is supportive of members like Whirlpool and General Electric who shift production abroad, agrees that sooner or later innovation and production must go hand in hand.
 Franklin J. Vargo, the association's vice president for international economic affairs, sounds even more concerned than Mr. Cohen. ''If manufacturing production declines in the United States,'' he said, ''at some point we will go below critical mass and then the center of innovation will shift outside the country and that will really begin a decline in our living standards.''
 As it is with global warming, the crisis is in the future. Manufacturing output is not likely to fall below critical mass, as Mr. Vargo puts it, in this generation -- or perhaps for several generations. The United States is still a powerhouse in manufacturing, and the output of the nation's factories continues to rise. The problem is that the craving for manufactured goods in this country is rising faster than output, and imports are filling the gap, particularly in crucial industries.
 Measuring this growing shortfall is imprecise. The government does not do the calculation, and outsiders must put together numbers from more than one federal database to make estimates. Mr. Zandi of Moody's Economy.com calculates that 20.5 percent of the manufactured goods bought in America last year were imported. That was up from 11.7 percent in 1992 and 20 percent in 2004. Only once since 1992 did the penetration rate slip -- by four-tenths of a percentage point in 2001, a recession year. 
 The other big industrial nations -- France, Germany, Japan, England, Canada -- also find themselves importing more and more of what they consume. In this comparison, the United States is not even high on the list, reflecting its preglobalization starting point in the 1970s as a much more closed economy than the others. 
 But the country-to-country comparisons hide a disturbing trend. Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, argues that in this country, import penetration is rising faster in core industries like machine-tool building than it is in other countries. And these are the industries that are, or should be, centers of innovation and invention.
 ''If you keep some production here, that is O.K.,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But a lot of companies are not doing that, or slowly ceasing to do so. It is a complicated mosaic.'' 
 Mr. Tonelson's efforts to document the exodus are part of his job. His organization represents small manufacturers who keep production at home much more than a General Electric or a Whirlpool. They suffer from import penetration more than the multinationals. The Business and Industry Council even favors tariffs as a protective measure -- a red flag for many mainstream Democrats and Republicans, who shun any suggestion that they might be protectionist.
 Still, Mr. Tonelson, using the same data and the same methodology as Mr. Zandi, but delving into individual industries, finds that the United States is importing more than 50 percent -- and in some cases close to 90 percent -- of the machine tools used in this country, the aircraft engines and engine parts, the parts that go into cars and trucks, the industrial valves, the printed circuits, the optical instruments and lenses, the telephone switching apparatus, the machines that mold plastics, the broadcasting equipment used for radio, television and wireless transmissions. The list goes on.
 ''It is hard to imagine,'' Mr. Tonelson said, ''how an international economy can remain successful if it jettisons its most technologically advanced components.''
 HIS alarm is not widely shared. Most economists and policy analysts say America's growing service sector and powerful financial sector will eventually offset deterioration in manufacturing. In the short run, these optimists count on a falling dollar, particularly vis-a-vis the Chinese yuan, to put a brake on imports by making them more expensive, and to encourage exports by making them less costly in foreign currency. Thus will America gradually reverse its still-ballooning trade deficit.
 But implicit in this solution is the belief that industries gone, or nearly gone, will come quickly back to life, and that skills given up can be quickly reacquired. 
 ''Economists assume that the factors of production respond very quickly,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''They don't. If you were a chief executive, would you build an expensive factory here on the strength of a shift in the exchange rate?''

HEADLINE: Large Caps vs. Small Caps: Beyond the Guessing Game

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AT the start of the year, conventional wisdom could not have been clearer. After more than a half-decade of disappointing returns, big, blue-chip stocks were finally going to wrest market leadership away from small-company shares. 
 And you could argue that the vast majority of market strategists and money managers who placed this bet early in the year were right. Well, sort of. 
If you toss out January, a spectacular month for small-capitalization stocks, blue-chip shares have actually led the market this year. Since Jan. 31, the Russell 1000 index of large-cap stocks returned 12 percent through Thursday, versus 8.3 percent for the Russell 2000 index of small caps.
 But there is a problem with this logic. If you're a buy-and-hold investor, you cannot just toss out January's results. That is like throwing out the Oct. 19 crash and proclaiming 1987 a banner year for stocks. 
 If you consider the full year's performance through Thursday, blue chips are again the losing team, with the Russell 1000 up 15.4 percent, versus 17.6 percent for the Russell 2000. And as the year winds down, blue-chip fans can't exactly say that momentum is on their side. Despite large-cap outperformance in December, , small-cap shares have generally been the fourth-quarter stars, posting gains of 8.2 percent, versus 6.9 percent for their large-cap cousins.
 ''When suddenly, it appeared as if the Federal Reserve was going to stop hiking rates and the economy looked stronger than expected, globally, people said: 'I want to be back in the risk bucket,' '' said Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, the brokerage firm based in St. Louis.
 While this turn of events has frustrated investors in blue-chip stocks, it's not that surprising, said James A. Shambo, a financial planner in Colorado Springs. ''The market has a tendency to do that which most of us think it won't do,'' he said. ''It loves to humiliate us.''
 There are several bigger lessons in the recent developments: 

KEEP AN OPEN MIND -- Even if you expect one asset class to outperform, don't turn your back on competing investments. ''There's nothing wrong with thinking that small stocks will no longer provide the type of leadership that they've shown in recent years,'' said Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research. ''But that's way different from saying that they'll no longer provide you any returns.''
 The fact is that while small and large stocks often take turns leading the market, success among these competing assets isn't mutually exclusive. 
 Consider the period from 1995 to 1999, when large-cap stocks dominated the markets. During this stretch, the blue chips returned double-digit gains in five consecutive calendar years. But while the small caps badly trailed the large caps, they still managed to produce double-digit gains in four of those five years. 
 Heading into 2007, many investors again believe that large caps are likely to outperform smaller stocks, partly because of the age of this bull market and a slowing economy. But even if the big stocks outperform, ''I would say overweight the large caps and underweight small caps -- but don't eliminate small caps from your portfolio,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. 
 Mr. Levkovich agrees. He says he believes that in 2007, small and large stocks could post highly competitive returns. Based on current prices, he predicts that the S.& P. 500 index of large stocks could gain 13.4 percent next year, to 1,600. And he forecasts that the Russell 2000 could climb to 888, a 13.7 percent jump.
 Mr. Skrainka said the bottom line '' is that you need to own appropriate amounts in both large and small stocks at all times and stop playing this game.'' 

BE PATIENT -- It can take years for an asset class to regain market leadership. ''These things rarely turn on a dime,'' said Thomas W. McDowell, chief executive of Rice Hall James, an investment management firm in San Diego.
 For instance, after a long period of small-cap outperformance from 1974 to 1983, large stocks seized control in 1984. But by the early 1990s, it appeared as if small stocks were ready to reassume the lead, as the Russell 2000 index posted solid gains in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Yet it wasn't until 2000 -- a good seven years later -- that small-company stocks really took over, with the bursting of the Internet bubble. 

WATCH YOUR BETS -- Even if you think a turn in market leadership is near, beware the risks of short-term tactical bets on a single asset class. If you make such a bet on a large-cap rally, keep checking to ensure that the underlying conditions that drove your decision are still true.
 At the beginning of this year, for example, there were plenty of reasons to be bullish on large-cap stocks. For starters, blue-chip stocks had underperformed small stocks for the previous six years, and no investment can lead the market in perpetuity.
 This is also the fifth year of the bull market, which means that this rally is older than average. Historically, small stocks start to lose some of their advantage in a bull market's latter stages.
 Finally, investors tend to gravitate to shares of large, industry-leading companies as the economy begins to slow. That is particularly the case during recessions, when stock market gains may be hard to come by.
 Earlier this year, there was a strong feeling among many money managers that the economy might slip into a full-blown recession sometime in 2007. 
 But in recent months, those fears have subsided as the economy has proved more resilient than was previously thought. 
 Corporate earnings growth has also been surprisingly resilient. To be sure, profit growth is slowing. But earnings aren't falling off a cliff -- and small-cap earnings growth is still expected to outpace that of large caps. For instance, while earnings among the S.& P. 500 companies are expected to grow 10 percent next year, on average, profits for the S.& P. 600 small-cap index are forecast to climb 12 percent, Mr. Stovall said.
 As Mr. McDowell put it, ''as long as earnings continue to surprise on the upside and the forecast remains positive, people will be reluctant to make that shift from small to large.''

HEADLINE: Back In Style: The Fur Trade

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
TOM DeLISLE, sporting thigh-high waders, squishes through mud and cattails surrounding a pond near Albany, looking for wayward beavers that might have wandered into one of his underwater traps. Alas, his instant-kill traps, baited with Backbreaker castor oil, are empty. But Mr. DeLisle plans to keep trapping all winter, knowing that the pelts of beavers and other animals will grow thicker -- and may fetch a better price when he sells them -- as the months wear on.
 ''Come trapping season, it's hard to wait,'' Mr. DeLisle said of his pursuit. ''It's like a kid on Christmas morning.''
At his warehouse in northern Greece, Sotiris Vogiatzis, a fur wholesaler, eagerly waits for pelts from trappers like Mr. DeLisle because beaver is a hot fashion item in places like Russia and Turkey. Five years ago, Mr. Vogiatzis was buying 5,000 beaver pelts a year; now he buys about 30,000 annually, at prices that have climbed to $30 to $35 each, from about $26 to $28. After he gets the pelts -- known in the trade as skins -- he ships them to plants where they are sheared, tanned, plucked and dyed. 
 Once treated, the beaver skins make their way into the hands of fashion designers around the world, like Zuki Balaila in Montreal. Mr. Balaila has been working with beaver since the 1970s (when he was known as ''Kooky Zuki,'' because he dyed beaver in vivid reds and blues for American fashionistas). Today, he serves markets far beyond North America.
 ''Now we export to China and Korea, which is unheard of,'' he said, taking special note of surging demand in Russia. ''Moscow is like New York City.''
 As humble beaver skins circle the world at steadily rising prices, so goes the fur market as a whole. Buoyed by the globalization of trade and the broader reach of the fashion industry, sales of fur garments, trim and accessories amounted to about $13 billion for the fiscal year ended August 2005, the most recent for which data is available -- up 9 percent from the previous year and up 40 percent from five years earlier, according to the International Fur Trade Federation. The organization predicts that fiscal 2006 will show a further climb in sales. 
 A variety of styles and colors -- and for beaver, a new lightness and reversibility owing to improved shearing -- has also helped fur fly off the rack worldwide. The price of mink, the gold standard of the fashion industry because of its softness and lightness, is at an all-time high (about $57 a pelt for Danish mink, for example). Even lesser-known furs have caught fire. The show-stealer has been muskrat, the ''poor man's mink,'' which tripled in price during the last year, to roughly $8 a pelt. Lynx and western coyote skins are also selling well, while red fox and ubiquitous raccoon pelts have lagged. American consumers spent about $1.8 billion on fur last year, a 50 percent increase since 1998. 
 Looming over the entire industry, of course, are animal-rights activists such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, more commonly known as PETA. Activists have earned both enmity and fear in the fashion world for their in-your-face tactics, like the moment in 1996 when an unidentified protester tossed a dead raccoon onto the plate of Anna Wintour, Vogue's fur-wearing editor, as she dined at the Four Seasons. 
 While some designers, Ralph Lauren most recently, have abandoned fur after pressure from the animal-rights movement, the industry says that many more have taken it up. ''The last five to six years, more than 400 international designers have included fur in their collections,'' said Tina Jagros, executive director of the North American Fur Association, a trade group. She estimates that this is double the number of designers who included it 15 years ago.
 WITH sales soaring, the fur trade has become bolder about taking on activists -- even securing Osama bin Laden-like status for antifur marauders. Last month, the industry claimed a victory when President Bush signed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, which gives federal authorities enhanced powers to prosecute animal-rights activists for certain offenses. (The act defines ''animal enterprise'' as any ''commercial or academic enterprise that uses or sells animals or animal products for profit, food or fiber production, agriculture, research or testing.'')
 The main reason for the fur boom, however, may simply be that pricey pelts are now within the reach of a broader and younger population, particularly in developing countries like Russia and China. Innovations like knitted fur, laser-cutting, and precision dying techniques have also made fur more appealing. In another shift from decades past, fur is no longer considered intimidatingly formal. 
 ''People are wearing their mink coats with their jeans,'' said Melisa Smart of the Alaskan Fur Company, a clothier based in Overland Park, Kan. A few years ago, she even made fur jersey-jackets emblazoned with the numbers of the Kansas City Chiefs football players. ''You could order a red sheared-beaver jersey with the number 88 on it,'' she said. 
 Within the chain that delivers fur from the wild or from farms to wholesalers, designers and retailers stand the trappers, who occupy the most basic and brutal rung in the hierarchy. Fur farms provide about 85 percent of the world's skins, according to the trade federation, with wild fur remaining largely a North American commodity.
 Although eight states have severely restricted trapping, some 150,000 trappers ply their trade each winter in the United States, and at least 70,000 in Canada. Increasingly, trappers focus on nuisance animals like beavers, muskrats or raccoons that suburbanites want removed. For his part, Mr. DeLisle arranges his trapping spots with homeowners and, like most trappers, pursues animals only part time.
 Mr. DeLisle, a native New Yorker, began trapping when he was 13; his first catch was a muskrat. He recalls bicycling home with animals he had trapped, telling his mother about the catches, then skinning them in the basement, as he does at his own home today. Now his 17-year-old son enjoys trapping, too.
 ''It's either in your blood or it's not,'' Mr. DeLisle said of his hobby. A self-employed chimney sweep who traps for love of the outdoors, Mr. DeLisle caught 30 beavers last year. The $900 he earned selling those skins accounted for roughly a quarter of his yearly earnings from trapping, most of which he plows directly back into the purchase of expensive traps. Mr. DeLisle stores and stretches his pelts to dry them out and then sends them off for sale, generally to an auction.
 For trappers, the most important auctions are held in Canada. There are three: the North American Fur Auctions in Toronto, which handles 5.5 million pelts a year; the Fur Harvesters Auction in North Bay, several hundred miles north of Toronto, with more than a million pelts annually (Mr. DeLisle sends his catches there); and a small one for western pelts in Vancouver.
 Luxury skins like mink -- which analysts say accounts for more than 70 percent of the fur sold in the United States -- are mostly farmed. The largest mink producers are Denmark, with more than 12 million pelts annually, followed by China, the Netherlands, Russia and the United States. The other heavily farmed animal, fox, is concentrated mostly in Finland.
 There are more than 300 mink farms in the United States, producing 2.9 million pelts. Utah has the most farms, owing to a large feeding cooperative in the state, but Wisconsin has the most animals, according to Teresa Platt, executive director of Fur Commission USA, an association of mink farms. Fur is so pivotal in Wisconsin that one House member from the state, Representative Tom Petri, was the leading sponsor of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act when it was originally introduced. 
 For decades, farm-raised animals like mink have been getting larger, and the pelts more profitable, because of careful breeding and feeding. Russia used to be a leader in mink farming. But annual mink production has dropped -- to about 2.5 million pelts today from 15 million to 16 million before the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to Torben Nielsen, the chief executive of Kopenhagen Fur, the world's largest fur auctioneer.
 China's burgeoning mink farms have come under special fire from animal-rights groups, which have sought to outlaw trapping and farming worldwide. PETA has posted a video on a Web site, furisdead.com, that it says was made in China and shows animals being skinned alive. The organization recently opened an office in Hong Kong.
 People in the industry acknowledge problems. ''Some of the farms we have visited are a very good standard. They use full European standards,'' said Thomas Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong International Fur Fair, where retailers buy garments for their stores. ''But some of the farms they might take time to improve.''
 When the world's fur buyers gather at auctions, the atmosphere can be tumultuous. Mr. Vogiatzis, the Greek wholesaler, deals in most types of skins but buys particularly large quantities of raccoons at auctions. He describes the scene as a ''madhouse.''
 During auction season in Toronto, truckloads of fur flood into the 150,000-square-foot warehouse of the North American Fur Auctions. As the items are sorted and displayed, the warehouse's concrete floor becomes slick with fur and oil. 
 Experienced graders in white coats categorize the skins by type and quality. The pelts -- still stiff because they are raw and untanned -- are then strung together into carefully labeled lots of varying sizes, some lots numbering in the hundreds. As the season progresses, the warehouse becomes a forest of dangling pelts, and the air within develops an intense odor.
 In the refrigerated section -- which resembles a closet packed with pelts, rather than dresses -- raccoon skins are hung inside out (the better to expose blemishes), with their striped tails protruding below. They are hung in the cooler amid other skins, which on a recent visit included silver foxes with white-tipped tails, red foxes, coyotes, river otters and even a few dozen bears.
 Several days before the auction, buyers and designers arrive to inspect the pelts before bidding. ''When you have to stand up and check the skins for 14, 16 hours a day,'' Mr. Vogiatzis said, ''it's not the easiest job in the world.'' 
 Mr. Vogiatzis, who joined his family's fur business 22 years ago, is one of the largest fur buyers in Greece and says his company has annual revenue of $8 million to $10 million. He started as a fur manufacturer in Kastoria, the center of the Greek fur industry, where he and his father employed 300 workers who made coats from minks, foxes and raccoons. But 15 years ago, Mr. Vogiatzis decided to shed the manufacturing side of his business and to deal exclusively in skins. 
 ''It's like a small auction house here,'' he said of his operation. ''Going around the world, selling skins -- maybe it suits me better than production.'' 
 Mr. Vogiatzis has witnessed the advent of new fur markets, and the accompanying geographic shifts. When he joined his father's business, he sent furs mostly to Italy. Now most of his furs end up in Russia. 
 The No. 1 factor affecting his business, he said, is the weather. ''When the weather is cold, everything is good for us -- we can sell,'' he said. This season, however, he is worried about a warm spell in Russia. ''We depend on God sometimes,'' he said.
 THE fur boom marks a turnaround from 15 years ago, when retail sales in the United States were barely half their current level. Fur's earlier peak came during the early to mid-1980s, when many women, newly ensconced in better-paying jobs, were using their spending power. Mr. DeLisle remembers those years as a time when ''you would never see a road-kill raccoon, because somebody would pick it up and sell it.''
 But mink farms overproduced, prices fell for luxury furs and then all other categories of fur. The stock market crash of 1987, and the sour economy that followed, also hurt the luxury-goods market. At the same time, fur opponents were gaining strength. PETA was founded in 1980 and now has 1.2 million members. It quickly gained a following among celebrities and a reputation for attention-getting stunts.
 Although Europe -- where an appetite for beaver top hats helped push North American settlers west two centuries ago -- remains a fashion leader, it is Russia and China that are driving demand. 
 At the Kopenhagen Fur Auction, about 70 percent of the fur sold is sent to China, according to Mr. Nielsen. Much of that is made into clothing there and then exported. China, particularly its Guangdong Province, has supplanted Manhattan as the world's leading manufacturing hub for fur. 
 An increasing amount of fur also stays in China, snapped up by ever-wealthier consumers. ''In China and Russia, a fur coat is a symbol of success,'' said Mr. Nielsen, who noted that the same was true in Spain in the 1990s and Italy in the 1980s. 
 Russia's growing appetite for fur is not solely attributable to frigid winters. Some segments of the economy are flourishing on the back of high oil and gas prices. ''Russians have a lot more money now,'' said Mark Downey, chief executive of Fur Harvesters. ''They can afford more fashion design-type things.''
 People in the fur trade, meanwhile, say consumers are buying fur apparel earlier in life, with the average customer being 10 years younger than the buyers of 20 years ago, according to Mr. Nielsen. Another demographic coup also seems to be brewing. ''Men are wearing it now,'' said Mr. Balaila, the Montreal designer.
 BORN in Beirut and raised in Israel, Mr. Balaila never saw fur garments up close until he arrived in Canada in 1973 to join his wife-to-be. She greeted him at the airport wearing a fur hat and a fur coat. He soon joined his father-in-law's fur manufacturing business, which focused largely on mink. He started out sweeping the floors, but as the 24-year-old passed by the coats, he became inspired.
 Mr. Balaila, who as a teenager enjoyed sketching clothes, quickly developed his own ideas for revamping his father-in-law's business. To his eye, the garments seemed dull -- browns, blacks, whites -- and ''looked too old, too heavy, too massive'' to appeal to the younger generation. 
 He resumed his sketching and soon had his own label. In 1986, he opened his own design shop, using unusual colors and lighter styles. Mr. Balaila manufactures his own garments, which is rare for a designer.
 Despite producing only a few thousand expensive garments a year, designers like Mr. Balaila feed the global craving for fur. If fashion shows in Milan, Paris, New York and London are presenting more fur, or a new type or style, ordinary consumers start clamoring for cheaper look-alike items. Wholesale prices rise in tandem.
 In the 1990s, when Mr. Balaila offered his apparel in Japan, his beaver garments were mistaken for a type of lamb. Now that beaver is a more popular fur, he plans to exhibit 40 items in mink, beaver and chinchilla at the Hong Kong International Fur Fair in February. ''Those countries that don't have the weather to wear fur, they're looking for something new and something different,'' he said.
 About 10 to 13 beaver pelts are used to make a knee-length coat. With pelt prices rising, Mr. Balaila charges more for his work. A sheared-beaver jacket that he might have sold wholesale to Saks Fifth Avenue or Macy's for $2,000 several years ago would probably go for about $4,000 today.
 In Paris, Milan and New York, mink and fox -- both farmed -- have the largest presence among furs on the runways, and consumers are paying more for their mink coats and beaver hats. During the last five years, ''we've seen a 5 to 10 percent increase each year in the price at the retail level across the board, regardless of whether it's mink or it's beaver or it's fox,'' said Angelo Papaevangelidis of Four Seasons Fur in Toronto, a manufacturer and retailer that sells up to 1,000 garments a year. 
 Despite strong demand, the fur industry remains on guard. As a luxury item, fur is extremely vulnerable to shifts in global economic winds. The animal-rights movement is still a chief concern. There is a widespread feeling among furriers that while the influence of the movement has declined in recent years, it remains potent.
 For its part, PETA says serious problems remain underexamined. ''We get calls from the public all the time who find that their dogs or cats get caught in leghold traps,'' said Dan Mathews, a PETA vice president who worries about drownings linked to underwater traps. 
 Trappers like Mr. DeLisle acknowledge that accidents do happen, but they say that trapping is done as humanely as possible, and that new techniques are constantly assessed.
 The animal-rights movement has its own legislative priorities. The Humane Society of the United States is seeking better labeling of fur. Currently, according to the group, only fur priced over $150 must alert consumers to what type of animal it is from, and where it was produced.
 Retailers, always on edge about the animal-rights arguments, are often loath to discuss fur. For example, Harrods of London provided its fur policy for this article, but in an e-mail message declined further comment, ''due to the sensitive nature of this particular subject.'' Harrods closed its fur salon in 1990, but still sells fur-trimmed coats and accessories.
 A HOT topic in Europe has been cat and dog fur. In November, the European Commission proposed a ban on the import, export and sale of such fur in the European Union, after acknowledging that some had slipped in unlabeled from China. The United States enacted a similar ban in 2000. 
 As is true of many industries these days, all eyes in the fur trade are likely to remain on China. The country's mink production is revving up, and its designers are gaining reputations overseas for style and quality. 
 So for beavers and other furry creatures, the world tour is likely to continue. A beaver snared by Mr. DeLisle on an icy New York morning next month could find its way to Mr. Vogiatzis and a pressing plant in Poland or Greece. Then it might be shipped to Siberia as a warm black hat with ear flaps. Another beaver could become a light blue sleeve in a soft and stylish reversible coat by Mr. Balaila, sold in a Korean department store for thousands of dollars.
 ''Nobody wants to wear what her grandmother or her mother was wearing,'' Mr. Balaila said. ''You have to excite the people.''

HEADLINE: Before the Holiday, a Gloomy Week for Stocks

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Before heading off for the Christmas holiday, many investors placed sell orders, pulling the stock market down for its worst week since the summer. 
 Gloomy economic reports contributed to decidedly unfestive stock returns among traders who stayed at their desks: volume on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday was the lowest of the year. On Friday, the government said that durable goods orders, excluding transportation equipment, fell 1.1 percent. On Thursday, a Federal Reserve survey found that manufacturing in the Philadelphia area had declined last month. Concerns about the possibility of economic weakness in 2007 also helped to send stocks downward.
Alcoa, the aluminum company, lost 5.8 percent, the worst weekly performance in the Dow Jones industrial average.
 For the week, the Dow fell 102.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 12,343.22. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 16.33 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,410.76. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 56.02 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 2,401.18.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.62 percent from 4.59 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: The Hedge Kings Are Rich, but Will They Be Noble?

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
HEDGE fund managers and traders make an astounding amount of money. This is now part of the lore of the nation. Young millionaires, young billionaires, all hunched over trading screens and manufacturing money while the rest of us toil for peanuts. 
 How did it happen? Why do they make so much more money than other people in finance do, or than people in industry in general? Do they deserve it? What will they do with it? And who makes it all possible?
These questions would take an entire book to answer. But I'll just try to give a few answers that occur to me, and I invite anyone who knows more about this subject than I do to chime in.
 First, the money is basically being made by ''positive carry.'' (By coincidence, this is also the name of a yacht owned by a supersmart, supersuccessful friend in finance named John Devaney.) That means the hedge funds can borrow money, invest it safely and make enough to repay the loan with interest and still have a profit. They can do this because the cost of money is so low these days. 
 Why is it so low? Because the Chinese people save about 40 percent of what they earn and use a lot of it to buy United States Treasury securities, keeping overall interest rates low. The Japanese do the same, and so do the immensely wealthy petro-states. So when the hedge fund managers cash their huge checks and sail their yachts and fly in private jets, they should thank people living carefully elsewhere. Savings in Guangdong, China, mean mansions in Greenwich, Conn.
 But why do clients pay so much for hedge funds? Why do hedge fund managers get their fabled ''2 and 20'' -- that is, 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of all gains past some ''hurdle rate'' (the return on Treasury securities, the change in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index or some other benchmark)? This is largely a mystery to me. 
 I own stock in Berkshire Hathaway, where Warren Buffett has achieved a pretty good long-term rate of return. He charges all of us stockholders a combined $100,000 a year in salary, period. I own some index funds run by Dimensional Fund Advisors in Santa Monica, Calif. Their returns are amazing, and they charge almost nothing. Why can the hedge fund guys get so much, especially when it's documented that so many of them do not outperform the indexes?
 The answer to that, I suspect, is at least threefold. One is superior salesmanship on the part of the hedge fund guys. They just do a very good job of marketing their product. Second is what Alan Greenspan once called ''the lottery effect'' -- that investors will pay a lot for a shot at the 50 percent returns that some hedge funds occasionally get. Third, we hear only about the survivors; funds that do poorly and fold quickly are soon forgotten, and we do not see the managers' yachts or art collections because they don't have them.
 There might be a fourth reason as well, that some hedge funds trade on inside information, a process known as front-running. Time will tell.
 But some completely heads-up, straightforward hedge fund managers really do have very superior research capacities, superfast timing in execution and traders with great reflexes. Theory tells us that even these cannot outperform the market for long, so maybe the present flowering of the hedge funds is too short a time to judge.
 We do know that much of the hedge world's 21st-century performance has been bolstered by the fact that they could and did sell short in the market meltdown of 2000 to 2002. (That's why they are called ''hedge funds.'') If they have to make their money mostly by trading and going long -- well, only time will tell if stock pickers can genuinely outperform markets even with very complex strategies and products.
 I am inclined to think that some few will, mostly because of my own experience in the junk-bond and management-buyout worlds. From 1988 or so to 1992, I, in my miserable garret, was able to predict incomparably better than the markets which junk-bond issuers and holders would fold, just by careful and skeptical reading of public filings and junk-bond default data. The results were documented in Barron's.
 Also in my miserable garret, with just the help of my brainy researcher and colleague, Susan Gayle Reifer, I could easily compute the breakup value of corporations planning to go private, and often do it far better than the markets (although not better than the corporate executives who sometimes bought out their stockholders for pennies on the dollar). 
 If, with few resources, I could find undervalued companies or securities I figure that others with vast resources can do it more efficiently. This is where the superstars like David A. Tepper of Appaloosa Management come in and get superstar returns. It can be done, but who knows for how long?
 Mr. Tepper and the few like him are the magnets; their success attracts investors to the hedge fund world. Most of the new fund managers won't last long, but they may last long enough to pile up enough in management fees to live comfortably for a long time.
 However it happens, the hedge fund managers of today are often amassing huge fortunes. They are stars in the financial firmament. But clearly their social utility to the nation and to the world is hard to see when compared with the social utility conferred by an Andrew Carnegie, an Andrew Mellon, a Henry Ford or a John D. Rockefeller, who genuinely built a nation and a world. Providing liquidity for different kinds of variable-rate mortgages simply does not compare, at least as I view it.
 But there is a vast ocean of opportunity for these new plutocrats to make their marks. Four out of 10 Americans live modestly, at best. Tens of millions are in poverty. It would be a marvelous legacy of the hedge fund era if these players endowed the hospitals and art galleries and scholarships that made possible a better life for Americans with slower reflexes than theirs. Some are already doing it, and it's a fabulous gift of their talent and decency. 
 JUST for my part, while I see these Wall Street and Greenwich players as stars of a kind, I don't see them as the real stars of today's world; those are the marines in Ramadi, the soldiers in Fallujah, the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan. They are the real stars, along with the police in Compton, Calif., the schoolteachers in Brownsville, Tex., and the emergency-room techs in Chicago. They often need help. 
 I do my tiny part through a great organization called Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. TAPS helps the families of those American service men and women who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. If just one successful hedge fund wanted to adopt TAPS and help it with its grief camps and mentoring of widows, widowers and orphans, that would be a helping hand from the stars of Greenwich to the stars of Fort Hood -- a handshake deal to remember. 
 Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

 BODY:
Like the three services celebrated earlier in the morning and the four that will follow into the afternoon, the 10:45 a.m. Sunday Mass at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in the Pico-Union district of downtown Los Angeles is crammed to the rafters, even though the church holds nearly 1,000 parishioners. When I spoke on a recent Sunday to Msgr. Jarlath Cunnane, or Father Jay, as he is known by his congregation, he said: ''If we had the space, I think another thousand people might well come to each Sunday Mass. We're full, bursting at the seams, and so are most churches in the archdiocese.''
In many ways, this is the best of times to be a Catholic in Los Angeles. ''In the 1980s, we were conscious of dioceses closing churches all over the Eastern United States,'' Cunnane told me. We were sitting in his office in a low-slung new building across the street from the church, where the administrative work of the parish is done. ''Our problem is the reverse: were it not for the shortage of priests, we would be expanding our ministry.'' 
 This news comes as something of a surprise, given the fact that the last four decades have been such a catastrophe for American Catholicism. The statistics speak for themselves: In 1965, there were 49,000 seminarians; in 2002, there were 4,700. In 1965, there were 1,556 Catholic high schools; in 2002, there were 786. Mass attendance dropped from 74 percent of self-identified Catholics in 1958 to 25 percent in 2000. The number of priests has not fallen quite as drastically -- 58,000 in 1965; 45,000 in 2002 -- but the median age for priests today is 56, and 16 percent of them are from foreign countries.
 And yet, to hear Cunnane tell it, things are different in Los Angeles. Indeed, what he was describing sounded like a throwback to the glory years of American Catholic devotion -- the baby-boom era, when the native-born children and grandchildren of Irish, Polish and Italian immigrants filled an ever-expanding number of Catholic churches, often in places where there had been no Catholic diocese before, and they clamored for more priests to say Mass, hear confession, preside over baptisms and petition for more parochial schools. 
 In those days, young American Catholic males answered this call in steadily increasing numbers. To be a priest was to play a central role in the life of much of both urban and suburban America, spiritually and also in the everyday concerns of parishioners. The priestly hierarchy was overwhelmingly Irish then, and it remains so today. But that is where all similarity to the church of the 1960s ends. For if the priests are cut from much the same ethnic cloth as they were a generation ago, their parishioners are not: out of the eight Masses celebrated at St. Thomas every Sunday, seven are in Spanish, as are all three of the Masses on Saturday and two out of the three daily Masses. Parish business is routinely done bilingually, and priests like Cunnane probably spend more of their working lives speaking Spanish than they do English. New seminarians in the archdiocese of Los Angeles are required to be able to say Mass in Spanish (or another language of recent Catholic immigrants, like Tagalog or Vietnamese) as well as in English. 
 St. Thomas is in inner-city Los Angeles, but there is nothing anomalous about what takes place there. Throughout Southern California, from the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles and from Orange County to East L.A., almost every parish church is in the same position, or at least inclining that way. As Fernando Guerra, a professor at Loyola Marymount University, has said, churches in Los Angeles now fall into two categories: they ''are either Latino or in the process of becoming Latino.'' Although the trend is not as extreme in other parts of the country, it is being reproduced almost everywhere in Catholic America to one degree or another. Take, for example, another St. Thomas the Apostle Church -- the one in Smyrna, Ga. There, Masses in English still predominate during the week, but on Sundays there are four English services and three Spanish ones, despite the fact that large-scale Hispanic immigration to the state is a very recent phenomenon.
 Nationally, Hispanics account for 39 percent of the Catholic population, or something over 25 million of the nation's 65 million Roman Catholics; since 1960, they have accounted for 71 percent of new Catholics in the United States. The vast increase, both proportionally and in absolute numbers, is mostly because of the surge in immigration from Latin America, above all from Mexico, that has taken place over the course of the past three decades. Today, more than 40 percent of the Hispanics residing in the United States, legally and illegally, are foreign-born, and the fate of the American Catholic Church has become inextricably intertwined with the fate of these immigrants and their descendants. 
 Nowhere is this clearer today than in Los Angeles. One key to the history of the city (mostly forgotten by non-Latinos) is the fact that the great migration of Mexican nationals northward in the past 30 years has a precedent in the 1920s, when waves of migrants flowed into California after the failure of the Cristero rebellion -- an uprising against the abolition of many of the church's privileges by Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The regime of President Plutarco Elias Calles suppressed the Cristeros ruthlessly. (''The Power and the Glory,'' Graham Greene's novel that follows the hunting down of a ''whisky priest'' by government forces, is set during the Cristero rebellion.)
 On one level, this is all ancient history, yet for many new immigrants from Mexico, the echoes linger on. One battle cry of Cristerismo, as it was known, was ''Long Live the Virgin of Guadalupe,'' a reference to the apparition of Mary that Mexican Catholics believe appeared to a native Mexican in the 16th century. In a caustic moment, the great Mexican writer Octavio Paz suggested that Mexicans believe only in two things: the national lottery and the Virgin of Guadalupe. The fascination continues: ask any Border Patrol agent, and he will tell you that many of the illegal immigrants whom the service intercepts today wear tattoos of the Virgin of Guadalupe. 
 In the aftermath of their defeat, many of the Cristeros -- by some estimates as much as 5 percent of Mexico's population -- fled to America. Many of them made their way to Los Angeles, where they found a protector in John Joseph Cantwell, the bishop of what was then the Los Angeles-San Diego diocese. Though he was born in Limerick, Ireland, Cantwell was determined to serve his Hispanic congregants. During the course of his tenure, Cantwell created dozens of new Hispanic parishes and missions -- this at a time when race relations in L.A. were at a nadir, and the bishop's mostly Irish congregants wanted little or nothing to do with their Mexican co-religionists.
 The Cristeros arrived in the tens of thousands, but the current wave of immigrants dwarfs their numbers. Roger Mahony, the current cardinal archbishop of Los Angeles, likes to point out that the United States is reaching ''the greatest levels of immigration in our nation's history,'' and to him and others in the church hierarchy, the new arrivals herald a rebirth of American Catholicism. Many within the church also say that these new arrivals could reverse the trend toward more tolerant attitudes on issues like contraception and abortion -- what orthodox believers dismissively call cafeteria Catholicism. If Los Angeles is the epicenter for the astonishing Hispanicization of the American Catholic Church, it is also the site of a return to orthodoxy.
 The question, though, is whether these changes represent something lasting. Is this a real turning point in the history of the American church that will lead to its enduring revival or, instead, only another cycle in that history? A cynic might observe that while the Catholic Church in Los Angeles has a great new market to serve, it has had great markets before. After all, the faith of the Irish and Italians in the 1950s seemed unbending, and yet it eroded in the aftermath of Vatican II and assimilation. Then, as now, priests routinely described their immigrant parishioners as possessed of traditional family values, a deep historical as well as spiritual connection to Catholicism and a belief that the church would look after their best interests. As Mahony himself told a group of seminarians in a recent speech, the pastoral task today among Latinos ''is not much different than at other times in the church's life in this country, such as when Catholic immigrants from Europe -- mostly Irish, Italian, Polish and German immigrants -- came in search of better lives and looked to the Catholic Church for assistance in their spiritual, material and legal needs.''
 At times, there seems to be a certain wishful thinking in the church hierarchy's insistence on the unshakable faith of Hispanic Catholics. At the very least, it seems to underestimate the effect assimilation has had throughout American history on religious orthodoxy. With the children and grandchildren of European immigrants, the church fought what turned out to be a losing battle against the secular mind-set. As Latino immigrants become more settled, will they not, in their turn, choose to adopt views reflective of the American norm -- a norm in which religious ideals of community have tended to give way to individualism and the quest for prosperity? Monsignor Cunnane has certainly thought about the problem. Cunnane, who comes from County Sligo, acknowledges ruefully the decline of faith in his native Ireland and says of his new flock, ''We'll not let these people slip away.'' 
 You do not have to spend much time with the Catholic hierarchy in Los Angeles to realize how deep the church's commitment is to its Latino parishioners. The priests I spoke with praised the moral seriousness of their new parishioners and displayed a palpable exhilaration about the depth of their faith, an almost romantic, idealizing rendering of their spiritual commitment. As Cunnane put it, ''The renewal we've experienced has not just been in numbers but in terms of vibrancy of faith and in the sense of community.''
 This extraordinary flow of feeling seems to go both ways. At Spanish Masses all over Los Angeles, there is the pervasive feeling of ardent devotion among the congregants. Cliched though it may seem, what seems evident at the end of a Mass in an immigrant church is the sheer power of the experience. Parish priests talk a great deal about the need to make their new parishioners feel at home. To do so, these priests have tried to accommodate their habits of worship. At St. Thomas, for example, a mariachi band with the musicians in full ranchers' regalia stands behind the altar and intermittently steps forward to play. As well, fewer and fewer churches in greater Los Angeles make use of communion rails, and while this a tendency that is increasingly visible around the country, there is a particular informality and, more important, a particular intimacy to Masses in Latino churches. People bring their children, and the intermingled sounds of laughter, babies' tears and parents' admonitions and reassurances echo through the church as a counterpoint to service, sermon and song.
 At St. Thomas, as the priest moves among his parishioners delivering the homily in Spanish, microphone in hand, he can seem to an outsider more like an evangelical pastor than a traditional Catholic priest. As he steps forward to ready communion, the priest is aided by a number of female members of the congregation. Most are elderly; all are dark-skinned -- this in a congregation where people of every color come to worship. The communion itself is given with those who wish to receive it standing around the priest. From a distance, it can seem as if they are almost purposelessly milling about him, although, of course, the reverse is true.
 To be sure, it is still possible in Los Angeles to hear a more formal Mass said in English, in a more hierarchical manner, notably in the new cathedral downtown. But many local parish priests have done everything they can to break down the barriers between themselves and their congregations. As Msgr. David O'Connell, who has worked as a priest in the inner city for the past 18 years and now is the pastor of St. Michael's Church in South-Central Los Angeles, explained it to me: ''The church must always be willing to 'reread' our own tradition in terms of those we're serving. It's what we've always done.''
 Of course, the archdiocese has not severed its ties with the powerful in order to stand exclusively with the meek and the poor. The church is an institution that wields enormous political power in Los Angeles, just as it has always done. The city has a Catholic establishment, which, while not as old as that in Boston or New York, dates back at least to the 1920s, when the Doheny family held sway. Edward L. Doheny, who made his fortune when he struck oil in Los Angeles and later added to it with oil holdings in Mexico, left in his estate millions of dollars for the building of Loyola Marymount University. His wife's rare-book collection formed the nucleus for the library at St. John's, the diocesan seminary. The Doheny family has since largely faded from the scene, but decade in and decade out the archdiocese has maintained its influence. Emblematic of this is the fact that the list of donors who underwrote the building of the new cathedral reads like a who's who of L.A.'s power brokers and includes many non-Catholics, most notably Eli Broad, the businessman and philanthropist, who is Jewish.
 There are tensions between the church as an establishment institution and the church as the champion of poor Latinos, but they rarely surface. To the extent they are referred to at all, they are spoken of obliquely. Members of the hierarchy will tell you that there was some resistance to Spanish Masses when they started becoming the norm in the archdiocese and that there is some lingering resentment at how ubiquitous they have become. Some Latino officials, both clerical and lay, intimate that the church still has a way to go before the hierarchy properly reflects the composition of Catholic Los Angeles. And it is telling that it was far easier for Cardinal Mahony to raise money for the new cathedral than it is for him to raise money for outreach in immigrant neighborhoods or to support the social activities of parish churches.
 After the pontificate of John Paul II, there is little left within the official church of the spirit of liberation theology that cut such a swath in Latin America and to some extent in the United States in the '60s. And yet, on the grass-roots level, that spirit is not extinguished. A number of the homilies I heard could have been uttered by the leftist priests of the immediate post-Vatican II period, like Gustavo Gutierrez, the Dominican theologian, or Ivan Illich, the radical educational theorist whom the present pope, Benedict XVI, threatened to excommunicate when, as Bishop Ratzinger, he was the head of the Vatican's Holy Office. The organizing tool that many priests in Los Angeles use, which is to form groups of neighbors into communidades de base, or base communities, was itself one of the fundamental innovations of liberation theology. Within certain orders active in Los Angeles, above all the Jesuits, campaigns for social justice continue to loom large, and it sometimes can seem as if the social commitments of the church of an earlier era are alive and flourishing in L.A., no matter what the current Vatican line may be.
 At St. Thomas the Apostle, for example, the priest at the Mass I attended preached that while the powerful might hold sway on earth, their rule was transient and their importance as nothing compared with that of Jesus and of the faith. On one level, of course, this is standard Sermon on the Mount stuff -- Roman Catholic religious boilerplate. Presumably, it would be possible to hear such words in almost any Catholic church across America today. The difference, though, was the electric effect the words had on the priest's congregants. Some of the congregation nodded emphatically; others clenched their fists; still others sighed audibly with relief. This is not to diminish the centrality of the priest's religious message. It was a Mass, not a mass rally, after all. But the social message embedded in the scriptural passages, above all the call for justice and a validation of the dignity of the poor -- that is to say of the parishioners themselves -- evoked the strongest reactions.
 ''What the priest talked about today was what I feel'' was the way one parishioner, a middle-aged immigrant, put it to me later, speaking in Spanish. ''Not just about God or my children, though that is most important of all, but about the world, this world here in Los Angeles.''
 ''Yes,'' his friend chimed in, ''this unjust world.''
 Had the church made a special effort with Latino immigrants, I asked? The two men I was speaking with only laughed. ''The church doesn't need to make a special effort,'' one of them said. ''It knows us perfectly. It's part of us.''
 Would his grandchildren feel the same way, I wondered? That perhaps depended more on the hand America dealt them than on anything the priests could do themselves. But many priests I spoke with in Los Angeles did emphasize the need for the church to adapt to their new congregants, just as Bishop Cantwell did in the 1930s. By this, they meant not only stylistically and emotionally but also in terms of the church's social mission. The Rev. Sean Carroll, a young Jesuit who is an associate pastor of the Dolores Mission in East L.A., put it this way: ''Our mission as a community of faith is to try to realize as best we can Jesus Christ's injunction to us to make a reality of what he longed for.'' He added: ''Our effort is part of what it means for us to build the kingdom of God. Our engagement in civic life helps that happen. We don't see this as separate from our religious vocation but essential to it.''
 Such commitments have made priests like Carroll heroes to many in the Latino community in Los Angeles. At times, the reverence bordering on adulation with which they are treated can seem cloying. And yet, starkly put, it is a reverence based on need. The priests, for their part, are painfully aware that, as Monsignor O'Connell put it, ''for many immigrants, the church is the mediating institution they trust the most, in which they feel they already have a foothold and are treated with respect.'' O'Connell himself spends a great deal of his time trying to serve as a go-between linking the immigrant community, including those who are in the United States illegally, with the local authorities. Many people in his parish, he told me, ''exist in an underground economy, a cash economy. They also live in a culture in which there is a lot of gang violence. What we often do is go into a neighborhood, say Mass and then talk with people about the issues that most concern them. Often, that means crime. So we will try to bring them to meet with the local police captain. The effort is meant to give them a stronger voice in the local community.''
 Over the past 25 years, enormous numbers of people all over Latin America have become Protestant. In the smallest market towns of Tabasco or northeastern Brazil, you see storefront evangelical churches competing with Catholics for adherents. In Guatemala, the most extreme example of the phenomenon, 60 percent of the population is Pentecostal or charismatic. And this trend has repeated itself among Hispanics in the United States, where Pentecostalism has become an extraordinary phenomenon. Curiously, modern Pentecostalism was born in Los Angeles in 1906, when William J. Seymour, the son of former slaves, began to preach in a dilapidated building on Azusa Street in what is now the Little Tokyo neighborhood of the city. In Pentecostal literature, this is referred to as the Azusa Street revival, and from the start it involved Latinos. 
 Today, about 20 percent of American Hispanics are Pentecostal, and their churches, whether conventional religious buildings or simple storefronts, are found in every neighborhood in Hispanic Southern California. Pentecostal leaders insist that their numbers are growing steadily, and the church is visible in many parts of Los Angeles. For example, around MacArthur Park, which is only a short drive from St. Thomas the Apostle, Pentecostal preachers, male and female, sermonize in Spanish through tinny loudspeakers, Bibles in hand.
 Some Pentecostal ministers in L.A. say that the Catholic Church is still too hierarchical. When I spoke to the Rev. Sammy Fernandez of La Puerta Abierta, the Open Door Church, in East Los Angeles, he said, ''People love touching God themselves.'' In Catholic churches, and even in mainline Protestant churches, he added: ''God is out there somewhere. He's probably too busy to touch us little peons. But our faith'' -- the Pentecostal faith -- ''is based on the ability to express yourself freely and in the presence of the Lord.''
 Fernandez's language was the language of faith, but in contrast to the Catholics I met in Los Angeles, it was also the language of capitalism. The Catholics' vision emphasized social justice, and while it encouraged people to organize themselves, it also at least implicitly made demands on them (and had high expectations of the state). In contrast, it seemed to me that Fernandez's focus was closer to Margaret Thatcher's or Ronald Reagan's, and there is little question that part of the appeal of Pentecostalism generally among immigrants is its emphasis on prosperity, in contrast to the traditional Catholic emphasis on solidarity. ''Whosoever will, do it yourself,'' Fernandez told me he liked to say to his parishioners. ''Don't bother the pastor. Do it yourself.''
 Neither Protestants nor Catholics were eager to speak about the tensions between them, but those tensions are palpable in Los Angeles. ''The Roman Catholic Church views us as little storefronts,'' Fernandez remarked. ''They assume that no matter what they do, Latinos are always going to be Catholic. But we've showed they're wrong. That's just a fact.''
 Fernandez did not deny that he was proselytizing, though he declined to single out Catholics specifically. ''We teach that we will be rewarded in heaven by the souls that we bring to the feet of the Lord,'' he said. After St. Thomas was damaged in a fire in 1999, a group of Pentecostals came to preach in front of it, exhorting the church's parishioners to join them. Proselytizing goes on all the time, on the streets, in door-to-door ministries, even in the workplace. Cunnane at St. Thomas told me that he had been in a restaurant and heard a Pentecostal and a Catholic arguing in Spanish about a biblical passage. The Pentecostal, it seemed, had brought his own Bible to work. 
 No Catholic I spoke with believed that the church's history rendered it any less capable of being close to the people (a standard Pentecostal charge). They simply emphasized the goal of social justice alongside that of catechizing. Historically, this is almost certainly easier for the Catholic Church than for any other religious group, because the church has such a long-developed social gospel and such an elaborate language for advocating for it, both when it raises its own voice in the debate and when it seeks to help make the voices of its congregants heard. And contrary to what Rev. Fernandez said, I saw no evidence of the church's indifference, either in terms of its teachings -- some of which, as in the case of birth control and priestly celibacy, of course makes liberal Catholics squirm -- or in terms of its activism.
 On the grass-roots level, that activism has taken, and continues to take, many forms, ranging from the month of prayer and fasting that the Dolores Mission initiated when an anti-immigration bill sponsored by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, passed in the House of Representatives to lobbying for labor rights and immigrants' rights in Washington to participating in the mass rallies for immigrants' rights that took place in Los Angeles last spring. The Sensenbrenner bill was a particular goad in that it not only made illegal entry into the United States a felony but also imposed penalties on anyone who gave aid to illegal immigrants. From the priests' perspective, this bill would have criminalized almost every aspect of their work and, as several of them remarked, would have forced them to repudiate the essence of their commitment to their parishioners. But there was no need for individual priests to announce they would defy the law (which in fact died in the Senate, thanks to the fierce opposition of Senator John McCain, as well as President Bush's refusal to push for the bill). As Father Carroll recalled: ''When the Sensenbrenner bill passed, the cardinal announced that if it became a law, he would ask his priests to disobey it -- that is, to continue to provide services. What he was saying, of course, was that it was an unjust law.''
 Given the dislocation that the arrival of literally millions of Hispanic immigrants has produced in Los Angeles over the course of the past 25 years, both materially and cognitively, it is probably fortunate that its archbishop during much of that time has been a man whose engagement with labor and immigrants' rights literally dates back to his childhood. Tall, slender and economical of movement, Cardinal Mahony, who is 70, is a paradigmatic representative of American Catholicism, a man who became a priest at a time when the Irish dominated the Catholic Church both in Los Angeles and in the country as a whole. When he was made a cardinal in 1991, Mahony was viewed within the church as being comparatively conservative. Today, however, he is often described as the last of the liberal lions, a sort of sacerdotal equivalent in the College of Cardinals to Senator Edward Kennedy in the U.S. Senate. He has emphasized the church's continuing opposition to abortion and euthanasia and has insisted that it is in this context that its support for immigrants' rights must be understood -- in other words that all form part of the church's culture of life. Unsurprisingly, this constellation of views dovetails perfectly with that of Latino Catholics in Los Angeles, who are themselves overwhelmingly liberal economically and conservative socially.
 The connection is one that the archdiocese emphasizes. For example, in its Spanish language publications, the cardinal is almost always referred to as ''Rogelio Mahony,'' Rogelio being the Spanish equivalent of Roger. One of Mahony's Latino admirers, Louis Velasquez, the former head of Hispanic outreach for the archdiocese, went so far as to insist to me that ''the cardinal speaks Spanish with an American accent, but he has a Mexican heart.'' And in conversations in Spanish with people in parishes all over L.A., I found some version of the sentiment was widely shared and readily expressed, almost like a kind of devotion.
 ''The cardinal is one of us,'' said an old woman after Mass at St. Thomas the Apostle. ''You don't need to ask any more.''
 Her daughter, on whose arm she was leaning, nodded her assent.
 Mahony was born in Hollywood in 1936. His father owned a poultry-processing plant, whose work force was overwhelmingly Latino even back in the 1940s. ''Way back to my earliest years,'' he told me, ''I was exposed to the difficulties of immigrants. I used to work in my father's factory as a kid, and I remember the day when we got raided by the Border Patrol. These guys came in with guns drawn as if a bank robbery was taking place. And the way they treated people! It was as if they were dirt.'' After a pause, Mahony added musingly, ''Even now, I can close my eyes and see it as if it were yesterday.'' Then he went on, ''From that day forward, I believe my life and that of immigrants have been intertwined.''
 As a student at St. John's Seminary in the early '60s, Mahony, who was then a rarity among his fellow seminarians in that he spoke Spanish, taught catechism to the local farm workers (St. John's is in Ventura County, in the heart of avocado-growing country, and the vast agricultural work force is almost entirely Latino). When he speaks of the farm workers, his tone becomes almost reverential. ''I saw firsthand the sacrifices they were making,'' he said. ''I saw goodness and generosity on their faces.''
 Mahony divides the history of his own engagement into two periods: the time before 1965, when, as he puts it, ''I was mostly aware of the immigrants' pastoral needs,'' and the years since, when, he says, ''the church became more and more involved in social-justice issues for immigrants.'' Mahony himself was ordained in Fresno, another agricultural, immigrant-heavy diocese, in 1962, during the period when Cesar Chavez began his campaign for farm workers' rights in earnest. Mahony was close to Chavez, and photographs from the time show the young priest saying Mass from the back of a flatbed truck. His involvement was such that in 1975 -- Mahony was by then auxiliary bishop of Fresno -- Gov. Jerry Brown named him to head up the newly formed California Agricultural Labor Relations Board. In effect, he became the lead negotiator in a series of labor disputes that culminated in the edgy peace between growers and farm workers that persists to this day.
 As the first native Angeleno to be archbishop of L.A. (he was appointed in 1985), Mahony was particularly sensitive to the extraordinary demographic changes that were taking place in Southern California. He had not been in office very long when he mandated that anyone graduating from the seminary had to be able to speak a second language well enough to say Mass and hear confession in it. In practical terms, this represented a de facto ''bilingualization'' of the archdiocese since, while there are substantial numbers of Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan Catholics in L.A. nowadays, the church's base constituency is Latino, and because this is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future, the most pressing need is for Spanish-speaking priests. Of course, since Mahony made this decision, the Hispanicization of the church has surpassed anything even he could have imagined at the time.
 As a result, the church has shifted its emphasis from labor rights for legal residents of the United States to the rights of immigrants. Mahony views this mission as one that is biblically ordained. In a recent speech at St. John's, he said, ''If you look today to see who are the most vulnerable, these are the same ones who are singled out by the prophets: people in poverty, single mothers, children and immigrants.'' In other words, he said, ''the challenge of the prophets is for us here and now.''
 For Mahony, there is nothing new about this. ''The church,'' he told me, ''has been doing direct service for centuries and doing advocacy as well.'' But there is little doubt that the Sensenbrenner bill and the rise of virulent nativist feeling in America, above all on conservative talk radio, played a role in galvanizing the Los Angeles archdiocese and Mahony personally. The church had already been campaigning hard, but, the cardinal told me, the immigration restrictionists in Congress ''teed up for us a home run by passing a bill so unlike the spirit of America.''
 It was not only the archdiocese that was galvanized by the Sensenbrenner bill. Last spring, a series of pro-immigration rallies swept Los Angeles. They were not directed by the church, but once the priests realized how the demonstrations were snowballing into something of great significance, the church joined a broad coalition of labor unions and activist groups that were committed to making the rallies work. As things turned out, the rallies succeeded beyond all the organizers' expectations. And certainly no one who knew Mahony was surprised to see him at the march that took place on the afternoon of May 1 wearing not his prelate's garb but a T-shirt that read ''We Are America'' in English, Spanish and Korean.
 Los Angeles, of course, remains a city divided, and while to his Hispanic congregants Mahony is thought of as a hero, he is criticized by many people on the rich, Anglo West Side, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, for his focus on immigrants' rights and, more significant, for his supposed connivance in transferring parish priests involved in the pedophilia cases -- part of the sexual-abuse scandal that in recent years has hobbled the American Catholic Church and bankrupted several dioceses. Some of these critics go as far as to say that the cardinal's commitment to the Latinos in his diocese is actually a way of deflecting attention from the scandal, and intermittently there are loud, bitter demonstrations in front of the cathedral, much to the fury of the mostly Latino worshipers. I never heard the sex-abuse issue raised once by the Hispanic Catholics I spoke to at parish churches all over the city -- testimony, perhaps, to the yawning gap between West and East Los Angeles, Anglo and Hispanic. 
 As a practical matter, the church's commitment to the immigrant cause now far transcends any individual's commitment, even the cardinal's. As Msgr. John Moretta, the pastor of the Church of the Resurrection, put it: ''I think the church will always side with the rights of people to live where it's best for them to live. We took that position when the Irish came and when the Italians came, and now we are doing the same with the Latinos.'' Moretta added that the changes in some of the atmospherics of church ritual, as well as the emphasis on certain saints on the calendar rather than others, was a form of reaching out not so very different from what the church did during the great Catholic European immigration to America in the last part of the 19th century.
 Moretta may well be right. But this does not make the transformation any less overwhelming. Perhaps the most resonant change of all, symbolically, is the new centrality of the Virgin of Guadalupe, adored in Los Angeles 70 years ago by the Cristeros and adored by the illegal immigrants today. The difficulty for the archdiocese is that while the Virgin of Guadalupe occupies this central place in the religious imagination of Mexicans -- ''who in Mexico is not a Guadalupano?'' was the way Moretta put it -- she has not traditionally been terribly significant either to Anglo Catholics or, more crucially, to the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans in Los Angeles. Moretta said, somewhat obliquely: ''We're making a big effort to be inclusive with the Virgin of Guadalupe. In the past, it had been Mexican parishes that mostly celebrated, but today we've made a big effort to reach out to Vietnamese, Koreans and Filipinos. On Dec. 3, when an annual procession in her honor takes place, and then on Dec. 12, when we celebrate her feast day, many people besides Mexicans will participate.''
 The story of the Virgin of Guadalupe goes that in 1531 an indigenous man known as Juan Diego had a vision of the Virgin Mary on a hill called Tepeyac. Addressing him in Nahuatl, his native language, and appearing not as the white woman of traditional Western Christian iconography but as an Indian herself, the Virgin instructed him to build a basilica on Tepeyac. By appearing as a poor woman, appearing before a poor man rather than a Spanish prelate and speaking Nahuatl rather than Spanish, the Virgin expressed her fundamental solidarity with the poor and the weak. By extension, the ''Guadalupist'' perspective embodies the church's concern for the poor.
 The Catholic Church in both the United States and Latin America has been trying for some time to ''de-Mexicanize'' the Virgin of Guadalupe, as Louis Velasquez put it, and to give her the same central importance throughout the Americas that she had always had in Mexico. In 1999, Pope John Paul declared her to be the patron saint of the Americas. (Three years later, he canonized Juan Diego as well.) In Los Angeles, as the Rev. Scott Santarosa of the Dolores Mission put it to me, many people already experience the Virgin of Guadalupe as not just the patroness of the Americas but also as the mother of all immigrants. Indeed, that was the theme of the march in her honor a few weeks ago on Dec. 3. 
 What is taking place in Los Angeles is an erasing of the border between Catholicism in the United States and Catholicism in the rest of the Americas. When I asked Mahony about the Virgin of Guadalupe or the church's view on immigration, he referred to studies and declarations issued jointly by American and Mexican prelates. In a sense, as mass immigration and economic interdependence have all but erased California's southern border, so the Hispanicization of the American Catholic Church has made it increasingly part of a single pan-American Catholicism.
 But even the Virgin of Guadalupe, powerful though she is symbolically, would be no more than a symbol were Latino Catholics not convinced of the sincerity of their church's commitment to them. The authority of the church in L.A. finally boils down to the fact that for the poor, the church has come through and continues to come through. When all is said and done, can a poor immigrant really depend on anyone else caring about his or her immortal soul and also his or her material fate? 
 The Rev. Gregory Boyle, a Jesuit who ran the Dolores Mission when things were at their roughest in East L.A. and who now heads up Homeboy Industries, a group that helps gang members (their slogan is ''Nothing Stops a Bullet Like a Job''), summed it up when he said, ''As a priest, you're always connecting the Gospel to people's lives.'' He continued, ''Ours is not the escapism of some kinds of religion, nor is it the disconnected, boring experience I'm afraid some Catholics remember.'' What inspires Boyle, he told me, is seeing women -- the women who stand up to the gangbangers while their husbands, as Boyle said sarcastically, ''sit in front of their televisions watching their telenovelas'' -- tackle some of the toughest, most pressing problems in their own communities and ask themselves, with a complete lack of sentimentality: ''What would Jesus do? How would Jesus respond to a gang member?''
 As Boyle puts it: ''You don't evangelize the poor; the poor evangelize you. I learned that as a young priest in Bolivia long ago, and it's my ongoing experience. The simple truth is that here you're called to something deeper, more radical, more credible.'' So where did that leave him, I asked? Where did that leave the church? Boyle paused, and then he said: ''You're always standing with the demonized, so that the demonization stops. You're always with the people on the outer fringes of the circle of compassion, so the circle of compassion can expand. You're always at the margins, so the margins once and for all disappear. And you're always with the disposable, so the people stop being disposed of.''
 Boyle's Catholicism, harking back, as it does, to liberation theology and committed to standing in solidarity with the poor, is one whose authority and relevance is immediately clear on the streets of East Los Angeles. But historically, such radical interpretations of the Sermon on the Mount have always been in conflict, within the church, with the Catholicism that tells its flock to render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and concedes that the poor will always be with us. It is a tension as old as the church itself. For the moment, the church in Los Angeles is closer to Greg Boyle's vision than it has been for many decades. The question, of course, is whether an increasingly conservative hierarchy, both in Rome and in the United States, will choose to allow it to remain so or will alter its course. It is this decision that will in the end determine whether the Hispanicization of the American church signals its rebirth or is a false dawn after all.

HEADLINE: The Right Has a Jailhouse Conversion

 BODY:
Not too long ago, you could tell whether an election was under way by watching prime-time television and counting the number of ominous recitatives about prisoners and ex-prisoners in the commercials. This fall, however, the seven million Americans who are in the custody of the state -- in prison or jail, on probation or parole -- did not loom large on nightly TV; in fact, as has been the case for nearly a decade, they barely received any notice at all. Prisoners are no longer the charged political symbols and campaign-season scapegoats they once were. 
This decline in the exploitation of crime coincides with an odd and surprising change in the politics of crime. The G.O.P., the party of Richard Nixon's 1968 law-and-order campaign and the Willie Horton commercial, is beginning to embrace the idea that prisoners have not only souls that need saving but also flesh that needs caring for in this world. Increasingly, Republicans are talking about helping ex-prisoners find housing, drug treatment, mental-health counseling, job training and education. They're also reconsidering some of the more punitive sentencing laws for drug possession. The members of this nascent movement include a number of politicians not previously known for their attention to prisoners' rights. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a former federal prosecutor whom The New Republic once accused of being stained ''with the taint of racism,'' wants to reduce the penalty for possession of small amounts of crack. Referring to mandatory-minimum sentences, Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina, whose district is home to Bob Jones University, declared on the floor of the House: ''I voted for them in the past. I will not do it again.'' Perhaps most remarkably, the outgoing Republican-controlled Congress came tantalizingly close to passing the Second Chance Act, a bill that focuses not on how to ''lock them up'' but on how to let them out. The bill may become law soon, if Democrats continue to welcome the new conservative interest in rehabilitation.
 By some measures, the Second Chance Act is a small bill. It authorizes less than $100 million over two years to address a significant problem: about 700,000 ex-offenders (the population of a good-size American city) will leave prison in 2007 -- and two-thirds of them are likely to be rearrested within three years. The bill would provide states with grants to develop model programs for prisoners returning to society. Those states that accept the grants will be asked to re-examine any laws and regulations that make it unreasonably difficult for ex-offenders to reintegrate themselves into their communities -- the classic example is the ban on allowing felons to receive a barber's license. (If the felon in question is Sweeney Todd, of course, the ban might make sense. But a blanket prohibition that includes check bouncers and marijuana users seems overly broad.) The bill also provides money to faith-based organizations and other nonprofits for prisoner-mentoring programs. Finally, it requires states to measure how well their programs achieve the bill's main goal: reducing the rate of recidivism among recently released prisoners.
 No one expects the Second Chance Act to solve the prisoner-re-entry problem overnight. The bill's authors are probably too confident that drug treatment, education and housing assistance can reduce recidivism on their own. Such services, many criminologists say, are effective only when paired with the tight supervision of ex-offenders. Some researchers point to the ''broken windows'' response to crime and suggest trying a similar approach with prisoner re-entry: quickly punish any small violations of the terms of a prisoner's release with graduated sanctions while returning ex-offenders to prison only for new crimes, not for technical parole violations like missing a meeting with a probation officer. The Second Chance Act does nothing to support this sort of approach.
 As policy, then, the bill won't be an elixir. But as a symbolic political gesture, the Second Chance Act completely reverses recent practice. For the first time in decades, Congress is poised to pass a bill that aims to make the lives of prisoners and ex-prisoners easier, not more difficult. In the 1990s, Democratic and Republican Congresses scrapped the Pell Grant program for prisoners, barred drug offenders from receiving federal student loans and cut highway money for states that did not revoke or suspend the driver's licenses of drug felons. Now leading politicians of both parties are proposing that states remove laws and regulations that wall off the ex-criminal class from the community. Rather than eliminating education and substance-abuse treatment programs, Congress may well finance them. When I met with Mark Earley, a former political star of the Christian right and a present-day prison reformer, I began explaining to him why I was surprised by the Second Chance Act and the so-called ''re-entry movement'' surrounding it. He knew why I was surprised: ''First of all,'' he said, by the very fact ''that there is common ground'' between Republicans and Democrats. ''And second of all, it's this?''
 Many liberals and Democrats -- from Senator Joe Biden to members of the Congressional Black Caucus like Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a representative from Cleveland, and Danny Davis, a representative from Chicago -- are sponsors of the Second Chance Act. Still, the issue is not a top priority for the party. In their recent blueprint for Democratic success, ''The Plan,'' Rahm Emanuel, the influential Illinois congressman, and Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, wrote only one paragraph on crime -- and that was mostly a hymn to the achievements of the 1994 crime bill. The campaign document for House Democrats, ''A New Direction for America,'' promises action on national security, the economy, higher education, energy, health care and retirement. The words ''crime'' and ''prisons'' never appear.
 Prison reform is not a highly advertised position of the Republican Party either, but a growing number of social conservatives are trying to make it a centerpiece of the Christian-conservative agenda. The most striking aspect of the Second Chance Act may be the cross-section of Republicans, from every wing of the party, who support it. Senator Arlen Specter, the top-ranked contender for the award of Least Favorite Republican among movement conservatives, is a lead sponsor, as is Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, who may be Christian conservatives' top choice for the 2008 presidential nomination. Among the House sponsors of the bill are Mike Pence, an Indiana congressman who is a leader of the conservative caucus in the House and a darling of Washington's conservative press corps, and Dan Lungren, a California representative and former California attorney general who helped write California's three-strikes law (which he still supports). ''For liberals in criminal justice, he's like the devil, almost,'' says a key liberal lobbyist for the bill, Gene Guerrero of George Soros's Open Society Policy Center.
 The Second Chance Act would seem an unlikely bill to be advanced during an election year. At every level of government, after all, elections are thought to encourage tough-on-crime legislation. Recalling his time in the Illinois Legislature, Barack Obama, an early sponsor, says: ''We used to have a joke. Let's say the offense was that defacing property was a Class C misdemeanor, or a Class A misdemeanor. Suddenly somebody would jack it up to a Class 2 felony. And it was always before election time. And we'd say, 'You know, it's not a good idea to leap all the way to the maximum penalty, because you'll have nothing to come back with next election.' You know, you want to take it in stages.''
 With the Second Chance Act, however, three of what were the most endangered senators in America -- Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Jim Talent of Missouri and Mike DeWine of Ohio -- put their names on the bill; all lost their re-election bids. Their support for the legislation wasn't an issue in their losses, but even that fact is remarkable. In today's political environment, crime policy has so receded from controversy that the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee could approve the Second Chance Act in July under the assumption that the full House might take it up on the eve of an election in which the Republican majority was at stake.
 What has changed? It's true that crime rates have declined in recent years (notwithstanding a slight uptick last year), but for the last quarter of the 20th century, crime policy was impervious to fluctuations in street crime. If crime went up, politicians got tough on crime. If crime went down, politicians still got tough on crime. At the state level, at least, that is no longer the case -- and a large shift in public opinion has much to do with it. In 1994, crime and health care were the two top issues that Americans thought the government should tackle. Nine years later, less than 1 percent of Americans named crime as a top political issue. 
 If safer streets had something to do with the change in public attitudes, so did another development: the changing place of crime in the national debate over moral values. Over the past decade, as the political scientists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck have suggested, the culture war of the 1970s and 1980s that revolved around race has been replaced by one that revolves around religion. A side effect has been a radically different crime debate. If the Second Chance Act fails to pass, it will not be because the two parties cannot agree on the importance of rehabilitation programs in prisons. But it may be because they disagree on the role religious organizations should play in rehabilitation. 
 This September, Mark Earley ascended to a lectern at the Washington Convention Center to recite a political act of contrition. Earley, who is white, seemed among the least likely attendees of the Congressional Black Caucus's annual legislative conference to rouse the mostly African-American audience of liberal activists, Capitol Hill staff members, lobbyists and members of Congress to sermon-listener cries of ''Amen,'' ''Yes, sir'' and ''Tell it!'' The most successful Christian conservative politician to emerge from the State of Virginia, Earley represented the district of Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed for 10 years in the Old Dominion Legislature. In 1997, he ran for attorney general on a platform that combined socially conservative positions on abortion and other issues with a dollop of tough-on-crime rhetoric -- and won. 
 Now Earley came to confess his sins. In front of an audience filled with former prisoners who were attending a job fair connected to the conference, Earley cast his arms wide and proclaimed: ''I was wrong. I repent!''
 ''I'm 52 years old,'' he said at the beginning of his remarks, ''and for the first 48 years of my life, I didn't think much about prisoners. And when I did, it went something like, I'm glad I'm not one, and I'm glad they are where they are.'' He continued: ''And I really pretty much had the view that prisoners were at the end of the line. That if you were in prison, you had no hope, you'd made a mess of your life, and it was better for me that you were there, because my family could be safe.''
 He went on: ''I was elected to the Virginia Legislature and served 10 years, from '87 to '97, in the Senate of Virginia, and quite frankly, spent most of my time in the Legislature working on how to put more people in jail and keeping them there longer. Virginia, like most states in the '80s, abolished parole, instituted three strikes and you're out, lowered the age at which juveniles could be tried as adults from 16 to 14.'' Earley told the crowd that these policies helped increase the American prison population ''tenfold in the last 30 years.'' Unlike most politicians who say such things, Earley wasn't bragging. He was apologizing.
 Like many Republicans and Christian activists, Earley's prison-house conversion dates from an encounter with Chuck Colson, the Watergate crook turned Christian evangelist. When Earley lost the Virginia governor's race in 2001 to Mark Warner, Colson asked Earley to take over Prison Fellowship, the ministry that Colson founded in the mid-1970s. Earley declined on the assumption that devoting himself to prisoners was tantamount to throwing his life ''down a dark hole.'' Over the next few months, Earley read his Bible and was struck by the number of criminals who play starring roles: Moses, for example, murdered a man and became a fugitive. Paul presided over the stoning of Stephen, the first Christian martyr. Earley came to a realization: ''If Moses or Paul had lived in Virginia or any state in the United States today, they would be serving, had they been caught, a multiple-decade prison sentence.'' He took the job.
 Of course, it's easy to admit the error of your political ways when you've left office and don't have to worry about voters punishing you for your change of heart. But Earley is far from alone in his apostasy from the usual anti-crime politics. Howard Coble, a congressman from North Carolina and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security in the last Congress, said in 2003 that the internment camps for Japanese-Americans during World War II were ''appropriate at the time.'' And yet when Coble first introduced the Second Chance Act to the full judiciary committee this summer, he called the bill ''an enlightened departure'' from the politics of ''lock them up and throw away the key.''
 ''At one point, I may have embraced that theory,'' Coble told me over the phone from his home in Greensboro, N.C., during the August Congressional recess. ''I still embrace the theory of locking the cell door if an offender has been convicted of a crime. But I don't say throw the key away. I say, keep the key handy, so the same key that locked that door can also unlock it.'' Coble's words recalled those of Alexander Maconochie, a Scottish prison warden who reformed Norfolk Island, the Alcatraz of 19th-century Australia, by inventing the concept of indeterminate sentencing -- an incentive-based system involving early release for hard work and good behavior: ''When a man keeps the key of his own prison, he is soon persuaded to fit it to the lock.''
 For most of the 20th century, indeterminate sentencing and rehabilitation were consensus policies in the United States. The decision to call the state agencies that run prisons departments of ''corrections'' was intended to reflect the rehabilitative nature of their work. But in 1974, a sociologist named Robert Martinson published an article called ''What Works?'' in the neoconservative journal The Public Interest. John DiIulio, President Bush's first director of faith-based initiatives, once called Martinson's essay ''arguably the single most influential article ever published in that influential journal.'' Martinson answered the question he posed by concluding that ''with few and isolated exceptions,'' there was no evidence that any rehabilitation programs successfully reduced recidivism. His article and the subsequent media attention it received -- along with the high crime rates of the 1970s -- are credited with shifting the emphasis in crime policy from rehabilitation to punishment and ''just desserts.'' Martinson later retracted his argument: in a 1979 article in The Hofstra Law Review, he acknowledged that some rehabilitation programs had ''an appreciable effect,'' while emphasizing that other programs were actually harmful. But the political environment was not as receptive to a more nuanced approach. Following California's lead in 1977, state after state abandoned rehabilitation and indeterminate sentencing in favor of punishment and fixed sentences.
 Today's revival of rehabilitation began during the final years of Bill Clinton's presidency. The Clinton administration had been as punishment-oriented as its Republican predecessors. With the exception of a few liberal members of Congress -- mostly members of the Congressional Black Caucus who represent urban districts -- Democrats in the 1990s abandoned prison reform. The two defining moments of Democratic crime politics in the 1990s were Clinton's decision as governor of Arkansas to allow the execution of the mentally impaired Ricky Ray Rector in 1992 and the passage of the 1994 crime bill; along with banning assault weapons and putting 100,000 cops on the street, the bill also prominently featured longer sentences for criminals and a federal three-strikes law.
 But in the spring of 1999, Janet Reno turned to Jeremy Travis, then the director of the National Institute of Justice, and asked, ''What are we doing about all the people coming out of prison?'' It began to dawn on Reno, Travis and others that the mandatory sentences Congress and state legislatures created over the preceding decades had an unintended side effect: automatic release. More and more prisoners were leaving prison without having to earn their release, because the incentives to change their behavior had been removed. That seems obvious: what else would you expect from states that abolished parole and replaced discretionary sentencing with fixed sentences? Yet few lawmakers and corrections professionals seemed to have considered the consequences. In October 1999, Reno and Travis held a news conference promoting the idea of prisoner ''re-entry,'' a word Travis came up with that rebranded the unpopular notion of prisoner rehabilitation. ''Re-entry'' shifts the emphasis from the criminal to the community -- from how an inmate is treated to how safe you and your neighbors will be when he or she is released. In that sense, re-entry preys on the public fear of a nation of Willie Hortons, but it does so in the service of going ''softer'' on crime.
 Even as Reno and Travis were promoting the idea of prisoner re-entry, Matt Salmon, a Republican congressman from Arizona, was championing the No Second Chances Act, a bill that would take federal money away from states that released a prisoner who then committed a crime in another state. The political climate seemed unfriendly. Yet Reno and Travis's initiative aroused little opposition -- or much notice of any kind. 
 Criminologists of both parties hope that the decreasing importance of crime as a political issue will make it possible to have a more sober discussion of the subject at last. They want to see a less ideologically charged debate and one that rests more closely on sound research. There's only one problem: a shocking paucity of such evidence to inform the policy debate. As Christy Visher, a researcher from the Urban Institute, put it in the May 2006 issue of Criminology and Public Policy, ''There is no consensus answer to the question Do prisoner-re-entry programs work?''
 And yet there is a consensus to not do what we are doing. Criminologists largely agree that increasing the use of incarceration at some point becomes counterproductive and crime actually starts to rise. Many researchers suggest that we're at that point already. In his book on re-entry, ''They All Come Back,'' Travis notes that only about 25 percent of the violent-crime reduction in the 1990s was because of ''incapacitation'' -- the fact that would-be criminals were locked up and unable to commit more crimes. Michael Jacobson, who worked as the New York City corrections commissioner under Rudy Giuliani, points out that the city's nation-leading decline in street crime during the 1990s coincided with a decline in the use of incarceration as a weapon of crime control. San Diego, the No. 2 city in crime reduction from 1993 to 2001, also sent fewer people to prison during that period.
 The best way to deter crime, according to most researchers, is to increase the swiftness and the certainty of arrest for people who break the law, not to increase the severity of their sentences. Many experts would like to see some kind of return to indeterminate sentencing, though they disagree on the particulars. Ultimately, they'd like to see sentencing turn from an Industrial Age policy, a one-size-fits-all assembly line, to an Internet Age policy of personalization. Joan Petersilia, a leading researcher on parole, recommends using statistical risk profiles, similar to those employed by auto insurers, to determine which ex-offenders should receive the most support or supervision from re-entry programs. She argues in her book ''When Prisoners Come Home'' that ''from a victim's standpoint, there is no benefit from determinate sentencing or automatic-prisoner-release schemes,'' because you ''replace a rational, controlled system of earned release for selected inmates with automatic release for nearly all inmates.''
 Outside the criminology community, conservatives have embraced re-entry to save lives, to save souls and also to save money. Putting aside Medicaid, spending on corrections has been the fastest-growing item in state budgets in recent years. Partly for this reason, Louisiana and Mississippi -- the two states, Michael Jacobson notes in his book, ''Downsizing Prisons,'' with the highest rates of per capita incarceration in the country -- embraced sentencing reform in 2001. Louisiana eliminated some mandatory sentences and required that the first two ''strikes'' for offenders be violent, rather than nonviolent, felonies. Mississippi, which had abolished discretionary parole in 1995, decided to bring it back for nonviolent first-time offenders. By 2003, 18 states had implemented similar reforms. Under the Republican governor, John Engler, Michigan repealed all of its mandatory-minimum drug laws.
 When George W. Bush took office in 2001, he did not dismantle the Clinton-era re-entry programs; rather, he adapted them to fit his faith-based agenda. Despite his strong support for capital punishment, President Bush may be the most pro-prisoner president in American history -- at least if you disregard the war on terror (an admittedly enormous caveat). Certainly in terms of rhetoric, Bush has done more to advance the interests of prisoners than either Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton. The Second Chance Act takes its name from the 2004 State of the Union address in which Bush asked Congress to pass a $300 million program to help prisoners as they re-enter society: ''In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners, and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from long experience that if they can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to commit crime and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a four-year, $300 million prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job-training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.''
 Democrats were flabbergasted. Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones calls it ''the only thing that George W. Bush has ever said at a State of the Union that made me stand up and cheer.'' Representative Danny Davis says, ''I always tell people that when he said that, I was the first person up to applaud, even though I was on the Democratic side of the aisle.''
 According to Mark Earley, Bush's speech ''very subtly sent a signal to conservative Republicans that it's O.K. to talk about rehabilitation and doing something for prisoners as they're coming back into society, and prisoners' kids.''
 There are few, if any, senators more closely identified with the Christian conservative movement than Sam Brownback. Like a growing number of conservatives, Brownback is a political proponent of the so-called new-evangelical causes, which range from AIDS in Africa and slavery in Sudan to poverty and the Prison Rape Elimination Act, a bill that helped build the coalition of Democrats and Republicans in the re-entry movement. Even when he disagrees with his fellow religious conservatives, he gives faith-based reasons for doing so. A convert to Catholicism, he has said his religion informs his support for a less punitive approach to immigration reform. In February, he held a hearing intended to foster debate on whether the death penalty can be reconciled with Pope John Paul II's call to create ''a culture of life.''
 Brownback also routinely mentions prison reform -- especially the faith-based variety -- in public speeches. During Alberto Gonzales's confirmation hearing to become attorney general, he made a special point of asking Gonzales about his plans to reduce prison recidivism. He wrote a letter to The Washington Post in February complaining about an op-ed by the U.C.L.A. psychologist David Farabee, who dismissed the Second Chance Act as a return to ''the intuitively appealing programs that we correctly rejected 30 years ago.'' Brownback countered in his letter, ''We should not be resigned to allowing generation after generation to return to prison because they don't have the tools to break the cycle.''
 When I visited him earlier this year, Brownback seemed highly aware of the dangers, even for a conservative Republican from Kansas, of seeming the slightest bit soft on crime. ''I wouldn't say I represent the mainstream of this,'' he insisted. ''I think we have to prove results'' -- that is, demonstrate an actual reduction in recidivism rates among newly released prisoners. He continued: ''I personally favor a number of these faith-based approaches. But if there are other approaches, let's try them. This is an enormous problem, and since the '70s, we have basically just said we'll lock people up.'' 
 Later, in his office in the Senate Hart Building, Brownback implicitly raised the specter of Willie Horton -- the fear that he and the other sponsors of the bill would be blamed for crimes committed by the formerly incarcerated: ''Imagine you get one bad prisoner coming out and committing a heinous crime, which is likely to happen. And people's reaction is, they get mad. They don't want this guy out on the streets that's doing this. If you can't show, look, by doing these programs we are cutting the recidivism rate overall, I don't think it will stand the blowback when that situation inevitably happens.''
 Chris Cannon, a Utah conservative who is the bill's Republican point man in the House, is less circumspect than Brownback. On crime, Cannon can sound like a liberal Democrat, if liberal Democrats still talked the way he did during my first phone conversation with him in August: ''Republicans have taken a pretty harsh position, just locking people up.'' And: ''The system has a very strong tendency to change them for the worse. Everybody knows that, I think.'' And: ''Our current system is fundamentally immoral.''
 A few weeks later, in his Congressional office, Cannon was just as adamant: ''I think society has a huge obligation to prisoners. I think that obligation transcends our current view, which is: Lock them up, hide them away, keep my daughter safe, keep my house safe, if he or she burgles, I want that person gone. Out of sight, out of mind. Away. I think that violates the fundamental concepts of who we are as Americans.
 ''Nobody thinks this is a bill that solves our moral dilemma,'' he went on. ''Maybe I should say moral crisis. But it is a first step, an agreeable first step, and it allows us to take a look at where we ought to think about ending up.'' But even Cannon occasionally realizes he's treading on dangerous political ground. After this preamble, apropos of nothing, he declared: ''In this whole thing, nobody is being soft on crime. Nobody is saying, let these people out. It's about after someone is found to have committed a crime, what do we do to help that person become a useful, productive member of society?'' Which, of course, involves letting them out.
 Cannon and his allies toiled hard on behalf of the Second Chance Act, and they helped shepherd it through the House, where the Republican leadership pledged to schedule a vote if the Senate did the same. But despite their efforts, the outgoing Congress failed to move forward. The first sign of trouble came in the summer. When the bill reached the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas tried to amend it so that it explicitly, rather than implicitly, authorized the financing of faith-based organizations. Gohmert's proposed amendment drew enthusiastic support from Republicans, but it alienated Democrats, who would have scuttled the bill in the Senate. The bill's Democratic supporters accept that the Bush administration will allocate some of the funds to Christian organizations. But they draw the line at direct legislative authorization to finance religious organizations. Such an authorization was anathema to them unless it contained additional language restricting faith-based groups from proselytizing and from discriminating on the basis of religion in their hiring decisions. To keep the bill on course, four Republicans -- including Cannon and Coble -- turned against their colleagues and joined with Democrats to defeat Gohmert's amendment. 
 In the Senate, with 37 co-sponsors and the support of Republican leaders, the bill seemed sure to pass. But in mid-December, as the legislative term came to an end, Senator Tom Coburn -- a Christian conservative from Oklahoma who has said, ''As a physician, I believe that we ought to be doing drug treatment rather than incarceration'' -- ignored personal appeals from Brownback, Specter and others and put a hold on the bill. Coburn supports the bill's objectives and calls it ''a good act,'' but his fiscal-conservative conscience overcame his social-conservative one. He demanded the termination of other federal programs that, in his view, served similar purposes. The bill's supporters must have felt betrayed, as some assumed that Coburn had pledged not to prevent the bill's passage. Even so, the bill seems likely to pass, with some modifications, in the next legislative session. 
 In order for that to happen, the Democrats will have to take a step similar to the one Bill Clinton encouraged them to take in the 1990s, when they conceded that the country's desire for changes in affirmative action, welfare and crime policy was more than just a proxy for racism. By passing the Second Chance Act, Democrats can acknowledge that the Christian desire to improve the lives of prisoners is more than a mere proxy for evangelism. And in doing so, they can re-embrace a cause of their own: the creation of a criminal-justice system that is more humane and more just. The current moment is, in Michael Jacobson's view, ''the best opportunity of the last 25 years for altering the way in which the United States has used incarceration.'' But if that moment is to be seized, if there's any possibility to reform a prison system that almost everyone thinks has failed, both parties are going to have to rely, at least a little bit, on faith.

HEADLINE: The Rise of the Office-Park Populist

BYLINE: By Jacob S. Hacker. 
Jacob S. Hacker, a professor of political science at Yale and a fellow at the New America Foundation, is the author of ''The Great Risk Shift: The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care and Retirement -- and How You Can Fight Back.''

 BODY:
On Election Day last month, Democratic candidates did something they haven't done for a while: they decisively won the middle class. Middle-income voters -- including white middle-income voters who have abandoned the party in droves in recent years -- preferred Democratic candidates by wide margins. Indeed, only voters with family incomes in excess of $100,000 a year were more likely to support Republicans than Democrats in House races in November.
The conventional view among the pundit class is that this middle-class restoration, valuable as it was for Democrats, creates thorny new tensions. Motivated mainly by their disgust with corruption, incompetence and the war in Iraq, middle-income voters are foul-weather friends who will flee the party en masse if it speaks forthrightly about, say, aiding the unemployed or the uninsured. Writing about the party's need to balance an uplifting message of opportunity and growth with demands for greater economic security, the veteran political reporter Thomas Edsall warns, ''For Democrats to thread this needle will take a steady hand.'' 
 But the needle's eye may not be as narrow as most pundits believe. Middle-class voters didn't rush to the Democrats despite all the populist campaign messages, but -- in large part -- because of them. And they didn't do so merely in poor urban centers or regions ravaged by the loss of manufacturing jobs but in relatively affluent exurban and suburban locales. Senator-elect Jim Webb eked out victory in Virginia by running up huge margins in the prosperous, white-collar north. Apparently he saw no conflict between his electoral base and his loud insistence, both during and after the campaign, that his reason for running was to ''bring true fairness back to economic life.''
 All of this suggests that familiar debates pitting the disadvantaged against the comfortable may be taking a fateful new turn. Increasingly, economic insecurity is a major concern of Americans once thought to be beyond its cold reach: middle-class professionals who have gone to college, or even beyond, but who suddenly find that their education and skills are no longer a guaranteed safety net. These office-park populists, as they might be called, aren't necessarily buying smash-the-system rants against free trade and immigration. But they are skeptical of corporate promises and concerned about their security -- and surprisingly supportive of expanded health care and other ideas atop the Democrats' wish list.
 For decades, it has been drilled into our heads that unskilled or uneducated workers are the big losers in a high-tech global economy. And indeed they are. What has been far less noted is that there is also a huge and growing amount of inequality among people on the highest rungs of the educational ladder. In other words, even as educated workers are pulling ever further ahead of less educated workers, they are also pulling ever further apart from one another. If you were one of the fortunate young students who rolled out of a computer-science program back in the 1990s, you may well have ended up in a cushy programming job offering a six-figure salary and lavish bonuses. If, by contrast, you find yourself looking for such a job today, you may discover that the best you can obtain is a contingent position with meager rewards, with the distinct possibility that you will soon be training your foreign replacement or writing the code that will do your old job.
 Moreover, if you were the fortunate worker of the 1990s, you could very well be the unfortunate worker of the mid-2000s as well. And that raises another important point about risk: it's not just that there's a growing gap between high and low earners with advanced education. It's that all well-educated workers, even those at the top, are at much greater risk of economic reversals than they used to be. Remarkably, the ranks of the long-term unemployed -- people who spend more than six months looking for work -- are disproportionately professional and well educated. And it is better-paid workers who have seen the promise of guaranteed pensions replaced with the risks and uncertainties of private investment accounts like 401(k)s -- the less skilled rarely receive pensions at all.
 Indeed, in some ways, workers who have invested the most in skills are most at risk today. For one, such investments are a lot more costly than they used to be. About a third of recent college graduates enter the job market with student-loan debts that exceed what experts consider reasonable -- a major increase from the past. What's more, skills can also put you directly at risk. If you have labored for years to learn cost accounting or blueprint preparation, you can gain a big leg up in the competition for jobs that require those specialized skills. But while these talents can help you prosper, they also make you dependent on particular jobs or lines of work. If these positions dry up, so does the market for your skills -- and the rewards those skills once delivered. (Unskilled workers, by contrast, have fewer opportunities to increase their wages but generally find it easier to move from one kind of job to another.)
 Critics of arguments like these point out that the average American is richer than ever and that investments in education and skills are still on the whole worthwhile -- both true enough. But risk and insecurity are as much about the range of possible outcomes as they are about the average outcome. Here, at least, it is clear that Americans with degrees and skills face much greater worries than in the past -- even if their average incomes are higher.
 The implications of office-park populism for American politics and policy are hardly crystal clear. Speaking to the mix of anxiety and optimism felt by middle-class workers will require more than harangues against immigrants or free trade. It will require innovative efforts to expand health insurance, strengthen retirement benefits and help less-than-superrich families save and invest. It will also require new types of insurance that protect against the most catastrophic risks. Proposals for new protections against huge income drops or budget-wrecking expenses have attracted support among politicians and policy experts. So has the concept of wage insurance: when workers lose high-paying jobs and take new, lower-paying ones, the government would guarantee them a portion of their former income for a certain number of years.
 The growing sense of anxiety among the once-insulated middle class doesn't, of course, guarantee a long-term shift of political power or a new policy direction. But the creeping spread of economic insecurity up the class pyramid does hold out the tantalizing hope of a new sort of debate -- one that is not framed exclusively around what the prosperous many should do for the dispossessed few. Alexis de Tocqueville once marveled at Americans' enthusiastic embrace of ''self-interest rightly understood,'' a philosophy of individualism that nonetheless celebrated aid to others and shared sacrifice. A body politic animated by self-interest rightly understood would lament the erosion of economic security not just because it was morally troubling or harmful to those at the bottom but because it was ultimately bad for us all.

HEADLINE: Realism

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
By far the hottest word of 2006: the noun realism, with its brother noun, realist, as a label for its practitioners.
In a Washington Post column titled ''This Is Realism?'' Charles Krauthammer led with ''Now that the 'realists' have ridden into town gleefully consigning the Bush doctrine to the ash heap of history, everyone has discovered the notion of interests, as if it were some new idea thought up by James Baker and the Iraq Study Group.''
 Contrariwise, Tom Ricks wrote in the same paper: ''The Iraq Study Group report might well be titled 'The Realist Manifesto,' '' a repudiation of the Bush administration's diplomatic and military approach now being challenged by recommendations stemming from ''the 'realist' school of foreign policy.'' 
 ''We are all realists now.'' That was the lede of George Packer's article in a recent issue of The New Yorker, paraphrasing Milton Friedman's temporary salute to the economic activism of Britain's Lord Keynes. ''Iraq has turned conservatives and liberals alike,'' Packer wrote, ''into cold-eyed believers in a foreign policy that narrowly calculates national interest without much concern for what goes on inside other countries.'' 
 Then, unexpectedly in a magazine with unabashed Bush-bashing credentials, Packer put his thumb in the eye of triumphalist realists: ''At some point events will remind Americans that currently discredited concepts such as humanitarian intervention and nation-building have a lot to do with national security -- that they originated as necessary evils to prevent greater evils. But, for now, Kissingerism is king.''
 That equated realism with Kissingerism, synonymy that Henry the K surely considers insufficiently nuanced. He was long associated, however, with the German word Realpolitik (pronounced re-AL-po-li-teek), coined in 1853 by Ludwig von Rochau in an attack on German liberals. In an essay in Time last month headlined ''The Return of the Realists,'' Walter 
 Isaacson noted that ''the doctrine of realism, or its Prussian-accented cousin Realpolitik, emphasizes a hard-nosed focus on clearly defined national interests, such as economic or security goals, pursued with a pragmatic calculation of commitments and resources. Idealism, on the other hand, emphasized moral values and ideals, such as spreading democracy.'' 
 Pragmatism was the word that proponents of realism preferred in the Nixon administration to define the opening to Communist China and detente with the Soviet Union, as well as a tolerance for authoritarian (O.K., dictatorial) leaders like Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore who were on our side in the cold war. In that temporary renaming of realism, Nixon speech writers liked to quote the famous saying attributed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt about a Central American strongman: ''Somoza may be a sonofabitch, but he's our sonofabitch.'' 
 (Tangent: That ''famous saying'' first appeared in Time magazine in an unsigned article -- as all were in the era of group journalism -- about a 1939 visit to Washington by President Anastasio Somoza Garcia. ''To prime President Roosevelt for the visit,'' Time reported in 1948, ''Sumner Welles sent him a long, solemn memorandum about Somoza and Nicaragua. According to a story told around Washington, Roosevelt read the memo right through, wisecracked, 'As a Nicaraguan might say, he's a sonofabitch, but he's ours.' '' No source for that ''story'' was ever found; it must be put down as apocryphal, a word rooted in the Greek ''hidden.'' This debunking denies today's realists one of their best lines.)
 The old realism of the 1960s and '70s derogated diplomatic morality, coined ''the balance of terror'' and glorified strategic stability. It treated idealism as a fatuous word, deriding President Woodrow Wilson's dream of a war to end wars that would ''make the world safe for democracy'' as hopelessly unpragmatic. In the 1980s, however, under Ronald Reagan, it was the word realism's turn to take a hit: the lexical pendulum swung toward evocation of America as ''the city on a hill,'' an embrace of human-rights rhetoric and the moral denunciation of an ''evil empire.'' Crusading idealism was In and amoral realism was Out. 
 In the first Bush era of 1989-93, with ''stability'' the paramount goal of diplomacy, the word realism began to make a comeback. It peaked in the senior Bush's visit to Kiev, just as the Soviet Union showed signs of coming apart in the Baltics and Ukrainians sought their freedom from Moscow rule. Brent Scowcroft, a retired general who had been a longtime Kissinger aide, helped write a stability-first speech for George H. W. Bush urging Ukrainians to stay within the Soviet Union and direly warning of ''suicidal nationalism.'' This caused a vituperative right-wing opinion monger at The New York Times to label the outburst of realism ''Chicken Kiev'' (and the elder Bush has not talked to me since). 
 Realism, as word and policy, had its ups and down through the Clinton years, but in the first term of Bush II was battered by what the historian Robert Kagan calls ''Americans' belief in the possibility of global transformation -- the 'messianic' impulse.'' As public impatience grew with ''the long, hard slog'' in Iraq, however, the stock of Wilsonian idealism fell out of bed, and realism came back into oratorical vogue and, in last month's elections, into shared political power. 
 Ascendant realists now face the problem introduced in The New Yorker: even amid war-weariness, how to justify a label with a history of unprincipled dickering with dictators and an amoral priority of stability over the export of freedom? 
 Language has a solution: an adjectival qualifier. Although Krauthammer two years ago pre-empted democratic realism to describe his idealistic policy of selective intervention, real old realists are now turning to ethical realism, an oxymoron with broad appeal, while liberal internationalists are trying out progressive realism. Meanwhile, grim idealists will soon be running the modifiers prudent and practical past focus groups. Prediction for 2007: Whatever adjectives are chosen to take the edge off the core position, the other side will denounce the label as unrealistic.

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With Cinderella?

BYLINE: By Peggy Orenstein. 
Peggy Orenstein is a contributing writer for the magazine. Her book ''Waiting for Daisy: A Tale of Two Continents, Three Religions, Five Infertility Doctors, An Oscar, An Atomic Bomb, A Romantic Night and One Woman's Quest to Become a Mother'' will be published in February by Bloomsbury.

 BODY:
I finally came unhinged in the dentist's office -- one of those ritzy pediatric practices tricked out with comic books, DVDs and arcade games -- where I'd taken my 3-year-old daughter for her first exam. Until then, I'd held my tongue. I'd smiled politely every time the supermarket-checkout clerk greeted her with ''Hi, Princess''; ignored the waitress at our local breakfast joint who called the funny-face pancakes she ordered her ''princess meal''; made no comment when the lady at Longs Drugs said, ''I bet I know your favorite color'' and handed her a pink balloon rather than letting her choose for herself. Maybe it was the dentist's Betty Boop inflection that got to me, but when she pointed to the exam chair and said, ''Would you like to sit in my special princess throne so I can sparkle your teeth?'' I lost it.
''Oh, for God's sake,'' I snapped. ''Do you have a princess drill, too?''
 She stared at me as if I were an evil stepmother. 
 ''Come on!'' I continued, my voice rising. ''It's 2006, not 1950. This is Berkeley, Calif. Does every little girl really have to be a princess?''
 My daughter, who was reaching for a Cinderella sticker, looked back and forth between us. ''Why are you so mad, Mama?'' she asked. ''What's wrong with princesses?''
 Diana may be dead and Masako disgraced, but here in America, we are in the midst of a royal moment. To call princesses a ''trend'' among girls is like calling Harry Potter a book. Sales at Disney Consumer Products, which started the craze six years ago by packaging nine of its female characters under one royal rubric, have shot up to $3 billion, globally, this year, from $300 million in 2001. There are now more than 25,000 Disney Princess items. ''Princess,'' as some Disney execs call it, is not only the fastest-growing brand the company has ever created; they say it is on its way to becoming the largest girls' franchise on the planet.
 Meanwhile in 2001, Mattel brought out its own ''world of girl'' line of princess Barbie dolls, DVDs, toys, clothing, home decor and myriad other products. At a time when Barbie sales were declining domestically, they became instant best sellers. Shortly before that, Mary Drolet, a Chicago-area mother and former Claire's and Montgomery Ward executive, opened Club Libby Lu, now a chain of mall stores based largely in the suburbs in which girls ages 4 to 12 can shop for ''Princess Phones'' covered in faux fur and attend ''Princess-Makeover Birthday Parties.'' Saks bought Club Libby Lu in 2003 for $12 million and has since expanded it to 87 outlets; by 2005, with only scant local advertising, revenues hovered around the $46 million mark, a 53 percent jump from the previous year. Pink, it seems, is the new gold.
 Even Dora the Explorer, the intrepid, dirty-kneed adventurer, has ascended to the throne: in 2004, after a two-part episode in which she turns into a ''true princess,'' the Nickelodeon and Viacom consumer-products division released a satin-gowned ''Magic Hair Fairytale Dora,'' with hair that grows or shortens when her crown is touched. Among other phrases the bilingual doll utters: ''Vamonos! Let's go to fairy-tale land!'' and ''Will you brush my hair?''
 As a feminist mother -- not to mention a nostalgic product of the Grranimals era -- I have been taken by surprise by the princess craze and the girlie-girl culture that has risen around it. What happened to William wanting a doll and not dressing your cat in an apron? Whither Marlo Thomas? I watch my fellow mothers, women who once swore they'd never be dependent on a man, smile indulgently at daughters who warble ''So This Is Love'' or insist on being called Snow White. I wonder if they'd concede so readily to sons who begged for combat fatigues and mock AK-47s. 
 More to the point, when my own girl makes her daily beeline for the dress-up corner of her preschool classroom -- something I'm convinced she does largely to torture me -- I worry about what playing Little Mermaid is teaching her. I've spent much of my career writing about experiences that undermine girls' well-being, warning parents that a preoccupation with body and beauty (encouraged by films, TV, magazines and, yes, toys) is perilous to their daughters' mental and physical health. Am I now supposed to shrug and forget all that? If trafficking in stereotypes doesn't matter at 3, when does it matter? At 6? Eight? Thirteen? 
 On the other hand, maybe I'm still surfing a washed-out second wave of feminism in a third-wave world. Maybe princesses are in fact a sign of progress, an indication that girls can embrace their predilection for pink without compromising strength or ambition; that, at long last, they can ''have it all.'' Or maybe it is even less complex than that: to mangle Freud, maybe a princess is sometimes just a princess. And, as my daughter wants to know, what's wrong with that? 
 The rise of the Disney princesses reads like a fairy tale itself, with Andy Mooney, a former Nike executive, playing the part of prince, riding into the company on a metaphoric white horse in January 2000 to save a consumer-products division whose sales were dropping by as much as 30 percent a year. Both overstretched and underfocused, the division had triggered price wars by granting multiple licenses for core products (say, Winnie-the-Pooh undies) while ignoring the potential of new media. What's more, Disney films like ''A Bug's Life'' in 1998 had yielded few merchandising opportunities -- what child wants to snuggle up with an ant?
 It was about a month after Mooney's arrival that the magic struck. That's when he flew to Phoenix to check out his first ''Disney on Ice'' show. ''Standing in line in the arena, I was surrounded by little girls dressed head to toe as princesses,'' he told me last summer in his palatial office, then located in Burbank, and speaking in a rolling Scottish burr. ''They weren't even Disney products. They were generic princess products they'd appended to a Halloween costume. And the light bulb went off. Clearly there was latent demand here. So the next morning I said to my team, 'O.K., let's establish standards and a color palette and talk to licensees and get as much product out there as we possibly can that allows these girls to do what they're doing anyway: projecting themselves into the characters from the classic movies.' ''
 Mooney picked a mix of old and new heroines to wear the Pantone pink No. 241 corona: Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Mulan and Pocahontas. It was the first time Disney marketed characters separately from a film's release, let alone lumped together those from different stories. To ensure the sanctity of what Mooney called their individual ''mythologies,'' the princesses never make eye contact when they're grouped: each stares off in a slightly different direction as if unaware of the others' presence. 
 It is also worth noting that not all of the ladies are of royal extraction. Part of the genius of ''Princess'' is that its meaning is so broadly constructed that it actually has no meaning. Even Tinker Bell was originally a Princess, though her reign didn't last. ''We'd always debate over whether she was really a part of the Princess mythology,'' Mooney recalled. ''She really wasn't.'' Likewise, Mulan and Pocahontas, arguably the most resourceful of the bunch, are rarely depicted on Princess merchandise, though for a different reason. Their rustic garb has less bling potential than that of old-school heroines like Sleeping Beauty. (When Mulan does appear, she is typically in the kimonolike hanfu, which makes her miserable in the movie, rather than her liberated warrior's gear.) 
 The first Princess items, released with no marketing plan, no focus groups, no advertising, sold as if blessed by a fairy godmother. To this day, Disney conducts little market research on the Princess line, relying instead on the power of its legacy among mothers as well as the instant-read sales barometer of the theme parks and Disney Stores. ''We simply gave girls what they wanted,'' Mooney said of the line's success, ''although I don't think any of us grasped how much they wanted this. I wish I could sit here and take credit for having some grand scheme to develop this, but all we did was envision a little girl's room and think about how she could live out the princess fantasy. The counsel we gave to licensees was: What type of bedding would a princess want to sleep in? What kind of alarm clock would a princess want to wake up to? What type of television would a princess like to see? It's a rare case where you find a girl who has every aspect of her room bedecked in Princess, but if she ends up with three or four of these items, well, then you have a very healthy business.''
 Every reporter Mooney talks to asks some version of my next question: Aren't the Princesses, who are interested only in clothes, jewelry and cadging the handsome prince, somewhat retrograde role models?
 ''Look,'' he said, ''I have friends whose son went through the Power Rangers phase who castigated themselves over what they must've done wrong. Then they talked to other parents whose kids had gone through it. The boy passes through. The girl passes through. I see girls expanding their imagination through visualizing themselves as princesses, and then they pass through that phase and end up becoming lawyers, doctors, mothers or princesses, whatever the case may be.'' 
 Mooney has a point: There are no studies proving that playing princess directly damages girls' self-esteem or dampens other aspirations. On the other hand, there is evidence that young women who hold the most conventionally feminine beliefs -- who avoid conflict and think they should be perpetually nice and pretty -- are more likely to be depressed than others and less likely to use contraception. What's more, the 23 percent decline in girls' participation in sports and other vigorous activity between middle and high school has been linked to their sense that athletics is unfeminine. And in a survey released last October by Girls Inc., school-age girls overwhelmingly reported a paralyzing pressure to be ''perfect'': not only to get straight A's and be the student-body president, editor of the newspaper and captain of the swim team but also to be ''kind and caring,'' ''please everyone, be very thin and dress right.'' Give those girls a pumpkin and a glass slipper and they'd be in business. 
 At the grocery store one day, my daughter noticed a little girl sporting a Cinderella backpack. ''There's that princess you don't like, Mama!'' she shouted.
 ''Um, yeah,'' I said, trying not to meet the other mother's hostile gaze.
 ''Don't you like her blue dress, Mama?''
 I had to admit, I did. 
 She thought about this. ''Then don't you like her face?''
 ''Her face is all right,'' I said, noncommittally, though I'm not thrilled to have my Japanese-Jewish child in thrall to those Aryan features. (And what the heck are those blue things covering her ears?) ''It's just, honey, Cinderella doesn't really do anything.''
 Over the next 45 minutes, we ran through that conversation, verbatim, approximately 37 million times, as my daughter pointed out Disney Princess Band-Aids, Disney Princess paper cups, Disney Princess lip balm, Disney Princess pens, Disney Princess crayons and Disney Princess notebooks -- all cleverly displayed at the eye level of a 3-year-old trapped in a shopping cart -- as well as a bouquet of Disney Princess balloons bobbing over the checkout line. The repetition was excessive, even for a preschooler. What was it about my answers that confounded her? What if, instead of realizing: Aha! Cinderella is a symbol of the patriarchal oppression of all women, another example of corporate mind control and power-to-the-people! my 3-year-old was thinking, Mommy doesn't want me to be a girl? 
 According to theories of gender constancy, until they're about 6 or 7, children don't realize that the sex they were born with is immutable. They believe that they have a choice: they can grow up to be either a mommy or a daddy. Some psychologists say that until permanency sets in kids embrace whatever stereotypes our culture presents, whether it's piling on the most spangles or attacking one another with light sabers. What better way to assure that they'll always remain themselves? If that's the case, score one for Mooney. By not buying the Princess Pull-Ups, I may be inadvertently communicating that being female (to the extent that my daughter is able to understand it) is a bad thing. 
 Anyway, you have to give girls some credit. It's true that, according to Mattel, one of the most popular games young girls play is ''bride,'' but Disney found that a groom or prince is incidental to that fantasy, a regrettable necessity at best. Although they keep him around for the climactic kiss, he is otherwise relegated to the bottom of the toy box, which is why you don't see him prominently displayed in stores. 
 What's more, just because they wear the tulle doesn't mean they've drunk the Kool-Aid. Plenty of girls stray from the script, say, by playing basketball in their finery, or casting themselves as the powerful evil stepsister bossing around the sniveling Cinderella. I recall a headline-grabbing 2005 British study that revealed that girls enjoy torturing, decapitating and microwaving their Barbies nearly as much as they like to dress them up for dates. There is spice along with that sugar after all, though why this was news is beyond me: anyone who ever played with the doll knows there's nothing more satisfying than hacking off all her hair and holding her underwater in the bathtub. Princesses can even be a boon to exasperated parents: in our house, for instance, royalty never whines and uses the potty every single time.
 ''Playing princess is not the issue,'' argues Lyn Mikel Brown, an author, with Sharon Lamb, of ''Packaging Girlhood: Rescuing Our Daughters From Marketers' Schemes.'' ''The issue is 25,000 Princess products,'' says Brown, a professor of education and human development at Colby College. ''When one thing is so dominant, then it's no longer a choice: it's a mandate, cannibalizing all other forms of play. There's the illusion of more choices out there for girls, but if you look around, you'll see their choices are steadily narrowing.''
 It's hard to imagine that girls' options could truly be shrinking when they dominate the honor roll and outnumber boys in college. Then again, have you taken a stroll through a children's store lately? A year ago, when we shopped for ''big girl'' bedding at Pottery Barn Kids, we found the ''girls'' side awash in flowers, hearts and hula dancers; not a soccer player or sailboat in sight. Across the no-fly zone, the ''boys'' territory was all about sports, trains, planes and automobiles. Meanwhile, Baby GAP's boys' onesies were emblazoned with ''Big Man on Campus'' and the girls' with ''Social Butterfly''; guess whose matching shoes were decorated on the soles with hearts and whose sported a ''No. 1'' logo? And at Toys ''R'' Us, aisles of pink baby dolls, kitchens, shopping carts and princesses unfurl a safe distance from the ''Star Wars'' figures, GeoTrax and tool chests. The relentless resegregation of childhood appears to have sneaked up without any further discussion about sex roles, about what it now means to be a boy or to be a girl. Or maybe it has happened in lieu of such discussion because it's easier this way. 
 Easier, that is, unless you want to buy your daughter something that isn't pink. Girls' obsession with that color may seem like something they're born with, like the ability to breathe or talk on the phone for hours on end. But according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American studies at the University of Maryland, it ain't so. When colors were first introduced to the nursery in the early part of the 20th century, pink was considered the more masculine hue, a pastel version of red. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, was thought to be dainty. Why or when that switched is not clear, but as late as the 1930s a significant percentage of adults in one national survey held to that split. Perhaps that's why so many early Disney heroines -- Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Wendy, Alice-in-Wonderland -- are swathed in varying shades of azure. (Purple, incidentally, may be the next color to swap teams: once the realm of kings and N.F.L. players, it is fast becoming the bolder girl's version of pink.) 
 It wasn't until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex differences became a key strategy of children's marketing (recall the emergence of '' 'tween''), that pink became seemingly innate to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few years. That was also the time that the first of the generation raised during the unisex phase of feminism -- ah, hither Marlo! -- became parents. ''The kids who grew up in the 1970s wanted sharp definitions for their own kids,'' Paoletti told me. ''I can understand that, because the unisex thing denied everything -- you couldn't be this, you couldn't be that, you had to be a neutral nothing.'' 
 The infatuation with the girlie girl certainly could, at least in part, be a reaction against the so-called second wave of the women's movement of the 1960s and '70s (the first wave was the fight for suffrage), which fought for reproductive rights and economic, social and legal equality. If nothing else, pink and Princess have resuscitated the fantasy of romance that that era of feminism threatened, the privileges that traditional femininity conferred on women despite its costs -- doors magically opened, dinner checks picked up, Manolo Blahniks. Frippery. Fun. Why should we give up the perks of our sex until we're sure of what we'll get in exchange? Why should we give them up at all? Or maybe it's deeper than that: the freedoms feminism bestowed came with an undercurrent of fear among women themselves -- flowing through ''Ally McBeal,'' ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' ''Sex and the City'' -- of losing male love, of never marrying, of not having children, of being deprived of something that felt essentially and exclusively female. 
 I mulled that over while flipping through ''The Paper Bag Princess,'' a 1980 picture book hailed as an antidote to Disney. The heroine outwits a dragon who has kidnapped her prince, but not before the beast's fiery breath frizzles her hair and destroys her dress, forcing her to don a paper bag. The ungrateful prince rejects her, telling her to come back when she is ''dressed like a real princess.'' She dumps him and skips off into the sunset, happily ever after, alone. 
 There you have it, ''Thelma and Louise'' all over again. Step out of line, and you end up solo or, worse, sailing crazily over a cliff to your doom. Alternatives like those might send you skittering right back to the castle. And I get that: the fact is, though I want my daughter to do and be whatever she wants as an adult, I still hope she'll find her Prince Charming and have babies, just as I have. I don't want her to be a fish without a bicycle; I want her to be a fish with another fish. Preferably, one who loves and respects her and also does the dishes and half the child care.
 There had to be a middle ground between compliant and defiant, between petticoats and paper bags. I remembered a video on YouTube, an ad for a Nintendo game called Super Princess Peach. It showed a pack of girls in tiaras, gowns and elbow-length white gloves sliding down a zip line on parasols, navigating an obstacle course of tires in their stilettos, slithering on their bellies under barbed wire, then using their telekinetic powers to make a climbing wall burst into flames. ''If you can stand up to really mean people,'' an announcer intoned, ''maybe you have what it takes to be a princess.''
 Now here were some girls who had grit as well as grace. I loved Princess Peach even as I recognized that there was no way she could run in those heels, that her peachiness did nothing to upset the apple cart of expectation: she may have been athletic, smart and strong, but she was also adorable. Maybe she's what those once-unisex, postfeminist parents are shooting for: the melding of old and new standards. And perhaps that's a good thing, the ideal solution. But what to make, then, of the young women in the Girls Inc. survey? It doesn't seem to be ''having it all'' that's getting to them; it's the pressure to be it all. In telling our girls they can be anything, we have inadvertently demanded that they be everything. To everyone. All the time. No wonder the report was titled ''The Supergirl Dilemma.'' 
 The princess as superhero is not irrelevant. Some scholars I spoke with say that given its post-9/11 timing, princess mania is a response to a newly dangerous world. ''Historically, princess worship has emerged during periods of uncertainty and profound social change,'' observes Miriam Forman-Brunell, a historian at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Francis Hodgson Burnett's original''Little Princess'' was published at a time of rapid urbanization, immigration and poverty; Shirley Temple's film version was a hit during the Great Depression. ''The original folk tales themselves,'' Forman-Brunell says, ''spring from medieval and early modern European culture that faced all kinds of economic and demographic and social upheaval -- famine, war, disease, terror of wolves. Girls play savior during times of economic crisis and instability.'' That's a heavy burden for little shoulders. Perhaps that's why the magic wand has become an essential part of the princess get-up. In the original stories -- even the Disney versions of them -- it's not the girl herself who's magic; it's the fairy godmother. Now if Forman-Brunell is right, we adults have become the cursed creatures whom girls have the thaumaturgic power to transform.
 In the 1990s, third-wave feminists rebelled against their dour big sisters, ''reclaiming'' sexual objectification as a woman's right -- provided, of course, that it was on her own terms, that she was the one choosing to strip or wear a shirt that said ''Porn Star'' or make out with her best friend at a frat-house bash. They embraced words like ''bitch'' and ''slut'' as terms of affection and empowerment. That is, when used by the right people, with the right dash of playful irony. But how can you assure that? As Madonna gave way to Britney, whatever self-determination that message contained was watered down and commodified until all that was left was a gaggle of 6-year-old girls in belly-baring T-shirts (which I'm guessing they don't wear as cultural critique). It is no wonder that parents, faced with thongs for 8-year-olds and Bratz dolls' ''passion for fashion,'' fill their daughters' closets with pink sateen; the innocence of Princess feels like a reprieve.
 ''But what does that mean?'' asks Sharon Lamb, a psychology professor at Saint Michael's College. ''There are other ways to express 'innocence' -- girls could play ladybug or caterpillar. What you're really talking about is sexual purity. And there's a trap at the end of that rainbow, because the natural progression from pale, innocent pink is not to other colors. It's to hot, sexy pink -- exactly the kind of sexualization parents are trying to avoid.''
 Lamb suggested that to see for myself how ''Someday My Prince Will Come'' morphs into ''Oops! I Did It Again,'' I visit Club Libby Lu, the mall shop dedicated to the ''Very Important Princess.'' 
 Walking into one of the newest links in the store's chain, in Natick, Mass., last summer, I had to tip my tiara to the founder, Mary Drolet: Libby Lu's design was flawless. Unlike Disney, Drolet depended on focus groups to choose the logo (a crown-topped heart) and the colors (pink, pink, purple and more pink). The displays were scaled to the size of a 10-year-old, though most of the shoppers I saw were several years younger than that. The decals on the walls and dressing rooms -- ''I Love Your Hair,'' ''Hip Chick,'' ''Spoiled'' -- were written in ''girlfriend language.'' The young sales clerks at this ''special secret club for superfabulous girls'' are called ''club counselors'' and come off like your coolest baby sitter, the one who used to let you brush her hair. The malls themselves are chosen based on a company formula called the G.P.I., or ''Girl Power Index,'' which predicts potential sales revenues. Talk about newspeak: ''Girl Power'' has gone from a riot grrrrl anthem to ''I Am Woman, Watch Me Shop.'' 
 Inside, the store was divided into several glittery ''shopping zones'' called ''experiences'': Libby's Laboratory, now called Sparkle Spa, where girls concoct their own cosmetics and bath products; Libby's Room; Ear Piercing; Pooch Parlor (where divas in training can pamper stuffed poodles, pugs and Chihuahuas); and the Style Studio, offering ''Libby Du'' makeover choices, including 'Tween Idol, Rock Star, Pop Star and, of course, Priceless Princess. Each look includes hairstyle, makeup, nail polish and sparkly tattoos. 
 As I browsed, I noticed a mother standing in the center of the store holding a price list for makeover birthday parties -- $22.50 to $35 per child. Her name was Anne McAuliffe; her daughters -- Stephanie, 4, and 7-year-old twins Rory and Sarah -- were dashing giddily up and down the aisles. 
 ''They've been begging to come to this store for three weeks,'' McAuliffe said. ''I'd never heard of it. So I said they could, but they'd have to spend their own money if they bought anything.'' She looked around. ''Some of this stuff is innocuous,'' she observed, then leaned toward me, eyes wide and stage-whispered: ''But ... a lot of it is horrible. It makes them look like little prostitutes. It's crazy. They're babies!''
 As we debated the line between frivolous fun and JonBenet, McAuliffe's daughter Rory came dashing up, pigtails haphazard, glasses askew. ''They have the best pocketbooks here,'' she said breathlessly, brandishing a clutch with the words ''Girlie Girl'' stamped on it. ''Please, can I have one? It has sequins!'' 
 ''You see that?'' McAuliffe asked, gesturing at the bag. ''What am I supposed to say?'' 
 On my way out of the mall, I popped into the '' 'tween'' mecca Hot Topic, where a display of Tinker Bell items caught my eye. Tinker Bell, whose image racks up an annual $400 million in retail sales with no particular effort on Disney's part, is poised to wreak vengeance on the Princess line that once expelled her. Last winter, the first chapter book designed to introduce girls to Tink and her Pixie Hollow pals spent 18 weeks on The New York Times children's best-seller list. In a direct-to-DVD now under production, she will speak for the first time, voiced by the actress Brittany Murphy. Next year, Disney Fairies will be rolled out in earnest. Aimed at 6- to 9-year-old girls, the line will catch them just as they outgrow Princess. Their colors will be lavender, green, turquoise -- anything but the Princess's soon-to-be-babyish pink. 
 To appeal to that older child, Disney executives said, the Fairies will have more ''attitude'' and ''sass'' than the Princesses. What, I wondered, did that entail? I'd seen some of the Tinker Bell merchandise that Disney sells at its theme parks: T-shirts reading, ''Spoiled to Perfection,'' ''Mood Subject to Change Without Notice'' and ''Tinker Bell: Prettier Than a Princess.'' At Hot Topic, that edge was even sharper: magnets, clocks, light-switch plates and panties featured ''Dark Tink,'' described as ''the bad girl side of Miss Bell that Walt never saw.'' 
 Girl power, indeed.
 A few days later, I picked my daughter up from preschool. She came tearing over in a full-skirted frock with a gold bodice, a beaded crown perched sideways on her head. ''Look, Mommy, I'm Ariel!'' she crowed. referring to Disney's Little Mermaid. Then she stopped and furrowed her brow. ''Mommy, do you like Ariel?''
 I considered her for a moment. Maybe Princess is the first salvo in what will become a lifelong struggle over her body image, a Hundred Years' War of dieting, plucking, painting and perpetual dissatisfaction with the results. Or maybe it isn't. I'll never really know. In the end, it's not the Princesses that really bother me anyway. They're just a trigger for the bigger question of how, over the years, I can help my daughter with the contradictions she will inevitably face as a girl, the dissonance that is as endemic as ever to growing up female. Maybe the best I can hope for is that her generation will get a little further with the solutions than we did. 
 For now, I kneeled down on the floor and gave my daughter a hug. 
 She smiled happily. ''But, Mommy?'' she added. ''When I grow up, I'm still going to be a fireman.''

HEADLINE: The 6th Annual Year in Ideas

 BODY:
As a psychologist in practice for nearly 35 years, I was delighted to observe that of the 74 noteworthy ideas of 2006 (Dec. 10), at least 10 explicitly mentioned psychologists as the primary impetus for the innovation. It is of more than passing interest that, even as our lives seem increasingly controlled by high-tech forces, it is the study of our minds and our basic social motivations that lay the groundwork for the improvement of the human condition.

I love the annual Ideas issue; I read and reread it to muse over the information and try to generate new ideas of my own.

Rather than turning each ballot into a lottery ticket, a better plan to increase voter turnout would be direct payments to voters (''The Ballot That Is Also a Lottery Ticket,'' Rebecca Skloot). For $10 million, Arizona could provide each voter with $5 for spending the time to vote. Direct payment as compensation might be an incentive for the working poor to vote.

Adding an extrinsic reward (the hope of a lottery prize) may get the voter to the poll -- and in Arizona there is a disincentive to vote, since juries are drawn primarily from the election rolls -- but the voter's only goal may be to vote rather than to vote sensibly.

The finding that bicyclists who wear helmets are more apt to be hit by cars reminded me of my own observation: When you wear sunglasses, people behave differently toward you (''Bicycle Helmets Put You at Risk,'' Clive Thompson). They tend to get very close to you, even bump into you, without apologizing. It seems that when they can't see your eyes, they assume that you don't see them.

As a victim of a serious bike accident, who would surely be dead now if I had not been wearing a helmet, I read of this research with horror. I don't care what the results of this absurdly designed experiment say -- I'd never ride without a helmet.

Even if the average pay of college graduates holding bachelor's degrees has grown at only a little better than inflation during the last five years (''The New Inequality,'' David Leonhardt), the statistic does not tell us much about the economic value of such degrees. It would have been more enlightening to compare the economic worth of different kinds of bachelor's degrees. I suspect that vocationally oriented degrees in the sciences, mathematics, economics, business and engineering would have yielded considerably superior financial returns than those in the social sciences, English, fine arts and art history, which are less vocationally oriented. Not that there's anything wrong with the latter fields of study, although their returns are frequently more rewarding intellectually than financially.

Gary J. Bass's description of Putin's Russia as a ''corporate state'' is correct, but there is nothing new about this fusion of ''country and corporation'' (''The Return of the Corporate State''). It's called fascism, and the corporatism Bass describes is a key ingredient. Though Putin's Russia is not a fascist state, it appears to be heading in that direction, as The Economist recently pointed out.

Jane Jacobs was never really against large-scale projects per se (''Big Urbanism,'' David Haskell). In her several books about cities, for instance, I don't recall reading any criticism of the decision to build Central Park, New York City's gigantic water system or its very extensive subway system. And in her most famous book, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' Jacobs mentions favorably, among other things, Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Plaza. What Jacobs was against were those ''utopian'' master plans, often primarily architectural in nature, that exhibited a willful ignorance of urban processes and were largely made possible by governmental financial legerdemain.

Regarding Christopher Shea's ''Hidden-Fee Economy,'' King C. Gillette's brilliant strategy immediately comes to mind: Give them the razor, and they will buy the blades! Still works, apparently.

While the graph in the ''Diplomat-Parking-Violation Corruption Index'' (Christopher Shea) reveals how diplomats from countries like Egypt and Pakistan are far more willing to flout parking laws than those from, say, Sweden and Lebanon, no mention is made of an equally fascinating revelation: across all the countries in the graph, unpaid parking violations dropped significantly in a single month: September 2001. Perhaps some influences do indeed transcend culture.

THE TROUBLE WITH DIVERSITY
 How We Learned to Love Identity 
 and Ignore Inequality.
 By Walter Benn Michaels.
 243 pp. Metropolitan Books/
 Henry Holt & Company. $23.
A lot of progressive politics today, Walter Benn Michaels complains, involves denouncing and apologizing for ''bad things that happened a long time ago.'' Government has its ------ History months and ------ Pride days. Business its diversity consultants and ''heritage management firms.'' Academia has its anti-hate rallies, dedicated, Michaels writes, ''to combating a position that no one actually holds.'' If these are familiar polemical targets, that is because, roughly since the term ''political correctness'' started appearing in national newsmagazines around 1990, conservative intellectuals have subjected the concepts of ''diversity'' and ''identity politics'' to a steady ideological barrage. 
 Like his predecessors, Michaels holds affirmative action at universities in low esteem, wants to get rid of race-based scholarships and worries that our diversity obsession -- preoccupied as it is with race -- ''perpetuates the very concepts it congratulates itself on having escaped.'' But his complaint with identity politics is ultimately a different one. Michaels is a self-described man of the left, a professor of English at the University of Illinois, Chicago. In his snide and occasionally incisive book, he insists that fighting over race and gender is not an outgrowth of leftist egalitarianism but an alternative to it, a kind of progressives' consolation prize, ''at best a distraction and at worst an essentially reactionary position.'' The real problem the left ought to be dealing with is what Michaels calls ''class,'' by which he means inequalities of income and wealth.
 Now, diverse societies do appear less able, or less inclined, to redistribute money than homogeneous ones. The Harvard economists Alberto Alesina and Edward Glaeser have argued that American racial heterogeneity explains about half the gap between American and European welfare spending, and Thomas and Mary Edsall's 1991 classic ''Chain Reaction'' described how a backlash against the civil rights movement resulted in a waning public willingness to support the welfare state through taxes. But this is not Michaels's subject. In fact, he doesn't believe race is a meaningful concept, either biologically or culturally, and he deals only in passing with the day-in, day-out politics of legislating for racial, ethnic and gender balance.
 What interests Michaels is the ideology of diversity, particularly as it is enunciated in universities. For him, this ideology has a basic ''trick'' to it: ''It treats economic difference along the lines of racial and sexual difference, thus identifying the problem not as the difference but as the prejudice (racism, sexism) against the difference.'' As long as no one wishes ill to the poor, and as long as the poor are not made to feel inferior, there are no grounds for complaint, and no basis for attacking capitalism (or ''neoliberalism,'' as Michaels sometimes calls it). Diversity keeps the left barking up the wrong tree. 
 Michaels has a point. Diversity can be a powerful tool of self-legitimation for the rich. ''A society free not only of racism but of sexism and of heterosexism,'' he writes, ''is a neoliberal utopia where all the irrelevant grounds for inequality (your identity) have been eliminated and whatever inequalities are left are therefore legitimated.'' It makes sense that today's Harvard undergraduates, as Michaels notes, should be more content with affirmative action than with a proposed campus maid service, which would reveal their economic advantages to others and to themselves. (Only 3 percent of students at selective universities come from the bottom socioeconomic quarter.) One sees why the liberal embrace of affirmative action has done nothing to dispel the Democratic Party's image as elitist, and why the conservative claim that affirmative action waters down educational quality has not been accompanied by any conspicuous flight from universities. In Michaels's view, universities are serving an extra-educational function, laundering privileges into qualifications. 
 So Michaels is not surprised that ''multiculturalism could go from proclaiming itself a subversive politics to taking up its position as a corporate management tool ... in about 10 minutes and without having to make the slightest adjustment.'' Newspapers focus on the millionaire bond trader who won a $12 million settlement when she sued Morgan Stanley for sexism in 2004, or on the female employees now suing Wal-Mart on the grounds that they make marginally less than their male co-workers -- but not on the gap between Wal-Mart workers and Morgan Stanley ones, who earn 60 times as much.
 Michaels does not so much develop an argument as state a point of view, which he then riffs on. One such riff is to describe various defenders of the diversity ideal as a ''police force'' for, the ''human resources department'' of and the ''research and development division'' of capitalism and the right. It is not clear whether he thinks diversity advocates play this role as well-meaning dupes or as cynical accomplices. Most of those who share Michaels's diagnosis and his anger tend to run this argument in the opposite direction, to show that corporate America has, for a pittance, sold the country out to race radicals, feminists and gay activists. Indeed, this is the essence of much populist conservatism.
 What makes this book different is its single-minded materialism. Race, culture, history, language, love -- all that is not money melts into air. Michaels is fascinated by an episode of the reality show ''Wife Swap,'' in which a rural woman can't stand the Park Avenue apartment she has traded into. ''We find ourselves believing that run-down shacks in the woods are just as nice as Park Avenue apartments,'' he writes, ''especially if your husband remembers to thank you for chopping the wood when you get home from driving the bus.'' He dismisses the complaints of the upper-middle-class residents of Alpharetta, Ga. -- profiled in a New York Times series on class -- that there's not much diversity of income in their neighborhood. ''The value of mixing rich people and poor people,'' he says, ''is real only if it contributes to the poor people becoming less poor, which is to say, if it decreases economic diversity.'' Michaels brings up the impending extinction of the Mati Ke language of Northern Australia only to dismiss as sentimental any disquiet over it. ''We ought to spend less time worrying about the disappearance of languages,'' he writes, ''and more time worrying about the disappearance of any credible alternative to unfettered capitalism.'' 
 Michaels is vague about what his alternative to capitalism would look like, aside from a few details -- universal child care, eliminating funding imbalances in public schools and abolishing private ones altogether. There is not so much a radical program here as a radical mood -- one of nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of yesteryear. Michaels laments that since the cold war, ''ideology's claims to truth have come to seem irrelevant.'' 
 But have they? More likely, the problem is that the ideological style of argument -- of pitting an untainted abstraction such as ''equality'' or ''progress'' or ''democracy'' against the messy realities of complex modern societies -- has come to seem dangerous. The main thing that capitalism and the diversity movement have in common is pragmatism. They draw their legitimacy from the spectacular failure of alternatives, not from their own freedom from internal contradictions. That is why people tolerate mending, not ending, diversity programs, and why they are a bit deaf, just now, to egalitarian schemes. Once burned, twice shy.

HEADLINE: Planning a New Life in the City

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
WHEN developers talk about who will buy all the high-end condominiums that they are building or planning to build in Manhattan, empty nesters invariably make the list.
 And since the oldest baby boomers turned 60 this year, more and more of them are becoming empty nesters, in many cases with more disposable income than their parents had before them.
But not all of the baby boomers being drawn to New York City are wealthy retirees seeking aeries on Central Park. The city is also luring middle-class suburbanites on the lookout for houses and condos in Brooklyn and Queens. Not yet of retirement age, but with children grown up, they see the city as the place where they want to grow old, and they are making the move as part of a future retirement plan.
 They are wooed not only by the city's cultural attractions, but also by lower property taxes, better public transportation, a highly accessible health care system and the chance to be closer to city-dwelling children. 
 Louis and Susan Greer are empty nesters who have decided to pack up their five-bedroom house on a six-acre spread in Campbell Hall, N.Y., in Orange County, and move to Brooklyn. They are seeking either a one-family house for under $600,000, or a two-family for under $800,000. 
 Mr. Greer's 2-hour-and-15-minute ''commute from Hades'' to his job in Lower Manhattan was one factor, but he said it was rising property taxes that finally persuaded him and his wife to start their Brooklyn house hunt. ''That was the nail in the coffin,'' he said, ''because we don't have children at home anymore, and most of the taxes go to schools.''
 William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said people like the Greers are at the leading edge of a baby boomer trend of ''young seniors'' with grown children. (Baby boomers are generally defined as people born in 1946 through 1964.) 
 ''Especially as they reach early retirement, as in ages 50 to 55,'' Mr. Frey said, ''baby boomers will be testing out areas like New York for the longer term.'' 
 According to a report issued by Mr. Frey with the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington last month, the baby boomers who do not age in place or, like previous generations, move to sunnier climes, will be lured into big cities. 
 ''You can't really compare baby boomers with previous generations,'' Mr. Frey said, ''because boomers are forever young. They also have education levels and cultural interests that would suggest they might be more likely to find cities attractive.'' 
 The number of older residents moving into New York and other cities is still smaller than the number who move out to the suburbs or to places like Florida and Arizona, but demographers, economists and gerontologists say that ''in migration'' numbers are sure to grow as baby boomers age. 
 Ken Dychtwald, a gerontologist and founder of Age Wave, a consulting firm that focuses on baby boomers' retirement, described them as generally wanting more out of the experience than the typical resort lifestyle associated with golf courses and recreation rooms. As a result, he said, boomers will probably move in increasing numbers to cities and college towns.
 ''Life that is nothing but leisure is not appealing to them,'' he said. ''They're dreaming of action. They want to be around bookstores and coffee shops and art galleries, and they will be less about showing up at senior centers and more about taking classes at N.Y.U. or finding a way to the Cream reunion at Madison Square Garden,'' which he noted was sold out for three nights straight last year. 
 The Greers, who have three grown children, started their search for a house in the city in May and have already seen more than 50 houses, mostly in Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights. They chose Brooklyn because they lived in Dyker Heights until three years ago and Mr. Greer's mother still lives in the Bensonhurst house where he grew up. 
 They originally moved out of the borough because they were fed up with the rumbling and rattling of trucks -- their house was on a favored detour off of the Belt Parkway. They love having a huge garden in Orange County, but deer have eaten everything they have planted. Besides, they said, they never have enough time to enjoy the outdoors. 
 Mrs. Greer admits that she has been extremely particular in their Brooklyn hunt. ''You can ask my husband -- I can find something wrong with any house,'' she said. To which Mr. Greer responded with a nod, ''You can quote that.'' 
 But she is unapologetic -- because, she said, ''when I move this time, I want it to be the last time.'' They are still years away from retirement -- Mr. Greer is 55 and Mrs. Greer 45 -- but they nonetheless want their next home to be the place they retire to. 
 ''We think that New York City is a great place to be if you're an older person,'' Mr. Greer said. 
 Mrs. Greer said they had already resigned themselves to having a smaller kitchen and even forgoing a garage, as long as they found a house with a decent-sized backyard. 
 ''We want to be able to go for walks in parks, be near the express bus and the subway, and be able to walk to restaurants,'' Mr. Greer said, adding: ''It's beautiful out where we are now. The air is great and we can see the mountains, but there's nowhere to go and nobody to do it with.''
 Brokers across the city who have worked with empty nesters moving in from the suburbs say that while retirees may move lock, stock and barrel to be near their grown children and grandchildren, younger boomers may initially use the apartments they buy as pieds-a-terre. 
 Alan Nickman, an executive vice president at Bellmarc Realty, said he had helped many empty nesters buy apartments in the city. ''These are people who have done reasonably well, but they don't have to be gazillionaires,'' he said. ''They can spend $500,000 to $600,000 for a studio or a one-bedroom before they're fully retired, but the majority of them are thinking about making this a permanent place when they finally do retire.''
 For baby boomers moving from other parts of the country, or from suburban areas where home prices have not reached the dizzying heights that they have in Manhattan, moving to the city can be a financial stretch.
 Pat and Manny Fuchs knew when they decided to leave Rochester Hills, Mich., last year that their real estate dollars wouldn't go as far in New York City. They sold their 2,400-square-foot Michigan home for about $325,000 and paid about twice as much for less than half the space in Lincoln Towers, near Lincoln Center. 
 ''Rochester Hills was a nice, comfortable middle-income area,'' Mr. Fuchs said. ''But we knew we were in for a price shock, so we factored it in.''
 He and his wife are retired and in their 50s. They are originally from the Chicago area, but chose New York because, Mrs. Fuchs said, it ''has more of all the good things that we love about Chicago -- it's like Chicago on steroids.'' They love being within walking distance of Broadway shows and museums. ''In some ways,'' Mr. Fuchs said, ''it was very liberating to get rid of the cars and to downsize.''
 Joe and Debbie Karp are another active couple in their 50s who see themselves someday retiring to New York City. The Karps are born-and-bred New Yorkers who moved to Florida in the 1970s and now live in Palm Beach. With their two sons nearly out of college, they decided last fall to buy a one-bedroom apartment near Lincoln Center.
 They plan to start by spending about 12 weeks a year in the city, but their eventual goal is to spend only theirwinters in Florida. ''We see what happens to people in the suburbs,'' said Debbie Karp, who is 55. ''When you lose your car, you become a prisoner. If and when we retire in an official sense, I would want to do it in New York.''
 Mr. Karp, who turns 60 next month and practices elder law, agrees. ''Although all of my clients are moving to Florida from New York,'' he said, ''I'm going to be the Floridian moving to Manhattan.''
 Shelley Morris and her husband, Seth, have just started the process of reversing the typical migration from city to suburb. They are still debating whether to give up their suburban lives in Bedford, N.Y., and get a large two-bedroom apartment in the city, or to get a smaller apartment and still keep a country house for weekend use.
 Either way, they're ready for a big change, because their house has become very quiet since their daughter graduated from college and moved into the city. 
 ''It just crept up on me that I was living in a community with a lot of young families and fewer and fewer empty nesters my age,'' said Ms. Morris, who is 49. ''And I worry that if you're in an isolated place, you can become reclusive and that's not really a good thing, especially as you get older.''
 Others are making the switch more gradually. In Kew Gardens, Queens, for instance, many of the Long Island homeowners who have considered moving into the Park Lane Tower, a new condominium, have been reluctant to downsize so significantly from their large suburban homes, said Aroza Sanjana, the broker for the building.
 ''At the end of the day,'' she said, ''no matter how many closets we have, it can't compare to the space they have in the suburbs.'' Instead, many have bought apartments for their grown children but are keeping the apartments in their own names. ''The parents are very picky about it because it's not just for their child,'' she said. ''They envision moving into it themselves eventually.''
 Vincent Koo, owner of Exit Kingdom Realty in Forest Hills, said that his office had worked with many Long Islanders looking to downsize and move to Queens. ''We see a lot of people who want to cut down on the commute,'' he said, ''and property taxes are a big issue for them.'' 
 Gary Englehardt, an economist at Syracuse University who has studied housing trends among baby boomers, foresees ''a lot of competition for suburbanite baby boomers'' among developers. Even though cities like New York may attract many of them, he said, builders are working hard to create retirement communities to keep them in the suburbs.
 Mr. Dychtwald of Age Wave said cities might have to do some retrofitting to accommodate an aging population better. ''Cities are really geared for people in their early 20s,'' he said. To make things easier for people with weakening vision and slower gaits, he suggested, restaurants might consider better lighting, city officials might want to lengthen the time it takes for a traffic light to change.
 ''We're not talking about a new alien form of baby boomer,'' he said, ''just older people who will have more time and probably more money to spend who are looking to take in all that the city has to offer.'' 
 But Judy and Jay Greenfield, who moved to the Upper East Side from Mamaroneck, in Westchester, last summer to be closer to their children and grandchildren, said they had found the city perfectly suited for a couple in their early 70s. 
 ''When you reach our age,'' Mr. Greenfield said, ''everything has a reduced price. You get these big reductions in transportation and in the subway, even pregnant women offer me their seats. But I don't take them.''

HEADLINE: Does Life Imitate the Art in Model Homes? 

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN new developments around the region, model homes and apartments offer scenes of life that seem almost too perfect to be real.
 In downtown White Plains, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel complex, for instance, where Louis R. Cappelli is building 213 condominiums, the walls of one bedroom are covered in cashmere, rose petals are strewn about a stainless steel Japanese soaking tub, and the bathroom cabinets are upholstered in leather. The lavishly appointed unit seems made to order for a well-heeled power couple.
At Van Wyck Glen, a community of 221 semiattached three- and four-bedroom single-family homes by Toll Brothers in Fishkill, a wine bottle and glasses sit atop the dresser in a master bedroom suite designed to soothe a young couple after a hard day with the kids. Downstairs, the smell of fresh-baked cookies wafts through the rooms. 
 At River Ridge at Hyde Park, a community of 162 town houses by Cambridge Development and Construction, a living room includes what most empty nesters have probably only dreamed about until now: a pristine white linen sofa, obviously never used by anyone under 30. 
 At Harbors at Haverstraw, an 800-unit complex being built on the Hudson riverfront by Ginsburg Development, a model includes an exotic art collection on the walls, expensive rugs on the living room floor and a whirlpool in the bathroom. (Unlike many model-home items, it can be ordered as an option in any unit.) It is a setting designed to project a lifestyle in some of the units for buyers in their late 50s or early 60s who are ready to enjoy the fruit of their labor. 
 And in Pelham, at the 66-unit Marbury Corners, another Ginsburg Development project, there is plastic sushi on the plates in the modernistic dining room of a stylish condo town house that appears to be occupied by 20-something professionals.
 But do model rooms like these, much more picture-perfect than the way people actually live, really help to sell homes? Do suburban couples with children -- especially couples commuting long distances from Fishkill to New York or White Plains -- really believe they will get a chance to sip wine before retiring? Or are cashmere-covered walls just fanciful decorating notions gleaned from some upscale magazine? 
 As for the decanter of wine in the bedroom and the rose petals on the bathroom floor, Lauren Brady-Russell, the owner of LBR Design Collaborative in Deer Park, N.Y., an interior design firm, remarked, ''Doesn't everyone live that way?''
 Perhaps not in real life, she conceded, but most home buyers at least like to dream about living the way the models depict life. Ms. Brady-Russell designed the model rooms at Harbors at Haverstraw and at Marbury Corners.
 Indeed, fantasies about the joys of homeownership are so motivating for buyers that Toll Brothers spent $100,000 to $130,000 furnishing and decorating each model home in the Fishkill development, where houses sell for $465,000 to $527,000. 
 ''It's a very effective marketing tool,'' Dan Zalinsky, a division senior vice president of Toll Brothers, said. ''Model rooms help buyers envision what life could be like in a new home. They're designed to tug on a buyer's emotions.''
 Mr. Zalinsky, who has four sons, the oldest 7, including newborn twins, said that he personally could not imagine taking time out to relax and have a glass of wine before going to bed. ''Unless,'' he added, ''you have a homeowners' association, like the one at Van Wyck Glen, taking care of outdoor chores like lawn mowing.''
 Selling a home using a model involves appealing to all of the senses -- hearing, sight, smell, touch and taste -- said Rebecca Hanford, president of November Design Group in Austin, Tex. Her company, which designs the interiors of model homes for Toll Brothers, often uses real food, like cookies fresh from the oven, to entice prospective buyers. Sometimes, there is music playing in the background.
 ''We want home buyers to be able to experience the model in such a realistic way they actually put themselves into those rooms,'' Ms. Hanford said. ''The same theory applies to children's spaces. We want a kid to say to his parents: 'I like playing in that house. I want to stay here!' ''
 At the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton Westchester, the high-end White Plains project, Kylie Travis Cappelli, the developer's wife, said she designed the interiors of the one- to three-bedroom condos, which cost $678,000 to $3.5 million, with no particular buyer in mind. ''We're just suggesting different options and leaving the rest to the buyers' imaginations,'' she said. 
 By contrast, Ms. Brady-Russell said she ''scripted a detailed profile'' of potential buyers at Harbors at Haverstraw, where condos are about $600,000 to more than $1 million.
 For one model in a three-bedroom unit, the imaginary residents are an empty-nester couple. The husband is retired and has taken up gourmet cooking, and the model kitchen is filled with hanging herbs and cookbooks are open on the counter.
 The wife, an art dealer who is still working, has an office in their home, and on the entry level her bookshelves are filled with pottery and other art.
 In a survey conducted by the National Association of Homebuilders last year, 43 percent of the developers who responded said model homes were the primary marketing tool they used, and 71 percent said they use model homes at least some of the time to sell a house.
 But according to Stephen J. Melman, director of economic services for the association, which is the home builders' trade group, in the current sluggish housing market, fewer builders are relying solely on models, and more are turning to real estate agents. ''When times are tough, you have to use everything in your arsenal,'' Mr. Melman said.
 As for a bedroom conducive to sipping wine, Mr. Melman said: ''Most couples raising a young family are probably happy just to get the kids off to school on time. Instead of wine in the model, how about a nanny?''
 Some brokers also think more realism can sometimes be helpful. J. P. Endres, president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and president of David Endres Realtors in Scarsdale, said: ''The bottle of Champagne by the hot tub is fine. The flowers in the vase are great. But sometimes, the model rooms are overdone, and buyers simply can't relate to them.'' That is especially true if a model portrays a lifestyle that is too expensive for a potential buyer, Ms. Enders said, because buyers may not consider the house.
 Not that the items in model units are not attractive to somebody. Most such items -- furniture, books and silk flowers -- are sold off when the model, the last available house in a development, is sold, often to a buyer who has fallen in love with the furnishings and wants the model exactly as is, according to Mr. Zalinsky at Toll Brothers.

HEADLINE: Liability for Renovations That Violate Building Code

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:

Q. My partner and I recently moved into a co-op apartment. The previous owners completely gutted and renovated the apartment after they bought it and resold it nine months later. The renovation was well designed and done with quality work.
 However, after living in the apartment for a week, we discovered that in the renovation of the walls (previously made of plaster, and now wallboard) all the existing soundproofing between us and our neighbor was removed. While the neighbor is very polite, we can clearly hear every conversation, as well as her television and noises from her pet birds. 
The only real solution will be more renovation. The board permitted the previous owners' renovation, apparently without any consideration of the effects on the quality of life for the next owners.
 Is solving the problem purely our responsibility or do we have any recourse with the building or board?

A. ''Section 27-769 of the New York City Building Code requires that walls between apartments conform to minimum sound-transmission ratings,'' said Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. He advised the writer to hire an acoustical consultant ''to determine if sound in excess of permitted levels is penetrating her apartment.''
 Mr. Shmulewitz said that if the wall separating the apartments is allowing excessive sound to penetrate, the wall may be in violation of the building code and the co-op could have a legal obligation to remediate the violation.
 The co-op, in turn, he said, could have a valid claim against the prior owners of the apartment if, as is common, their alteration agreement contained a clause that made them responsible for any adverse effects on the building or its systems.
 In addition, Mr. Shmulewitz said, the current shareholder might have a claim against the prior owners if the renovations were done in violation of any legal requirement, since co-op purchase contracts typically contain a representation by the seller that all renovations were done legally. ''However, the writer should be quick to act,'' he said, ''since such clauses are typically enforceable for only up to one year after closing.'' 

Four-Year-Limit Rule Can Protect Illegal Rent

Q. I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Queens, which has not been registered with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal since 1995. I know I am entitled to file an overcharge complaint involving up to the last four years' rent. What I am unsure of is what rent will be used to calculate any overcharge.
 Is it the rent registered in 1995 or the amount on the lease from 2002, which was not registered?

A. Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said the amount used to calculate any overcharge will be the rent that was being charged four years before the complaint was filed, whether or not that rent was registered. ''So, if the complaint is filed on Dec. 26, 2006, the base rent for purposes of computing an overcharge will be the rent that was being charged on Dec. 26, 2002,'' he said.
 Mr. Belkin noted that the fact the 2002 rent was not registered does not, by itself, mean the housing division will find there was a rent overcharge. In his example, he said, if all rent increases imposed after Dec. 26, 2002, followed the stabilization guidelines covering each of them, there should not be any finding of an overcharge, even if the 2002 rent was higher than it should have been.

HEADLINE: Building Densely In Farm Country

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Pa. 

 BODY:
DESPITE the arrival of big-box stores, as well as the crush of tourists who come to ogle quilts and shop at factory outlet stores, farmland still envelops two-thirds of Lancaster County. 
 Agriculture is responsible for one in five jobs in this part of southeastern Pennsylvania, and about a quarter of the county's farmland is in the hands of local Amish families. Farmland preservation, meanwhile, continues to generate support among residents, and county officials estimate that the amount of farmland that has been permanently preserved grew to 67,000 acres in 2006 from 12,000 acres in 1993.
But recently, local officials, concerned that not enough is being done to balance growth and development, have redoubled their efforts, urging developers to come up with more land-efficient housing to reduce sprawl and preserve farmland. 
 Until recently, housing development in Lancaster focused mostly on single-family homes that sat on relatively abundant lots, the kind of development that has attracted couples like Barry and Dorothy Myers. 
 The Myerses, who are both 69, spent 18 years living in a large house on two parklike acres in the township of Manheim. But in August they moved to a type of housing development that used to be virtually unheard of in Lancaster. Built in East Hempfield, the development, Veranda, is aimed at offering a mix of housing options, to a variety of residents, in a more compact way. While it still allows for plenty of green space, it also creates pedestrian-friendly small-town streetscapes that are increasingly appearing elsewhere, often under the banner of ''neotraditional'' design or ''New Urbanism.'' 
 By big-city standards, housing options at Veranda hardly feel cramped. And so far, the Myerses are happy with their new community. They live in a two-story duplex, a ''carriage home'' that sits on a new two-acre town green, along with town houses and single-family homes.
 ''There is already a sense of community here, and the proximity of the houses has helped,'' Mr. Myers said. ''It's not just older people who are buying into it -- an awful lot of people in the neighborhood are in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and we've seen everything from toddlers to college-age kids.'' 
 Lancaster County officials have been supporting so-called smart-growth initiatives for years. In 1993, the county amended its master plan to try to steer more residential housing, as well as redevelopment, to specially designed ''growth areas,'' and 13 of those areas are now situated within the county's more urban corners. 
 Last spring, Lancaster amended its master plan once again, responding to concern that too much growth was still occurring outside of its specially designated growth areas. Now the goal is to watch development more carefully within certain rural areas and to encourage the development of denser, as well as more diverse and affordable, housing within the 13 urban growth areas. 
 County executives say their goals are in line with a nationwide push for more compact housing, as well as Lancaster's changing demographics, which include more retirees and empty nesters. There are also plenty of first-time home buyers looking for more affordable options than those found in the Philadelphia and New York areas. 
 In 2003, Lancaster had an estimated 482,775 residents, but county officials expect it will get more than 100,000 new residents by 2030. By then, they think, the county will need more than 53,000 new housing units. 
 One of the builders who have already heeded the need for more compact mixed-use housing is the Lancaster-based Charter Homes and Neighborhoods. According to Robert Bowman, its president, Charter used to built two to three homes per acre for its single-family developments, but about eight years ago it decided to try to build communities with higher housing density, though as much open space as possible. 
 Charter Homes is now developing 12 such communities, three of them in Lancaster. One is Veranda, while another is Millcreek in West Lampeter, where three-quarters of the 237 home sites have already been sold and where 31 acres were preserved as open space. 
 The third development is Florin Hill, which offers seven types of housing options, from the mid-$100,000s to $450,000. Tucked into a hillside of Mount Joy, Florin Hill, which is more townlike, has space for 472 residential units, as well as 120,000 square feet for shops, restaurants and offices. 
 At Millcreek, two of the newest residents are Suzanne and Ken Wirtz, who moved there in September with their three sons. 
 Before the move, the couple had been living in a large house on an acre in York County, west of Lancaster. But the family's two older sons were soon to leave home for college, and the couple, who are in their 40s, also wanted to reduce Mr. Wirtz's commute to Baltimore. At first, they looked at smaller homes that sat on larger lots, in places as far away as Maryland, but in the end they bought a slightly larger home on a quarter of an acre at Millcreek, even though the move would more than double Mr. Wirtz's commuting time. 
 ''We looked at developments that were just rows and rows of houses, where the houses were often gorgeous, but they, as well as the land around them, had no personality,'' Mrs. Wirtz said. Now she walks her dog along Millcreek's walking trails every day, and the relative compactness of the community, as well as the proximity of many kinds of families and retired couples, has helped her family foster a stronger sense of community, she said. 
 Newport Square, a new mixed-use community based primarily in the township of Warwick, is also attracting a broad variety of people, with its single-family homes, town houses and garden apartments, said Joseph Asterino, a regional sales manager for Berk Homes in Mohnton, the builder. ''It's a complete mix,'' he said, ''everyone from first-time home buyers, to people downsizing and relocating.'' 
 Not everyone in Lancaster supports the need for more compact housing. James R. Cowhey, executive director of the Lancaster County Planning Commission, said that while county residents are becoming more receptive to denser development ''slowly, but surely,'' there is some resistance to having the development nearby. Still, he said, ''people here have an eye-opening expression when they see the development, as opposed to when they just hear the term.'' 
 More concentrated housing faces other challenges in Lancaster. The county planning commission would like to see residential development within its specially designed urban growth areas occur at an average net density of 7.5 dwellings per acre, but some builders say that meeting this number will be challenging because only about 10 of the county's 60 municipalities have already changed zoning laws to allow compact development or are considering changes.
 Karen Martynick, executive director of the Lancaster Farmland Trust, said her nonprofit group, which helps to preserve farmland, supports the need for more concentrated housing because Lancaster is continuing to lose about 1,100 acres of farmland a year to development. 
 ''It's not possible to save every acre of farmland here,'' she said, ''but I'd say that 15 of the county's municipalities still don't have the right kind of zoning that they need to help protect those areas that the county has specifically designated for agricultural use.''

HEADLINE: Changing the Mortgage Equation 

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
FOR decades, home buyers have strained to reach the magic down payment or equity threshold of 20 percent, so they could avoid or end dreaded private mortgage insurance, which can add $100 or more to a monthly house payment without any tax advantage. 
 Some of the sting is about to go out of those payments. President Bush signed legislation on Wednesday making mortgage insurance tax fully deductible for borrowers whose household income is $100,000 a year or less and who buy their homes after Jan. 1. Analysts and mortgage industry executives said the legislation would give a boost to first-time home buyers in particular, and at least partly diminish the use of so-called piggyback loans to avoid the insurance requirement. 
''This is wonderful, especially with where the prime rate is right now,'' said Stephen Heideman, executive director of the Upfront Mortgage Brokers Association, a group whose members advocate full and early disclosure of mortgage fees. 
 Mr. Heideman, who is also president of United Mortgage Financial Group, a brokerage in Tempe, Ariz., explained that in recent years, many borrowers have avoided paying mortgage insurance by simultaneously taking out mortgages and home equity lines of credit, essentially using the credit line as an additional down payment to reach the 20 percent equity mark. 
 Such a strategy allows borrowers to avoid mortgage insurance, but it grows more costly as the prime interest rate rises, because rates for home equity credit lines are typically tied to the prime rate. Now, with interest rates higher, piggyback loans look less economical.
 Take, for instance, a situation in which a borrower is buying a home for $250,000, and has $25,000 for a down payment. To avoid mortgage insurance, that borrower could also take a home equity credit line of $25,000, and use it for the remaining 10 percent of the down payment.
 Assuming that the first loan, for $200,000, is a 30-year loan fixed at 6 percent, and that the home equity credit line is at prime (8.25 percent), the effective monthly payment would be $1,043, after taxes, if the borrower was in the 28 percent tax bracket, itemized tax deductions and did not pay any principal on the home equity credit line. (The actual monthly payments would be higher, offset by tax savings that do not show up until the end of the year.)
 If the same borrower put down $25,000 and took a mortgage for $225,000, the required monthly mortgage insurance would be about $97. But if that premium is tax deductible starting in January, as the law provides, the borrower's effective after-tax payment is $1,103.
 The $60-a-month lower cost of the two loans is probably a short-term gain. If the home's value rose at the rate of inflation, or roughly 3 percent a year, the borrower's equity would reach the 20 percent threshold in three years, eliminating the monthly insurance cost. At that point, the borrower with a fixed-rate $225,000 mortgage would probably pay less. 
 Jeff Lubar, a spokesman for the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, a Washington-based trade group, said the law was backed by mortgage bankers and brokers, as well as by consumer-advocacy and minority-advocacy organizations. Those groups pointed out that the lack of a tax deduction for mortgage interest made it more difficult for many lower-income borrowers to buy homes. ''This certainly helps level the playing field,'' Mr. Lubar said. ''Every bit helps in getting people into homeownership.''
 Industry analysts said that 5 to 9 percent of mortgages now require insurance. They estimate that under the new law the number would probably rise to 10 to 12 percent.
 ''Mortgage insurance is typically associated with plain-vanilla, but less risky, conventional loans,'' said Howard Glaser, principal of the Glaser Group, a Washington-based mortgage industry consulting firm. ''If the deduction attracts more borrowers back to traditional mortgage loan products, that will be the real gift for home buyers.''

HEADLINE: Tires May Say All Season, But Winter Takes Exception

BYLINE: By STUART F. BROWN

 BODY:
ADVANCES like electronic traction control and all-wheel drive make it possible for many cars to get through winter on all-season tires, which provide good grip in a wide range of conditions. But in regions with heavy snowfall and prolonged low temperatures, a set of specialized winter tires may be the difference between getting to your destination or spinning off a slick road. 
 About 20 years ago, winter tires were much the same as summer tires except for a tread pattern that was deep and blocky -- a design intended to help the car claw its way through snow. But winter tires have improved a lot in the last decade or so. 
For example, tire engineers figured out how to create minute porosities, openings in the tread material with edges that help to bite the road. The little indentations also create an escape route for the thin layer of water that can form on top of road ice, says Bridgestone, which makes the Blizzak line of studless winter tires.
 Another big advance came when engineers began adding silica, a mineral that makes up most of sand, to the carbon-black filler material that gives tires their color. In addition to improving fuel economy by reducing the tires' rolling resistance, silica also improves wet traction. It has a third useful trait: improving the low-temperature flexibility to help maintain winter grip.
 ''At around 44 degrees Fahrenheit the way rubber compounds behave significantly changes,'' said Parmeet Grover, Michelin brand director at the company's United States headquarters in Greenville, S. C. ''They become much less pliable. 
 ''Special winter tire compounds are formulated to push that transition temperature down lower,'' he added. ''Silica is a part of this, and the rest is the black magic of compounding that we keep to ourselves.''
 There is another benefit to adding silica to winter tires: they last longer than the older, fast-wearing snow tires. 
 Early silica-compound tires didn't have such great life, either.
 ''The silica wouldn't bind to the rubber polymers,'' said Steve Carpino, vice president for research and development at Pirelli Tire North America. ''Now we have additives that give silica and polymers in the compound the bond you need for good wear. Tread patterns have gotten a lot better, too.'' 
 Because there are so many choices of winter tires, selecting the appropriate ones can be daunting. The first consideration depends on typical winter weather conditions. Drivers in areas where winters are cold but generally dry can use a winter performance tire, which provides traction that is nearly as good as that from all-season tires. But in regions where snow covers the ground for long stretches, a true snow and ice tire is preferred. 
 A good starting point is the Web, where the sites of tire makers and large retailers offer useful guidance on selecting tires along with their sales pitches.
 ''People call us and ask 'What's the perfect tire for my car?' '' said Matt Edmonds, vice president for marketing at the Tire Rack in South Bend, Ind. ''There aren't any perfect tires, but there are correct tires.''
 Recommendations from Tire Rack's sales staff are informed by the company's own tests; employees drive cars fitted with the brands they sell, and the company posts its tire-test ratings as well as customer feedback to help shoppers compare their performance. 
 ''We're not trying to find the best tire,'' Mr. Edmonds said. ''We just want to understand the tires.''
 Tire makers often recommend that drivers buy four winter tires, rather than just put a pair on the engine-driven wheels. Sure, these people are selling tires, but there are sound engineering reasons for the advice. Antilock brakes, traction control and other electronic safety systems make their rapid calculations and interventions on the assumption that the car has four tires with the same performance abilities. Conflicting information from a mixed set of tires can confuse the systems' judgment. 
 All-wheel-drive vehicles, too, can benefit from a full set of winter tires. Engine power at all four wheels can help a vehicle accelerate from a stop, but will not help it stop. That depends on friction between the tires and the road. 
 Changing to winter tires necessarily requires compromise. The tread pattern may make them noisier, the ride may be somewhat harsh and the cornering on dry pavement will suffer. Typically, winter tires carry a speed rating a step lower than the one on the summer tires they replace.
 Owners of vehicles factory equipped with run-flat tires, which are not equipped with a spare, may need to make an accommodation when a change to winter tires is made, such as adding a small compressor and a sealant kit to the trunk -- or signing up for a roadside assistance program.
 Owning two sets of tires for one vehicle may seem extravagant, but consider that all the months it is running on winter tires, the summer tires are resting in the garage, not suffering any wear at all. Winter tires should last three seasons if they are removed as soon as the weather turns warm.

HEADLINE: New Federal Fuel Economy Ratings Set a Double Standard 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
GOVERNMENT regulators, along with most American drivers, have long understood that the fuel economy estimates on the window stickers of new cars can be laughably optimistic. Even the federal fuel economy label serves notice that the actual mileage will depend on options, driving habits and other conditions.
 So this month the Environmental Protection Agency revised its method for calculating mileage, an effort to provide more realistic numbers for shoppers considering a new vehicle. The change, which takes effect on 2008 model year vehicles, will be considerable; miles per gallon in city driving may drop by as much as 30 percent for gas-sippers like hybrids, the agency says. On average, city mileage for all vehicles is expected to be about 12 percent lower; highway estimates could be as much as 8 percent lower.
The new method of calculation recognizes that Americans drive faster, accelerate more quickly and use the air-conditioning more frequently than the federal mileage tests have been taking into account. It also takes into consideration changes in the ways Americans now buy and use vehicles, especially as large S.U.V.'s have evolved from work trucks to family haulers. 
 For the first time, trucks with a gross (fully loaded) weight rating of more than 8,500 pounds will have to carry fuel economy labels, beginning with the 2011 model year. Previously, large pickups and S.U.V.'s in this class (like the Hummer H2) were exempt; the new cutoff will be 10,000 pounds. 
 When the new stickers begin to appear, there is bound to be confusion. Labels carrying mileage figures based on the new calculations will be required on Sept. 1, 2007, making it plausible that the buyer of an '08 Chevrolet Impala will see a lower m.p.g estimate on the window sticker than a neighbor who bought an '07 model a week earlier -- even if the cars are mechanically identical.
 Of course, the federal fuel economy ratings were not established for consumer education alone. The program began under the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, after the Arab oil embargo, as part of an effort to improve fuel economy and reduce oil imports. The fuel economy data is compiled by the E.P.A.; in most cases, the tests are conducted by automakers and spot-checked by regulators. 
 To enforce a schedule of gradual improvements, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was given the authority to establish standards for corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE. Under the law, each automaker must maintain minimum fleet averages for its cars and trucks to avoid penalties. But here's the rub: Even though regulators have now agreed that the method in use for estimating fuel economy is unrealistic and needs to be revised, it will continue to be used for calculating compliance with CAFE mandates. 
 The decision to approach the fuel economy problem through the label and not the vehicle came from Congress, which tried to address consumer dissatisfaction by ordering the change as part of the Energy Policy Act it passed in the summer of 2005. 
 Gas mileage is a touchy subject not only among consumers, but also in Congress, where it took an explicit political compromise to pass the ratings change. Part of the deal was that the older, less realistic formula would still be used for CAFE compliance, which is 27.5 miles a gallon for cars, and a figure for light trucks (pickups, vans and S.U.V.'s) of 22.2 m.p.g. for 2007.
 Beyond knowing that the older mileage calculations are unrealistic, government regulators also know the fuel economy of the vehicle fleet now on American roads (which of course includes older vehicles). Each month the Energy Department publishes its own estimate after adding up the gallons of gasoline sold and dividing by the number of miles driven. It says cars get 22.4 miles a gallon, and vans, pickups and S.U.V.'s get 16.2.
 While there is a general consensus that fuel economy is crucial to America and that the current rating system is out of kilter, the agreement ends there. For example, in the summer of 2005, during the debate over whether to change the sticker or the vehicle, Senator James M. Talent, Republican of Missouri, described the threat this way: ''Unreasonably higher CAFE standards would be a dagger at the heart of our auto manufacturing sector.'' 
 Mr. Talent, discussing a proposal to raise the fuel economy requirement to 34 miles a gallon, said in floor debate that a Ford F-150 pickup built in Missouri would cost $3,000 more as a result. That would encourage people to buy import-brand trucks, he said, because those manufacturers could offset gas-guzzling trucks with a large number of smaller, more efficient vehicles. In fact, sales of the largest American-built trucks have slipped because of higher gas prices. 
 On the other side of the debate was Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York and chairman of the House Science Committee. After the E.P.A. acted this month, he argued, ''The sticker itself isn't worth much if there isn't a follow-through on the Department of Transportation's part,'' to change car's actual mileage.
 ''Shame on N.H.T.S.A.,'' he said, summarizing the recent history of inaction on fuel economy standards by the department in charge of the issue, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Mr. Boehlert predicted that the new Congress would toughen the standards. 
 The auto industry liked the change to the mileage calculation because it implies that drivers, not vehicles, are out of step with test procedures. A spokeswoman for the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, Gloria Bergquist, said, ''How you drive really is the most important factor.''
 Some incoming members of Congress plan to raise the issue of fuel economy in the next session, but it is not clear whether there is a consensus for tougher standards on cars. For light trucks, the Transportation Department has already ordered improvements in fuel economy, subject to economic feasibility and safety, but the change is modest, about 8 percent. 
 It did, however, change the system, setting a sliding scale based on each vehicle's size. That had the effect of making fuel economy important to the manufacturers of each vehicle. 
 In contrast, the system in place for cars sets a corporate average, so that a company that specializes in small cars need not worry about improving its fuel economy, while a company that makes big cars may struggle to meet the standard. The Transportation Department has asked Congress to change the car rules to resemble the truck rules, so far without effect.
 And while the new Congress will have a Democratic majority, the impact of that change on fuel economy rules is not clear; the issue has never broken down cleanly along party lines. Some Republicans have always looked with sympathy on the interests of the Detroit manufacturers and opposed fuel mandates; others have favored conservation. 
 Some Democrats were in the conservation category, too, but others took the position of the United Auto Workers, which has generally opposed stricter mandates.
 The deeper problem, though, is that there is no free energy lunch, and cars with better fuel economy may seem less attractive in other ways. The mileage heroes may be smaller or slower; they may be priced higher because they are built with expensive, lightweight materials or use complex powertrains, as gas-electric hybrids do. 
 And the federal government's recent track record on reducing oil dependence is dismal. In 1992, stung by the run-up in prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Congress passed an energy law that called for 10 percent of cars to run on something other than gasoline by the then far-off year of 2000. But the price of gasoline came back down, and the Energy Department found it could not swim against the economic tide. So transportation is still 97 percent dependent on oil. 
 There is another route, however. Many of the mandates on car emissions originated with California and spread to other states and the federal government. Now California and other states are seeking to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which would have the result of requiring better mileage, since the amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the amount of hydrocarbons burned, either as gasoline or diesel fuel. 
 The case is now before the Supreme Court, and if it rules in the states' favor, states could effectively regulate fuel economy. Some would probably do so vigorously -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has often said he aspires for his state to be the center of the ''carbon-free world.''


GRAPHIC: Chart/Diagram: ''Out With the Old ...''Fuel economy estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency are printed on the window sticker of new vehicles. The method for determining mileage has not been changed since 1984.... And in With the NewBeginning Sept. 1, 2007, a new design will be used for the fuel economy label. In addition to telling shoppers that the method of calculating fuel economy has changed, the new label has a bar graph that shows how the vehicle's mileage compares with others in its class. Features like the estimated annual fuel cost and the E.P.A.'s catch-all reminder - your actual mileage will vary - will be displayed more prominently.

HEADLINE: Coast to Coast In the Pursuit Of Economy

BYLINE: By BOB KNOLL. 
Bob Knoll, an engineer who retired in 1997 as auto test director of Consumer Reports, is a frequent contributor to The Times.

 BODY:
''YOUR mileage may vary'' is so common a catchphrase, in contexts that range far from fuel economy (you may like the movie less than I did; you may have side effects from the medication) that Y.M.M.V. often stands in. 
 Of course, fuel economy really does differ, for many reasons. By now, the public knows that mileage estimates on a car's window sticker are often impossible to match in the real world. This is why the Environmental Protection Agency has announced revisions to the estimates. [Page 2.]
The E.P.A. computes its numbers from automobiles running on a chassis dynamometer, not a road, in a climate-controlled environment. The fuel is not measured; the figures are calculated solely on the basis of emissions samples.
 There was a time when automakers advertised real mileage numbers, as determined in an event that took place every year from 1936, except during World War II, to 1968. 
 Sponsored by the Mobil Oil Corporation and known as the Mobil Economy Run, the coast-to-coast test captured the public's imagination, with spectators sometimes lining the test route for a glimpse of the cars.
 While fuel economy was not then an overriding factor (for most people) in deciding which model to buy, results of the economy run were heavily promoted by carmakers -- at least by the ones who scored well.
 All the leading automakers fielded teams of drivers. To guard against illict modifications, the cars were bought at dealerships by the United States Auto Club, which sanctioned and operated the event.
 After the cars were in hand, they were checked to ensure that they had standard production parts. Once certified as ''stock,'' seals were applied to the hoods and chassis and the cars were shipped to the city where the run was to begin.
 Cars competed in classes based on wheelbase, engine size, body size and price. Each was assigned a driver and a relief driver.
 In the 1964 Mobil Economy Run, I drove for the Chrysler team and was assigned to a Plymouth Valiant compact sedan. My relief driver was a fellow engineer, John Galicki, from the Chrysler Proving Grounds. At the time, I was in the company's road test department; I had previously worked on the development of the original 1960 Valiant, Chrysler's first true economy car.
 The cars -- 45 in all, in 8 classes -- set off from Los Angeles and finished in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, at the Socony Mobil Pavilion of the World's Fair. The run covered 3,243.8 miles and the total allowed running time was 70 hours and 40 minutes. 
 The smallest car to make the '64 run was a Chevrolet Corvair and the largest was a Chrysler Imperial. One significant sign of how times have changed: imported cars then accounted for so little of the market that none were included. 
 While the main event took place April 3-9, my introduction began a few weeks earlier. After the sealed cars were delivered to the teams -- the first time I saw the Valiant I was to drive cross-country -- each was allowed 2,500 break-in miles. The object was to become familiar with the particular car and to figure out which driving techniques would coax the best mileage from it.
 Since we could not tinker with the cars (the auto club's monitors kept them under watchful eyes), we started a rigorous break-in schedule. The enemy of fuel economy is friction, both inside the engine and in the running gear -- all the moving parts that can sap energy. We set out to reduce the cars' rolling resistance.
 Each day when we took our cars from the impound area we drove them as close to wide-open as was prudent in the mountain roads around Los Angeles. One Chrysler driver who had been there before told us, ''They only check mileage on the run itself -- so get the worst mileage you can now.''
 I had been looking forward to this part of the assignment, and though my Valiant was not exactly a sports car, it did well enough in spite of its slow manual steering. I scrubbed the tires mercilessly in corners and thoroughly wore down the brakes -- to create clearance between the shoes and drums and prevent any brake dragging, however slight.
 The run was conducted like a sports car rally, in that the driver must follow a certain route in a given time and is penalized for arriving late (or early) at designated checkpoints. The Mobil Run not only followed the time-distance criteria of a rally, but added another dimension: very carefully measured gasoline consumption. 
 Each car's trunk held a special tank, filled with fuel that had been painstakingly measured, with corrections to take account of the ambient temperature. (The factory fuel tank was disconnected.) 
 In addition, each car came with a U.S.A.C. observer whose job was to carefully observe -- and penalize -- any course deviation, traffic violation, speed limit infraction or rolling stop. The observers were rotated daily, lest they become friendly with the drivers and overlooked some rule-breaking.
 Thus, it was like driving with a very attentive mother-in-law in the back seat, an eagle eye on the speedometer. You had to be sure you halted completely at every stop sign, and while you could roll through a yellow light, you had to be through an intersection before the red light was visible.
 If penalized, a driver had to spend time idling just after the morning start, when other cars were already taking to the road. Time spent idling meant that the daily run had to be made at a slightly higher speed, in addition to gasoline wasted from the cold start in the morning. 
 The route was secret, and maps for each day's run were handed out the night before.
 The 1964 run had overnight stops in six cities: Phoenix; El Paso; Fort Worth; Memphis; Indianapolis; and Harrisburg, Pa. Temperatures ranged from 34 to 87 degrees and the altitude from 47 feet below sea level to 5,280 feet above. The weather included, according to the official highlights published afterward: 
 ''Heavy rain for 40 miles north of Tucson. Snow, rain, and ground fog between Bisbee and Douglas, Ariz., with winds up to 30 m.p.h. Light showers at start in Memphis. Sections of highways were flooded northeast of Memphis. Overcast with winds to 30 m.p.h. from Harrisburg to end of the run. Very light snow at Staten Island.'' 
 Clearly, these were not the laboratory conditions of the E.P.A. 
 My car was a Valiant V-100 with a 273-cubic-inch V-8 rated at 180 gross horsepower. It had a three-speed automatic transmission -- all the cars had automatics -- but lacked any power assist for the steering, brakes, windows and seats. Nor did it have air-conditioning. It was not a lot of fun to drive.
 Once break-in was over, the grind began. Although as a test driver I was used to long stints at the wheel, the seven days of high-concentration driving were daunting. 
 After driving with some abandon during break-in, the economy run itself consisted of driving at fairly high speeds (where legal) to build up a time cushion so that you could slow down when the going became difficult -- in city traffic, for example. With my Valiant, the trick was to get to high gear quickly and then back off the throttle just a bit without losing speed. I soon found this to be natural and I still drive that way today. 
 In those days, the Mobil Economy Run received a lot of national publicity, but even so it was strange to see spectators lining the road in small towns. Our arrival in Phoenix, the first big city, seemed like a holiday parade: flags were flying, bands were playing and crowds of people were waving. I soon got used to this reaction, and it gave me a sense that I was doing something special. 
 Next day, in El Paso, I received a certificate signed by Mayor Judson F. Williams proclaiming me an honorary citizen who ''shall hold a place of high esteem in the minds and hearts of the people of this City.''
 Although arriving in each city was an event, the biggest thrill came in Indianapolis, where the whole fleet drove a lap on the Indy 500 track. Approaching the first turn, with the tall grandstands making the track feel like the bottom of a canyon, was an unforgettable experience even at 50 m.p.h.
 The last leg into New York City was fairly short (184 miles) and easy. And by that point, there was little I could do to alter the overall fuel economy average reached over the previous six days.
 I and my Valiant ended up taking third place in Class B. Our competition included a Rambler American 440 6-cylinder driven by Les Viland, an American Motors engineer with several economy run victories under his belt; a Chevy II 100 6-cylinder; a Dodge Dart 170 V-8; a Chevy II Nova V-8; and a Ford Falcon V-8. Class results were tight except for the Rambler, which averaged 27.8336 m.p.g. and ended up with the best mileage in the entire 1964 economy run. The Chevy II 6 was second, at 23.2182, and my Valiant V-8 finished third, at 23.0851.
 Fast forward to 2006, with fuel economy once again a driving concern. Gas prices are higher now, with AAA reporting a national average of $2.327 for regular last Thursday. In 1964, gas was selling for about 30 cents a gallon (about $1.95 in current dollars). The price of each gallon, along with concerns over Middle East imports and global warming, may make 2007 a good time to consider a revival of the economy run. It would not surprise me if, just as in 1964, curious spectators lined the streets when the caravan rolled into town.

HEADLINE: Fresh Twist on Eminent Domain

 BODY:
Eminent domain is usually viewed as a last resort that government can use when it wants to build something in the public interest -- a hospital, highway or, as authorized by the U.S. Supreme Court last year, an urban revitalization project. But the New Jersey Supreme Court this month ruled that eminent domain can also be used to spare a parcel of rapidly-disappearing countryside from a builder's imminent plans to pave it over. 
 The 6-1 decision, which allows the South Jersey suburb of Mount Laurel to seize one of its last remaining parcels of farmland, is a significant victory in the vital effort to prevent once rural parts of the Garden State from being overwhelmed with housing developments and strip malls. The 16-acre tract in question had already been prepped by the builder for 23 homes in the $400,000 and up price range. 
In rescuing the land, the court wrote that the state's residents ''have expressed a strong and sustained public interest'' in acquiring open space and ''have voted repeatedly'' to spend taxpayer money to do so. We agree, and would add that in a congested state like New Jersey preservation of the few remaining pieces of open land is as much in the public interest as any highway or government building.
 The lawyer for the developer says he expects to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on grounds that the decision violates federal fair housing laws since the town is trying to stop residential development, rather than just preserve open space. The lawyer also said the ruling amounts to a ''death knell'' for developers and would have a ''chilling effect'' on new construction. But a simple glance at the proliferation of housing developments, corporate headquarters and big box stores in once rural parts of the state makes it hard to believe that there is much of a threat to additional development.
 By stipulating that municipalities must pay a fair market price that reflects the land's development and zoning approvals, the Supreme Court imposed a safeguard against any town that might otherwise use its new power cavalierly. Michele Byers, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, said that even stronger deterrents are the high cost of going through the eminent domain process itself and the political unpopularity of invoking eminent domain for anything except as a last resort. 
 Interestingly, Mount Laurel, about 20 miles from Philadelphia, was the site of a series of earlier state Supreme Court decisions beginning in 1975 that became the basis for additional housing. The rulings, which became models for several states across the country, ultimately required many of New Jersey's wealthy towns to provide for modest amounts of affordable housing, especially when they gave the go ahead for new expensive homes. 
 Today, Mount Laurel is typical of many once sparsely-populated New Jersey towns that find themselves almost completely developed. The mayor, Peter McCaffrey, said the township instituted eminent domain proceedings as the only available way to save one of its two remaining tracts of farmland. He said the town of 43,000, which is home to three retirement communities, 22 hotels and numerous businesses and single family residences, is now about 90 percent developed.
 The latest Mount Laurel decision comes as the state Legislature is considering measures to curb eminent domain in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that allowed New London, Ct. to take property for redevelopment. We would urge the legislators to oppose any effort that would prevent a town from using eminent domain as a final option for preserving pristine land or other purposes of great public benefit.

HEADLINE: Stressed? It's Not the Gifts or the Parties. It's the Job.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years ago, two writers in Oregon wrote a suggestion-filled manifesto assailing the commercialization of the holiday season, ''Unplug the Christmas Machine.'' 
 The book was never a blockbuster. But 13 printings and 150,000 copies later, it still has an audience. ''The issues we addressed back then are with us today,'' observed Jean Coppock Staeheli, who wrote the manifesto with Jo Robinson.
By now, on the eve of Christmas, the holiday stress may be starting to ease. But if you wonder why the tyranny of the holiday crunch seems to get a bit worse each year, there's a reason -- and it's not really the frantic search for a just-right sweater for Uncle Frank. 
 Gift giving is part of it, of course. The year-end buying binge is a phenomenon that the economy depends on, Madison Avenue promotes and nearly everyone partakes in -- with sentiments that range from empty obligation to undisguised glee.
 Yet, increasingly, the seasonal stress is more about work than shopping. A growing number of workers, according to workplace experts and economists, have their compensation and job security linked to quarterly and year-end performance targets. So vacation days are abandoned and the holiday office parties are ignored because end-of-the-year projects have to be finished -- or else. 
 ''It's a manifestation of a corporate culture that pushes more of the risk and pressure to hit quarterly numbers and yearly numbers onto the employees,'' said Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''And it helps explain why the holidays have become nuttier.'' 
 The economy as a whole is actually somewhat less dependent on the end-of-the-year sprint than it used to be. This is mainly because of structural changes in the vast $12 trillion United States economy. As the nation has become richer, consumers spend more of their income on services, from childcare to restaurant meals, and that spending tends to spread evenly throughout the year. ''The economy is still back-ended, but not as much as it used to be,'' said Mark Zandi, senior economist at Moody's Economy.com.
 But that economic shift hasn't been felt by workers, many of whom depend on a year-end bonus, which typically is paid at the beginning of the following year. David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's, points to the spike in labor costs during the first quarter of recent years as evidence that bonuses based on hitting year-end performance targets are fairly widespread. ''Bonuses are getting to be a bigger and bigger part of total compensation, and we're not just talking about investment bankers and hedge fund managers by any means,'' Mr. Wyss said.
 Not only the lure of bonuses, but also the fear of losing a job adds to the seasonal strain on workers. 
 In the past, companies would try to hold off making layoffs during the holiday season, but no longer. The fourth quarter has become the most common time for layoff announcements, said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm. 
 ''There's no stigma anymore,'' he said. ''Companies are under great pressure to meet their year-end profit goals. If it becomes clear they will not hit them, the executives are under pressure to cut costs.'' Since Thanksgiving, well-known companies announcing large job cuts include the Bank of New York, Pfizer and DuPont.
 In the stretch to meet year-end goals, time is stolen from elsewhere. According to a poll by Harris Interactive, American workers gave back 574 million vacation days last year, or the equivalent of more than 20,000 lifetimes. The survey, conducted on behalf of the online travel service Expedia.com, estimated the value of those days, using the average hourly wage, at $75 billion.
 So, maybe it's no surprise that as the calendar winds down, many workers don't have the time for holiday spirit, and regard the company holiday party as a time-wasting distraction: 57 percent of workers say a holiday party is not important to them, and nearly half do not feel obligated to attend, according to a Harris Interactive poll published this month. The no-shows are struggling to balance the demands of work, shopping and family duties, said Nancy Halverson, a vice president at Spherion, a staffing consultant. 
 Exhaustion from the year-end crunch, according to David Ulrich, a professor at the University of Michigan business school, can be seen as supply and demand getting out of whack on a personal level. Workplace and social demands, he said, can exceed one's personal resources. ''We, and others, ask too much of ourselves,'' Mr. Ulrich explained. ''Year-end burnout is often more related to missed expectations than the work itself.''
 Of course, for many, shopping is still a seasonal chore. And there has been no shortage of holiday spending this year. The average American household expected to spend $857 on family and friends, or $77 more than last year, according to a poll by GfK Roper Consulting, a research firm. (For the economy, that would, in total, be a $90 billion shot in the arm.) And families with incomes of more than $75,000 planned to spend more than $1,500.
 But unlike toiling away for year-end accounting, getting a gift for Aunt Grace at least can lead to some measure of joy, for the gift-giving ritual serves as a reminder of home, hearth and lasting relationships. 
 ''People are exhausted by the year-end holidays, but they are also getting something out of it,'' said Leigh Eric Schmidt, a professor of religion at Princeton University and author of ''Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays.'' 
 ''You can't unplug Christmas,'' he concluded.

HEADLINE: Across Africa, A Sense That U.S. Power Isn't So Super

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia 

 BODY:
THE rally was supposed to be against Ethiopia, Somalia's neighbor and historic archenemy, which in the past few weeks had sent troops streaming across the border in an attempt to check the power of the increasingly powerful Islamists who rule Mogadishu.
 But the cheers that shook the stadium (which had no roof, by the way, and was riddled with bullet holes) were about another country, far, far away.
''Down, down U.S.A.!'' thousands of Somalis yelled, many of them waving cocked Kalashnikovs. ''Slit the throats of the Americans!''
 Not exactly soothing words, especially when the passport in your pocket has one of those golden eagles on it. 
 Somalia may be the place that best illustrates a trend sweeping across the African continent: After Sept. 11, 2001, the United States concluded that anarchy and misery aid terrorism, and so it tried to re-engage Africa. But anti-American sentiment on the continent has only grown, and become increasingly nasty. And the United States seems unable to do much about it.
 A number of experts on Africa trace those developments to a sense not of American power, but of its decline -- a perception that the United States is no longer the only power that counts, that it is too bogged down in the Middle East to be a real threat here, and so it can be ignored or defied with impunity. 
 American officials, for example, acknowledge that they are at a loss about what to do about the on-again, off-again Somali crisis, which cracked open last week when the two forces dueling for power blasted away at each other in their first major confrontation. In this case, there are a lot of reasons why many of the people don't like Americans, starting with the United States' botched efforts to play peacemaker in the early 1990s to its current support for Ethiopia, which is taking sides in Somalia's internal politics.
 But the broader issue playing out here -- the sense that the United States is not the kingmaker it once was -- goes beyond Mogadishu. It is Africa-wide. And it is based on a changed reality: the emergence of other customers for Africa's resources and the tying down of American military forces in Iraq have combined to reduce American clout in sub-Saharan Africa, even as the United States pumps in more financial aid than ever -- about $4 billion per year -- and can still claim to be the one superpower left standing. 
 ''The actual ability of the U.S. to influence circumstances on the ground in Africa has declined dramatically,'' said Michael Clough, a former director of the Africa program at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''But the symbolic significance of the United States is still there. So we become the perfect target.''
 For proof, please see Sudan, Congo, Eritrea, northern Nigeria to a lesser extent, and even South Africa.
 Chester A. Crocker, who was an assistant secretary of state for Africa under President Ronald Reagan, says the drop in American influence began when the cold war ended. He argues that despite all the complaints about fickle cold war Africa policy, which critics say propped up one corrupt dictator after another under the rationale of containing Communism, the United States was at least paying attention to Africa, and its efforts may have saved millions of lives. 
 It was the decade immediately after the cold war, Mr. Crocker said, when the United States disengaged from much of the continent, that Africa fell apart. Cataclysmic wars swept through Somalia, Rwanda, Algeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Congo. More Africans were slaughtered in the 1990s than in any other recent decade.
 Now, as the United States resumes its interest in Africa, it faces a new, more pixilated landscape. ''Africa is in play again,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''It is a more competitive playing field which gives greater influence to African leaders as well as to potential competitors or 'balancers' of U.S. diplomatic leverage. It is not just China: it is Brazil, the Europeans, Malaysia, Korea, Russia, India.''
 ''Inevitably,'' he concluded, ''this dilutes somewhat U.S. ability to call the shots, define the agenda and mobilize coherent international action.''
 For example, there is Sudan, a country that the West, and the United States in particular, has desperately tried to isolate. First, it was because of Sudan's links to terrorists. Then came reports that the government was tied to genocide in Darfur. Sanctions have been imposed, almost embarrassing amounts of diplomatic pressure have been exerted and now military threats are being made. The result: even more anti-American hatred, which plays straight into the hand of the hard-line Khartoum regime. 
 Why are the results of American policy in Sudan so meager? Two reasons stand out above others: oil and Asia.
 Sudan is flush with a booming supply of crude, and it has turned from West to East for trade partners: to China, India, Malaysia and the Arab world. That means American economic leverage doesn't work as it once did. Consider how little effect the sanctions have had on Sudan's economy -- it's one of the fastest growing in the world, even as Darfur burns. 
 ''We learned that we don't need the Americans anymore,'' said Lam Akol, Sudan's foreign minister. ''We found other avenues.''
 Back in the 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Crocker said, there were few other avenues. In those cold war days, he said, sustained, patient, high-level American involvement helped end wars from Angola to Mozambique and helped to bring South Africa's brutal apartheid system to its knees.
 In the 1990s, with the Soviet Union gone, aid to Africa dipped; Americans were turning inward, and foreign policy focused far more on building trade relations with dynamic new partners, especially in Asia and Eastern Europe.
 But then came 9-11. 
 ''And suddenly poor, nasty, weak places mattered,'' said Steve Morrison, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 In an effort to reduce the conditions in which terrorism is thought to thrive, American foreign aid to Africa surged, with much of the money going to health programs (especially AIDS prevention), and peacekeeping. Private Western efforts to alleviate suffering also increased. Just ask Bill Gates. Or Bill Clinton.
 TODAY, in Congo, the United States spends more than $200 million supporting a United Nations peacekeeping mission that has barely kept that unruly, violent, continent-sized country intact.
 But Ted Dagne, a specialist in African affairs for the Congressional Research Service, said that such concern about security in Africa ''has not led to expansion of relations in other areas and did not increase American influence in Africa.'' 
 One reason, he argued, was that American policy these days does not necessarily mean sustained, patient, high-level attention. Instead, it emphasizes the role that Africans themselves can play (supported by American money and advice, of course). More and more, Africans are mediating their own conflicts, from the border disputes between Ethiopia and Eritrea to the civil wars in Burundi and Sudan.
 Another reason is Iraq. The ceaselessness of Baghdad's bloodshed has greatly undermined the United States' credibility, fanned anti-American feelings in Muslim regions like the Horn of Africa, and drained resources that might otherwise have been available to address other problems.
 ''There is significant blowback coming from our catastrophic decisions in Iraq that is affecting our ability to do anything about Sudan or Somalia,'' Mr. Morrison said.
 Even so, many Africa experts say there are countries -- Kenya is one -- where the American message still matters. There, the United States is generally credited, along with other Western countries, with exerting crucial diplomatic leverage that helped Kenya make the peaceful transition in 2002 from a one-party state to a genuine multiparty democracy.
 ''America still has a lot of influence,'' said S. O. Mageto, a former Kenyan ambassador to Washington. ''But not like it used to.''

 BODY:
The concerns and interests of the nation are reflected in the words and expressions that flit to the fore. Here are just a few of the terms that became prominent or first appeared last year. 
 anchor baby: a derogatory term for a child born in the United States to an immigrant. Since these children automatically qualify as American citizens, they can later act as a sponsor for other family members.
digiroid: a test photograph taken with a cheap digital camera before a more expensive or complicated one is used. From digital plus Polaroid.
 frequent flier: a repeat offender; a recidivist; generally, a person who regularly or habitually uses or takes advantage of a service. From the airline industry term but now widely used in hospitals and by police officials.
 Fox lips: lips colored and lined with makeup to seem more prominent, said of female anchors on Fox News.
 God wink: something taken as evidence that a higher power is at work; a coincidence. Popularized by Squire Rushnell in his 2003 book, ''When God Winks,'' and in later books. A similar term is God breeze, a commonplace epiphany or revelation.
 hubby-sitter: a man hired to keep a woman's husband out of trouble.
 Hummer house: an overly large single-family residence. Synonyms from earlier years are starter castle, faux chateau and McMansion. 
 Internet courage: boldness of character that comes from the anonymity and distance inherent in Internet communication.
 jet people: asylum-seekers, refugees or immigrants who relocate by airplane. Constructed along the lines of boat people. 
 Johnny Jihad: a Muslim or Muslim combatant. Although this term dates to 1996 or earlier, its heaviest usage by far has occurred since 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq.
 Katrina brain: forgetfulness, lack of concentration and failure to follow through on activities, characteristic of the post-traumatic stress of Hurricane Katrina.
 never event: a serious or life-endangering medical error.
 puppet mouth: a mouth framed by a deep fold running from below the nostrils to the mouth corners. Term used by cosmetic surgeons.
 seven-thousand-mile screwdriver: micromanagement of a situation from afar. Lately used to describe the difficulties of managing the war in Iraq.
 sneeze: a television advertisement shorter than 15 seconds.
 spaghetti bowl: the interconnected and tangled economic relationships of a group of nations.
 subzero: a size of clothing smaller than zero, same as size 00.
 sudden jihad syndrome: an outburst of violence from a seemingly stable and normal Muslim.
 vice mail: voice-mail messages disguised as confidential stock tips left on the wrong answering machine, a form of the pump-and-dump scam.
 zeteophobia: a fear of career-planning. Coined by John Krumboltz, a Stanford University professor.

HEADLINE: Imagining Iraq After We Leave

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A War That Abhors a Vacuum'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 18):
 Ben Connable, a major in the Marine Corps, warns of an inevitable vacuum leading to a ''bloody reality'' on the streets and towns of Iraq should American forces withdraw.
As Major Connable surely knows, both already exist in Baghdad and elsewhere, the widely recognized result of the Bush administration's decisions to launch its unnecessary war and then disband the Iraqi Army and purge Baathists from every governing body in the ethnically and religiously divided nation. 
 To imply that the ensuing political vacuum can be filled only by the American occupation that created it cannot be the serious proposal Iraqis and the world desperately need to forestall catastrophic regional war.

Ruth J. Chojnacki
Chicago, Dec. 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 Of course Ben Connable is correct that there will be a ''bloody reality'' when we withdraw from Iraq. But this same bloody reality will exist if we withdraw 50 years or even 100 years from now as well, unless we have some magical plan for changing the nature of the entire region. 
 Come to think of it, invading Iraq was supposed to be the magic plan. The reality that we cannot possibly stay there as long as Iraq's neighbors and other locals like Al Qaeda is precisely why the invasion was ultimately doomed to fail. 
 Staying longer changes only how much money we waste and how many brave Americans die.
 The Iraqi units we are training will melt away or divide up into factions after we leave as quickly as Saddam Hussein's forces did when we went in. 
 Waiting for some future when they will be ready to take over without us is a fool's errand. Iran thanks us for coming, and suggests we avoid the door on our way out. 

Carmi Turchick
Buffalo, Dec. 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 I leave on Dec. 24 to return to Vietnam for the first time in almost 40 years. Ben Connable's Dec. 18 Op-Ed article reminds me of some of the arguments that were being made back then. 
 Should American forces stay and fight in a war they were not winning to protect ''our'' Vietnamese? 
 Would more American money, weapons, equipment and advisers permit the Vietnamese Army to stand up? 
 In the end, the ''cold calculus'' was that some 20,000 Americans and many more Vietnamese were killed while President Nixon tried to decide what to do -- and our Vietnamese lost their war. 
 That is a ''bloody reality'' that the United States must consider today.

Tom Collier
Ann Arbor, Mich., Dec. 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 Ben Connable makes a valid point that pulling out our troops from an area in Iraq makes that area a prominent target for insurgent takeover and tyranny.
 Unfortunately, this observation is moot. There is no plausible future in which Iraq is stable under American occupation. 
 There is also no plausible future in which Iraq is stable without American occupation. 
 No amount of microanalysis matters until we have a good answer to the question: How does this end?

Adhitya S. Chittur

Dec. 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 Ben Connable supports maintaining the American military presence in Iraq without addressing the security benefits of promoting diplomatic efforts and working to increase international economic investment. 
 The result is a mere parroting of President Bush's ''stay the course'' rhetoric. 
 Major Connable sidesteps the disastrous history of exclusively military intervention in Iraq. And he doesn't address the limits of blood and treasure that Americans are willing to sink into that country. 
 While articulate and moving, Major Connable's assessment is more White House politics than quality analysis. Ignoring today's problems and tomorrow's limitations does not make them go away. 
 We can and must fight smarter in the truly global war on terrorism. It is time that we attacked our Iraq problem in a new direction, with comprehensive solutions that allow for a reduction of United States military forces.
 America must hope that our new Congress is up to that task.

HEADLINE: Environmental Lawyer to Head Planning Board

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
The Long Island Regional Planning Board will soon have a new leader, the second in its 40-year history. The board voted on Tuesday to select Michael White, an environmental lawyer and partner at Jaspan Schlesinger Hoffman in Garden City, as its executive director. The appointment is to take effect next month. 
 Mr. White, 54, of Centerport, has held top environmental posts with Suffolk County and the Town of Huntington. He studied environmental science before earning a law degree from Touro Law Center in Huntington. 
James Larocca, the chairman of the planning board, said Mr. White was chosen after a national search that drew more than two dozen applicants.
 ''His Long Island credentials, undergraduate training as a research scientist and government experience, along with his awareness of the political and environmental communities, combined to play very high in our consideration of a new executive director,'' he said. ''In recent years, the board's processes have lost some momentum and standing, and we are confident that Michael will help put the board back on track as a regional leader for planning.''
 The planning board studies transportation, housing and energy issues, and serves as an advisory agency for policy changes. Lee Koppelman, who had been the board's executive director since its creation in 1965, was forced to resign in May, following criticism over its finances. 
 ''I hope that my skills as a scientist and understanding of the governmental process will help the board bring forward an action plan for ways to address the critical issues on Long Island,'' Mr. White said. ''My priorities are affordable housing, taxes and the cost of governing, and preservation of the environment. Above all, environment is my passion.''

Agreement Is Reached On Canon U.S.A. Move
 After numerous setbacks, a deal has been reached to move the headquarters of Canon U.S.A. from its current home in Lake Success, in Nassau County, to a 52-acre site in Melville, in Suffolk. 
 The Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, brokered a mediation session on Dec. 14 between the Tilles Investment Company, which owns the Melville site -- a former pumpkin farm along the Long Island Expressway -- and the Holiday Organization, a Westbury-based developer that had contracted in February 2005 to buy it. 
 When Canon approached Holiday to express interest in the site, Tilles balked at going through with the sale. 
 Although nothing was signed, the parties reached an agreement in principle, with terms expected to be made final early next year. 
 Milton Mollen, a retired New York State justice, presided over the mediation session. 
 Mr. Levy expressed relief over the agreement. ''If we didn't make a move, it could have led to a relocation to New Jersey,'' he said. ''A move by Canon U.S.A. to Suffolk will bring 2,000 jobs to the county and mean the largest number of upper-echelon jobs coming to the county since the arrival of Computer Associates.'' Computer Associates established its headquarters in Islandia, with 2,200 employees, in 1992. 
 Canon U.S.A. has been in Lake Success since 1978 and has 1,130 employees. With the move to Melville, it plans to expand its operations and add 1,000 jobs, Mr. Levy said. 
 Bill Reed, a company spokesman, said Canon had been looking to relocate since the late 1980s. ''This is our third or fourth attempt to find another location so we can buy the land and build our own headquarters in a campus-type setting,'' he said. Canon U.S.A. currently leases three buildings totaling 360,000 square feet. 
 Patrick Dugan, Nassau County's deputy county executive for economic development, said that Suffolk's good fortune would ''not necessarily'' mean gloom and doom for Nassau. 
 ''The move will mean that Nassau will lose a major employer, which will have an impact on property taxes, but most of the current employees will be able to commute to Melville,'' he said. ''We expect to attract another employer to fill that space.'' 

Giving Notice in Nassau On Games Rated 'M'
 A new law in Nassau County aimed at protecting children from violent video games will require retailers that sell games rated ''M'' (mature) to hand out or post a written notice at the checkout counter explaining the rating. Such games are designed for players 17 or over. 
 The legislation, signed on Dec. 13 by the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, was introduced in October by David Mejias, a county legislator from North Massapequa. 
 ''I was shocked when I learned about the content of some video games that kids are getting as gifts,'' Mr. Mejias said. ''There are games with women prostitutes being beaten, cops being killed, people using drugs and getting robbed at gunpoint. 
 ''While we don't have the right to make these games illegal or to tell retailers that they can't sell them, we do have the responsibility to give parents more information before they buy these video games.''
 Sol Tiegerman, a psychologist and specialist in behavioral management, praised the law but said it would ''probably be marginally effective as a major impact.''

HEADLINE: Scant Progress On Closing Gap In Women's Pay

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Throughout the 1980s and early '90s, women of all economic levels -- poor, middle class and rich -- were steadily gaining ground on their male counterparts in the work force. By the mid-'90s, women earned more than 75 cents for every dollar in hourly pay that men did, up from 65 cents just 15 years earlier.
 Largely without notice, however, one big group of women has stopped making progress: those with a four-year college degree. The gap between their pay and the pay of male college graduates has actually widened slightly since the mid-'90s.
 For women without a college education, the pay gap with men has narrowed only slightly over the same span. 
 These trends suggest that all the recent high-profile achievements -- the first female secretary of state, the first female lead anchor of a nightly newscast, the first female president of Princeton, and, next month, the first female speaker of the House -- do not reflect what is happening to most women, researchers say. 
 A decade ago, it was possible to imagine that men and women with similar qualifications might one day soon be making nearly identical salaries. Today, that is far harder to envision.
 ''Nothing happened to the pay gap from the mid-1950s to the late '70s,'' said Francine D. Blau, an economist at Cornell and a leading researcher of gender and pay. ''Then the '80s stood out as a period of sharp increases in women's pay. And it's much less impressive after that.''
 Last year, college-educated women between 36 and 45 years old, for example, earned 74.7 cents in hourly pay for every dollar that men in the same group did, according to Labor Department data analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute. A decade earlier, the women earned 75.7 cents.
 The reasons for the stagnation are complicated and appear to include both discrimination and women's own choices. The number of women staying home with young children has risen recently, according to the Labor Department; the increase has been sharpest among highly educated mothers, who might otherwise be earning high salaries. The pace at which women are flowing into highly paid fields also appears to have slowed.
 Like so much about gender and the workplace, there are at least two ways to view these trends. One is that women, faced with most of the burden for taking care of families, are forced to choose jobs that pay less -- or, in the case of stay-at-home mothers, nothing at all.
 If the government offered day-care programs similar to those in other countries or men spent more time caring for family members, women would have greater opportunity to pursue whatever job they wanted, according to this view. 
 The other view is that women consider money a top priority less often than men do. Many may relish the chance to care for children or parents and prefer jobs, like those in the nonprofit sector, that offer more opportunity to influence other people's lives. 
 Both views, economists note, could have some truth to them.
 ''Is equality of income what we really want?'' asked Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard who has written about the revolution in women's work over the last generation. ''Do we want everyone to have an equal chance to work 80 hours in their prime reproductive years? Yes, but we don't expect them to take that chance equally often.''
 Whatever role their own preferences may play in the pay gap, many women say they continue to battle subtle forms of lingering prejudice. Indeed, the pay gap between men and women who have similar qualifications and work in the same occupation -- which economists say is one of the purest measures of gender equality -- has barely budged since 1990.
 Today, the discrimination often comes from bosses who believe they treat everyone equally, women say, but it can still create a glass ceiling that keeps them from reaching the best jobs at a company.
 ''I don't think anyone would ever say I couldn't do the job as well as a man,'' said Christine Kwapnoski, a 42-year-old bakery manager at a Sam's Club in Northern California who will make $63,000 this year, including overtime. Still, Ms. Kwapnoski said she was paid significantly less than men in similar jobs, and she has joined a class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores, which owns Sam's Club.
 The lawsuit is part of a spurt of cases in recent years contending gender discrimination at large companies, including Boeing, Costco, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Last month, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case against Goodyear Tire and Rubber. 
 At Sam's Club, Ms. Kwapnoski said that when she was a dock supervisor, she discovered that a man she supervised was making as much as she was. She was later promoted with no raise, even though men who received such a promotion did get more money, she said. 
 ''Basically, I was told it was none of my business, that there was nothing I could do about it,'' she said.
 Ms. Kwapnoski does not have a bachelor's degree, but her allegations are typical of the recent trends in another way: the pay gap is now largest among workers earning relatively good salaries. 
 At Wal-Mart, the percentage of women dwindles at each successive management level. They hold almost 75 percent of department-head positions, according to the company. But only about 20 percent of store managers, who can make significantly more than $100,000, are women. 
 This is true even though women receive better evaluations than men on average and have longer job tenure, said Brad Seligman, the lead plaintiffs' lawyer in the lawsuit.
 Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the company did not discriminate. ''It's really a leap of logic to assume that the data is a product of discrimination,'' Mr. Boutrous said. ''People have different interests, different priorities, different career paths'' -- and different levels of desire to go into management, he added. 
 The other companies that have been sued also say they do not discriminate. 
 Economists say that the recent pay trends have been overlooked because the overall pay gap, as measured by the government, continues to narrow. The average hourly pay of all female workers rose to 80.1 percent of men's pay last year, from 77.3 percent in 2000.
 But that is largely because women continue to close the qualifications gap. More women than men now graduate from college, and the number of women with decades of work experience is still growing rapidly. Within many demographic groups, though, women are no longer gaining ground. 
 Ms. Blau and her husband, Lawrence M. Kahn, another Cornell economist, have done some of the most detailed studies of gender and pay, comparing men and women who have the same occupation, education, experience, race and labor-union status. At the end of the late 1970s, women earned about 82 percent as much each hour as men with a similar profile. A decade later, the number had shot up to 91 percent, offering reason to wonder if women would reach parity.
 But by the late '90s, the number remained at 91 percent. Ms. Blau and Mr. Kahn have not yet examined the current decade in detail, but she said other data suggested that there had been little movement.
 During the 1990s boom, college-educated men received larger raises than women on average. Women have done slightly better than the men in the last few years, but not enough to make up for the late '90s, the Economic Policy Institute analysis found.
 There is no proof that discrimination is the cause of the remaining pay gap, Ms. Blau said. It is possible that the average man, brought up to view himself the main breadwinner, is more committed to his job than the average woman.
 But researchers note that government efforts to reduce sex discrimination have ebbed over the period that the pay gap has stagnated. In the 1960s and '70s, laws like Title VII and Title IX prohibited discrimination at work and in school and may have helped close the pay gap in subsequent years. There have been no similar pushes in the last couple of decades.
 Women have continued to pour into high-paid professions like law, medicine and corporate management where they were once rare, but the increases seem to have slowed, noted Reeve Vanneman, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. 
 Medicine offers a particularly good window on these changes. Roughly 40 percent of medical school graduates are women today. Yet many of the highest paid specialties, the ones in which salaries often exceed $400,000, remain dominated by men and will be for decades to come, based on the pipeline of residents. 
 Only 28 percent of radiology residents in 2004-5 were women, the Association of American Medical Colleges has reported. Only 10 percent of orthopedic surgery residents were female. The specialties in which more than half of new doctors are women, like dermatology, family medicine and pediatrics, tend to pay less. 
 Melanie Kingsley, a 28-year-old resident at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said she had wanted to be a doctor for as long as she could recall. For a party celebrating her graduation from medical school, her mother printed up invitations with a photo of Dr. Kingsley wearing a stethoscope -- when she was a toddler.
 As the first doctor in her family, though, she did not have a clear idea of which specialty she would choose until she spent a summer working alongside a female dermatologist in Chicago. There, she saw that dermatologists worked with everyone from newborns to the elderly and worked on nearly every part of the body, and she was hooked.
 ''You get paid enough to support your family and enjoy life,'' said Dr. Kingsley, a lifelong Indiana resident. ''Yeah, maybe I won't make a lot of money. But I'll be happy with my day-to-day job, and that's the reason I went into medicine -- to help other people.'' She added: ''I have seen people do it for the money, and they're not very happy.''
 The gender differences among medical specialties point to another aspect of the current pay gap. In earlier decades, the size of the gap was similar among middle-class and affluent workers. At times, it was actually smaller at the top.
 But the gap is now widest among highly paid workers. A woman making more than 95 percent of all other women earned the equivalent of $36 an hour last year, or about $90,000 a year for working 50 hours a week. A man making more than 95 percent of all other men, putting in the same hours, would have earned $115,000 -- a difference of 28 percent.
 At the very top of the income ladder, the gap is probably even larger. The official statistics do not capture the nation's highest earners, and in many fields where pay has soared -- Wall Street, hedge funds, technology -- the top jobs are overwhelmingly held by men.

Articles in this series are examining what has happened to men and women several decades after the women's movement began. The series can be found at nytimes.com/business.

HEADLINE: Bigger Army Will Mean Bigger Job for Recruiters

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE and THOM SHANKER; John Dougherty contributed reporting from Tempe, Ariz., Tim Eaton from Austin, Tex., and Eric Ferkenhoff from Chicago.

 BODY:
In his six years as an Army recruiter in South Dakota and now in Chicago, Sgt. First Class Roger White has heard his pitch rejected for all kinds of reasons: The job is too dangerous. My parents hate the war. I can make more money working. 
 But when Sergeant White tried to explain why he trusted that the military could continue to sustain and swell its ranks at a time of war, he said, one story came to mind.
A 39-year-old woman who once worked as a chemical specialist in the Army found herself down and out and living in a women's shelter, he said. The Army came calling one more time, and she re-enlisted. Now, the woman is back in uniform at her previous job, serving in South Korea. 
 ''It was amazing,'' Sergeant White said, ''to see how much change we could bring to just this one woman's life.'' 
 More recruits may soon be needed. With President Bush's declaration last week that he had asked Robert M. Gates, the new defense secretary, to work with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a plan to expand the Army and Marine Corps, military officials have already begun to consider how to grow, by how much and how fast.
 Senior Army officials underscore the challenges they face, regardless of the goals that might be set. But like Sergeant White, they also express confidence that the Army's recruiters -- armed with incentives, high-tech marketing and inspiring stories from soldiers -- can continue a steady, substantial annual increase in troop numbers.
 The process is expected to be gradual: Pentagon civilian officials and military officers said that few were envisioning a large, rapid growth that would require the Army to dust off emergency mobilization plans for reopening bases or drawing in National Guard equipment.
 Instead, civilian and military officials said, they are drawing up tentative proposals that would make permanent the 30,000-troop temporary increase approved by Congress after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and then add 30,000 more troops to the Army over the next five years, resulting in an active-duty Army with 542,400 soldiers by 2012.
 Expanding the nation's ground forces is expensive; every 10,000 new soldiers add about $1.2 billion in personnel costs to the Pentagon's annual budget. On top of that, equipment for 10,000 new troops would cost an additional $2 billion, according to Army statistics.
 The study of how to expand the ground forces comes at a time of other financial strains. Army officials have told Congress that the service was $56 billion short in its equipment budget before the war in Iraq, and now requires an extra $14 billion annually just to repair and replace equipment worn or destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Nevertheless, among many officers and soldiers in Iraq and at home, the need for additional support has grown urgent. Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, previewed the service's thinking this month when he warned that unless more soldiers were added to the roster, ''We will break the active component.'' 
 General Schoomaker said the Army could successfully manage a growth of 6,000 to 7,000 soldiers a year, and a range of Army officials acknowledged that any growth larger or faster than that would require exorbitant amounts of money for financial incentives, new barracks and equipment.
 Similarly, Gen. James T. Conway, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said recently that his force of 180,000 could grow by 1,000 to 2,000 a year until the current strain on America's ground forces from the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan was reduced.
 Col. Kevin A. Shwedo, director of operations for the Army Accessions Command, which is responsible for recruiting and initial training, said the service routinely reassigned drill sergeants and opened classrooms to fill specific Army needs, whether into field medicine, intelligence or infantry. This experience would allow the Army to deal with any order to expand its roster, he said.
 ''We have a plan right now where we have projected training seats from now through the end of next year,'' Colonel Shwedo said in a telephone interview. ''And we have the ability with minimal disruption to shift those seats if a decision is made by our military and civilian leadership to expand the training base.'' 
 Recruiters still face challenges in filling basic training classrooms with new soldiers. The Army failed to meet its annual recruiting goals in 2005 by the widest margin in two decades. 
 The Army met its recruiting goal in the 2006 year, which ended at midnight on Sept. 30. But to be successful, the Army added 1,000 recruiters, bringing its total to 6,500, and sweetened their educational and financial incentives. 
 The Army also raised recruits' maximum allowable age to 42 from 35 and accepted a larger percentage of applicants who scored at the lowest acceptable range on a standardized aptitude examination, leading some military analysts to suggest that the Army had undermined its historic emphasis on quality to make its quota.
 Sgt. First Class Abid Shah, a senior enlisted official at the military entrance processing station at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, where new recruits are tested and sworn in, said more recruiters might be needed. Even then, he emphasized that the effort would move slowly.
 ''It won't happen in days,'' Sergeant Shah said. ''It takes years.''
 Part of the struggle, recruiters said, is economic. Attracting young people to military service is difficult when jobs are plentiful and wages are on the rise. 
 The pool of eligible candidates is also small, as Army requirements that recruits meet certain physical, mental and moral standards mean that only 3 of 10 18-year-old Americans may apply.
 Parents are another major obstacle to recruitment, Pentagon studies have shown. For some recruits, signing up means risking alienating parents, or just plain ignoring them. 
 Luis Vega, for example, after being sworn in to the Army Reserve on Friday at Fort Hamilton, said he had not told his parents. 
 ''They think it's just a phase,'' he said. 
 His head was already shaved; he planned to ship out in April. And besides his fiancee, who he said supported the move, Mr. Vega, 28, said he was the only one in his hometown of East Rutherford, N.J., who seemed to understand the value of military service. 
 ''Everybody thinks I'm crazy,'' Mr. Vega said. 
 Elsewhere, especially in the Southwest, where recruiting has been strong in recent years, the mood seemed to be more visibly upbeat.
 At a recruiting station near the University of Texas at Austin, Sgt. First Class Jeremy Cousineau said that there seemed to be no lack of interest among young men and women in his area. He said he believed that the Army would have little trouble finding the soldiers it needed. 
 ''It's all good around here,'' he said. ''Life is good in recruiting for us.''
 Two marines helping out with recruiting while at home for the holidays in Tempe, Ariz., said they hoped that their positive experiences in the military would persuade others to sign up. 
 One of them, Sgt. Jesus Delatrinidad, 23, said that despite the long absences from home -- unlike many marines, he has not served in Iraq -- signing up or re-enlisting brought benefits far beyond the financial.
 ''I love the Marine Corps and that's what's making me think about staying in,'' he said, noting that he had six more months on his four-year contract. ''It's made me a better person.''
 Appeals to the sense of personal growth, and patriotism remain a dominant part of the recruiting pitch for the Army and the Marines. In advertisements and at sporting events, recruiters now emphasize intangibles, like the camaraderie of combat, at least as much as the financial incentives like extra money for college. 
 According to Sergeant White in Chicago, the approach seems to be working. 
 ''The applicants we've been interviewing, people join for a reason,'' he said. ''Whether that's to serve the country, to pay off college or go to college in the first place, that hasn't changed. But more and more, we're seeing the patriotism. People who simply want to serve their country. That's their reason for coming into the office, and that hasn't changed.''

HEADLINE: Security Council Approves Sanctions Against Iran Over Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
The Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved sanctions intended to curb Iran's nuclear program, capping months of negotiations over how severe and sweeping the restrictions should be.
 The resolution, prepared by Germany and the Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- bans the import and export of materials and technology used in uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missiles.
Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador to the United Nations, hailed the measure as an ''unambiguous message that there are serious repercussions'' for Iran's pursuit of its nuclear ambitions. He added, however, that it was ''only a first step,'' saying, ''If necessary, we will not hesitate to return to this body for further action if Iran fails to take steps to comply.'' 
 The resolution, which mandates compliance but restricts punishment to nonmilitary measures, has been in the works since Iran flouted the Security Council's call for a ''full and sustained suspension'' of nuclear activities by Aug. 31. It is weaker than proposals in earlier drafts, which started circulating in October, after repeated changes intended to placate Russia, which has strong economic ties with Iran. Throughout the process, Russia's objections were often seconded by China.
 Uranium enrichment is the first step in making fuel that can be used for nuclear power plants, or for nuclear weapons. Iran has maintained that it has the right to pursue its nuclear program, which it says is aimed at generating electricity. 
 Iran's United Nations ambassador, Javad Zarif, greeted the resolution's passage with a lengthy and critical address, saying that it ''can only remind the Iranian people of the historical injustices this Security Council has done to them'' and that the Council should focus its efforts instead on Israel, which he declared an ''actual threat to international peace and security.'' 
 The measure would freeze the assets of 12 Iranians and 10 companies said to be involved in nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It also would give a new committee the authority to amend the list later. 
 The final version of the text, however, qualifies the asset freeze in some respects, for example by giving countries more latitude to unfreeze certain assets than previous drafts would have allowed.
 In an effort to maintain their sometimes fragile coalition, the Americans and Europeans also agreed to eliminate a mandatory travel ban on those people said to be involved in nuclear activities. While older drafts had mandated that all states ''prevent entry'' of such people, the final version of the resolution simply ''calls upon'' states to ''exercise vigilance'' over their borders.
 In another nod to Russia, the resolution was amended to exclude any sanctions against a nuclear power plant that Russia is building at Bushehr, in southern Iran.
 R. Nicholas Burns, the American under secretary of state for political affairs, said that the Security Council's unanimous approval of the measure was ''significant,'' and that the ''process of compromise that allowed us to reach this resolution was worth it in that respect.'' He said he hoped that it would encourage other countries and organizations to adopt sanctions against Iran, and noted that harsher economic penalties could follow if Iran failed to halt its nuclear program within 60 days. 
 The Security Council was initially expected to approve the resolution on Friday, but as recently as Friday morning, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, voiced concerns that the text threatened legitimate business deals. 
 Mr. Churkin maintained that the resolution was intended to prod Iran to negotiate, not to punish it. Several small 11th-hour revisions, however, allayed Moscow's concerns, including the removal of one company, Aerospace Industries Organization, from the list of those involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. Several of the company's subsidiaries remain on the list. 
 ''We believe that the resolution is written in a way which should not allow hindering legitimate activities,'' Mr. Churkin said Saturday. ''We'll see what happens in the course of implementation.'' 
 For years, some officials within the American government have pressed for the Security Council to adopt sanctions to halt Iran's nuclear pursuits. 
 In June, the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany offered Iran a package of economic and political incentives to halt its nuclear program. The offer was rejected, setting the stage for the Aug. 31 deadline and, ultimately, the sanctions resolution.
 The resolution's European sponsors emphasized that they hoped it would inspire Iran to cooperate. 
 Emyr Jones Parry, Britain's ambassador, said the ''long, complicated, sensitive'' negotiation had culminated in a ''very tough message.'' 
 Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the French ambassador, said: ''Iran has now a very clear-cut choice to make. Cooperate with the international community or be more and more isolated. And we hope that Iran will make the right choice, the choice of dialogue.'' 

U.N. Approves Renovation Plan
 UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 23 (Reuters) -- The General Assembly on Saturday approved a top-to-bottom renovation of its landmark Manhattan headquarters building that is expected to take seven years at a cost of $1.9 billion.
 The main building is a 39-story aluminum, glass and marble tower that houses the United Nations Secretariat and is considered an outstanding example of modern architecture.
 But after 54 years, its roof leaks, it is riddled with asbestos and it lacks fire detectors, a sprinkler system or other emergency safety devices.
 Renovation was first envisioned in 2002, and the project was estimated then to end up costing about $1 billion. But the price tag has soared since then, mostly because of construction delays, improvements focused on security and a failed campaign to persuade the New York State Legislature to approve a new office building to provide temporary space for staff members. 
 The project is to be financed by increases in the dues paid by all the members of the United Nations on a sliding scale. That will put the poorest nations' share at a little under $2 million each. The United States, which picks up the tab for 22 percent of the regular United Nations budget, will pay more than $400 million.

HEADLINE: Tiny Montenegro Booms, and Eyes the Russian Hand That's Feeding It

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: BECICI, Montenegro 

 BODY:
Montenegro has never seen anything quite like the Hotel Splendid. For almost half a mile, this complex of penthouse suites, swimming pools and boutiques stretches along the Adriatic shoreline providing unparalleled luxury for those who can afford it. 
 But like many of the projects backed by Russian investment funds that have recently poured into this small country, the hotel has earned a less than glamorous reputation. Three bombs exploded at the site during construction. The police officer investigating the blasts was killed. When the hotel opened in September, guests were bused in under the watchful eyes of armed guards.
In the past two to three years, hundreds of Russians have flocked to Montenegro to buy large stretches of land along the increasing fashionable Adriatic coast and to build resorts like the Hotel Splendid. Farther inland they have bought the majority of shares in the country's industrial sector. Their money has helped to fuel a real estate boom and has provided much-needed cash to ailing factories. 
 The influx of Russian capital is prompting many here to question its impact on this nation of only 650,000 people, which already has a reputation as one of the most corrupt and crime-ridden states in the Balkans. The concerns spring from the secretive nature of many deals, questions about the origins of their financing and the large sums of money involved. Transactions are frequently carried out with cash. 
 ''The question is who knows what is going on? Whose funds they are?'' said Ranko Krivokapic, the speaker of Montenegro's Parliament and leader of the Social Democratic Party, one of two major parties in the coalition government. ''Who knows?'' 
 In its official policy, Montenegro is avowedly pro-Western. In May, the republic voted in a referendum to end its union with neighboring Serbia, breaking up all that remained of the former Yugoslavia. The newly independent state has made membership in NATO and the European Union immediate priorities. The country's new prime minister, Zeljko Sturanovic, who took over in October from Milo Djukanovic, the longest-serving leader in the Balkans, says he wants to rid the country of the organized crime groups that dominated it during the breakup of Yugoslavia. 
 But government and opposition leaders now worry that Russian money could slow much-needed economic and political changes and thwart Montenegro's aspirations for closer ties with Europe and the United States.
 Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, recently valued Russian investments in Montenegro at about $2 billion, roughly equivalent to Montenegro's annual economic output. But they may be even more; government officials say many ventures are channeled through companies in third countries. Some suggest that these companies are also being used to bring money earned illicitly in Montenegro in the 1990s back into the country. 
 From Bar to Tivat, Montenegro's most prized stretch of coast, Russian voices can now be heard around the ports, on the beaches and in the cafes. Real estate signs are written in Russian and English. Irish and British clients outnumber Russians, real estate agents here say, but it is the Russians -- many working with Montenegrin business partners -- who have brought the largest and most valuable assets. 
 ''It is interesting that they are able to come here carrying four, five or six million euros in cash apparently without any form or official control,'' said Marija Vukovic, who was until a year ago a municipal lawyer for Budva, a pretty coastal town where Russians have made substantial investments. 
 Ms. Vukovic now owns her business, dealing with real estate transactions. ''Every day we hear that Montenegro wants to be part of the E.U., but this kind of business is not proof that we are heading the right way,'' she said.
 As Russian investments here grow, Moscow has sought to exert more political influence. In August, Russia's emergencies minister, Sergei Shoigu, warned in an interview with a Montenegrin newspaper that relations between the countries would be damaged if the Montenegrins continued to pursue NATO membership. Later that month, Mr. Djukanovic met with President Putin in Sochi, a Russian Black Sea resort, and discussed the possibility of creating a military-technical agreement. 
 ''What will be the price of our partnership with Russia?'' said Nebojsa Medojevic, an opposition leader. Montenegrins, he said, believe that Russian businesses have little interest in the rule of law in what is still a very weak state. ''I have nothing against Russians, just their prices, the role of their police, illegal funding, state interference in the media and so on,'' he said.
 Historians here point out that Montenegro has performed a balancing act between East and West for hundreds of years. For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Montenegro -- which first gained independence in 1878 and lost it at the end of World War I -- was an ally of the Austro-Hungarian empire. During that time the small principality turned to Russia, a fellow nation of Orthodox Christian Slavs, to finance its debt and buy arms. The royal families of Montenegro and Russia also intermarried. 
 Now, after years of stagnation brought on by war and sanctions in the 1990s, many government officials say Russian investments are crucial to economic revival. 
 Mr. Krivokapic, the parliamentary speaker, said Russian companies were far more willing than Western businesses to invest here because of the country's shifting political status. He said there was plenty of historical precedent in the reliance of other countries on Russian money. 
 ''I was surprised when I saw that Nice, Cannes, Monte Carlo were all built with the help of Russian money,'' he said. Away from the coast Russians have dominated the purchase of state-owned industries from the government in deals that opposition groups have criticized. 
 In 2005, Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, based in Russia, became the majority shareholder in Kombinat Aluminum Podgorica, an aluminum smelter, as well as an affiliated thermoelectric power station, bauxite mine and coal mine, which together account for around half of Montenegro's export earnings. Rusal was the only company to negotiate with the government, and the government classified the contract as a business secret. 
 In 2004, Montenegro's main steel mill, Zeljezara Niksic, was sold to Midland Resources, which is Russian-owned but registered in Britain. That contract was also classified as secret. (The mill was subsequently taken over again by the government and then sold to a British company.) 
 The concerns about these investments are based on a perception that Russian investments are inextricably linked with bad business practices, some critics here concede. 
 Whether or not those views are fully justified, senior government officials say they would like to curb Russia's commercial influence. 
 ''We are aware of the fact, once again, we are a small economic system that can be dominated and manipulated easier than the bigger ones,'' said Miodrag Vlahovic, Montenegro's former foreign minister, in an interview before stepping down this fall. ''But we believe that with the new investments coming from the Western countries, with one or two strategic players, the situation will be balanced.'' 
 But critics of Russian investment say the influence of Russian groups already here will be hard to escape in this still fragile country. 
 ''I wouldn't care that the Russians were coming if we had strong institutions,'' said Vanja Calovic, the coordinator of MANS -- the Montenegro Network for the Affirmation of the NGO Sector -- an anticorruption campaign group based in Podgorica, the capital. But, she said, ''they will be too powerful to be controlled by the government.''

HEADLINE: Rap Fan Asks Hard Questions About the Music He Loves

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Byron Hurt takes pains to say that he is a fan of hip-hop, but over time, says Mr. Hurt, a 36-year-old filmmaker, dreadlocks hanging below his shoulders, ''I began to become very conflicted about the music I love.'' 
 A new documentary by Mr. Hurt, ''Hip Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes,'' questions the violence, degradation of women and homophobia in much of rap music. 
Scheduled to go on the air in February as part of the PBS series Independent Lens, the documentary is being shown now at high schools, colleges and Boy's Clubs, and in other forums, as part of an unusual public campaign sponsored by the Independent Television Service, which is based in San Francisco and helped finance the film.
 The intended audiences include young fans, hip-hop artists and music industry executives -- black and white -- who profit from music and videos that glorify swagger and luxury, portray women as sex objects, and imply, critics say, that education and hard work are for suckers and sissies.
 What concerns Mr. Hurt and many black scholars is the domination of the hip-hop market by more violent and sexually demeaning songs and videos -- an ascendancy, the critics say, that has coincided with the growth of the white audience for rap and the growing role of large corporations in marketing the music.
 Ronald F. Ferguson, a black economist and education expert at Harvard, said that the global success of hip-hop had had positive influences on the self-esteem of black youths but that children who became obsessed with it ''may unconsciously adopt the themes in this music as their lens for viewing the world.''
 With the commercial success of gangsta rap and music videos, which portray men as extravagant thugs and women as sex toys, debate has simmered among black parents, community leaders and scholars about the impact of rap and the surrounding hip-hop culture. 
 ''There's a conversation going on now; a lot more people are trying to figure out a way to intervene that's productive,'' said Tricia Rose, a professor of Africana studies at Brown University. 
 At one extreme are critics, both black and white, who put primary blame for the failures and isolation of urban black youth on a self-destructive subculture, exemplified by the worst of hip-hop. But many of those critics, Dr. Rose said, fail to acknowledge the deeper roots of the problems. At the other extreme are people who reflexively defend any artistic expression by young blacks, saying the focus must remain on the economic and political structures that hem in minorities. 
 ''That's the real catch,'' Dr. Rose said. ''The public conversation about hip-hop is pinned by two responses, neither of them productive.''
 Among blacks, to criticize rap, especially in front of the wider society, is to risk being called disloyal, said William Jelani Cobb, a historian at Spelman College in Atlanta, at a recent screening of the film in Newark. But the exaggerated image of male aggression, said Dr. Cobb, who also speaks in the documentary, actually reflects male insecurity and longstanding powerlessness, while the image of women resembles that held by 19th century slave owners.
 Chris Bennett, 36, took his daughters, ages 15 and 11, to see Mr. Hurt's film in Chicago because he said he wanted them to think about the music. Mr. Bennett, a school security guard, said he saw the effects of gangsta rap in his job. ''Everyone wants to be tough now,'' he said. ''Everyone wants to be hard, and education has taken the background.'' 
 The event in Chicago drew some 250 people, including several high school groups. Many of the boys were skeptical about the supposed dire influences of rap. Jock Lucas, 16, hotly argued with female students about the prevalence of lyrics that denigrate women, asserting, as many of the boys did, that a girl who dressed provocatively deserved such labels and might even like them. 
 ''I don't think rap is a bad influence,'' Jock said. ''They're just speaking about how it goes where they come from. If the people who listen go out and do these things, it's their own fault.'' 
 Another high school student at the Chicago event, Vasawa Robinson, 19, said rap showed ''real life'' and that ''if you try to show a different picture, the kids won't want to listen.'' The more political, socially conscious rap, Vasawa said, was for an older generation. 
 Mr. Hurt's film includes clips from a music video by the rapper 50 Cent, from his album ''Get Rich or Die Tryin', '' in which the singer re-enacts a drive-by shooting he survived and boasts in crude terms of his power and readiness to kill his enemies. 
 It also includes portions of the video ''Tip Drill,'' an extended fantasy of male sexual domination by the rap star Nelly, who has won praise by promoting literacy and bone marrow donations, but, as the film notes, also markets a drink called Pimp Juice. 
 Mr. Hurt, who grew up in a black neighborhood of Central Islip, N.Y., in modest circumstances, was quarterback of the Northeastern University football team and said he had been a fanatical ''hip-hop head.'' 
 ''It was music created by people your age who looked like you , talked like you, dressed like you and weren't apologetic about it,'' he said.
 His views changed, he said, when, after college, he worked in a program teaching male athletes about violence against women. 
 ''Here's the conflict,'' Mr. Hurt said. ''You still love hip-hop and you love to see the artists doing well, but then you ask, 'What are they saying? What is the image of manhood?' '' 
 White males may be major customers, Mr. Hurt said, ''but it influences black kids the most.''
 ''They're the ones who order their days around it,'' he said, ''who try to conform to the script.''

HEADLINE: Immigrants Go From Farms to Jails, And a Climate of Fear Settles In

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: ELBA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A cold December rain gusted across fields of cabbage destined for New York City egg rolls, cole slaw and Christmas goose. Ankle-deep in mud, six immigrant farmworkers raced to harvest 120,000 pounds before nightfall, knowing that at dawn they could find immigration agents at their door.
 The farmer who stopped to check their progress had lost 28 other workers in a raid in October, all illegal Mexican immigrants with false work permits at another farm here in western New York. Throughout the region, farm hands have simply disappeared by twos and threes, picked up on a Sunday as they went to church or to the laundry. Whole families have gone into hiding, like the couple who spent the night with their child in a plastic calf hutch.
 As record-setting enforcement of immigration laws upends old, unspoken arrangements, a new climate of fear is sweeping through the rural communities of western and central New York. 
 ''The farmers are just petrified at what's happening to their workers,'' said Maureen Torrey, an 11th-generation grower and a director of the Federal Reserve Bank's Buffalo branch whose family owns this field and more than 10,000 acres of vegetable and dairy farms. 
 And for the first time in years, farmers are also frightened for themselves. In small towns divided over immigration, they fear that speaking out -- or a disgruntled neighbor's call to the authorities -- could make them targets of the next raid and raise the threat of criminal prosecution.
 Here where agriculture is the mainstay of a depressed economy, the mainstay of agriculture is largely illegal immigrant labor from Mexico. Now, more aggressive enforcement has disrupted a system of official winks, nods and paperwork that for years protected farmers from ''knowingly'' hiring the illegal immigrants who make up most of their work force.
 ''It serves as a polarizing force in communities,'' said Mary Jo Dudley, who directs the Cornell Farmworker Program, which does research. ''The immigrant workers themselves see anyone as a potential enemy. The growers are nervous about everyone. There's this environment of fear and mistrust all across the board.'' 
 In a recent case that chilled many farmers, federal agents trying to develop a criminal case detained several longtime Hispanic employees of a small dairy farm in Clifton Springs, and unsuccessfully pressed them to give evidence that the owners knew they were here illegally.
 Since raids began to increase in early spring, arrests have netted dozens of Mexican farm workers on their way to milk parlors, apple orchards and vineyards, and prompted scores more to flee, affecting hundreds of farms. Some longtime employees with American children were deported too quickly for goodbyes, or remain out of reach in the federal detention center in Batavia, N.Y., where immigrants are tracked by alien registration number, not by name.
 Federal officials say events here simply reflect a national commitment to more intensive enforcement of immigration laws, showcased in raids in December at Swift & Company meatpacking plants in six states. 
 The effort led to a record 189,924 deportations nationally during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, up 12 percent from the year before, officials said, and 2,186 deportations from Buffalo, up 24 percent. It includes prosecuting employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, better cooperation with state and local law enforcement, and new money from Congress for more agents, more detention beds and quicker deportations.
 In small towns like Sodus, Dresden and Elba, where a welcome sign declares that the population of 2,369 is ''Just Right,'' some residents quietly approve of the crackdown. They are unhappy with the growing year-round presence of Mexicans they consider a drain on public services, resentful of the political clout of farmers, or concerned about the porous borders denounced nightly on CNN by Lou Dobbs. Others are torn, praising Mexican families but worried that some farmers exploit them. 
 Farm lenders and lobbyists warn of economic losses that will be measurable in unharvested crops, hundreds of closed farms and revenues lost in the wine tourism of the Finger Lakes. On the other side, supporters of stringent enforcement expect savings in schools and hospitals, and a boost to low wages as the labor market tightens. 
 The harvest of fear may be harder to chart, but it is already here. It can be felt in Sodus, where an October raid left a dozen children without either parent for days, and in vineyards near Penn Yan, where a grower of fine cabernet grapes reluctantly permits a worker to sleep in a car, hidden in the vines that he prunes. Everywhere, rumors fly about why one place was raided and not another, feeding suspicion and a fear of speaking out.
 For Rodney and Debbie Brown, the dairy farmers in Clifton Springs who lost 6 of their 10 employees to immigration arrests, the experience began like an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.''
 When no workers showed up at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 28 to help milk 580 waiting cows, Mr. Brown went to the farmhouse where most of their Hispanic employees lived, only to find it eerily empty. Some of the workers had been with the Browns for more than seven years.
 ''All of a sudden they were all gone,'' Mrs. Brown said. ''It was very scary.''
 Later, the Browns learned that agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been waiting for the workers in their driveway at dawn with state troopers, and had whisked them to the 450-bed detention center in Batavia, where there were 3,094 admissions this year. Like an estimated 650,000 immigrants in New York State and some 11 million nationally, the employees were in the United States illegally; the permits and Social Security cards they had shown to the Browns were fake. 
 What prompts such raids is rarely disclosed. But federal officials have said that they pursue tips from the public, adding to uneasy speculation about private vendettas or political retaliation. Such talk abounded in Sodus, for example, after an October raid at Marshall Farms, a large breeder of ferrets and dogs for pharmaceutical companies. The consensus, several residents said, was that a disgruntled American employee had called in the complaint. 
 More than 18 workers, many of them longtime employees with children in Sodus schools or day care, were summoned by name to the office from their jobs cleaning animal cages, and taken away -- the men to Batavia, the women to unspecified county jails. 
 ''A lot of the employees down there were very heartbroken to see the women walk out with shackles around their feet and handcuffs chained around their waists, crying,'' said Cliff DeMay, a large private labor contractor who supplies agricultural businesses in seven states with workers, and accepts their papers at face value -- part of a system that has allowed deniability to everyone but the illegal worker. 
 ''The I.C.E., they've always picked up people on complaints,'' he added. ''It's not the Border Patrol or I.C.E.'s fault. It's the fault of our damn politicians.''
 But Mr. DeMay also echoed a widespread view that those who criticized the raids were asking for trouble. 
 Others, including the Farm Bureau, pointed to the unusual intensification of the dairy investigation after Mr. Brown was quoted in a Sept. 11 Associated Press account. Michael W. Gilhooly, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, responded that raids were ''carefully planned'' and ''result from investigative leads and intelligence.'' 
 Mrs. Brown, 46, said she was summoned to thefederal building in Rochester and questioned for an hour and a half by immigration agents who threatened to subpoena her phone records. Federal prosecutors then brought felony charges against the workers for using fake Social Security numbers to get their milking jobs.
 But rather than turn against their former employers in exchange for leniency, as prosecutors wanted, the Mexican men pleaded guilty to felonies and accepted deportation, said Michael Bersani and Anne Doebler, lawyers who represented them in immigration court. Government lawyers would not discuss the case.
 Neighboring farmers, who helped the Browns milk, seemed shaken. ''A lot of them say, 'We should write letters to the editor, but we don't want to draw attention to ourselves,' '' Mrs. Brown said. ''Everyone is very panicky.''
 Some have a different perspective. Ray Woodhams, 58, a Sodus resident who works at a Rochester hospital that was sued by Hispanic employees who were barred from speaking Spanish, said he was glad to read of the arrests. 
 ''The farmers have got their view, but they're shortsighted -- they're not looking at the country as a whole,'' said Mr. Woodhams, who notes that he is a registered Democrat and the son of a Dutch immigrant farmer. ''The farmers say they can't get labor. Well, if they paid a decent wage, maybe they could.'' The Browns, echoing many farmers, counter that they have found no one steady to fill the vacant jobs. 
 Many labor advocates, after years of fighting farmers for wage and hour protections, find themselves in an uneasy alliance with their old foes. 
 ''Suddenly everybody's interest is the same: Save the lives of the migrants,'' said John Ghertner, who is on the board of Rural and Migrant Ministry, an interfaith advocacy group. ''From the farmers' perspective, so they have labor. From our point of view, human rights.''
 The smaller the farm and the more settled the work force, the more wrenching the arrests. Or so it seemed as friends gathered around the wife of a vineyard worker arrested in Yates County four days earlier, on his way to prune vines he had tended for a decade. His three children, 14, 11 and 2, are all American-born.
 His wife, weeping, described how the agents who had taken him and two others into custody on the road circled back to the house to try to take her, too. As the agents banged at the door and tried to open it, she hid in the bedroom with the 2-year-old, she said, and put her hand over his mouth when he started to cry. 
 Victor Feria Reyes, the state-licensed labor contractor who had dispatched the father and the others to the vineyard, said that throughout the Finger Lakes, his crews were down by half. ''A lot of people hate us,'' he said as his daughter Elenita, 8, leaned close. ''They just say, 'Take them away.' '' 
 The owner of the vineyard, who had lost three of his five workers to immigration arrests, called them ''part of my family,'' but begged not to be named. ''I'm afraid of retaliation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Owners Just Can't Help Themselves

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
On opening day of the 2002 season, Gary Matthews Jr. batted for Al Leiter, the Mets' starting pitcher against Pittsburgh, in the sixth inning, flying out to Armando Rios in left field. The next day, the Mets traded Matthews, an outfielder, to Baltimore for a young pitcher, John Bale.
 It was the only time Matthews batted for the Mets, and it was his first at-bat in a season in which he had a salary $37,500 above the $200,000 minimum. In April, when Matthews has his opening at-bat for the Angels of Anaheim, it will be the first under his $50 million contract.
Matthews, at 32, is too old to be called a child, but he is a poster child for the latest economic excesses of the owners. Gil Meche is on the poster with Matthews, and there's enough room on it to include a bunch of others as well. 
 The owners are out of control and, as usual, they have no one to blame but themselves. Marvin Miller used to say the owners wanted the union to protect them from themselves, and he was right. Without engaging in illegal collusive acts, they are incapable of protecting themselves from themselves.
 Just last week, the players' union computed the 2006 average player salary at a record $2.7 million. The contracts flooding the market this winter indicate that a year from now baseball will be flirting with a $3 million average.
 Like workers in other industries, professional athletes should be able to earn as much as they can, with no artificial restraints, like payrolls caps, limiting their pay. Rock singers and rappers can do it. So can actors and television anchors. Why not athletes?
 But in their desperation to add a lusty hitter or an effective pitcher, the owners lose all perspective and spend exorbitantly and foolishly. They fit the story, apocryphal or not, that is told about Lamar Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs' owner, who died recently.
 His father, H. L. Hunt, supposedly once said of his son's involvement with professional football, ''I gave him an unlimited budget, and he has already exceeded it.''
 Baseball owners continually exceed the limits of common sense. Tom Hicks of the Texas Rangers has led his colleagues in that curious practice in recent years -- see his $252 million signing of Alex Rodriguez as Exhibit A and his $65 million signing of Chan Ho Park as Exhibit B. But this off-season he has left the questionable signings to others. He can still join them by signing Barry Zito to an outrageous contract, but that irrational act remains to be performed.
 Playing for the Rangers last season, Matthews had the best season of his seven-year career. His timing could not have been better. He batted .313, the first time he hit .300, and he produced career highs in home runs (19) and runs batted in (79). His 146 games, 620 at-bats and 690 plate appearances were also career bests.
 The Angels saw those numbers, saw that they were good and plunked down 50 million big ones for five years. Presto, they had a center fielder, though one who has never demonstrated the ability to produce big numbers consistently.
 Maybe Matthews is a late bloomer and will continue to improve, but maybe he is the .249 career hitter averaging 13 home runs and 52 R.B.I. that he was before last season, the player who in the space of four years was traded three times, claimed on waivers three times and released once. Six teams besides the Mets gave up on him.
 The Angels hope they were all shortsighted.
 What can the Kansas City Royals expect from Meche? His signing was far more curious because the Royals don't do that sort of thing. They have been accused of pocketing the money they get from revenue-sharing.
 But a team that has lost 100 games three years in a row and four of the last five has to start somewhere if it hopes to improve. Whether Meche is the place to start -- at $55 million -- is debatable. 
 Meche has a winning career record (55-44), but in six major league seasons he has had an earned run average under 4.48 only once, he has never pitched 200 innings in a season and he has made as many as 32 starts only twice. 
 The best thing that can be said for some of the pitchers who have signed for significant money is they have winning career records. Often in the past, clubs have scooped up pitchers with losing records, paying them as if they were Cy Young award winners.
 Did Ted Lilly (59-58) ever think he would be a $10-million-a-year pitcher (Chicago Cubs, four years, $40 million)? Did Vicente Padilla (66-61) grow up in Nicaragua thinking he would one day earn $11.25 million a year pitching for the Rangers (three years, $33.75 million)?
 And how in the world could Daisuke Matsuzaka have ever figured the Red Sox would spend $103 million to see if he could pitch in the majors? The Red Sox can only hope he doesn't turn out to be Hideki Irabu. 

Is It the Pitcher or the Coach?
 Jason Marquis, who has a winning career record (56-52) but had losing records the last two seasons with St. Louis, gained a three-year, $21 million contract from the Cubs. 
 The Cubs signed him hoping that their pitching coach, Larry Rothschild, could help Marquis, who grew up on Staten Island, rediscover the ability that made him a 15-game winner in 2004, his first season with the Cardinals.
 Taking nothing away from Rothschild, who is an excellent pitching coach, Marquis spent the last two seasons with Dave Duncan, who has fixed many pitchers over the years, including Jeff Suppan, who had a 62-75 record before he got to the Cardinals, then went 44-26 in three years and was largely responsible for the Mets' premature exit from the past postseason.

Some Scary Impersonations
 A 38-year-old Chicago man was arrested last week, charged with identity theft. Besides being accused of stealing the identities of 27 Chicago-area residents, he was suspected of stealing the identities of nearly 90 baseball players. But the man, David Dright, could argue that there were people in uniform last season who also had stolen the identity of major leaguers.
 Impersonating a pitcher, for example, was Josh Towers, who in 12 starts and 3 relief appearances with Toronto had a 2-10 record and an 8.42 earned run average. Bruce Chen of Baltimore was 0-7 with a 6.93 E.R.A., and Angel Guzman of the Cubs was 0-6 and 7.39.
 Pitchers weren't the only impersonators. Mark Bellhorn looked like a player in his San Diego uniform, but when he started swinging his bat, the clear picture faded quickly. He batted .190 in 253 at-bats, the lowest average for anyone with at least 250 at-bats. 
 Jason Lane and Eric Munson of Houston pulled off a neat trick in their masquerade as major league hitters. They combined to hit .400: Lane hitting .201 in 288 at-bats and Munson .199 in 141 at-bats. 
 Among other identity-theft culprits, Nick Green batted .184 in 114 at-bats for the Yankees; Doug Mirabelli, .191 in 183 at-bats for the Padres and the Red Sox; Jason LaRue, .194 in 191 at-bats for the Reds; Tony Clark, .197 in 132 at-bats for the Diamondbacks; and Damian Jackson, .198 in 116 at-bats for the Nationals. 

Two Votes for the Hall
 Pete Rose thinks Mark McGwire belongs in the Hall of Fame. But then, Pete Rose thinks Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame. 
 ''I know I've made mistakes, but a lot of people feel I've paid for those mistakes,'' Rose told reporters last week. ''It's been 17 years already.''
 Rose was mistaken. It has been 17 years since he was banished from baseball, but it has been only three years since he stopped lying and admitted that he had bet on baseball games. And when he finally, and belatedly, told the truth, it was to enhance sales of a new book.
 If Rose had spoken the truth from the start, he might well have been reinstated years ago and been elected to the Hall of Fame. Now neither is likely to occur. Even if a future commissioner were to reinstate Rose, the players who populate the Hall, and would have to vote him in, and the veterans committee would overwhelmingly reject him.

BYLINE: By JEFFRY A. FRIEDEN. 
Jeffry A. Frieden is a professor of government at Harvard University and the author of ''Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century.''

 BODY:
MAKING GLOBALIZATION WORK
 By Joseph E. Stiglitz.
 358 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95.
Fifteen years ago, the world seemed headed irresistibly toward economic integration. Developed, developing, formerly Communist and even still-Communist nations (like China and Vietnam) had embraced markets and plunged into the global economy.
 Joseph E. Stiglitz, a former Yale, Princeton and Stanford professor, spent most of the 1990s atop the commanding heights of this globalizing economy, first as the chairman of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and then as chief economist at the World Bank. After returning to academia with a position at Columbia, Stiglitz became one of three recipients of the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize for his research on the economics of information.
 Now, as enthusiasm about economic integration has waned, Stiglitz has emerged as one of globalization's most prominent critics. Even while he was at the World Bank, he clashed repeatedly with his counterparts at the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury over what he called their ''market fundamentalism.'' His ''Globalization and Its Discontents'' (2002) included sharp criticisms of international economic institutions, in particular the I.M.F. for its handling of the East Asian financial and currency crises of 1997-98. 
 The book, which sold widely, was hailed by globalization skeptics and hotly debated by economists, some of whom found Stiglitz's criticisms exaggerated, unfair and unduly personal. Still, the novelty of an eminent economist and former high-ranking public official making a passionate assault on the international economic order put Stiglitz at the center of the globalization debate.
 His new book extends the discussion of ''Globalization and Its Discontents'' but largely avoids the polemical tone. One can, in fact, judge these two books by their covers. The earlier work showed a flame streaking across a stark black background. The soft white jacket of ''Making Globalization Work'' features three earth-eggs resting in a vulnerable nest. Stiglitz appears to have gone from flamethrower to mother hen. Even the title suggests a transition from flashy dissent to constructive engagement. And indeed, this book is a concise and enlightening treatment of international economic problems, along with much less convincing proposals for reform.
 Stiglitz walks the reader through a series of issues, from trade and intellectual property rights to global warming and the role of the multinational corporation. Each of the book's chapters frames a problem, provides some analysis and proposes solutions. On page after page, Stiglitz argues that globalization holds out great promise as a force for good, but that the rules of the present international economic order are designed and enforced by the rich nations to serve their interests. As a result, they are inequitable and inefficient. 
 Developed countries manipulate international trade rules to protect their factories and farmers from more efficient producers in the developing world, Stiglitz tells us. Multinational corporations evade responsibility for the damage they do. Meanwhile, the international financial system, led by the I.M.F., rewards improvident lenders (the wealthy) and penalizes hapless debtors (the poor).
 Stiglitz often invokes the concept of negative externalities: the costs that some individuals, firms or nations impose on others. A factory that skimps on pollution control, for instance, may increase its profits, but it harms the rest of society. The polluter is responding to incentives without having to pay the cost of its activities. Similarly, interest groups in developed nations benefit from favorable treatment by their governments, but these favors victimize people in developing nations who are trying to compete. It is bad enough, Stiglitz says, that thousands of wealthy American cotton farmers get billions of dollars in government subsidies; it is even worse that this depresses the world price of cotton, further impoverishing millions of African cotton farmers.
 When the pursuit of private gain causes social losses, government should force the perpetrators either to stop or to help repair the damage, Stiglitz argues. This is the rationale for pollution control, fisheries management, public health restrictions and other familiar regulatory measures. ''Making Globalization Work'' calls repeatedly for action to avoid or redress the impact of externalities -- in trade, corporate activity, the environment and financial and monetary affairs. 
 Stiglitz uses his command of economic logic to good effect, offering clear discussions of dozens of complex issues, from patent law to abuses in international trade. Many critics complain that drug companies overcharge poor countries, but Stiglitz goes further and makes a convincing case that this is not only immoral but also economically inefficient. Poor countries should be charged less than rich countries: if people willing to pay for medicines are unable to buy them, an existing demand goes unmet, which, in economic terms, is wasteful. Drug companies' pursuit of private gain results in an inefficient allocation of resources and a social loss. Stiglitz won the Nobel for exploring how uncertainty and poor information can make markets fail. Here he takes evident pleasure in showing how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.
 Many of Stiglitz's criticisms are uncontroversial. He is hardly alone in believing that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. But he can be one-sided, as in his unstinting praise for East Asian development policies that often repressed labor and restricted democracy, and in his tendency to absolve developing-country governments of almost all blame for their problems. He is even weaker in his policy proposals. 
 Stiglitz argues throughout that powerful special interests have distorted the world economic order and the international institutions that run it. His preferred solutions are large-scale reforms in existing international institutions and the creation of new institutions like a global reserve system -- to make trade fairer, to allocate reserves more equitably, to discourage despotism and corruption. But why would the national governments that, after all, still run the world want to do any of these things? And why should we expect new institutions to be any less biased, any less subject to special-interest pressures, than existing ones?
 It is hard to disagree with Stiglitz's intentions. Yet he seems to assume that bumping policies up to the international level will make world economic institutions less captive to the special interests he abhors -- though democratic control of policy is more likely at a national than an international level, since most national politicians must face elections. Even if focusing on national policies (for example, what the United States should do in the I.M.F.) is difficult, it may be a more promising avenue for reform than Stiglitz's new and improved international organizations.
 ''Making Globalization Work'' is an optimistic book, offering the hope that global society has the will or the ability to address global problems and that international economic integration will ultimately prove a force for good. Certainly Stiglitz is right that the world would benefit from aconcerted effort to address problems of the environment, poverty and disease. However, his proposals are almost utopian in their reliance upon good will, enlightened public opinion and moral imperatives to overcome selfish but deeply entrenched private or national interests that do not share his goal of making globalization work for as many countries and as many people as possible. 
 Stiglitz has given us a well-written and informative primer on the major global economic problems. He helps his readers understand exactly what is at stake. Nonetheless, for all its good intentions, ''Making Globalization Work'' is probably not a workable blueprint for the future.

HEADLINE: Niche Manufacturing Comes to a Car's 4 Corners

BYLINE: By STUART F. BROWN

 BODY:
DRIVERS wrestling with choosing winter tires from among the bewildering array now available can point a finger at the rapidly changing economics of the tire-making business. An industry that once depended on huge runs of identical products to make a profit has been overhauled by automated manufacturing systems that make it possible to develop and deliver new models and sizes very quickly. 
 The new systems of flexible automation can also make small production runs profitable, promising increasingly specialized products that cater to drivers' needs. At its manufacturing and research complex in Rome, Ga., for example, the Italian tire maker Pirelli relies exclusively on production from its modular integrated robotized system, or MIRS. 
Pirelli's automation strategy -- making smaller batches of a large number of products -- is in keeping with a trend toward mixed production runs seen in industries from automobiles to consumer electronics. The business logic is appealing to Pirelli because the system eliminates the need to keep a lot of expensive raw materials and finished tires on hand. 
 The ability to make small production runs economical -- as few as four tires at a time, according to Pirelli -- makes it possible to build some wild variations. How about a set of gigantic tires for your Hummer? 
 ''We make tires for ultra-big bling-bling wheels in small numbers, but they are quite profitable,'' said Gaetano Mannino, president of Pirelli Tire North America. ''It has become like a fashion business. Whoever has the advantage of being first with a hot design can lead the market for a while.'' 
 A traditional tire factory may sprawl up to a half-mile in length and can be set up to produce popular models in batches of 1,000 or more. When it is time to change to a different model, it can take workers eight hours or more to switch molds and set up the machinery for the next run. 
 A MIRS production unit is quite different, consisting of a dozen robots feeding a group of rubber-extruding and ply-laying machines. The system fabricates the tires around metal drums that the robot's arms grip powerfully. These arms have sophisticated wrists that let the robots hand off the tire-in-progress to the extruding machinery at all sorts of angles as strips of rubber and reinforcing material are built up to form the tire's structure. One MIRS system can simultaneously build 12 different tire models. 
 A bar code on each drum tells the equipment which model of tire it is about to make, and the control software supplies the appropriate recipe for the machinery. At the end of the process, robots load the unfinished tires into molds that will emboss the tread pattern and sidewall lettering in a 25-minute steam-curing process. 
 All of this mechanical cleverness benefits not just Pirelli, but also the customer. With their precise, repeatable movements, robots can build tires with everything in the right place, time after time. There are no overlapping rubber strips where there shouldn't be, and no joints. Tires made using human labor cannot hope to match the level of consistency of MIRS, which ensures that every tire will be well balanced and quiet running. 
 Tire-making equipment as compact as MIRS gives people novel ideas. Pirelli engineers originally considered trucking the robotic system to racetracks to quickly make and test racing tires. 
 But sometimes the phone rings. ''About two years ago a general called me from the Pentagon and he wanted to know if they could take a MIRS module over to Iraq,'' Mr. Mannino said. ''But it's too dusty there. Our MIRS plants have to be very clean. They can't be out in the desert.''

HEADLINE: Empty for 75 Years, and Now a Symbol of Rebirth 

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
THE huge neo-Classical Masonic temple in the heart of the downtown here devolved into an eyesore after 1928, when the Masons abandoned the still-unfinished building. Decades of neglect left the limestone colonnade crumbling, the brick facade scrawled with graffiti and even the original copper roof picked apart by thieves.
 And that was just the outside.
''I couldn't get out of here fast enough,'' recalled William W. Perrett, an expert on historical rehabilitation who first examined the building about 25 years ago. He took a second look several years ago. ''You couldn't move inside for the spray cans,'' he said. 
 Today, however, the building has become a symbol of the rebirth of Providence, not to mention one of the largest restoration projects in Rhode Island's history. In April, it is scheduled to open as a Marriott Renaissance hotel, with 272 luxury rooms, a ballroom, a lower-level restaurant and lounge, meeting rooms and a fitness center. Weekday corporate rates will start at $259 a night.
 Sage Hospitality Resources of Denver and its investment partner, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, have spent about $87 million to transform the temple over the last five years. The developers are receiving a federal tax credit equivalent to 20 percent of the main costs of the rehabilitation and a state tax credit worth an additional 30 percent, along with some city assistance.
 ''This building could never have been done without historic tax credits,'' said Mr. Perrett, now Sage Hospitality's project manager for the new hotel. But, he added, ''federal tax credits weren't sufficient to do this deal; they needed state tax credits.''
 Mr. Perrett, a native of Michigan whose family owned hotels there, has completed five rehabilitations of historic buildings into hotels, including the conversion of a Romanesque-style bank building in San Diego into a Courtyard by Marriott and the conversion of the Fulton Building in Pittsburgh into one of the most popular hotels in the Renaissance line.
 The resurrection of the Providence building has mirrored the gradual transformation of the city, whose economy had changed after the exodus of manufacturers after World War I. 
 The building's conversion, though, has been a complicated one. 
 ''The weird thing is, the building really never had a history,'' said Edward F. Sanderson, a historian and executive director of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission.
 Construction began in 1926. But about two years later, ''the Masons ran out of money, and they told the workers to quit work for the day, and somehow word got around that they shouldn't come back,'' Mr. Sanderson explained. ''When I first came to work in the 1970s, you could go in there, and you could see the hand tools that were still sitting where they had been put down in 1928,'' he said. ''It was pretty amazing.'' 
 The building's unfinished eight-story interior remained a large hull with rusted steel-platform staircases gripping its graffiti-covered walls. 
 ''The copper roof had been stolen in the 1970s -- an entire copper roof -- and the inside was rotted,'' Mr. Perrett said. 
 The temple had been part of a complex that included a narrow structure linking it to a large theater building. The state bought the entire complex in 1945 and finished the theater building, converting it into the popular Veterans Memorial Auditorium, according to Mr. Sanderson. The auditorium is used primarily as a symphony space. 
 Despite the temple's optimistic cornerstone, which is carved with a ''1949'' date, the state did nothing with the building.
 There it sat on a slope just below the Statehouse, Mr. Sanderson noted, ''too big and too expensive to fix, and too big and too expensive to tear down, deteriorating outside the governor's window.'' 
 ''The idea that a building would stand empty and unused for 75 years in the center of a city is pretty extraordinary,'' he said.
 The restoration project was extensive -- and unusual. A $2 million metal brace was built to hold up three walls of the temple while developers tore down and rebuilt the interiors. A fourth wall was destroyed many years ago, along with the building linking it to the theater.
 To take advantage of a ballroom originally built by the Masons below what is now the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, developers excavated two stories below the temple to create an underground passage between the two structures. The narrow linking building was rebuilt, and the ballroom was reconstructed to make it soundproof, ensuring that the strains of a Beethoven fugue would never meld with the driving rhythms of ''Hava Nagila'' at a wedding in the hotel ballroom, and vice versa, Mr. Perrett said.
 For Renaissance, a brand under the Marriott International umbrella, the project offered the perfect opportunity to extend the brand, which appeals to business travelers who like to explore the cities they visit, said Rita Cuddihy, the senior vice president of Renaissance. The brand has about nine hotels in rehabilitated historic buildings throughout the country, with three more, including the Renaissance Providence, about to open.
 ''A historic redo is the perfect way to give local authenticity,'' Ms. Cuddihy said. 
 Conversions of historic buildings -- whether banks or department stores or Masonic temples -- have become increasingly commonplace, according to John M. Tess, the president of the Heritage Consulting Group, which has worked on several hotel conversions over the last 25 years. Besides offering tax credits, the projects are also appealing because they enable developers to redevelop historic buildings exceeding the size allowed by existing zoning regulations, he said.
 Mr. Tess says he has seen an increase in hotel projects involving historic buildings over the last decade as more people have moved into the downtown areas of American cities. 
 ''A lot of hotel chains will consider historic rehabilitations,'' Mr. Tess said. ''With respect to historic hotels, they can act as almost a flagship. Every town has a hotel or historic building that everyone in town knows about.''
 The city of Providence, meanwhile, is also considering converting a portion of another historic structure into a hotel: the South Street Station complex, a former electrical power generating plant on the Providence River.
 Mr. Tess said that these types of projects, made feasible by state and federal tax credits, are limited only by the supply of buildings.
 ''Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, you could go in and buy these buildings at reasonable cost,'' he said.
 ''That's no longer true today, which is why it's important to have in place government incentives that allow historic buildings to be saved and play an important part in the activities of cities.''

Next fall I'd like to use my Delta frequent-flier miles to fly from New York to Sydney, Australia. However, Delta doesn't seem to fly direct there, nor do other Skyteam members. -- Albert B. Lowenfels, Valhalla, N.Y.
 
 While it is true that none of the 10 Skyteam alliance partners (Aeroflot, AeroMexico, Air France, Alitalia, Continental Airlines, CSA Czech Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Korean Air and Northwest Airlines) flies direct to Sydney, according to the flight schedules at www.skyteam.com, good options include Korean Air via Seoul; Delta and Korean Air via Seoul; and Delta and Korean Air via Atlanta and Seoul. As you know, you can earn and redeem frequent-flier miles on any Skyteam carrier.
 But a quick search at www.orbitz.com shows better routings, from around $1,500 for an economy round trip with United (via Los Angeles); or American and Qantas (also via Los Angeles). United is a member of Star Alliance; American and Qantas are members of Oneworld. You may want to consider joining one of these frequent-flier programs, earning miles that you can redeem on either program's partners, saving your SkyMiles for another time.
 Several readers face the dilemma of choosing between a chance to earn miles, redeem them for a flight, or upgrade, or find a cheaper fare or a more convenient routing.
 Paris E. Smith in Alkmaar, Holland, writes that he wants to fly KLM from Amsterdam to Cape Town but doesn't have enough miles to upgrade from economy to business class. He asks, ''Can I take the rest of the miles I need from my Continental Airlines' OnePass account to make up the difference, as both are members of Skyteam? If not, is it possible to fly one leg in cattle class and then upgrade the return (long night flight) to business?''
 Although Air France/KLM and Continental belong to the Skyteam alliance, one cannot combine miles from the two mileage accounts to claim an award. This applies to all frequent-flier program partnerships. But Flying Blue, the frequent-flier program of Air France/KLM, is one of the few programs that permits ''mixed'' class awards. So you can fly one leg in economy and one in business class for the average between the economy and the business-class value of an award ticket. You can use miles to upgrade on one flight only, as upgrades are based on one-way trips. ROGER COLLIS

HEADLINE: Mr. Bloomberg's Future Vision

 BODY:
New Yorkers are reminded often these days that their city will add another million or so people in the next 25 years, bringing the total to more than 9 million. That prospect may seem too distant to inspire any sense of urgency. But consider how difficult it is to find affordable housing, good schools, uncrowded subway cars and reasonably passable streets. Then imagine having to compete for these same services in a city that will have added a population equivalent to the city of San Francisco. 
 Faced with similar pressures, cities like London and Shanghai are charting paths to smart growth. New York also needs a plan and needs it fast. Fortunately, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is a man in a hurry. When he unveiled his 10-point plan for New York in 2030 earlier this month, he noted that he has little more than 1,000 days to put the city on the right course.
The bones of his plan are solid. He would add new capacity for drinking water, transportation, energy and housing. He sounded many strong green notes, including a commitment to cleaner energy, making good use of brownfields and reducing air pollution by 30 percent. Waterways would be cleaned and transformed into recreational destinations. More playgrounds would be built, especially in underserved neighborhoods. Every New Yorker, he said, had a right to live within 10 minutes of a park.
 The vision was as expansive as it was uplifting. And the mayor, who seems to relish his growing fluency in speechmaking -- a handy talent as he takes more often to the national stage on a host of urban issues -- presented it seamlessly in multi media fashion, from slide show to panel discussion. Missing, though, were some fairly large details, including how to pay for it all. Mr. Bloomberg will need to persuade not just New Yorkers but Albany and Washington that the long-term savings will justify the investments. 
 The mayor invited New Yorkers to join in on the conversation, and rightly so. New Yorkers, an opinionated lot, undoubtedly have plenty to say about the city's antiquated infrastructure, from subway to sewage systems to streets and power plants. And he surely could not have missed the fact that at a panel discussion that day there was spontaneous and sustained applause at the mere mention of congestion pricing -- a system of charging a fee to drivers on the busiest streets, in the lower half of Manhattan. 
 Mr. Bloomberg was also right to thank his predecessors -- the visionaries of the past who planned for today. A century ago, smart people here and in Albany set about securing an upstate source for drinking water and building tunnels to deliver it. They built a sewage system that has mostly held, although it currently leaks about 2 billion gallons into local waterways every year. They designed a subway system that was critical to economic growth. 
 But all these plans were for a smaller city, and the time has come to imagine another future. Mr. Bloomberg, who can take much credit for engineering the city's phenomenal comeback from the attacks of September 2001, now sees that success can only be maintained by looking beyond today.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Joins With L.I. Leaders on Issues

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE 

 BODY:
COUNTING the days before taking over as governor, Eliot Spitzer met last week with several Long Island leaders to help set the region's priorities for his administration.
 ''I'm sitting here with friends,'' Governor-elect Spitzer said, mentioning some of them as ''Steve and Tom and Bill and Judy.'' 
 That would be the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy (at right above with Mr. Spitzer); the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi (at left); the Suffolk County Legislature's presiding officer, William J. Lindsay; and the Nassau County Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs.
 Also present were Matt and John: Matthew Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, the leading local business group, and John Durso, president of the Long Island Federation of Labor.
 After huddling for more than an hour in Mr. Levy's 12th-floor office, they announced their common goals: achieving business growth, creating more affordable housing, improving transportation, curbing state mandates and property taxes, preserving open space and developing centers like the Nassau Hub and the old Pilgrim state hospital campus in Suffolk.
 Despite their unanimity, the assembled officials gave no details on how they intended to solve those sticky problems.
 ''We've been talking about these same issues for years, till we're blue in the face,'' said Desmond Ryan, a lobbyist who did not attend. The biggest hurdle is local zoning control, he said. Perhaps anticipating skepticism, Mr. Spitzer said the challenge was ''how do we get these to a point where there is concrete that will be poured.''
 Mr. Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said: ''We need help in keeping Long Island affordable. Eliot gets it.'' Similarly, Mr. Suozzi from Nassau -- who had challenged Mr. Spitzer in a primary earlier this year -- said, ''It's clear Eliot understands the problems of Long Island.''
 Still, Long Island must compete for Mr. Spitzer's attention as upstate and New York City fight for their own needs.
 ''Long Island has been a neglected stepchild,'' said Arthur Kremer, a former Democratic assemblyman. Mr. Kremer takes heart that Mr. Spitzer's choice to oversee economic development in the new administration is Patrick Foye, president of United Way of Long Island, who attended the meeting.
 It doesn't hurt that Steve, Tom, Bill and Judy -- like Eliot -- are all Democrats, a remarkable reversal from the Island's history as a Republican stronghold. ''The dynamics for leadership are great,'' said Mr. Ryan, a Republican who nonetheless predicted that Mr. Spitzer ''is going to do great things.''

HEADLINE: Political Gifts for the Holidays

 BODY:
This is the traditional season of giving. Yet in the world of politics, the most lasting presents are not those that are opened Christmas morning but those that spring from decency, bipartisanship, respect and the good intentions that form the basis of civilized society. 
 Well, we can dream, can't we? 
 Though such virtues are rare in politics, we can at least hope that leaders on both sides of the aisle will think hard about what they can give to each other and Connecticut residents to make this state a better place to live. 
 In case they are stumped, here is a list:
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell: The newly elected governor can give the people a clear sense of priorities that reach higher than marching to the ordinary G.O.P. drumbeat of cutting budgets and lowering taxes. Those are important, but she was not elected so overwhelmingly to assume the office of chief bean counter. Ms. Rell is popular because people believe she is honest and principled, and she can afford to spend her political capital on a few loftier goals. One initiative that we like is her desire to make preschool available to the poorest children in the state. This has occurred on a limited scale, but deserves a bigger push. 
 James Amann, the speaker of the House, and Donald Williams, the Senate president pro tempore: The best gift these two Democratic leaders can give both Governor Rell, a Republican, and state residents is to resist the urge to treat the governor's office as inconsequential in the coming session. This might be difficult in a General Assembly that for the first time in decades has a veto-proof Democratic majority. Both men have their legislative priorities, and not all are shared by Governor Rell. Yet the best legislation comes about when there is genuine give and take. 
 The G.O.P.: A new, visionary leader of the state Republican Party would be a boon to just about everyone. The state party is the weakest it has been in nearly 30 years. Nobody is well served when one party -- in this case, the Democratic Party -- is so much stronger than the other. 
 It was widely reported earlier this month that Governor Rell had asked Representative Rob Simmons to be the new state G.O.P. chairman, asking him to help rebuild the party. He would be a great choice. Although Mr. Simmons lost his seat representing Connecticut's Second Congressional District by a little more than 80 votes last month, he knows how to run and win against popular Democrats. A strong G.O.P. chairman is a necessity. 
 The state's judges: They should give the people a commitment to running an open court system throughout the state. Scandals involving the judiciary this year have made it obvious that some judges believe that they alone should have the power to grant or deny public access to court sessions or even criminal information. 
 The acting chief justice, David Borden, has done a very good job of opening up the system. But he will be retiring in August. What is needed, on the part of other judges, is a serious change of heart. 
 The state: Connecticut, the wealthiest state in the union, has three of the poorest cities in the country: Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven. It's no accident. Connecticut has a 350-year history of expecting its cities and towns to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and solve most of their own problems. But the odds are stacked against the cities because they have so many poor people and so little taxable land. In several instances, the state has stepped in temporarily to help bolster local police. Yet cities' problems go beyond safe streets. If state policy and dollars forced suburbs to act in tandem with cities, and encouraged regional planning instead of the inane, ''go-it-alone'' mentality of each municipality, all communities would be better off. 
 The State Department of Education: If this agency could do one thing for Connecticut students, it should be to emphasize the need for schools to improve the reading ability of all children in the state. Scores on national tests show that performance for most state students is mediocre at best, for cities and suburbs alike. Only 39 percent of Connecticut fourth graders read up to national standards and nearly one-third of Connecticut students lag far behind in reading. Improving the state's educational track record in this one area would improve countless lives and, in years ahead, the state economy. 
 The General Assembly: The Department of Public Utility Control announced this month that there would be big increases in electricity rates for the third year in a row. Yet nobody seems to be doing anything to stop the rise in rates. Legislative leaders and the governor wring their hands, hold summit meetings, pray to the heavens, yet the increases continue. When it comes to shaping policy, however, lawmakers would give residents a great gift if they remembered Hippocrates: First, do no harm. Fashioning a solution to high electric rates in Connecticut could wind up hurting more than helping. The deregulation legislation passed nearly a decade ago to almost universal applause was supposed to help. It did not. At this point, caution is preferable to rushing into a ''solution'' that makes the situation worse.

HEADLINE: Changing of the Guard and Style For Politics of Central Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
In decades past, the politicians who came out of central Brooklyn, New York's largest black community, were shaped by the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s, with many coming of age politically during the Vietnam War era. 
 But this year's elections, as well as last year's, represented a changing of the guard that could signal a wider shift of black political consciousness in the city: the emergence of a class of politicians spawned in the professional world, with experience in private industry, nonprofit organizations and other fields.
One new state lawmaker was recently a lawyer for CBS. Another raised money for private schools. A third was a police captain; while another, who is headed to the City Council, worked for the transit system.
 They are largely politicians who have little to no association with Democratic Party clubhouse politicians in Brooklyn, which has been tainted by recent corruption scandals. And the sheer number of newly elected officials in central Brooklyn, perhaps the biggest changeover in years, is something of a milestone -- particularly in a political world in which incumbency, at least for state lawmakers, can last virtually a lifetime. 
 ''We are now seeing a very new group of political leaders in Brooklyn who are, quite frankly, crossover politicians who have successfully delivered a message that speaks to the interests of different constituencies,'' said Craig Steven Wilder, a professor of urban history at Dartmouth College.
 Mr. Wilder, author of the book ''A Covenant with Color: Race and Social Power in Brooklyn,'' said the new crop of elected officials was ''different from the group who came to power in the 1970s and 1980s, who came to politics through civil rights issues.''
 ''This group represents the post-civil rights generation. And they have to deal with a different agenda,'' he said. ''That includes meeting the needs of people who are gentrifying their areas, people who have been there a long time and people who have been marginalized.''
 Notable among the new breed is Hakeem Jeffries, 36, who left his job as a lawyer for CBS to go to Albany. He was elected this year to the Assembly seat held for 25 years by Roger L. Green, who was convicted in a petty larceny case. 
 Another new assemblyman is Karim Camara, 35, who served as the director of fund-raising for the Cush Campus Schools, a private elementary and middle school in Brooklyn. He is also executive pastor at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights. Last year he succeeded Clarence Norman Jr., the former Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman who was first elected in 1982 and resigned in a scandal.
 And on the City Council, there is Darlene Mealy, 42. She is a former executive assistant at New York City Transit who won a hotly contested primary last year, beating William F. Boyland Jr., the patriarch of one of Brooklyn's well-known political families. Also elected this year was Eric Adams, 46, who will go to the State Senate, succeeding Carl Andrews. Mr. Adams, a former police captain, was also a founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.
 The best known of the new group is Representative-elect Yvette D. Clarke, 42, a city councilwoman and a former director of business development at the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. 
 Ms. Clarke won a Democratic primary in September that received national attention when a white candidate, David Yassky, tried to capture the seat that for decades had been held by black lawmakers: Major R. Owens, and before him, Shirley Chisholm.
 For many people in central Brooklyn who closely watch local politics, the new officials are a refreshing change after a period in which some of the incumbents they succeeded were tainted by scandal.
 ''The election of so many new black officials in Brooklyn has made a lot of people, including me, feel hopeful,'' said the Rev. Clinton M. Miller, pastor of the Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
 ''I think many of these new leaders are viewed as representing the political prototype of what an elected official should be in this era: someone who is steeped in the community, but who also knows how to operate in corporate and business settings.'' 
 Mr. Jeffries, for example, was an assistant general counsel who specialized in litigation at CBS. ''We are all products of the community who have gone out and excelled in various endeavors,'' Mr. Jeffries said.
 ''But we have come back to work in the community, to use politics as a way to make a difference in the communities that we come from. That's what the civil rights movement was all about.''
 But some Brooklyn Democrats question whether they will be able to avoid the infighting that has created friction among many of their predecessors.
 In fact, a generation ago, central Brooklyn's black leadership was splintered into two factions. One was a group whose de facto leader was Albert Vann, an assemblyman who started his public career as a teacher. Mr. Vann, who is now a city councilman, was a community leader in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville struggle between the black community and the United Federation of Teachers over the local school board's power to hire teachers.
 Mr. Vann, who was a supporter of Mr. Owens, was also the political mentor of Mr. Green and several others.
 On the other side were politicians who were loyal to State Senator Vander L. Beatty. Mr. Beatty often worked in collaboration with Brooklyn's regular Democratic organization, which until recently was led by white politicians from southern Brooklyn.
 Indeed, a generation ago, candidates and officials in Brooklyn routinely complained that the infighting among central Brooklyn's black officials often hampered their ability to bring resources and funds into the area.
 The feuding among politicians in those days was heated. In one case, in a 1982 primary race for Congress between Mr. Beatty and Mr. Owens, Mr. Beatty's supporters hid in a crawl space above a bathroom at the Board of Elections office in Brooklyn. After the office closed for the day, Mr. Beatty's supporters went to where the voter files were kept and doctored registration cards of Mr. Owens's supporters, apparently in an effort to thwart an Owens victory.
 Although that was an extreme incident, there have been long-standing tensions and rivalries in the borough for years. The newer elected officials have hopes of avoiding such squabbling, with plans to meet often, perhaps at regularly scheduled breakfasts, to determine ways to allocate recourses to their districts.
 ''One of the things about that that I think is a good sign is that we all like each other and get along well,'' Ms. Mealy said. ''Some of them have not even taken office yet. But we have camaraderie already. And it will make things easier for us to work together and get things done.'' 
 But getting things done might take more than friendship and amity. They all have the disadvantage of being low in seniority in their respective houses of government. And they generally have fewer staff members and less influence than their predecessors, who enjoyed the benefits of incumbency and the clout and resources that came with it.
 Still, they insist that their lack of seniority will not limit their effectiveness.
 ''We have the wisdom and experience of our predecessors to build upon,'' Ms. Clarke said. ''And our job is to find ways of working together and making even more of a difference in this new era. And I'm sure that we will all find ways to make our mark.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the emergence in Brooklyn of a class of political leaders from the professional world who have few ties to the borough's Democratic clubhouse politicians misidentified the primary opponent defeated by Darlene Mealy in a contest for a City Council seat from Brooklyn in 2005. He is William F. Boyland Sr., the patriarch of one of Brooklyn's well-known political families -- not his son, William Jr. (The younger Mr. Boyland is a state assemblyman.)

HEADLINE: American Idol 

BYLINE: By GARY HART. 
Gary Hart, a former United States senator, is the author, most recently, of ''The Courage of Our Convictions: A Manifesto for Democrats.''

 BODY:
THE AUDACITY OF HOPE
 Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream.
 By Barack Obama.
 375 pp. Crown Publishers. $25.
In a more perfect world, a graduate program complete with a doctoral thesis might be required of all those seeking the presidency. In certain ways, ''The Audacity of Hope'' qualifies as Senator Barack Obama's thesis submission. While exhibiting his leadership attributes, life experiences and personal qualities, largely in anecdotal form, this book also displays reasonably wide and thoughtful, if occasionally predictable, responses to domestic controversies and underscores that in his brief time as the junior senator from Illinois, he has been exposed to conflicts in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union and elsewhere.
 The self-portrait is appealing. It presents a man of relative youth yet maturity, a wise observer of the human condition, a figure who possesses perseverance and writing skills that have flashes of grandeur. Obama also demonstrates a wry sense of humor. His life has given him many reasons to be wry. 
 The senator is a global man for the age of globalization, and his story is now familiar. A Kansas mother, a Kenyan father, an Indonesian stepfather, and years growing up in the disparate places of Hawaii and Indonesia marked him for distinction the moment he walked through the doors of the United States Senate, and provided him with a unique prism through which to view the glory and the folly of American politics.
 Obama disarmingly admits to ambition, ''chronic restlessness'' and envy of more successful younger politicians. Before rolling the dice on a risky Senate race, he had begun to harbor doubts about his choice of career, and suggests here that he went through at least some of ''the stages prescribed by the experts'': ''denial, anger ... despair.'' And, in a particularly Tolstoyan moment, he confesses to ''acceptance'' of ''my mortality.'' He listened to countless people's stories and came to a Roosevelt-like epiphany: ''Government should help.'' He laments the loss of a shared civic language and the widening gap between the myth of American life and its reality, and he devotes this book to the discovery of ''a new kind of politics'' and ''civic life,'' to ''the notion of a common good.'' He specifically refuses to offer ''a manifesto for action, complete with ... 10-point plans.''
 Confessing guilt at being ''insufficiently balanced'' in his political views -- ''I am a Democrat, after all'' -- Obama insists that ''government has an important role in opening up opportunity to all''; he also believes in ''the free market, competition and entrepreneurship.'' He suspects that some of his views -- his open-mindedness on social issues, for example, combined with economic traditionalism -- will cause him trouble. His relative newness on the political scene, he admits, will also cause him to be seen as a ''blank screen'' on which a variety of people will project their own views, but he then quickly acknowledges that he must ''avoid the pitfalls of fame.'' 
 Given his recent media exposure, Obama would be well advised to follow his own counsel in this regard. ''Precisely because I've watched the press cast me in a light that can be hard to live up to,'' he writes, ''I am mindful of how rapidly that process can work in reverse.'' The media age has been known, as he wisely recognizes, to devour what it doth create. 
 Despite being new to the scene (although he did serve three terms in the Illinois State Senate), Obama casts himself in the role of a political veteran, using phrases like ''the longer I served in Washington'' (less than two years) and ''the more time I spent on the Senate floor.'' But his particular upbringing gives him special insights into the transition of American politics in the 1960s and '70s from debates over economic principles to a focus on culture and morality, and into the divisiveness, polarization and incivility that accompanied this transition. He describes the Democratic Party as one that merely reacts to events, and he documents the strangulation of conviction by ''triangulation.'' His substitute? Trans-partisan consensus around a ''project of national renewal.''
 The success of a book like this may be judged by determining for whom it is written. Obama perceives his audience as intelligent, involved (though only slightly wonkish) citizens interested in knowing more about who he is and what and how he thinks. Much of his book is dedicated to the who and the how, though the chapters ''Our Constitution,'' ''Opportunity'' and ''The World Beyond Our Borders'' are meant to demonstrate the what -- intellectual depth, policy innovation and international exposure. As sprightly as his political observations are (e.g., the longer you are in the Senate, the more you come to resemble your wealthy contributors), the substantive discussions often seem didactic, revealing, especially in his discussion of the Constitution, the law professor he once was.
 Obama thinks Democrats have been ''wrong to run away from a debate about values,'' though exactly who has been guilty of running away is not made clear, and his correct definition of values -- ''the standards and principles that the majority of Americans deem important in their lives, and in the life of the country'' -- is hardly what the evangelical polemicists who have hijacked the traditional Republican Party have in mind. He is particularly evocative on the issue of ideological inconsistency, blaming liberals for demanding civil liberties but not deregulation and conservatives for wanting deregulation of markets but encouraging wiretapping. ''Values,'' Obama writes, ''are faithfully applied to the facts before us, while ideology overrides whatever facts call theory into question.''
 Prescriptively, he advocates public investments in education, science and technology, and energy as the key to expanded opportunity. This has been standard fare for so-called neoliberals since the late 1970s. But he also writes that ''what's missing is not money, but a national sense of urgency.'' He promotes cutting-edge ideas -- for instance, abolishing all tax breaks for the oil industry and requiring contributions from the big companies that would help finance alternative energy research -- and shows great interest in governmental experimentation instead of traditional bureaucratic programs. His inherent internationalism causes him to ponder why, five years after 9/11 and 15 years after the end of the cold war, the United States ''still lacks a coherent national security policy,'' rightly finding the Bush doctrine of pre-emption and defeat of evil in the world wanting.
 Truly great leaders possess a strategic sense, an inherent understanding of how the framework of their thinking and the tides of the times fit together and how their nation's powers should be applied to achieve its large purposes. ''The Audacity of Hope'' is missing that strategic sense. Perhaps the senator should address this in his next book. By doing so, he would most certainly propel himself into the country's small pantheon of leaders in a way that personal narrative and sudden fame cannot.
 In a very short time, Barack Obama has made himself into a figure of national interest, curiosity and some undefined hope. This book fully encourages those sentiments. His greatest test will be that of sensing the times, of matching his timing with the tides of the nation.
 He is at his best when he writes things like this: ''I find comfort in the fact that the longer I'm in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes, that a striving for power and rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition, and that I am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience.''

HEADLINE: What Surrounds the Iraqi Tinderbox

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
IF Iraq should descend into full-blown civil war, its neighbors could be drawn into a ''regional conflagration,'' as the new defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, put it to the Senate.
 Would that mean whole national armies squaring off against one another? Not likely soon, experts say. But after several more years of rising sectarian strife, centered in Iraq and spreading beyond its frontiers, a much wider war could ignite.
For now, the five largest nations bordering Iraq are keenly watching out for their interests: siding with Iraq's Sunni or Shiite Muslims, controlling their own domestic rumblings, and seeking to increase their influence in the region. 
 So they prepare for limited, ''asymmetric'' battle -- ''deploying certain military elements for very specific purposes,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''It wouldn't be country-on-country warfare.''
 Their intervention in the Iraq war, Mr. Cordesman said, would escalate like this: Neighboring countries send advisers, small weapons and money to their allies. Then come military trainers and perhaps volunteer forces. Heavy weaponry follows.
 Any of which may be occurring in Iraq now, according to experts.
 Larger-scale war requires fit armies, and analysts find most of the five lacking -- a possible brake on a broader conflict, at least in the short term.
 In judging military prowess, equipment inventories are the least significant indicator, according to Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations.
 ''Skills, tactics, training and doctrine are the most important factors, and harder to assess -- the software, if you like, as opposed to hardware,'' Mr. Biddle said.
 All face personnel challenges. How well could their forces perform when they have little or no training in battle?
 ''Syria's skills are not very good,'' he said. ''Jordan is the best of the lot, also the smallest. They have impressive equipment, and would probably use it more effectively than most other armies in the region. But even their training has its limits.''
 Nations could gear up for a bigger war with hired help from the fast-growing global industry of private military contractors. Croatia used such expertise to win its war of independence with Serbia.
 If Iraq fractures along ethnic lines, Turkey, with its restive Kurdish minority, is already primed to intervene. Throughout the 1990s, it did not hesitate to strike Kurdish rebel bases in northern Iraq. 
 ''They're worried that Kurdish nationalism will result in the dismembering of their country,'' said Steven A. Cook, also of the council. ''It's as if the Mexicans were reclaiming Texas or California.''
 Today the five have little incentive or ability to join wholeheartedly in a wider war. The most likely outcome, Mr. Biddle said, is a long, grinding stalemate among rivals in Iraq, supported by neighboring countries, that produces war weariness and an eventual settlement -- where ''the only way to defeat the enemy is to exhaust them.''
 But if allies on either side of the bitter Sunni-Shia conflict are defeated decisively, a worst-case conflict becomes a distinct possibility, Mr. Biddle said.
 The trigger would be a lopsided balance of power in Iraq. For example, if the Shiite majority, backed by Iran, established a repressive pro-Shiite government, it could send Sunni refugees streaming out of the country by the thousands or even millions.
 ''The refugees become a tremendous source of instability, with lots of sectarian tension spilling out all over the region,'' he said. ''Imagine after six to eight years -- the pressure on Sunni governments to act will become severe. It's very common for civil wars to spread to neighboring states. The whole landscape looks very different after several years of civil war.

 ''Saudi Arabia has virtually no power projection capability,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

ACTIVE: 354,500

TRYING TO CONTAIN THE IRAQ WAR, AND IRAN -- Like the Turks, the Saudis want Iraqi national unity and stability. They are fortifying their border with Iraq to stop possible swarms of refugees. They are locked in a fierce rivalry with Shiite Iran for regional dominance. Likely to use special forces, not heavy forces, in any escalation.

IRAN

Iranian active forces: 545,000. Limited training, combat experience. Most of those trained in Iran-Iraq war have left the service.

About 220,000 are 18-month conscripts ill prepared to fight.

350,000 reserves lack skills, equipment and leadership; reorganization and training are needed.

PUSHING FOR REGIONAL DOMINANCE -- Seeks to increase its influence via Iraq's Shiite majority. Aligned with Syria, whose ruling Alawites are accepted as Muslims by many Shiites. (Many Sunnis do not consider Alawites Muslims.) Sunni governments fear a ''Shiite crescent'' stretching from Lebanon and Syria through Iraq and Iran.

POPULATION: 68.0 million

SUNNI: 10%

U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ: 150,000
POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL U.S. 'SURGE' FORCE: UP TO 50,000

NAVAL BUILDUP -- Last week, the Pentagon announced that more U.S. and British warships would be sent to the Persian Gulf, as a sign of resolve against Iran and to protect oil shipping.

HEADLINE: Sizzling a Year Ago, but Now Pfffft 

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The telenovela, the steamy low-budget soap opera genre that has become the staple of television programming in Spanish-speaking countries, lives on its sudden bursts of uncontrollable -- and loudly acted -- passion.
 Maybe that was what was burning in the hearts of network executives in New York about this time last year when, seemingly out of the blue, many of them announced a rush to begin developing a new form of programming for the summer: the American telenovela.
''It's right to characterize what we were all caught up in last year as telenovela fever,'' said Katherine Pope, the executive vice president of NBC Entertainment.
 The ardor has apparently cooled. In the 12 months since news reports revealed that CBS was working on as many as seven scripts for telenovelas, that ABC had invested in as many as 45 existing telenovela storylines, and NBC was jumping in to adapt telenovelas already produced by Telemundo, the Spanish-language network that NBC owns, not much more has been said -- or done. Not a single telenovela project has been put into production by any of those networks. 
 The networks' intense interest in the telenovela genre was sparked by the need to find alternative, inexpensive programming in the summer to replace the round of repeats. Telenovelas are made cheaply in Spanish-speaking countries, for only a fraction of the $2 million to $3 million an episode that network dramas cost.
 Once into development, however, financial realities began to set in. The networks discovered they would only alienate their viewers if they tried to make the shows of distinctly lesser quality than their regular shows. They also discovered that the production schedules required to grind out so many episodes in such a short time would be daunting. Most telenovelas shoot as many as 40 pages of script in a day; the conventional network drama seldom does more than about 15 (each page equals about one minute of screen time). 
 ''The economics still have to be figured out,'' Ms. Pope conceded.
 ABC, has of course, added a new hit prime-time series called ''Ugly Betty,'' which is based on one of the most popular telenovelas ever produced. But nobody, certainly not its executive producer, Ben Silverman, considers the American ''Betty'' a true telenovela as the genre is commonly understood -- that is, a stylized short-run series with a definitive ending, about 13 weeks long, broadcast in several episodes a week.
 ''We originally conceived the show as a true telenovela,'' Mr. Silverman said, ''but it got shifted by ABC to a regular hourlong drama series.'' He added that the expensive look of the ''Betty'' series, which is set in the glamorous world of New York couture magazines, could never have been fashioned on the budget of a real telenovela. 
 ''We could never have shot in New York,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''We could never have gotten a star like America Ferrara,'' he added, referring to the actress in the title role.
 Though versions of ''Ugly Betty'' have played as straight telenovelas around the world, in countries as far flung as Germany, India and Israel, the ABC adaptation is a regular highly produced, episodic network series. 
 If you want to see what an American version of a telenovela looks like, you would have to have tuned in this fall to one of the stations on the mini-network called MyNetworkTV (MNT), a collection of television stations (including Channel 9 in New York), mainly owned by the News Corporation. The stations were orphaned last winter when their old network, UPN, combined with its competitor, the WB, to form the CW network.
 Not that many people have tuned in. MNT has so far tried four telenovelas, including one, ''Fashion House,'' starring the former sirens Bo Derek and Morgan Fairchild (complete with catfight between them), and another, the current ''Wicked Wicked Games,'' starring Tatum O'Neal. 
 Running two episodes at a time five nights a week, the network has thus far made little noise with any of its telenovelas. Ratings for MNT's telenovelas in the 18- to 49-year-old audience, the primary market for most broadcasters, have been negligible. They have been scoring about half a national rating point -- or less -- which translates to about 650,000 viewers in that group (compared with 8 million to 10 million viewers for a hit show in the same period). 
 ''Obviously we're not pleased with the ratings,'' said Paul Buccieri, senior vice president of Twentieth Television, the production studio that supplies programming to MNT. (The studio is mainly the syndication arm for the Fox Broadcasting Company.) But Mr. Buccieri emphasized that the ratings have not diminished that network's conviction that telenovelas would work with American audiences. 
 ''We're still definitely enthusiastic about the genre,'' he said.
 MNT's experience has contributed to the slackening of interest among the big networks. Program executives at one network confirmed that the low ratings for MNT's telenovelas put a chill on their own plans. Mr. Buccieri said that MyNetworkTV has learned many lessons in trying to make the form work, including adding cost-saving techniques like hand-held cameras. MNT has two more telenovelas in production to fill the gap when the current ones leave off. 
 Longer term, there are questions about whether the network can stay committed to giving up all its prime-time hours to the genre if the ratings do not improve. Reality shows and game shows would be considerably cheaper.
 Still, if MNT connects on even one telenovela, it may reinvigorate the passion for them among the major networks.
 Executives at ABC, CBS and NBC all said they still have some telenovela projects in development. Mr. Silverman, who continues to option rights to telenovelas made in Latin America, remains a firm believer. ''I think someone should give it a shot,'' he said.
 Ms. Pope said NBC would almost surely stay in the telenovela game, for several reasons, beginning with its association with Telemundo. NBC owns the rights to all the telenovelas that play on that network (and that is almost the only kind of programming Telemundo does). If NBC did commit to a telenovela, it would shoot it in Miami, where Telemundo is based, finding economies by using that network's studio and sets. 
 And then there is the interest of Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal Television. Ms. Pope said, ''I personally believe we will definitely make a telenovela. Jeff grew up in Miami, he's seen the form and he's very dedicated to it.''
 She added that many advertisers have also expressed interest in the genre and had indicated a willingness to sponsor a telenovela if a network decided to produce one.
 ''Ultimately, we are the best-positioned network to get one done quickly,'' Ms. Pope said.
 But not very quickly. ''I'm not sure when you'll see one,'' she said. ''It's really unlikely anyone will make one as soon as next summer.''

HEADLINE: New Los Angeles Dream Factories Design Buildings

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
To the extent that Los Angeles is a company town -- that company being movies and television -- it isn't easy to gain fame as an architect here, especially in the shadow of Frank Gehry, one of the profession's few West Coast celebrities.
 There are those who maintain that Angelenos don't care that much about architecture, except when it comes to designing their own houses. While the city is home to top-flight architectural talents like Mr. Gehry and Thom Mayne, some say it has been slow to champion unorthodox civic design as a source of local pride.
But it's becoming harder to make that argument these days, as developers, arts benefactors and academic institutions in Los Angeles begin to embrace the notion that cutting-edge design -- however costly -- can sow both economic and social dividends by spurring development and enlightening the public. 
 At the California Institute of Technology alone, Mr. Mayne of Morphosis is designing the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, a building that would draw light from above while affording vistas of the sky; Joshua Prince-Ramus is at work on the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology, a steel-braced frame supporting a concrete ring of offices; and Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners has designed Broad Center, a biology research building with etched stainless steel wall panels cladding laboratory spaces and a glazed ''light tower'' animating the center of the building.
 At the Art Center College of Design, a private institution in Pasadena, the local firm Daly, Genik redesigned the south campus, which opened in 2004. The U.C.L.A. Hammer Museum has been redesigned by the local architect Michael Maltzan as a more transparent, porous space with a courtyard that integrates the museum into the surrounding streetscape, along with a 300-seat theater that was completed this month and a restaurant, bookstore and public classrooms. 
 Some Los Angeles architects say that Mr. Gehry and Mr. Mayne helped raise the bar for them. ''Both of those people have changed the expectations of people pretty substantially,'' said Kevin Daly of Daly Genik, which is working on the second phase of a bold redesign of the south campus of the Art Center College. ''It's the obligation on our part to make sure that starts to happen for the next generation.''
 Meanwhile up-and-coming Los Angeles architects have distinguished themselves in the annual Young Architects Competition sponsored in New York by P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art. Hernan Diaz Alonso of Xefirotarch won in 2005 with a swirling, billowing composition of tentlike bio-organic forms inspired by the tango. Jason Payne and Heather Roberge of Gnuform were finalists this year with a proposal called ''Purple Haze,'' after the Jimi Hendrix song, that featured ''altered sensory states'' like loungers made of rubber tube rings with depressed centers that become wading pools. 
 Architects from distant points also seem to be doing more in Los Angeles. For example Renzo Piano, from Italy, has designed an addition to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art that includes a glass entrance pavilion, a park and a new gallery building named for the businessman and philanthropist Eli Broad. 
 The New York architects Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey and Robert A. M. Stern and the Mexican architect Enrique Norten have recently designed apartment buildings and hotels. Steven Holl of New York is working on a makeover of the Beaux-Arts-inspired Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. 
 Most prominent of all perhaps is Mr. Gehry's Grand Avenue redevelopment, a project by Related Companies near his acclaimed 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall that aims to create a vital downtown core in Los Angeles. ''The only way to do something transformational is to do something above and beyond what's already there,'' Stephen M. Ross, the chairman of Related, said in an interview. ''It's incumbent on developers to take things to that level.'' 
 There are now at least three significant buildings in close proximity to Grand Avenue: Disney Hall; the 2002 Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, designed by the Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo; and Mr. Mayne's path-breaking Caltrans District 7 Headquarters (2004) for the state transportation agency, whose facade morphs as its perforated aluminum screens open and close. Mr. Mayne, the winner of the 2005 Pritzker Prize, has also been asked to come up with architectural proposals to enhance the city's 2016 Olympics bid.
 ''There is a level of consciousness in Los Angeles that I think has spread in the 20 or 25 years I've been doing this,'' said Eric Owen Moss, the architect in Culver City, Calif., who is designing a large mixed-use project and a medical building on the Sunset Strip. ''There is a broader constituency of politicians, developers and clients who are interested in design and supportive of architecture on a large scale.''
 The urgent focus on downtown is partly related to shrinking space for housing development in outlying areas and an increase in traffic congestion, which has made driving to and from work more onerous than ever. 
 ''Los Angeles is moving from a suburban culture to an urban culture,'' said Richard Koshalek, president of the Art Center College of Design. ''It's a seismic shift. The frontier now for L.A. is closed. It can't expand any further. People are frustrated with the commutes.''
 As a result developers are focusing on high-rises, and public officials are trying to improve mass transit. ''There is a conversation in Los Angeles -- it's very nascent -- about what urbanism is going to mean in coming years,'' Mr. Maltzan said. ''The city's changing. It's becoming significantly denser. The city has grown to its physical boundaries.''
 Mr. Ross said: ''You're dealing with a different generation. Young people don't want to spend as much time in their cars. They want to be close to their work.''
 Whether this growing attention to urban development will result in architecturally distinctive projects is another question. While universities have demonstrated a willingness to take chances with their architecture, many Los Angeles design professionals say, developers generally have not. 
 ''There is still a certain anxiety and a certain apprehension about architecture in this city,'' Mr. Koshalek said. ''It can't just be the educational institutions. It has to be the political leadership.''
 Much of the credit for New York City's new focus on architecture goes to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has made high-quality design a priority of his administration through the City Planning Department and the Department of Design and Construction. Yet even in New York, architects note, exciting designs can be compromised by neighborhood opposition, preservationist concerns or the kind of political infighting that has dogged the rebuilding effort at ground zero and the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn.
 Paul Lubowicki of Lubowicki/Lanier Architects in El Segundo, Calif., said he thought there was still an endemic indifference to architecture among politicians and the public in Los Angeles. ''I don't think the general public values architecture in this town,'' he said. ''I don't think architecture makes an impact at all. Everywhere else but here.''
 Even Mr. Gehry's Disney Hall, with its heady swooping curvilinear metal exterior, did not shake up the city's sensibilities, some say. 
 Last year's film ''Sketches of Frank Gehry,'' by the Hollywood director Sydney Pollack could be considered an exception to this indifference. 
 ''When the concert hall was going up, you would hear people talking about Frank and how negative they view anything different around here,'' Mr. Lubowicki said. ''It's different from Chicago, where you're walking around, and the buildings draw you in. Here you go in a car, you go in a parking lot, you go up in a building.''
 Because of the city's sprawl, it's not easy for a single building to become the galvanizing force it might be in a more concentrated landscape. ''The problem with L.A. is the impact of various projects is so diffuse, given the size of the city,'' said Mr. Stern, who is the dean of Yale's School of Architecture. ''There's not much next to anything else.''
 Mr. Meier's 1997 travertine-clad Getty Center complex, for example, with its signature curves and rectangles, is isolated on a hilltop. ''It's part of L.A., everyone goes there, but it doesn't seem to influence anything,'' Mr. Meier mused. 
 ''The commercial architecture is terrible'' in Los Angeles, said Mr. Meier, who also recently designed the new Broad Art Center at U.C.L.A., the city's Museum of Television and Radio (1996) and the local branch of Gagosian Gallery (1995). ''I don't know who the developers are who do these things. They don't come to us.''
 Central to traditional Los Angeles thinking is the primacy of one's own home and backyard. There is also a longstanding reverence for the city's mid-century Modernist residential architecture, like the Eames House and other landmarks built as part of the Case Study House Program, which ran from the mid-1940s through the early 1960s.
 Mr. Lubowicki said his practice lies mainly ''in the rich-people house category,'' but added: ''I'd love to do a library, stuff that makes people aware of what you can do with a building. There's so little of that around here.''
 Others counter that the so-called local disdain for architecture has been exaggerated, in part because it plays into Los Angeles architects' image of themselves as countercultural cowboys. ''L.A. architects present themselves as fugitives on the run,'' said Sylvia Lavin, a professor in the architecture and design department at U.C.L.A. ''The stories that the culture needs to tell itself here are quite different.'' 
 While the public may not be passionate about architecture, others point out, some crucial players are. Mr. Broad, for example, was the prime mover behind Grand Avenue, Disney Hall, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Caltrans, as well as the Los Angeles High School For the Visual and Performing Arts, designed by Coop Himmelblau, which is under construction. 
 ''Key individuals who are the kind of people who can change things -- we don't have enough of them,'' Mr. Daly said. 
 Mr. Koshalek said: ''We need great patrons who believe in ideas and are willing to commit to young architects so we will have something to advance in the future. There is so much that needs to be done here.''

Famed Surgeon's Care Stirs Debate on Treatment
When Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, then 97 and one of the most influential heart surgeons in history, suffered a dissecting aortic aneurysm, he became the oldest survivor of an operation he had devised to repair torn aortas. But his treatment also stirred debate over how far to go in treating someone so old, and making risky decisions that can save lives. A1

Pork Projects Cost Seats
A timeworn bit of political wisdom has been that larding one's district with pork projects can act as an incumbency protection program, and the Republican leaders in Congress ardently followed that principle. But the pursuit of earmarks -- special local projects that circumvent the normal budgeting process -- cost two senators and four House members their seats in the last election. A1

HEADLINE: Fighting City Hall, Specifically Its Boxy Design and Empty Plaza

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Boston City Hall, a hulking, gray concrete box of a building, is hard to miss. And lately so are people's opinions about it.
 Debate about City Hall was sparked anew last week, when Mayor Thomas M. Menino proposed selling the building and its large brick plaza and moving city government to an undeveloped waterfront parcel. Mr. Menino thinks that the sale would fetch about $300 million and that the new building would prompt growth in an undeveloped part of the city.
 ''It really doesn't work for municipal government,'' Mr. Menino said. ''The building is unfriendly, cold, and the way it's structured, it has a third floor only on one side and it doesn't have a fourth floor.'' 
 Descriptions like ''fortress'' and ''dungeon'' have long bounced off the concrete walls of City Hall, which has seen a recent influx of mice. The plaza is known mainly for its T stop, wind gusts that steal umbrellas and a fountain that was paved over because of leaks. 
 ''I'm convinced someone in power had an uncle who owned a concrete factory,'' said Councilman John Tobin, who with a colleague proposed selling the building in 2003, only to have a piece of the ceiling fall on their desks days later. ''The air quality is poor. The windows don't open, and some offices are like meat lockers and others you can get a tan in.''
 But Mr. Menino's announcement has also strengthened the will of City Hall's defenders; some see it as a seminal building in the city's history, and others do not want the seat of city government to move to a waterfront location that can be difficult to reach.
 ''It's extremely important, architecturally, and it's been recognized as one of the best modern movement buildings in the U.S.,'' said Pauline Chase-Harrell, an architectural consultant who was chairwoman of the Boston Landmarks Commission in the 1980s. ''It was intended to symbolize the rebirth of Boston,'' Ms. Chase-Harrell added, with the new concrete building growing out of Boston's red brick past.
 Thomas H. O'Connor, the university historian at Boston College and author of ''Building a New Boston: The Politics of Urban Renewal,'' said City Hall was a controversial building from the day its first rendering was unveiled in 1962 because it so contrasted with the city's colonial architecture. It was completed in 1968 to numerous jokes, including that it was the box that neighboring Faneuil Hall came in.
 ''I think members of the new architectural era thought it was marvelous, and I think by and large the general public was horrified by it,'' Dr. O'Connor said.
 It is not so much the building that must be preserved, Dr. O'Connor said, but its location, which intertwines city, state and federal government in the neighborhood where American democracy was fomented.
 ''The location now is central to what should be a very proud government center for Boston, and I don't think putting it somewhere else would do the trick,'' he said.
 The building has drawn professional praise as well as condemnation. In 1976 a poll of architects named it one of the 10 most important buildings in America, while the Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit organization of urban planners, voted the building and plaza into its ''hall of shame.''
 Some architects see the emptiness of the plaza, which was meant to hold restaurants and benches, as a municipal failing. Elizabeth S. Padjen, editor of Architecture Boston magazine, said in the May-June 2005 issue that the center looked like ''someone who has lost his self-respect,'' and the inability to fix it stemmed from something in Bostonians that ''favors self-flagellation.''
 Gerhard Kallman, who designed the building and its surroundings, also said in the magazine that he had expected the plaza to be developed with restaurants and other public spaces. In an interview, Mr. Kallman, 91, said the building was not meant to be trendy and disposable.
 ''A building like this is an iconic public building,'' he said, ''and it really becomes a memory of a city's history. It cannot be easily replaced for reasons of temporary convenience. I hope those who do recognize its importance to the architectural history of the past few decades would make their opinions known to the mayor.''
 The people in line at the parking clerk's window during lunch Thursday were more than happy to offer their thoughts on the building.
 ''It's prime real estate. Just nuke this and sell it,'' said Jerry DiPietro, 47, an asset manager from East Boston who was in line. ''It's such a waste of space.''
 But Karen O'Donnell, 53, an electrician from Waltham, Mass., said she enjoyed the occasional concert and sports rally on the plaza, and worried that the gathering space could not be replicated.
 Up a set of escalators, in a hallway decorated with works by local artists, Mary Pearson, 71, the head clerk in the city's assessing department, said she would be happy to see the building go.
 ''I hate this building,'' Ms. Pearson said. ''It looks like a dungeon. It's so blah, how else can you say it? That's how it feels.''
 Janet Pagano, 55, who works for the nearby school department and has business at City Hall nearly every day, said she wanted the building to stay where it was.
 ''I'd be disappointed, only because it's so accessible right here,'' Ms. Pagano said. ''Being a city employee, it's just easy to get here.''

HEADLINE: Voting for Higher Wages

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Raising the Floor on Pay'' (Business Day, Dec. 20): 
 Increasing the minimum wage is a very important part of a larger economic agenda that voters across the board want to see Congress enact. 
 Our pre-election poll found that registered voters were more than three times as likely to vote for candidates who favored increasing the minimum wage, increasing student aid, securing health care for all regardless of employment status, and guaranteeing paid sick days for all workers.
Women voters, who are particularly affected by these issues, showed even more support for candidates favoring these positions. So while the states make important strides on family economic issues, voters have sent a clear message that they want national action.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''In Chinese Boomtown, Middle Class Pushes Back'' (front page, Dec. 18): 
 On the whole, China's economic boom has not been producing a middle class.
But as ''Chinese Success Story Chokes on Its Own Growth'' (front page, Dec. 19) suggests, it has produced a wealthy class and a poor class, and relations between the two are often predatory. 
 China's gap between rich and poor now exceeds that of the United States. Communist Party leaders, safely on the wealthy side of the divide, make sure there are no real labor unions, independent courts or unmuzzled press. 
 Economic ''miracle'' results.

HEADLINE: Still Flying High

 BODY:
Globalization is tough to sell to average people. Economists can promote the very real benefits of a robustly growing world: when they sell more overseas, American businesses can employ more people. But what sticks in our minds is the television image of the father of three laid off when his factory moves offshore. 
 It is worth taking note, therefore, of a good-news trade story for an icon of American manufacturing. The Boeing 747 looked as if it was heading toward obsolescence in the difficult environment for air travel after Sept. 11, 2001. Fast-forward five years and the old bird is flying high. Boeing has received orders for 67 of the airplanes this year, the most for that model in a single year since 1990 and worth a total somewhere in the neighborhood of $16.75 billion. Of course, all of this benefits Boeing's shareholders, the American economy and the nearly 150,000 people Boeing employs in the United States.
Much of the credit for this good news goes directly to globalization and trade. As Leslie Wayne reported in The Times, expanding global trade is a main reason for the aircraft's renewed success, with many of the orders coming for air freighters rather than passenger planes. While sweat socks and cheap plastic toys take the slow boat, high-end goods like computer chips and expensive perishables like seafood go by air. Hence the demand for 747s, and Boeing's -- and America's -- good fortune.
 It is important to bear in mind just how much this country has benefited from free trade at a time when protectionist sentiment -- particularly of the China-bashing variety -- is growing. America's middle class is unquestionably suffering through an era of wage stagnation and job insecurity. That is an argument for a stronger safety net for workers cut loose in the upheaval of a changing economy, whether those changes are driven by technology or global competition.
 A large part of the problem is the disposition of the spoils of globalization. While liberalized trade has meant faster growth, lower inflation and huge profits, the benefits in this country have gone disproportionately to the wealthy. The United States needs a more progressive tax system and the government must find a way to help businesses and individuals with out-of-control health care costs.
 According to the World Bank's recent report, Global Economic Prospects, trade in goods and services will very likely more than triple by 2030. Over the same period, the global economy is expected to expand from $35 trillion in 2005 to $72 trillion -- ushering hundreds of millions around the world out of poverty and into the global middle class in the process. That would mean a lot more goods to make and sell -- and a lot more cargo and passengers for Boeing jets.

HEADLINE: M.L.S. Wants Your Advertising

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Picture this: opening day of the 2007 Major League Soccer season in April for Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center. During the televised game from Carson, Calif., the camera pans the stands and settles on two California women, eyes on the game, ears to their cellphones. They are wearing red-and-white-striped replica jerseys emblazoned with the name of a team sponsor -- Bimbo.
 Bimbo? Cue the snickers and leering comments on sports shows like ESPN's ''Pardon the Interruption'' and ''Jim Rome Is Burning.''
But for M.L.S., a decision to sell space to sponsors on the front of the jerseys of the league's 13 teams for a minimum of $500,000 a year is another way for the league to find a seat at the table in the global soccer marketplace. And Grupo Bimbo, a multibillion-dollar Mexican company that markets products like Wonder Bread, is one of only a few potential sponsors for Chivas. 
 In previous years, the league sold some advertising space on team jerseys, then divided the proceeds among its clubs. Commissioner Don Garber retains the right to reject inappropriate advertisers, which he considers companies that sell hard liquor and tobacco or run Internet gambling sites.
 Grupo Bimbo has its name emblazoned on the jerseys of a handful of Mexican club teams, including Chivas Guadalajara. That club, like Chivas USA, is owned by Jorge Vergara, a Mexican businessman. A third Vergara team, Deportivo Saprissa of Costa Rica, is also sponsored by Bimbo.
 In Spanish, the word bimbo has no specific meaning, similar to the way the Haagen-Dazs name was made up in order to sell ice cream. When Grupo Bimbo was founded in 1945, according to the company's official history, it came up with the name through a combination of the words Bambi, the animated Disney movie released three years earlier, and bingo, a popular lottery in Mexico at the time. The company, whose logo is a small teddy bear, has marketed its products for more than 20 years in the United States, primarily in areas with large Hispanic populations.
 Confusion over marketing slogans has also traveled north to south. A maker of T-shirts in Miami was trying to capture the Hispanic market during a visit by Pope John Paul II in 1987. The shirts were supposed to read ''I Saw the Pope'' (el papa) but instead said ''I Saw the Potato'' (la papa), according to the Web site moronland.com. Coors also had a translation problem in 1983, when its slogan ''Turn It Loose'' ended up meaning ''suffer from diarrhea.''
 ''Chivas is the perfect fit for Bimbo, and honestly, I never really thought of it in that other connotation,'' said Kathy Carter, an executive vice president for Soccer United Marketing, the league's marketing arm, in New York. She added that Chivas had not yet made a decision on what its jersey sponsor would be. ''The value will be driven by what teams create,'' she said. ''The reputation of the club -- wins, losses, winning tournaments -- will go a long way toward determining value.''
 She added: ''What's important is that this gets people talking about Chivas and people can go on all they want. This is a bread company. You can bet the next time Hispanic people hear Tony Kornheiser go on about it, they will turn off their televisions when he's broadcasting a 'Monday Night Football' game.''
 The opinion is much the same in Southern California.
 ''Our current and target fans will know what it means; there will be no miscommunication,'' said Eddie Salcedo, the director of partnership development for the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which holds the marketing rights to Chivas USA. ''We're not afraid to partner with them. This is the ultimate brand-awareness tool.''
 Salcedo said that A.E.G. and Chivas expected its sponsor, whether it is Bimbo or another company, to pay more than $1 million a year. (Consider what the Los Angeles Galaxy can expect a sponsor to offer if the club signs the English star David Beckham.)
 In the United States, team jerseys in major pro leagues have been almost sacrosanct, but seemingly everything else has been for sale; stadium naming rights and signage at arenas are the most obvious examples. Television timeouts have been added. And baseball increased the time between innings to give sponsors more time to sell things like beer and drugs to fight erectile dysfunction. 
 In Europe, advertising on team jerseys, in soccer and other sports, has been around for more than 30 years. Last year, Manchester United of England signed a four-year shirt sponsorship deal for $106 million with the American International Group, an insurance company. Chelsea, another English club, is receiving $18.7 million a season from a five-year deal with Samsung.
 In Spain, Barcelona, which had not had a sponsor's name on its shirt, decided to take an altruistic tack. The club is paying Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, $2 million a year for the next five years to use its logo in all competitions.
 Other United States companies put their names on the jerseys of European teams in an attempt to increase their presence overseas. Several years ago, Ty, the company that makes Beanie Babies, put its logo on the shirts of Portsmouth in England.
 During a recent sports industry conference in New York, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the current model of sponsors' buying advertising time on TV was enough, for now. Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, told Reuters that the game was ''held to a different standard'' and that ''part of the lure of our game is the history and tradition.''
 Last month, Real Salt Lake became the first club to announce a sponsorship deal. ''The aura of soccer is very different from other sports,'' said Dave Checketts, the owner of Real Salt Lake. The team signed a four-year deal with XanGo, a Utah-based company that makes juices and other products from the mangosteen fruit. XanGo will pay Real Salt Lake more than $500,000 but less than $1 million a year.
 ''For the other sports, there is a group of owners who would not let it happen,'' Checketts said. ''It means one thing to the Kansas City Royals and another thing to the New York Yankees. There is something about a city name on the jersey that seems sacred to them.''
 XanGo, Checketts said, was the sponsor of a game in August, when Real Madrid played in Utah.
 ''They were incredibly pleased that their name was broadcast around the world to 130 countries and that they got their name out in Madrid in a big way,'' he said. ''The day after the league announced plans to sell the front of the jersey, they were in the door. They sold 7,000 jerseys to their distributors. That's more than we've sold in two years.''
 M.L.S. is ready to join the rest of the soccer world and turn its players into walking billboards, and is willing to endure the snickers and barbs. Carter of Soccer United Marketing asserted that there was more at stake.
 ''We are part of the global economy,'' Carter said. ''We are evolving as a country, and in the global economy we have a seat at the table -- we no longer own the table. It is naive for people not to understand that the United States is the largest Hispanic economy in the world. It's not about excluding, it's about including.''

HEADLINE: The Winds Shift in Washington 

 BODY:
Midterm election years can be a roller-coaster ride for a president and his party, but for George W. Bush and the Republicans, 2006 held fewer peaks and more valleys than most. 
 The year began with the confirmation of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., Mr. Bush's choice for the second Supreme Court vacancy of his presidency. (An earlier choice, Harriet Miers, withdrew.) The Senate was bitterly split on Judge Alito, and the discontent with the administration seemed only to increase as 2006 wore on.
 The administration's plans for Iraq were increasingly called into question, fueled by bleak reports from Baghdad. The Supreme Court issued 
 a rebuke to the president regarding his plans for detainees and the war on terror, powers that he asserted after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Bush's defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, became a lightning rod for criticism of the war, and Vice President Dick Cheney became the butt of talk-show jokes after he accidentally shot and wounded a hunting partner in February.
 Republican legislators were tarnished by disclosures of scandals involving lobbyists and the Congressional page program. Even the economy, 
 a source of much good news for the president and the party, was buffeted by high energy prices, a softening housing market and slower growth. 
 Democrats benefited from the dissatisfaction. They began the year with hopes of regaining a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years, and during the campaign they set their sights on the Senate as well. They succeeded on both fronts. 
 The Democrats took the House handily, gaining 30 seats. Control of the Senate was in doubt until two days after the elections, when Senator George Allen of Virginia conceded a tight race to Jim Webb, the Democratic challenger.
 The next day, the elections claimed one final victim: Mr. Rumsfeld, whose resignation was announced by the president.

HEADLINE: Iran Is Defiant, Vowing to U.N. It Will Continue Nuclear Efforts

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Iran on Sunday reacted defiantly to the United Nations Security Council resolution imposing sanctions because of the country's nuclear program. Iranian officials vowed to continue efforts to enrich uranium and warned that the Security Council action would change Iran's relationship with the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency.
 The Security Council voted unanimously on Saturday to impose sanctions on Iran banning the import and export of materials and technology used in uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missiles. 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Sunday that the sanctions would not prevent Iran from developing its nuclear program, ISNA news agency reported.
 ''The nuclear technology is our right, and no one can take it away from us,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying. ''You will soon regret this superficial action,'' he said, referring to the sanctions. 
 ''What kind of Security Council is this that is completely in the hands of the Zionists, the United States and Britain?'' he added. 
 Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, said Iran would respond immediately to the vote by pushing forward with its plan to develop its nuclear program, the newspaper Keyhan reported.
 ''Beginning Sunday morning, we will begin activities at Natanz -- site of 3,000 centrifuges -- and we will drive with full speed,'' he was quoted as saying. ''This will be our immediate response to the resolution.'' 
 The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Iran, in response to the sanctions, intended to put into operation 3,000 centrifuges at its main nuclear complex in Natanz, the newspaper Iran reported. 
 Progress at Natanz has been slow, though. Iran has sporadically operated only a single ''cascade'' of 164 centrifuges, the devices that spin at high speed and turn ordinary uranium into a fuel usable for nuclear power plants -- or, at higher enrichment levels, nuclear weapons. 
 Members of Parliament agreed to discuss a bill that would require the government ''to review its cooperation'' with the International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations. It was not clear what the bill would require. The deputy speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, refused to comment when asked whether it might require that Iran withdraw from the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. ''Our efforts should be reasonable and moderate,'' he told ISNA. ''That means we should be after getting our rights and also show that we are not after a fight. And if they are willing to recognize our rights, we will cooperate.''
 Iran says that its program is peaceful and that as a signatory of the treaty, it has the legal right to enrich uranium. It says it wants to enrich uranium to produce fuel for its nuclear reactors independently. However, enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear weapons if it is enriched to higher levels. 
 The United States says that Iran is a major oil exporter and that its nuclear program is a cover for its weapons program.
 The Security Council on Saturday requested that Mohamed ElBaradei, director of the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency, report to the Council within 60 days on whether Iran had complied and suspended its enrichment program. The Council warned that it would take ''further appropriate measure'' if Iran refused to comply.
 But there were no hints by Iranian authorities that Iran might halt the program.
 ''Our response to the resolution is the continuation of peaceful nuclear activities in a more concrete, decisive and more organized manner than before,'' said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, in a news conference. 
 Mr. Larijani also told Keyhan that pressure from the West through the Security Council would not work. ''It will make us more determined to reach our nuclear goals,'' he said. 
 The press has been barred from criticizing Iran's nuclear policy. Newspapers on Sunday either refrained from editorial comment or denounced the Security Council's decision to punish Iran. Critics could be charged with jeopardizing the country's national interests. 
 However, a weekly program on state-run radio has criticized Iran's defiance for three consecutive weeks this month.
 Iran's state-run television and radio is led by Ezatollah Zarghami, a conservative, who is close to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr. Zarghami is not politically linked to Mr. Ahmadinejad.
 ''Who says that we will lose our national identity if we give up our nuclear program?'' Sadeq Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University, said this month on the program.

HEADLINE: Helping the Poor, the British Way

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
It's the season for charitable giving. And far too many Americans, particularly children, need that charity. 
 Scenes of a devastated New Orleans reminded us that many of our fellow citizens remain poor, four decades after L.B.J. declared war on poverty. But I'm not sure whether people understand how little progress we've made. In 1969, fewer than one in every seven American children lived below the poverty line. Last year, although the country was far wealthier, more than one in every six American children were poor.
And there's no excuse for our lack of progress. Just look at what the British government has accomplished over the last decade. 
 Although Tony Blair has been President Bush's obedient manservant when it comes to Iraq, Mr. Blair's domestic policies are nothing like Mr. Bush's. Where Mr. Bush has sought to privatize the social safety net, Mr. Blair's Labor government has defended and strengthened it. Where Mr. Bush and his allies accuse anyone who mentions income distribution of ''class warfare,'' the Blair government has made a major effort to reverse the surge in inequality and poverty that took place during the Thatcher years.
 And Britain's poverty rate, if measured American-style -- that is, in terms of a fixed poverty line, not a moving target that rises as the nation grows richer -- has been cut in half since Labor came to power in 1997.
 Britain's war on poverty has been led by Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer and Mr. Blair's heir apparent. There's nothing exotic about his policies, many of which are inspired by American models. But in Britain, these policies are carried out with much more determination. 
 For example, Britain didn't have a minimum wage until 1999 -- but at current exchange rates Britain's minimum wage rate is now about twice as high as ours. Britain's child benefit is more generous than America's child tax credit, and it's available to everyone, even those too poor to pay income taxes. Britain's tax credit for low-wage workers is similar to the U.S. earned-income tax credit, but substantially larger. 
 And don't forget that Britain's universal health care system ensures that no one has to fear going without medical care or being bankrupted by doctors' bills.
 The Blair government hasn't achieved all its domestic goals. Income inequality has been stabilized but not substantially reduced: as in America, the richest 1 percent have pulled away from everyone else, though not to the same extent. The decline in child poverty, though impressive, has fallen short of the government's ambitious goals. And the government's policies don't seem to have helped a persistent underclass of the very poor. 
 But there's no denying that the Blair government has done a lot for Britain's have-nots. Modern Britain isn't paradise on earth, but the Blair government has ensured that substantially fewer people are living in economic hell. Providing a strong social safety net requires a higher overall rate of taxation than Americans are accustomed to, but Britain's tax burden hasn't undermined the economy's growth.
 What are the lessons to be learned from across the pond? 
 First, government truly can be a force for good. Decades of propaganda have conditioned many Americans to assume that government is always incompetent -- and the current administration has done its best to turn that into a self-fulfilling prophecy. But the Blair years have shown that a government that seriously tries to reduce poverty can achieve a lot. 
 Second, it really helps to have politicians who are serious about governing, rather than devoting themselves entirely to amassing power and rewarding cronies. 
 While researching this article, I was startled by the sheer rationality of British policy discussion, as compared with the cynical posturing that passes for policy discourse in George Bush's America. Instead of making grandiose promises that are quickly forgotten -- like Mr. Bush's promise of ''bold action'' to confront poverty after Hurricane Katrina -- British Labor politicians propose specific policies with well-defined goals. And when actual results fall short of those goals, they face the facts rather than trying to suppress them and sliming the critics.
 The moral of my Christmas story is that fighting poverty isn't easy, but it can be done. Giving in to cynicism and accepting the persistence of widespread poverty even as the rich get ever richer is a choice that our politicians have made. And we should be ashamed of that choice.

HEADLINE: Helping U.S. Companies Export White-Collar Jobs 

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
For a while ''Office Tigers'' looks like one of those middle-of-the-night get-rich-quick infomercials. 
 In this curious but ultimately intriguing four-part documentary, which begins tonight on Sundance Channel, Joe Siegelman, a 34-year-old American, prances around the Chennai, India, offices of Office Tiger, the company that he and a partner founded, and brags about how fabulously successful it is.
Mr. Siegelman (who used to work in investment banking at Goldman Sachs), a co-chief executive, stands on a desk to make a speech to adoring employees who surround him. He talks proudly about changing the way the world does business. Office Tiger exists at a fairly high level of corporate outsourcing. It does, as the documentary says, ''PowerPoint presentations, number crunching and research'' for American companies, functioning as a back office far, far away. 
 Executives suggest that Office Tiger's secret is working its staff remarkably long hours (Chennai, formerly called Madras, is 10 1/2 hours ahead of New York time), eliminating coffee and tea breaks, and instilling pride in the employees' work by periodically telling them that they're the best and the brightest and that this job is the gateway to a glorious financial future for them. 
 As seen by the director, Liz Mermin, and her crew's cameras, the place lies somewhere between a white-collar sweatshop and a religious cult. But that may be true of a lot of corporations.
 In the first episode Mr. Siegelman presents himself as a self-satisfied character, living in a hotel for six years, not owning a car and stopping male employees in the hallway to ask why they are not wearing ties.
 The four episodes' titles -- ''Meritocracy,'' ''Integrity,'' ''Accountability'' and ''Commitment to Clients'' -- would work just as well (O.K., better) in a recruiting film for the company. Fortunately they are about more than the titles suggest. Unfortunately their messages are a bit scattered.
 Fast facts appear on the screen periodically: Unemployment in India is almost 10 percent. There are 2.5 million new Indian college graduates a year. India does 85 percent of the world's outsourcing. The average age for marriage in India is 24 for men and 19 for women.
 A handsome 41-year-old American executive refers to himself as an ''old bachelor,'' while wedding invitations pile up on his desk. He is also condescending to his secretary, in a 1950s way, joking that she is the one who really runs the company.
 One Indian employee makes an impassioned if not fully convincing speech about the value of honesty. Another is declared a ''marked man'' after he inexplicably lies about his identity to a client. 
 Based on what is seen in ''Office Tigers'' the company relies heavily on instilling what are seen as American corporate values in their Indian employees. The better to have them accepted and respected by American clients, the officers believe. For starters that means a 10 a.m. meeting starts at 10 a.m., not 11 a.m. or noon. And for better or worse it means working in a world where the staff training people are the ''talent transformation team'' and strategies have names like ''rapid organic acquisitive rollout.'' 

Office Tigers

HEADLINE: 2007 Seen as a Potentially 'Defining Year' for the Current Round of Global Trade Talks 

BYLINE: By JOHN ZAROCOSTAS

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
The international trade system is heading for turbulent times next year unless negotiators from developing and industrial nations move quickly, and decisively, to conclude a deal, top officials and business executives warn. 
 ''I think it's probably a defining year for the round, and hence for the multilateral trading system,'' said Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, which is overseeing the so-called Doha round of negotiations.
 The talks to improve trade in farm and industrial goods, which started in November 2001 in Doha, Qatar, collapsed in late July after the United States, the European Union, Japan and India failed to reach an agreement on reductions in farm subsidies and tariffs, which is critical to a wider agreement. 
 Since then, some countries that had been waiting for the W.T.O. to forge an agreement have said they would begin negotiating bilateral accords with trading partners. 
 A new wave of bilateral agreements could undermine the W.T.O.'s authority. And the absence of a global trade agreement poses other risks. It may escalate trade tensions among large economies, including China, the United States and the European Union. Trade experts also warn of a possible rise in protectionism as both rich and emerging nations seek to pry open markets. 
 ''This is one of the most dangerous moments that I recall,'' said Peter Sutherland, chairman of BP and of Goldman Sachs International. ''At the moment, it is virtually impossible to be other than pessimistic about the round and, therefore, about the W.T.O. There is a lack of leadership, as opposed to rhetoric.''
 His pessimism is shared by many trade negotiators and experts. At stake is five years of negotiations on a package to sweep away barriers to the international flow of goods and services, valued at more than $12 trillion a year. The complex areas of negotiations are all interrelated. As the W.T.O. itself puts it, ''Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.'' And the accord must be approved by all members -- there will be 150 when Vietnam joins in January. 
 About two dozen trade ministers are to meet in late January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But Mr. Lamy played down expectations. 
 ''My own sense is that a serious negotiating meeting will only make sense when people come with new numbers,'' Mr. Lamy said. ''I am not aware that that will be the case in Davos. Davos is a useful stock-taking exercise.'' 
 Mr. Lamy was also cautious on the idea of calling a W.T.O. ministerial meeting in February. 
 ''I think it's only useful if, again, people come with new numbers on what they ask for, and new numbers on what they're willing to pay for on agriculture and industrial tariffs,'' Mr. Lamy said. 
 National politics are casting a long shadow over the Doha round. President Bush's loss of his Republican majority in both houses of Congress in November means that he will have to work hard to extend his trade promotion authority, which expires next July. Under this ''fast track'' authority, the president has the power to negotiate trade deals and Congress must vote yes or no on them without offering amendments. 
 On the other side of the Atlantic, France, a country with an outspoken farm sector and a marked reluctance to lower agricultural barriers, is preparing for its presidential election in the spring. Given France's influence on European Union trade policy, it will be difficult for the bloc's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, to deliver deeper cuts on farm subsidies and tariffs. 
 But without deeper cuts from the European Union, a senior American trade official said, it would be difficult for the Bush administration to sell the package at home. 
 In any case, the days are gone when the United States and Europe set the agenda on trade, brokered secret deals in back rooms and then forced them on their partners. 
 ''The geopolitics have changed,'' Mr. Lamy said. ''India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia play a huge role in this agriculture negotiation.'' 
 Kamal Nath, the Indian minister for commerce and industry, recently said that unless the United States and the European Union substantially reduced their farm subsidies, ''there would be no benefits for developing countries'' from Doha. 
 Many business groups are also skeptical. 
 ''We want things to move on Doha, but only if there's a willingness to have real negotiations and not posturing,'' said Christopher Wenk, director of international trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall in Tokyo as Traders Show Caution Before Release of Key Numbers 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Share prices in Tokyo slipped yesterday as traders held off making big moves before the release of economic data this week. In Shanghai, however, the market surged to a record on buying of bank shares, while most other Asian markets were closed for Christmas Day. 
 Markets in the United States and Europe were also closed yesterday for Christmas; most will reopen today.
In Tokyo, the stock exchange's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell 12.07 points, or 0.07 percent, to finish at 17,092.89.
 Yesterday's retreat came after the index added 57.13 points on Friday to finish 0.34 percent higher at 17,104.96 points -- its highest close since May 9.
 Market sentiment was cautious yesterday ahead of some economic indicators due this week, including November household spending on Tuesday, as traders wanted to see whether the data were likely to discourage the Bank of Japan from raising interest rates next month.
 In Shanghai, the benchmark index soared to another closing record as traders bought banks shares on hopes that China Life Insurance will make a strong debut in January.
 The insurance company, in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, set the price in its $3.6 billion offering at 18.16 to 18.88 yuan a share. 
 The Shanghai Composite index advanced 3.9 percent to 2,435.76 points. It rose as much as 4.6 percent during the day but retreated on profit taking.
 The Shenzhen Composite Index jumped 1.5 percent to 543.42 points.
 In currency trading in Tokyo, the American dollar gained against the euro and the Japanese yen in Tokyo.
 Thailand's key stock market index ended slightly higher yesterday on bargain hunting in blue-chip banks, although most foreign investors stayed away awaiting further action by the government.
 The Stock Exchange of Thailand's benchmark SET index rose 0.6 percent, or 4.01 points, to close at 684.32.
 Since hitting a nine-year low of 35.09 baht last Monday, the dollar has strengthened, closing Monday at 36.43 baht, little changed from its Friday close of 36.44.
 Thai shares plunged nearly 15 percent last Tuesday after the central bank announced regulations restricting foreign capital inflows in an effort to curb the baht's appreciation.
 The authorities quickly lifted the controls on foreign stock investments but retained the curbs on bonds and other debt instruments, prompting the benchmark index to bounce back 11 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Rush at End, But Sales Fall Short

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
There is always next year. 
 Shoppers swarmed discount stores and mobbed suburban malls over the crucial holiday weekend, but the final burst of buying is expected to fall short of retailers' expectations.
Visa USA, the credit card company, said yesterday that it would lower its closely watched forecast for holiday spending. Based on purchases by credit and debit card holders, Visa said sales rose 6.5 percent in November and December, compared with the same period last year, down from its initial forecast of a 7.5 percent gain.
 The company's unexpected downward revision -- and the millions of dollars in lost sales it represents -- could have broad implications for the nation's merchants, who count on purchases during the holiday season for nearly half of their business. 
 For consumers, it will probably translate into even deeper discounts over the next week, as they begin redeeming millions of gift cards. 
 Industry analysts said that, after a strong, discount-induced start the day after Thanksgiving, consumer spending slowed in December and never fully recovered. A soft housing market and high fuel prices pinched consumer spending, while unseasonably warm temperatures damped sales of cold-weather clothing from New York to Chicago. 
 ''We knew spending would be slower than last year,'' said Wayne Best, senior vice president of economic analysis at Visa USA. ''But it seems to be even slower than we predicted.'' 
 The lackluster performance, well below the 8.3 percent increase in 2005, came despite respectable last-minute sales over the weekend. 
 ShopperTrak RCT, which measures purchases at 45,000 mall-based stores, said spending rose 22.5 percent on Friday and Saturday, compared with the same period last year, hitting $16.3 billion.
 A founder of the research firm, Bill Martin, called it a ''very strong close to the holiday shopping season.''
 But it was probably not enough to prop up the entire season. Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at the NPD Group, an influential research firm, said retailers had handicapped themselves by dangling even deeper discounts this November than last -- encouraging consumers to finish their shopping earlier than ever. 
 According to NPD, 40 percent of Americans had started shopping by Thanksgiving weekend. ''That is a huge increase over the prior year,'' Mr. Cohen said. 
 The early shopping theory was supported, in part, by data from ShopperTrak, which said consumers spend more on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, than on any day leading up to Christmas. That is a reversal from previous years, when the Saturday before Christmas was the biggest shopping day of the year. 
 Retailers turned Black Friday into a fierce game of one-upmanship this season, with dozens of malls opening at midnight to compete with discount retailers, only to be outdone by CompUSA, which began ringing up sales at 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving. 
 Since then, Mr. Cohen said, customer traffic at the nation's stores has slid. 
 Those who did shop spent less, according to Visa USA. From Dec. 1 to Dec. 24, it said, the cost of the average purchase dropped by 1 percent. When customers did splurge, it was on electronics, appliances and home furnishings -- which emerged, to Visa's surprise, as the single biggest area of growth this holiday season.
 Data from Visa is considered a reliable gauge of the economy because $17 out of every $100 is spent on its 500 million cards. Like monthly retail sales reports from the Department of Commerce, Visa's holiday forecast includes spending on gasoline, grocery stores and restaurants.
 Faced with a so-so December, retailers did their best to drum up business this last weekend. Best Buy opened at 7 a.m. and dangled scores of Christmas Eve specials like a $229 L.C.D. television and 50 percent off all HBO DVDs. 
 Circuit City offered Sunday-only specials like a 5.1 megapixel digital camera for $80 and gave away $100 gift cards for every purchase of $1,000 or more. 
 Last-minute discounts lured Kim Clark to a Wal-Mart in Hamden, Conn., on Christmas Eve. 
 ''It's never too late,'' said Ms. Clark, a 45-year-old mother, as she spent $89 on toys like an Aquadoodle Sing 'n Doodle, one of the season's hottest preschool products. 
 ''I just hope my bank does not prosecute,'' she said. 
 To make up for disappointing pre-Christmas sales, stores are now focusing on those shoppers holding gift cards. Retailers like Coach and Bloomingdale's are introducing dozens of new products this week to encourage shoppers to spend their gift cards before the year is over. 
 Wal-Mart, whose sales have lagged competitors all year, appealed directly to plastic-wielding shoppers in its circular yesterday: ''Got a gift card?'' it read. ''Get your gift.''

HEADLINE: Addressing a Shortage of Hotel Rooms, Not People

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

DATELINE: MUMBAI 

 BODY:
With its ultrachic restaurant and sweeping views of a 16th-century tomb, the Oberoi in New Delhi is a hotel of choice for the deal makers pouring into India.
 But unless you planned your trip months ago, there is little chance of finding a vacancy. The 279 rooms and suites are fully booked almost every night until April at prices that start at $345 a night, breakfast not included.
Demand for hotel rooms is soaring in India as its economy blossoms. Foreigners are flooding in to cut deals, attend conferences or just discover the caves of Ajanta and the sands of Rajasthan. The rise of low-fare airlines is also bringing domestic air travel within reach of more Indians, who, until recently, had little chance of ever boarding a jet.
 Yet for all those travelers, India offers only 110,000 hotel rooms. China has 10 times as many, and the United States 40 times as many. The New York metropolitan region alone has about as many rooms as all of India. 
 The shortage is pushing peak season rates for basic rooms into the stratosphere, by Indian standards, and attracting some of the world's best-known names in hotels -- Accor, Hilton, Wyndham, Pan Pacific -- to invest heavily in India.
 ''There's enormous potential here,'' said Dennis Oldfield, the general manager for the Indian branch of Accor, a French group with 4,100 hotels worldwide. Accor has plans for up to 200 hotels in India within a decade.
 Meanwhile, business travelers are trying to cope.
 Two female Indian employees of a top management consultancy based in New York were recently forced to share a bed in a company apartment because there were no decent hotel rooms available in the city they were visiting, according to one of their colleagues, who did not wish to be identified.
 Microsoft is using its own Live Meeting videoconferencing technology to cut down on business trips, said Ravi Venkatesan, chairman of Microsoft India.
 In Bangalore, rooms are so costly that traveling salespeople and other professionals often commute by air from as far as Mumbai, 620 miles away.
 ''They are making you fly to Bangalore every day in the morning and fly back every night because it's cheaper than paying the hotel bill,'' said Saurabh Gupta, an analyst in the Indian office of HVS International, a hospitality industry consulting firm.
 Infosys, an Indian software giant with 66,000 employees worldwide, has built its own 500-room hotel next to its headquarters in Bangalore. By June, it expects to have 15,000 company-owned rooms across India -- nearly an eighth as many rooms as the entire country has, and more than any Indian hotel chain.
 Putting an employee up for a night at its Bangalore campus hotel costs Infosys $15, and the guest gets three-star treatment that would normally cost $150, by the company's estimate.
 ''It's much more efficient in India to do it yourself,'' said T. V. Mohandas Pai, director of human resources at Infosys.
 The high prices are all the more striking in a low-wage country like India. At a $500 rack rate for the five-star rooms favored by business travelers, a hotel employee earning minimum wage here would have to work about a year to pay for one night's stay, versus about two and a half weeks' work for an American earning minimum wage.
 And even though the Chinese earn twice as much as Indians on average, India has the more expensive rooms, according to a recent edition of Travel Business Analyst, an industry newsletter. Comparing rooms of similar quality, suitable for business travelers, a room in Delhi cost $187 on average this year, versus $122 in Beijing; a room in Mumbai was $178, versus $150 in Shanghai.
 High prices discourage tourists, industry specialists say, and the shortage of rooms, along with other infrastructure woes, offers one reason a country with the petal-covered lakes of Kashmir and the palm-lined shores of Kerala lags behind in tourism.
 Compare India, a country of 1.1 billion people, to New York, a city of 8 million: New York attracted 6.8 million foreign tourists in 2005; India attracted 3.9 million.
 The Indian government also recognizes that, by some industry estimates, hotels employ 180 people for every 100 rooms, and it is now scrambling to expand supply.
 It recently paid for half-page advertisements in Delhi newspapers that urged families to convert their homes into bed-and-breakfast operations, which can charge about $35 a night. The government's goal is to approve enough homes-turned-hostels to offer another 10,000 rooms in time for the Commonwealth Games, an Olympic-like event, in 2010, which will be held in New Delhi.
 ''We should not be turning tourists away,'' Ambika Soni, the Indian tourism minister, said in a telephone interview.
 Some hotel executives blame the government for sticking to decades-old laws that limit the amount of land for sale and drive up prices. 
 Because of the Indian real estate boom, land is so expensive that the Taj group of hotels, a chain with 7,000 rooms across India, has found that the reserve price at land auctions makes building a hotel not financially viable, said Ajoy Misra, the group's sales and marketing chief.
 Ms. Soni said she was pushing for a 10-year tax rebate for new budget hotels, as well as encouraging Indian Railways to give up some of its vast land holdings for track-side hotels. To avoid the spiraling auction prices, the government may soon purchase land and lease it out cheaply to hotels.
 Amitabh Kant, a senior official in the Tourism Ministry, said $6.5 billion was being invested in hotel-building, and 140,000 new hotel rooms were expected by 2010. More conservative assessments put the figure at 70,000.
 Hilton has won approvals for 75 new hotels in India by 2010, Mr. Kant said. Ramada Hotels recently announced a partnership with Royal Orchid, an Indian company, to build four- and five-star properties nationwide.
 The Taj group, which has long focused on the affluent, is introducing $22-a-night hotels called Ginger, and plans to build 100 of them within five years. And Accor has announced plans, along with Emaar, a developer in Dubai, to invest $300 million to bring 100 of its Formule1 hotels to India. Accor will also bring Sofitel, a plusher chain, to Mumbai.
 Starwood Hotels plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build scores of hotels across India, said Stephen Ford, the chief of the company's South Asian operations. The expansion will include brands as diverse as Sheraton, Westin, Le Meridien, W and Aloft, an $80-a-night, low-frills hotel for business travelers.
 ''We're very confident that there's a huge need for hotel bedrooms,'' Mr. Ford said, ''and that's why we're here.''

HEADLINE: Europe May Thrive Despite the U.S.

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The prospects for Claas, a German maker of agricultural equipment, could not be better at the moment. The market for its combines and tractors is booming in China and India. Its sales continue to be strong in the United States and at home. 
 ''We don't see any clouds on the horizon,'' its chief executive, Rudiger Gunther, said recently. 
 The question is whether other parts of the European economy can weather the slowdown in the United States as well as Claas. Europe has thrived in the last year -- its best in the last five -- with healthy exports, strong business investment and the long-awaited return of consumers, many of whom were unemployed in years past and not spending. 
 Still, the slowing American real estate market, whose rise in the last five years allowed consumers to draw on their housing equity to spend freely, has become the wild card in the outlook for 2007. To be sure, only a minority of economists now think that the decline in housing will spill over into the rest of the United States economy and touch off a full-blown recession. 
 The optimists about Europe's prospects point to thriving businesses like Claas, which had $2.92 billion in sales last year, most of them outside the United States, as one reason why Europe can take an American slowdown in stride. The pessimists counter that even the strongest economies can be hurt by the largest storms. 
 Germany, considered only a few years ago to be the sick man of Europe, is resurgent, while France chugs along at a moderate pace. 
 Italy and Spain are growing as well, making for a quartet that supports, rather than drags down, the dynamic smaller economies like Ireland, the Netherlands and Austria. 
 Forecasts that Europe will grow about 2.7 percent this year, and at least 2 percent next year, are welcome news for a global economy that relies on the United States and booming emerging markets in Asia, notably China and India, to keep the world's factories humming. 
 Combined with Japan, which is emerging from a decade of stagnation, Europe can finally stand on its own, to the relief of European policy makers. 
 ''For Europe and also for Japan, the constellations of growth that we're observing are going in the direction of alleviating tensions on global imbalances,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said recently. ''We're very cautious. But what we're currently observing goes in the right direction.'' 
 This outlook has put the European Central Bank, which has raised its benchmark interest rate to 3.5 percent now from 2 percent in December 2005, in a position where it can order up more rate increases in 2007 without squeezing growth. 
 The problem is that Europe has been in this position before, in late 2000. At that time, Wim Duisenberg, who was then president of the European Central Bank, confidently predicted that a slowing American economy would have minimal effect on Europe. In retrospect, it was the beginning of the collapse of the technology bubble. But the bank soon reversed course and in May 2001 began cutting its key interest rate from a high of 4.75, and did not stop until it hit 2 percent in June 2003. 
 A repeat of 2000-01 could, in theory, force the central bank to cut rates. But analysts caution that the bank will be unwilling to abandon its tightening strategy without ample evidence that the United States is pulling Europe down with it. 
 ''The potential for denial is pretty vast here,'' said Ken Wattret, chief European economist with BNP Paribas, a bank that has staked out a bearish view of the American economy. ''The compulsion to cut rates is much less when rates are not that high to begin with.'' 
 The optimists hasten to point out that corporate restructuring in the last few years has made companies much more shock-resistant than they were in 2001, when the contracting economy in the United States laid bare the structural weakness of the European corporate sector. 
 One consequence of steady expansion into new markets, like Eastern Europe and Asia, has meant that Europe is less dependent on the United States than it might first appear. About 20 percent of exports from European Union countries head to Asia, and only 15 percent across the Atlantic. 
 ''While there is no doubt that a U.S. slowdown will have serious implications for euro zone exporters, there are also good reasons not to be overly pessimistic,'' said Marco Kramer, an economist with UniCredit in Munich. 
 The opposing school points to the sheer number of American consumers as the reason why an American slowdown will hurt the rest of the world, and badly. In 2005, household spending totaled $9 trillion, or 20 percent more than spending in Europe, nearly four times the Japanese total, and nine times the corresponding Chinese figure, said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. 
 ''Not only do Teflonlike U.S. consumers reign supreme in terms of relative growth performance, but they also have the scale that the rest of the world is lacking,'' Mr. Roach wrote in a recent essay. 
 Economists also note that integrated financial markets transmit shocks in unusual ways. If the American economy does slow significantly, European firms that sell there or have invested there will see their shares tumble, possibly leading them to slow investment at home. 
 ''People are rational animals, but this feel-good factor is important in a way that is very hard for us to measure,'' said Laurence Boone, chief France economist for Barclays Capital. 
 The worst possible scenario would be a crisis of confidence in the dollar -- impossible to predict but always conceivable -- set off by a sharp deterioration in the outlook in the United States early in the year. 
 With a surging euro worth about $1.31, European exporters are finding ways to cope. But a serious collapse of the dollar would send European exports to the United States into a free fall, generate turbulence in financial markets and douse hopes for a 2007 that matches 2006. 
 ''All the policy makers still believe in the possibility of a dollar crash,'' said Stephen Jen, the chief currency economist at Morgan Stanley. ''It's lingering out there.''

HEADLINE: An Economy of Extremes

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Economists have long waxed lyrical about a ''Goldilocks economy''-- one that is not too hot, not too cold. 
 In this ideal world, the economy is running so smoothly that there is little risk of it overheating and pushing inflation higher -- forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Nor is the job market weakening, threatening to plunge the economy into the icy bath of a recession.
The ''just right'' economy is not often achieved, of course, but lately this bedtime story has taken a particularly tricky turn: it is both too hot and too cold.
 The housing market has fallen into a deep freeze; so has the auto industry. Yet on several other fronts, including commercial construction and high-end consumer spending, economic activity appears to be sizzling. 
 Lombard Street Research, a British economic forecasting firm, recently dubbed the American economy the ''anti-Goldilocks economy.'' 
 That is making it challenging for both economists and the Federal Reserve to decide which risk is greater: that housing will drag down the rest of the economy, pushing the Fed to cut rates, or that inflation will remain above the Fed's comfort zone, forcing it to push up rates instead.
 But others say that next year hot and cold could end up canceling each other out, turning the economy balmy.
 For now, though, with home construction entering its second year of a downturn, many economists have aggressively pared back their forecasts for growth in 2007. Some have started to utter the R-word.
 ''We've increased the probability of a recession in our forecast to 35 percent,'' said David W. Berson, chief economist of Fannie Mae.
 On the other hand, Charles Dumas, who follows the American economy for Lombard from London, ticked off a list of countervailing forces from high employment and income growth to robust business investment. 
 ''None of that speaks of a slowdown,'' he said. ''There has to be a landing but I don't see any signs of it yet.''
 The economy looks very different depending on whether you are inside or outside the housing market.
 Consider Andrew Palau, who runs Premier Homes and Additions of River Edge, N.J. Business has dried up as the collapse of the housing market has slashed demand for new master bathrooms and refurbished kitchens across Bergen County in the northeast corner of the state.
 ''Homeowners don't have a clear view in front of them so they are not investing because they want to hold on to the money,'' Mr. Palau said. 
 He managed to hold on to his staff of 10 this year, but thinks he is probably going to have to let people go next year. ''Everything is telling me that next year will be worse,'' he said. ''I don't see how I can keep everyone.'' 
 Virtually every homebuilder in the nation shares Mr. Palau's concern. Yet a look just outside the border of the housing-linked economy provides a starkly different view. 
 ''Our market is as close to capacity as you can get,'' said Michael D. Bolen, chairman and chief executive of McCarthy Building Companies in St. Louis, a commercial builder of everything from schools and hospitals to casinos and parking lots. 
 To hear Mr. Bolen speak, the job market has the go-go feel of the Internet-driven boom of the late 1990s. ''It's as goofy as it's ever been,'' he said. ''We're offering signing bonuses and guaranteed locations to people coming straight out of school.'' 
 Mr. Bolen said that McCarthy expected to increase its 1800-strong hourly work force by 10 to 15 percent when the construction season picked up in the spring.
 This off-kilter performance has allowed for an unusually wide difference of views on the economic outlook next year.
 Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., expects the economy to virtually stall at somewhere between flat to 1 percent growth in 2007. He thinks the Fed will slash its benchmark short-term interest rate from 5.25 percent today to 3.75 percent by the end of next year.
 A majority of traders now anticipate that the Fed will cut rates next year, starting in the summer, though not by quite so much. According to the market for interest rates futures, the Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to 4.75 percent by the end of 2007.
 Yet for all the economists taking the cue from Mr. Palau's bleak outlook, others look to McCarthy's booming business.
 Bruce Kasman, chief economist at J. P. Morgan, forecasts the economy will grow at a healthy 3 percent clip in 2007. Rather than cutting interest rates, the Fed may well have to raise them again to quell inflationary pressures. ''The rates market is pricing in weak growth and Fed easing,'' Mr. Kasman said. ''If our view is right there will be a correction.''
 Economists were taken by surprise by the speed at which the housing market morphed from a surging bubble to a sinking stone. Today, there are some signs that the worst has passed: mortgage applications seem to be bottoming out, for instance. 
 But the number of permits issued to build new houses fell for the 10th straight month in November, and they are down about a third since November of last year. Residential investment plummeted in the second and third quarters of the year. 
 Employment in construction has fallen; so has the production of construction materials and other items related to housing. In the third quarter, the slowdown in homebuilding subtracted more than one percentage point from economic growth.
 But for all the damage done by the deflating housing balloon, it has so far been narrowly circumscribed. 
 Today, virtually every economist agrees that the housing recession is likely to continue weighing on economic growth. But the consensus breaks up over how bad that damage will be. 
 The most important disagreement is over how intensely the housing recession will ricochet through the rest of the economy and how it will affect consumer spending, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the nation's economic activity. 
 ''I find it very hard to believe that what started in housing ends in housing,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''That you are not going to get any spillovers from a major recession in a sector that accounts for 6 percent of the economy.''
 Many economists argue that the decline in housing prices experienced so far must inevitably deliver a big blow to consumer spending. Bluntly put, Americans who spent more than they earned as the price of homes soared cannot possibly go on spending as avidly now that the value of homes is tumbling. And if consumers spend less, businesses will stop investing. 
 Homeowners are certainly extracting less money from their homes to spend. Mortgage equity withdrawals, net of commissions and taxes, fell in the third quarter for the fourth time in a row, to about $380 billion at an annual rate, the lowest level in almost three years. 
 They are likely to keep falling. According to the Fed, the equity Americans hold in their homes grew only 0.1 percent in the third quarter, before seasonal adjustments. This was the slowest pace of growth in more than 10 years. 
 But for all this, consumers have not yet shown any sign that they are ready to put the wallet away. Overall consumer spending grew by 0.5 percent in both October and November, after accounting for inflation, bolstered by the decline in the price of gas.
 Shawn DuBravac, staff economist at the Consumer Electronics Association, said he expected sales of everything from big screen televisions to digital cameras to grow by a little less than 7 percent next year, down from about 11 percent in 2006. 
 While profit margins among some electronics retailers are down due to intense competition, the business is holding up much better than expected. ''Lots of people said the housing market would kill the economy,'' Mr. DuBravac said. ''That hasn't happened. The consumer seems really healthy going into 2007.'' 
 From hospitals to hotels, spending on services is growing. ''This year has been a better year than last year,'' said Anne Trevett, the innkeeper at Blackbeard's Lodge in Ocracoke, a coastal island of North Carolina. ''The only down times we have are due to bad weather.''
 Even as the housing downturn has curtailed the ability of Americans to borrow, spending is being supported by jobs and wage growth. Employers are adding about 150,000 jobs each month, according to the government's survey of businesses. As oil prices have declined, real wages have rebounded. Real disposable personal income has grown by 0.5 percent a month, on average, over the last three months. 
 Businesses are investing heavily, too. Nonresidential investment grew 10 percent in the third quarter, almost compensating for the 19 percent decline in nonresidential investment. ''Outside of the housing and motor vehicle sectors,'' said the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in a speech late last month, ''economic activity has, on balance, been expanding at a solid pace.''
 There is one crucial weakness to all the forecasts, however. Part way through the bust of perhaps the strongest housing boom on record, the American economy is in uncharted territory. 
 Nobody has ever seen how a situation like this unwinds. 
 Allen Sinai, president and chief global economist at Decision Economics, observed that past housing-induced recessions were characterized by rising interest rates and tight credit, conditions that do not apply in these days of still cheap, easy money. 
 Some economists have drawn parallels to 2000 -- when the Federal Reserve spun on a dime and started slashing interest rates only weeks after warning about inflationary risks. But the slump in 2000 came about because highly leveraged businesses, shocked by the end of the tech boom and the drying up of new orders, essentially stopped hiring and investing. Today, corporate balance sheets are in very good shape.
 Still, there are enough uncertainties to warrant talk of a recession. 
 Mr. Sinai estimated that, over time, consumers ended up spending 40 cents out of every dollar in equity they extracted from their homes as house prices went up. They spent 28 percent of the capital gains they made when they sold their homes, and 3 percent of their increase in overall wealth. 
 ''If housing is as unhelpful on the way down as it was helpful on the way up, we will get a recession,'' Mr. Sinai said.
 But at McCarthy, Mr. Bolen has other worries. ''Our suppliers and vendors and subcontractors have been working so hard for so long they are going to get tired,'' he said.

HEADLINE: I'm Elite and You're Not

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

 BODY:
An elite-level frequent flier card used to be a passport to a better flying experience, offering access to special waiting areas, preferred seating and priority first-class upgrades.
 But lately, frequent flier status has come to represent something else to many business travelers: a de facto insurance policy against more declines in customer service.
Airlines are reserving more choice seats for their best customers, often leaving nonelites wedged in cramped spaces. They are creating separate areas where their best customers can check in, get screened and even board faster. Those passengers without status often must stand in lines that seem to be getting longer and longer. 
 There are even discussions about whether to begin charging passengers for checking in luggage or advance seat assignments; card-carrying elites would most likely be exempt from those fees. 
 ''Basically, the airlines are saying that if you're a frequent flier, you'll be protected against cuts in services and amenities,'' said Tim Winship, the co-author of ''Mileage Pro: The Insider's Guide to Frequent Flyer Programs'' (OAG Worldwide, 2005) and the editor of the Web site Frequentflier.com. ''It's a subtle but important switch from the early days of loyalty programs, when belonging to a frequent flier program meant that you would be given additional services that went above and beyond the already good service you were getting.''
 Passengers have noticed a shift, too. ''Becoming an elite flier doesn't mean you get anything extra,'' said Christopher Howes, a product manager from Minneapolis, who is a Northwest Airlines frequent flier. ''It just means that you avoid some of the headaches and hassles that are becoming more common.''
 Airlines deny that they have changed their approach to loyalty programs. Recent modifications to their frequent flier benefits, they assert, have increased the benefits of membership while maintaining a consistent level of service for the balance of their passengers. 
 ''We're not saying, 'We'll take care of our best customers, and everyone else can go stand in a line,' '' said Graham Atkinson, an executive vice president and chief customer officer at United Airlines. ''What we are saying is that for people who are going to demonstrate their loyalty or pay higher fares, we want to offer a better experience.''
 United recently limited its Economy Plus seats at the front of the economy-class section -- where seats have five extra inches of legroom -- to frequent fliers. Before that, travelers who paid more for their airline ticket, but were not elite fliers, could also get a seat assignment in that part of the plane. Separate security screening lines for its top-tier customers have also been added at many airports that United serves.
 More changes are in the works. United is testing a new check-in and boarding procedure at San Francisco International Airport that completely separates elites from other passengers. Frequent fliers are checked in, screened and boarded in their own lines. The new program, tentatively called Airport Premier Services, will be added at United's hubs in Chicago and Washington in early 2007, and at an undetermined number of other airports later in the year.
 United is also considering whether to charge some economy-class passengers a fee for checked luggage and advance seat assignments in exchange for a deeper discount on a ticket. Currently, it does not charge for seat assignments and allows passengers to check two bags, each up to 50 pounds, free. Elites who buy these cheaper fares would probably be exempt from the fees. The airline says that the new tickets represent another choice for passengers rather than the removal of basic amenities.
 ''We're trying to identify things that people are willing to pay for,'' Mr. Atkinson said.
 Other airlines are also making changes to their programs, but like United, they chafe at the suggestion that nonelites are suffering as a result.
 Northwest Airlines, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, also added separate elite boarding lines earlier this year at many airports. It reclassified some of its exit row seats and certain desirable seats in the front of the economy class section as Coach Choice seats, for which it charges nonelites $15 a seat assignment. However, elite-level frequent fliers are exempt from the fee. A Northwest Airlines spokesman, Roman Blahoski, said the changes were ''a way for Northwest to reward and recognize our most loyal customers.''
 But other airlines are reluctant to remove amenities that were once available to all of their passengers and return them to only their frequent fliers. US Airways has added elites-only boarding lines, but stopped short of partitioning its economy-class cabin. It also turned down two ideas, at least for now: charging nonelites to check luggage and making them pay for soft drinks. ''Any changes we make need to increase the value of our frequent flier program -- not downgrade the flying experience for nonelites,'' said Travis Christ, a vice president of marketing at US Airways.
 American Airlines has also been reluctant to join other airlines in cutting services to nonelite passengers. Although it offers separate security lines for frequent fliers, it maintains a single economy-class cabin. It recently tested -- but then abandoned -- a plan to charge passengers for soft drinks on American Eagle, its regional carrier. ''You want to take care of your good customers first, but you have to strike a balance,'' said Billy Sanez, a spokesman for the airline. ''You have to be fair to both.''
 Still, experts on loyalty programs believe more changes are inevitable. Not only do the changes generate income for airline, but they also encourage passengers to sign up for a frequent flier program and stay loyal to a carrier, said Hal Brierley, the president and chief executive of Brierley & Partners, a loyalty program design firm based in Dallas. 
 ''The airlines are finding that at least some passengers will pay a bit extra for added comfort, like more leg room or an exit row seat,'' he said. ''Letting loyal frequent fliers enjoy that comfort for free is one more way carriers like Northwest and United are rewarding their frequent travelers, and creating an opportunity cost for those who do not remain loyal.''
 Being a frequent flier may not always be enough, though. Richard Wong, a lawyer in Washington who is a United and American frequent flier, said there was a pecking order among elites to get perks that used to be available to anyone. Often, on fuller flights, even the lower-level elites are shut out of the desirable economy-class seats.
 ''You don't just have to be a frequent flier to get a better seat assignment,'' he said. ''You have to be a high-level elite. Otherwise, you could be stuck in the back of the plane.''

HEADLINE: Chile Proposes to Reform Pension System

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Responding to growing complaints that the privatized pension system here is failing to deliver adequate benefits, the Chilean government has recommended that it be supplanted by a system in which the state would play a much larger role. The current system is a favorite of free-enterprise enthusiasts, including President Bush.
 The changes, part of a reform package scheduled to go to Congress early next year, include a guaranteed minimum pension for the country's poorest citizens, even those who have never contributed to the private system. 
The proposal also contains measures meant to stimulate competition, reducing the high costs to contributors and the extraordinarily high profits for pension fund administrators that analysts blame for some of the current problems.
 ''This is a radical reform, because it moves us from a system based solely on individual savings to one that includes a pillar of solidarity based on one's rights as a citizen, and not contributions,'' Labor Minister Osvaldo Andrade told reporters when the plan was announced on Dec. 15. ''We are integrating systems that are fundamentally different.''
 Social Security in the United States, like national pension systems in many countries, is based on a pay-as-you-go arrangement in which workers, employers and the government all contribute. Under the Chilean system, in contrast, workers are required to pay 10 percent of their salaries into private investment accounts that they control; employers do not participate, and the state's contribution has been reduced. 
 In recent years, that pioneering privatized system has been emulated by a score of other countries and praised by leaders of many others. Mr. Bush, for example, proposed using the Chilean model as the basis for a reshaping of Social Security, calling the system here ''a great example'' and saying the United States could ''take some lessons from Chile.''
 But dissatisfaction with the inability of the system to provide the benefits promised when Gen. Augusto Pinochet imposed it in 1981 has been rising, and became an issue in this year's presidential campaign. 
 As things now stand, about half the Chileans in the labor force will not qualify for a pension or will receive only a minimum payment, for a variety of reasons that include their not having paid into the system for the minimum 20 years.
 ''There are a whole set of problems, strongly linked to a system that had certain presuppositions that have not come true,'' President Michelle Bachelet said in an interview in June. ''People retire and find that they are entitled to a pension that is between 30 and 50 percent of their wages, and not the 70 percent they were promised'' when the Pinochet dictatorship eliminated the previous system.
 The Association of Pension Fund Administrators, which represents the six companies in the industry, did not respond to requests for an interview with its director, Guillermo Arthur. But he and other advocates of the current system have criticized several aspects of the proposed reforms, saying they might be unconstitutional and would limit contributors' freedom of choice and reduce profitability.
 Proponents of the current system maintain that it delivers an average 10 percent annual return on investment. But a commission Ms. Bachelet appointed to recommend changes disagrees with that assessment, saying that ''more realistic estimates'' of the net return to contributors are roughly half what the industry claims.
 In hopes of stimulating competition, the reform plan would let banks and insurance companies form pension funds. The six existing funds, down from a peak of more than 20, object. They appear especially fearful that the state bank will jump into a business that has yielded them a return on assets of as much as 50 percent annually.
 Ricardo Hormazabal, who leads a pension research group at the University of Chile, said getting a state administrator involved ''would provoke a substantial drop in commissions to pension funds,'' which according to some studies run as high as one-third of workers' total contributions.
 For similar reasons the pension fund lobby opposes the government's plan to ''take all new entrants and bundle them'' as Finance Minister Andres Velasco put it, into a single group whose contributions would initially go to the fund that offered them the best deal. 
 ''The idea is simple,'' Mr. Velasco said in an interview. ''The more competition there is in that market, the lower the cost to users.''
 Advocates of the current system have criticized the government's proposed minimum pension, about $143 a month, as too generous. They argue that so large a guaranteed payment amounts to ''a disincentive to contribute'' to the private accounts, in the words of Rossana Costa, an economist at the conservative Institute for Liberty and Development here.
 The government proposal also contemplates a voluntary role for employers, who would receive a tax credit if they contributed.
 Fulfilling one of Ms. Bachelet's campaign promises, the reform package calls for pensions for women who have never worked in the official labor market, including a bonus payment for each child they bear. Special incentives are also to be included to encourage young workers to participate in the private system instead of evading their contributions, as many now do.
 ''These are all significant advances that add up to a change of model,'' said Jaime Ruiz-Tagle, an economist who has written extensively on pension issues and was a member of the government's reform commission. ''The legitimacy of and the confidence in the system will be enhanced, and that's no small thing.''

HEADLINE: Diabetics in the Workplace Confront a Tangle of Laws

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS 

 BODY:
John Steigauf spent more than a decade fiddling with the innards of those huge United Parcel Service trucks until an icy day two years ago when the company put him on leave from his mechanic's job. A supervisor escorted him off the premises.
 His work was good. He hadn't socked the boss or embezzled money. It had to do with what was inside him: diabetes.
U.P.S. framed it as a safety issue: Mr. Steigauf's blood sugar might suddenly plummet while he tested a truck, causing him to slam into someone.
 Mr. Steigauf considered it discrimination, a taint that diabetes can carry. ''I was regarded as a damaged piece of meat,'' he said. ''It was like, 'You're one of those, and we can't have one of those.' '' 
 With 21 million American diabetics, disputes like this have increasingly rippled through the workplace:
 A mortgage loan officer in Oregon was denied permission to eat at her desk to stanch her sugar fluctuations, and eventually was fired.
 A Sears lingerie saleswoman in Illinois with nerve damage in her leg quit after being told she could not cut through a stockroom to reach her department.
 A worker at a candy company in Wisconsin was fired after asking where he could dispose of his insulin needles. 
 In each instance, diabetics contend that they are being blocked by their employers from the near-normal lives their doctors say are possible. But the companies say they are struggling, too, with confusion about whether diabetes is a legitimate disability and with concern about whether it is overly expensive, hazardous and disruptive to accommodate the illness.
 The debate will probably intensify. The number of diabetics in America swelled by 80 percent in the past decade. Experts say the disease is on its way to becoming a conspicuous fact of life in the nation's labor force, raising all sorts of issues for workers and managers.
 Even an outspoken advocate for diabetics like Fran Carpentier, a Type 1 diabetic and a senior editor at Parade magazine, understands the implications for business. ''Knowing what it's like to live with the disease hour by hour, day by day, I wonder if I owned my own company if I would hire someone with diabetes,'' she said. ''I'm being bluntly honest. And it kills me to say this.''
 Doctors, though, say that with improved medications and methods of self-testing blood sugar, most diabetics can do almost any job if they properly manage their illness. Yet myths about the disease persist, advocates say, leading many companies to shun diabetic employees.
 ''It's not all about ignorance, but if I can get rid of ignorance, I can get rid of a lot of discrimination,'' said Shereen Arent, the director of legal advocacy for the American Diabetes Association.
 Part of the confusion is a byproduct of the disease itself, a capricious illness of elevated, damaging levels of sugar in the blood. Type 1 is a malfunction of the immune system that usually appears in childhood, while the far more prevalent Type 2 is closely associated with obesity and inactivity. Many people with diabetes will face withering complications like blindness, amputations and heart disease. Others will not.
 For some, particularly insulin users prone to the abnormal drops in blood sugar known as hypoglycemia, the illness can cause dizziness, fainting or muddled judgment. Doctors, however, say those constitute a tiny number of readily identifiable cases. 
 Nonetheless, the risk of plunging blood sugars has fueled a longstanding reluctance to employ diabetics in jobs like those of truck driver or police officer, if they are on insulin. Until this summer, the National Fire Protection Association cautioned against making it too easy for even non-insulin-dependent diabetics to become firefighters. Now the association recommends an individual assessment. 
 Federal law bars diabetics from joining the armed services and prevents diabetics on insulin from becoming commercial pilots.
 Innumerable diabetics, though, are engaged in more mundane jobs uninvolved in matters of life and death. For these people, secretaries and factory workers and programmers, a ''reasonable accommodation,'' like permission to eat at one's desk or to be excused from fluctuating shifts, can make the difference in whether they can function.
 When disputes can't be resolved, the cases often land in court or before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The commission, which enforces the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, says diabetes-related complaints have been on the rise, one of the few conditions generally showing an increase in complaints. Diabetes accounts for nearly 5 percent of the 15,000 annual allegations that the commission gets under that act, trailing only back impairment, other orthopedic injuries and depression.
 Often the courts are of scant help in bringing clarity. Mr. Steigauf has spent two years trying to thread his way through the disability discrimination law. The federal law can be fuzzy, for it mentions no illness or handicap by name but supplies a legal test under which plaintiffs must usually demonstrate that a ''major life activity,'' like walking or vision, is ''substantially limited.''
 This is easy enough for anyone who has lost sight or a limb. But the restrictions of diabetes are often invisible. Diabetics thus can find themselves teetering on a balance beam, needing to prove they are disabled enough to fit under the law but not so impaired that they can't do a job.
 Judges in nearly identical cases have ruled in completely opposite ways, leaving diabetics bewildered and businesses unsure what, if anything, they should do. While some courts, for example, have held that the eating restrictions diabetics face satisfy the substantial limitation, others have disagreed.
 ''Usually the battle is over that word, 'substantially,' '' said Craig A. Crispin, an Oregon employment lawyer. ''If you say the person is disabled because of the impact on eating, the other side will say: 'Hey, look, she's eating a sandwich. Where's the disability?' ''

Seeking Accommodations
 The quarrels are as varied as working life: a musician rejected for a cruise ship's cabaret band, baggage handlers and plane cleaners fired by an airline, a blackjack dealer dismissed by a casino.
 The American Diabetes Association fields about 100 calls a month about workplace tussles like these. Many of them revolve around accommodations, though the changes sought tend to be modest: predictable hours, a place to test blood, freedom to snack when sugars get unbalanced.
 Companies often cite workplace safety as their paramount concern, though there is little hard evidence to suggest that diabetics are a risk.
 In one case in 2002, ConAgra Foods withdrew a job offer to Rudy Rodriguez at a Texas baked bean plant after a physical suggested that his Type 2 diabetes was so out of control that he was a hazard. Mr. Rodriguez had performed fine as an interim laborer, but the examining doctor declared there was nowhere he could safely work ''outside of a padded room where he could even then fall and break his neck from dizziness or fainting.'' 
 An appeals court found otherwise and held that ConAgra had violated the law. The case was settled, and Mr. Rodriguez now works for a printer.
 ''Some people who have a problem with hypoglycemia should not be doing public safety-type jobs,'' said John W. Griffin Jr., a lawyer from Texas with Type 2 diabetes who handles discrimination cases. ''But I guarantee you that that baked bean factory was not public safety.''
 There has been other progress for diabetics: the San Antonio Police Department's barring of diabetics on insulin was struck down. Insulin-using diabetics in good control of their illness can get private pilot's licenses.
 In the lingerie saleswoman's case, Sears agreed to a consent decree awarding the woman $150,000 and stipulating that the store train supervisors about disability discrimination.
 Employers, however, prevail in a vast majority of cases (many are settled). It is hard even to get lawyers to pursue complaints since prejudice is tricky to prove. Establishing discrimination has become harder since 1999, when the Supreme Court held that if a disability can be corrected with medicine or things like prostheses, it is not necessarily protected. Advocates for the disabled say the ruling warped the intent of Congress. 
 Ruth Colker, a law professor at Ohio State University who studies disability discrimination, said that very few working people with diabetes now find themselves guarded by the law. 
 Judges, in fact, have deemed these diabetics not disabled: a Maine store manager who had trouble walking because of poor circulation, and a New York security guard without vision in one eye and declining vision in the other who had four episodes of hypoglycemia in two years.
 In some instances, employers have said they took action against an employee because of diabetes, but the court still found that the worker was not disabled and threw out the case. 
 ''There's not a remedy for every wrong,'' said David A. Copus, a lawyer who represents employers and specializes in disability issues. ''There are employers who don't like ugly people. They're not protected by the law.''
 Mr. Copus said he was not unsympathetic. His father had diabetes; it was very debilitating.
 Wary of bad outcomes, many diabetics conceal their illness on the job. Brian T. McMahon, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies workplace discrimination, said: ''You get to the question of whether or not to disclose you have diabetes. Most people opt not to, for they fear: Am I inviting more trouble?''

Figuring Employer Costs
 There was a time, four or five decades ago, when you wouldn't find one diabetic on the entire floor of a factory. Now, Type 2 diabetics are commonplace. It is not only the ascendancy of the disease, but also the fact that a condition once considered a corollary to old age is striking people sooner, catching them long before retirement. And this comes as companies are already struggling to balance productivity in the workplace with soaring medical costs.
 To understand the brutal math of diabetes, all a business has to do is consult the Web site diabetesatwork.org, set up by the government to furnish advice on addressing diabetes in the workplace. One of its tools is a calculator that uses rough assumptions to suggest what costs might be involved.
 Businesses plug in the number of employees, the tally is multiplied by 8.2 percent (a slightly dated national prevalence rate for diabetes), then that figure is multiplied by $13,243, an estimate for yearly medical costs of a diabetic. Voila: the price tag of diabetes. It is a burden more than five times that of workers without diabetes.
 Ron Z. Goetzel, a vice president for Thomson Medstat, which analyzes health care costs for businesses, said that if absenteeism and productivity losses are added, diabetes ranks third among major conditions as an economic cost to employers, after heart disease and hypertension.
 Companies have only started to reckon with this, and with the disease's ancillary concerns. Even if advocates say safety is rarely a factor, companies argue they cannot take chances with some types of workers, like school bus drivers or even pizza deliverers. 
 Concessions may seem small -- for example, granting a bank teller more frequent breaks -- but many employers contend that if rules bend for one person, then that breeds resentment among other employees. Co-workers cannot see the diabetes, and if an employer gives preferential treatment to a diabetic worker, it cannot legally tell other workers it is because of the diabetes. Companies feel that indulging all diabetics trivializes the meaning of disability and of fairness.
 ''It comes down to how many extra points do I give you,'' said William J. Kilberg, a Washington employment lawyer. ''Why is everybody a victim?''
 He said too many people who are not disabled demand special favors. ''I mean, I wear eyeglasses,'' he said.
 In addition to the threat of a suit under federal or state disability law, businesses must grapple with the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires them to grant unpaid leave to ill workers. That can create scheduling difficulties.
 ''This whole area gets complicated, because the medical leave act can mean employees absent from the workplace for extended periods,'' said Stephen A. Bokat, general counsel for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''That bothers employers even more than an employee needing a half-hour during the day to administer some insulin.''
 Health care consultants urge companies to become proactive, try to use tools like wellness programs to forestall diabetes' claim on their workers and install disease management programs to improve existing cases. And many do. Companies dangle $100 incentives (though more often a mug or a T-shirt) if an employee submits to a health assessment or accepts a phone call from a health coach. 
 But getting participation is hard. And the economic worth of these undertakings to a business is difficult to gauge with a progressive disease like diabetes. Sometimes the evident benefits of in-house health programs are years down the road, when an employee a business invested in may well be working elsewhere.

When Safety Comes First
 John Steigauf's fellow mechanics called him ''Flunky.'' The name caught on after Mr. Steigauf gave advice to a prickly supervisor, who thundered, ''I'm not going to let some flunky mechanic tell me how to do my job.'' Mr. Steigauf, 47, wanted it embroidered onto his uniform. Supervisors said forget it. 
 He joined United Parcel in Minneapolis in 1991, turning wrenches from the start. Five years ago, he learned that he had Type 2 diabetes. Though it often goes with being overweight, he had a wide receiver's build: 6-foot-2, 193 pounds. But his mother had diabetes. 
 He was put on pills and watched his diet, abandoning his cherished hot chocolate. Yet his blood sugar remained high. If it didn't drop, he would need insulin. That sent fear pumping through him.
 U.P.S. requires mechanics, like its interstate drivers, to hold a commercial driver's license and to be cleared to drive out of state so they can road-test trucks. In reality, mechanics could go weeks without leaving the yard, but those were the rules. And at the time, federal officials did not grant interstate licenses to insulin-using diabetics.
 They did dispense a few exemptions. But Mr. Steigauf, who started using insulin only in 2004, stood no chance. The requirement was to have driven safely while on insulin for three years.
 So Mr. Steigauf tried starving himself, slicing off 30 pounds. It made him crabby, fatigued and so thin ''that if I stuck my tongue out, I looked like a zipper.''
 His blood sugars did not budge. But after he took insulin, his diabetes settled down almost at once.
 Later in 2004, he had to have a physical to renew his commercial license, a test he could no longer pass. Minnesota did not have the three-year rule, and since he had never had a hypoglycemic episode or other problems, Mr. Steigauf got an exemption to drive within the state. Given that he didn't even leave the county while road-testing trucks, he hoped that would be good enough.
 It wasn't. For consistency, U.P.S. wanted all its mechanics to be certified to drive from state to state, whether they needed to or not. So Mr. Steigauf was sent home on disability, even though he felt fine.
 Norman Black, a U.P.S. spokesman, said the company had always intended to find Mr. Steigauf another position. He said the company did not discriminate but was passionate about safety.
 Studies tracking accident rates of diabetics are inconclusive; some indicate worse outcomes, others don't. But either way, Mr. Steigauf's direct supervisor at the time, Dan Welke, said he thought the company had gone too far, that somebody else could road-test the trucks repaired by Mr. Steigauf.
 ''It just seemed ridiculous,'' Mr. Welke said.
 Mr. Steigauf also had trouble making sense of this. When his diabetes raged out of control, it had been all right to fix trucks. Now, with the illness under control, it wasn't.
 When he spoke to someone in human resources, Mr. Steigauf said he was told that he would never come back. The notion that he was a human tinderbox punctuated his interactions. ''I'd be told that I could pull a tractor up to a fuel pump and pass out and the thing would explode,'' he said. ''I was like a grenade and was going to kill people.''
 At home in Bloomington, Minn., where Mr. Steigauf's tidy ranch is bordered by a soupcon of lawn, he, his wife, Dawn, their twin daughters and their severely autistic son struggled on a weekly disability check of $431, about half his old pay.
 To keep going, he did odd jobs. Friends at U.P.S. dug into their pockets. The family cut one another's hair and skipped sending Christmas cards.
 Finally, Mr. Steigauf asked U.P.S. to excuse him from interstate driving as a ''reasonable accommodation'' under disability law. After all, he had left the state for U.P.S. only once in 13 years. Some of his colleagues, he found out, did not even have commercial driver's licenses.
 But U.P.S. refused, saying he was not disabled under discrimination law, and thus not entitled to an accommodation.
 So, in early 2005, he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and waited, interned in his house, as if he had evaporated -- all the while collecting disability from a company that said he was not disabled.
 After seven months, U.P.S. offered him a lower-paying job, fixing trailers. He could not touch an engine or drive. But he took it while he battled for his former position.
 Then he had some luck. Federal officials changed their rules on interstate licenses and Mr. Steigauf qualified for a waiver, allowing him to return to his old job. He is expected to start within a month or so.
 This fall, the E.E.O.C. concluded that he had been discriminated against and that U.P.S. owed him relief. U.P.S. said it would contest the decision.
 Mr. Steigauf is still bitter, not toward U.P.S. itself, but toward the way he believes it treats diabetics. Even now, he feels singled out.
 ''I've had unloaders at work say to me, 'Are you that diabetic guy?' '' he said. ''I don't know what they mean. Nothing? Or, 'You shouldn't be working here'?''
 To keep his exemption, he must obey a complicated protocol to show the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration that he remains fit. Every three months, he has to report how much he drives and his sugar levels. If he has an accident, even if someone rams his car while he's in a movie, he has two days to alert the government. He has seven days to let the government know if he has a new car or a new phone number. 
 ''The exemption adds to the discrimination,'' he said one afternoon at home. ''It constantly reminds me that I'm different.''
 His children skittered through the room.
 ''You become a show dog,'' he said. ''I fix engines. I don't want to be a show dog.''

 Articles in this series are exploring the widening impact of the Type 2 diabetes epidemic.

HEADLINE: Nanny Hunt Can Be a 'Slap in the Face' for Blacks

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
Last month, Jennifer Freeman sat in a Chicago coffee bar, counting her blessings and considering her problem. She had a husband with an M.B.A. degree, two children and a job offer that would let her dig out the education degree she had stashed away during years of playdates and potty training.
 But she could not accept the job. After weeks of searching, Ms. Freeman, who is African-American, still could not find a nanny for her son, 5, and daughter, 3. Agency after agency told her they had no one to send to her South Side home.
As more blacks move up the economic ladder, one fixture -- some would say necessity -- of the upper-middle-class income bracket often eludes them. Like hailing a cab in Midtown Manhattan, searching for a nanny can be an exasperating, humiliating exercise for many blacks, the kind of ordeal that makes them wonder aloud what year it is. 
 ''We've attained whatever level society says is successful, we're included at work, but when we need the support for our children and we can afford it, why do we get treated this way?'' asked Tanisha Jackson, an African-American mother of three in a Washington suburb, who searched on and off for five years before hiring a nanny. ''It's a slap in the face.''
 Numerous black parents successfully employ nannies, and many sitters say they pay no regard to race. But interviews with dozens of nannies and agencies that employ them in Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Houston turned up many nannies -- often of African-American or Caribbean descent themselves -- who avoid working for families of those backgrounds. Their reasons included accusations of low pay and extra work, fears that employers would look down at them, and suspicion that any neighborhood inhabited by blacks had to be unsafe.
 The result is that many black parents do not have the same child care options as their colleagues and neighbors. They must settle for illegal immigrants or non-English speakers instead of more experienced or credentialed nannies, rely on day care or scale back their professional aspirations to spend more time at home.
 ''Very rarely will an African-American woman work for an African-American boss,'' said Pat Cascio, the owner of Morningside Nannies in Houston and the president of the International Nanny Association. 
 Many of the African-American nannies who make up 40 percent of her work force fear that people of their own color will be ''uppity and demanding,'' said Ms. Cascio, who is white. After interviews, she said, those nannies ''will call us and say, 'Why didn't you tell me' '' the family is black? 
 In several cities, nanny agencies decline to serve certain geographic areas -- not because of redlining, these agencies say, but because the nannies, who decide which jobs to take, do not want to work there. ''I can't service everyone,'' said Maria Christopoulos-Katris, owner of Nanny Boutique, an agency that turned down Ms. Freeman's request, even though it claims to cater to the city of Chicago. ''I don't discriminate.'' 
 Ms. Freeman finally found a friend, another black mother, to watch her children.
 Similarly, Ms. Jackson was told by some of the best-known nanny agencies in Washington that they did not serve Prince George's County, Md., a largely black area bordering the District of Columbia. 
 ''We have problems getting people to certain areas because of logistics,'' said Barbara Kline, the owner of White House Nannies, which Ms. Jackson contacted. ''I'm always worried people will interpret it the wrong way.'' She added, ''Nannies like to go where other nannies go or where their previous jobs were.'' Ms. Jackson noted that White House Nannies served other suburbs, and that a bus stopped just minutes from her house. 
 Agencies represent only a small slice of nannies; most work through informal arrangements, further out of reach of civil rights and labor laws. (Because so many nannies are illegal, no one can say with certainty how many work in this country, let alone work for black families.) 
 In visits, telephone calls and e-mail exchanges across the country, nannies of all colors spoke of parents in sweeping ethnic generalizations: the Jews this, the Indians that. Viola Waszkiewicz, a white sitter in Chicago, has cared for black children, but explained that many fellow Eastern European nannies would not. 
 ''We come here, and we watch TV and the news, and all we see is black people who got hurt, got murdered,'' she said. Most of the nannies she knows ''think all black people are bad,'' she said. ''They're afraid to go to black neighborhoods.''
 Pamela Potischman, a social worker in Brooklyn who specializes in parent-nanny relationships, said, ''You rely on what's familiar, so you're going to rely on these vast generalizations to be self-protective.'' She added, ''The nannies talk, and they say, 'This is what's O.K. and what to watch out for.' '' 
 This summer, Tomasina and Eric Boone of Brooklyn sought a nanny for their baby girl because their jobs -- she is the advertising beauty director for Essence magazine, he is a lawyer at Milbank Tweed -- require evening hours. After a Manhattan agency did not return Ms. Boone's call, they searched on their own, and sat through one stomach-curdling interview after another. 
 One sitter, a Caribbean woman living in Bedford-Stuyvesant, asked about the ''colored'' people in the Boones' neighborhood, Clinton Hill. A Russian sitter said enthusiastically that although she had never cared for a black child, she could in this case, because little Emerie Boone, now 7 months old, was light-skinned. All sitters expressed surprise that a black couple could afford a four-story brownstone. 
 ''There were points where I got so frustrated that I picked up my child and I said, 'Tomasina will show you out,' '' said Mr. Boone, who is African-American and serves on the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
 The Boones now use day care. It is inconvenient -- the center closes at 6, often forcing Mr. Boone to race to Brooklyn and then back to his Midtown office. But ''there is no way we're doing the whole nanny thing again,'' said Ms. Boone, who is African-American and Puerto Rican. 
 Mr. Boone said, ''To have someone refer to other black people as 'colored,' what does that teach your child about race?'' 
 Like Ms. Freeman in Chicago and Ms. Jackson in Maryland, the Boones worry that nanny troubles could limit their professional advancement. In earlier generations, Ms. Jackson said, ''We were the nannies.'' Now, blacks ''want to have it all,'' working and raising children. ''But to have it all you need help,'' she said. 
 And that means qualified help. ''How can you do a background check when someone doesn't have a driver's license?'' Ms. Jackson said. ''I'm not going to take this nanny just because she's the only one I can get.''
 In an exception to the usual stroller parade of black sitters with white children, some white nannies do care for black children -- and experience slights because of it. Margaret Kop, a Polish sitter in Chicago, said that on a recent playground visit, ''one of the other nannies asked me, 'Where did you find that monkey?' '' On the way home, Ms. Kop cried, stung by the insult to the child she loved. 
 Some black sitters, both Caribbean and African-American, said they flat out refused to work for families of those backgrounds, accusing them of demanding more and paying less. 
 ''It seems like our own color looks down on us and takes advantage of us,'' said Pansy Scott, a Jamaican immigrant in Brooklyn, basing her conclusions on working for a single black family years ago. Ai-Jen Poo, lead organizer for Domestic Workers United, a labor group, said, ''Domestic employees are at the whim of their employers,'' good or bad. ''If they happen to run into an employer who for whatever reason is not respecting their rights,'' she said, they may draw wildly broad conclusions. 
 The problem may be as much about class as race, said Kimberly McClain DaCosta, a Harvard sociologist who is researching how blacks care for family members. For nannies, working for an employer of the same background or skin color ''highlights their lower economic status,'' she said, but ''the fact that their employers are black just makes that more intense.''
 Many black families say they seek only a sitter who is reliable and loving. But some do have race-based preferences themselves. African-American professionals, who constantly battle the stereotype that blacks do not speak proper English, sometimes hesitate to hire Caribbean nannies who speak with lilting accents or island patois, said Cameron L. Macdonald, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
 These parents want their children ''socialized into what it's like to be black in a racist society, but they also want their children to be socialized into being middle class. That's hard for one person to do,'' said Ms. Macdonald, who is white. 
 Ms. DaCosta is an African-American parent herself. She and her husband, who is Caribbean, have successfully employed several nannies for their three children. Still, the hiring process has been tricky. They preferred a black sitter, who would instantly understand matters like how to do their daughter's hair. At one point, Ms. DaCosta scouted playgrounds, so she could spy on nannies' skin color as well as behavior; another time, she placed a race-neutral ad, and hid by the window as the prospective nannies drove up, sighing with relief when a black one appeared. 
 Ms. DaCosta and her husband now use au pairs, checking the photos on their applications and announcing their own race at the start of the phone interview. ''We don't want any surprises,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, Some Hope Of Taking Back the Projects

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
The heritage of suspicion and misery separating this city's poorest residents from its comfortable classes is playing out in a fierce battle over the future of the public housing projects here, a fight in which the shelter of as many as 20,000 people is at stake.
 It has raged ever since the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development announced plans last June to demolish four of the largest projects in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and no amount of assurances that the agency wants to replace the crime-haunted, aging brick structures with something better has calmed the anger of former tenants.
 This month, under pressure, HUD restated that it might allow some tenants to return while proceeding with redevelopment; a face-off in Federal District Court here Friday between tenant advocates and department lawyers could be decisive. 
 The struggle over housing in New Orleans raises the larger issue of how to reintegrate the most vulnerable residents after the hurricane, the ones most disrupted by the storm and still displaced 16 months later. 
 And it has brought sharply into focus how much the New Orleans housing projects were places apart, vast islands of poverty in an already impoverished city. HUD has already chosen two nonprofit developers to replace the Lafitte project, a forbidding complex of 1940s reddish brick dormitories near Interstate 10, with a mix of houses and apartments, some subsidized and some not. The new housing will ''dramatically improve living conditions'' for the former tenants, a legal brief by the department says.
 The agency's plans and the resistance of the tenants has become a cause celebre for advocates of many stripes. They shouted down hapless housing officials at a tumultuous public meeting here last month; they demonstrated angrily outside Mayor C. Ray Nagin's home two weekends ago; and the courtroom vituperation, in the lawsuit against HUD, has been unusually bitter.
 Still, the advocates' talk of ethnic cleansing, social engineering and HUD's purported ''violation'' of international law has partly obscured the reality of what the projects were and what even some who question the planned demolition fear they could become again if the redevelopment project falls through.
 ''I think the romanticism that goes with the 'good old days of public housing' belies the harsh realities of crime and social malaise that had been created as a result of a concentration of low, low income folks,'' said Michael P. Kelly, who directed the troubled Housing Authority of New Orleans from 1995 to 2000 and now runs its counterpart in Washington, D.C. ''Women that would put their babies in bathtubs at the sound of gunfire, that was a reality; coming home from your job and having to walk through young people participating in drug trades.''
 Working women trying to raise children, many of whom staff the low-wage tourist hotels here, often made that walk, as they do in public housing in other cities. But here the journey had a particularly tough edge, in keeping with the often violent city surrounding the projects.
 The toughness was underscored in striking fashion at last month's public meeting, notably by one of the many enraged former tenants who rose to criticize the federal housing department and the city housing authority.
 ''I'm a young man who grew up in the projects,'' said that critic, Alvin Richardson. ''I grew up in the Iberville project, the Desire, the Calliope, the St. Thomas, St. Bernard, and I survived them all. You can't do nothing to me because I survived the ghetto.''
 The peculiar physical environment of the projects, a confluence of their isolation, their dilapidation and the large numbers of vacant apartments, combined to create difficulties, some veteran police officers say. It was not the tenants who created problems, but nonresidents taking advantage of the dense clustering of small, low-ceilinged apartments.
 ''The way they were constructed, it's not law-enforcement friendly,'' said Lt. Bruce Adams, a veteran police officer who grew up in the Desire project. ''All those entrances and exists. The fact that it's so condensed is causing the problem.'' 
 Don Everard, director of a social service agency that worked for years in one of the projects, said that with all the vacancies, ''you didn't know what was up the stairwell.''
 ''You didn't know who was using an abandoned apartment,'' Mr. Everard said.
 Since August there have been at least five killings in the old Iberville project, abutting the French Quarter, even though the complex is only about one-quarter occupied. In the latest, a young man was found shot in the head, propping up the door of an abandoned apartment with a bag of crack cocaine at his feet.
 At the St. Thomas project, the violent crime rate was more than seven times as high as the city's as a whole, according to a paper done at the London School of Economics; only 2 percent of its residents were employed full-time. 
 At the C. J. Peete project, which is on the department's demolition list, Lawrence Powell, a Tulane University historian, recalled a flourishing open-air drug market across the street. 
 Bernell Stewart, a nearby resident standing across from the empty Lafitte project, said, ''Every time you looked around, somebody was getting killed on this corner.''
 Even those critical of the housing department acknowledge that the projects, with all their troubles, had effectively cut off their inhabitants, an isolation reinforced by generations of living in them. Mr. Powell, who ran a social services agency at C. J. Peete in the 1990s, said he tried to ''help people move out where they would become homeowners, to move back to the original goal where it was a way station, not warehouses.''
 That alienation was starkly in evidence at the public meeting last month. ''For once, I would like for us to live in y'all's houses and let y'all live in ours,'' Josey Willis, a displaced Lafitte resident, told the officials. ''Let us change places and see what we feeling; then you can feel what we feeling.'' 
 Other cities have seen similar resistance from public housing tenants fearful of change. But here the tenants' extreme poverty and a legacy of mistrust fueled by years of official neglect has given the fight an edge. Misspent money caused the federal department to keep a close watch over the local housing authority in the mid-1990s, and the department finally took it over in 2002. The projects here were in such poor shape that ''a lot of us said it shouldn't even be considered affordable housing,'' said Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution, who served as chief of staff for former Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros.
 This city's politicians have been notably silent on the issue but have occasionally suggested that they, too, are wary of a return to the old days. ''We don't need soap-opera watchers right now,'' President Oliver Thomas of the City Council said last February, commenting on the lives of displaced public housing residents.
 The department's goal is to deconcentrate the poor, in concert with the philosophy that developed during the early 1990s calling for redeveloping public housing as ''mixed income'' communities. The best-known example here, the redevelopment of St. Thomas after its demolition in 2000, is still a subject of fierce controversy, a mix of successes and shortcomings that has fueled suspicions.
 The pleasant streets of pastel-colored houses that replaced the grim St. Thomas buildings have put life back into a Lower Garden District neighborhood that for years was fearful and moribund. 
 On the other hand, the new development has accommodated less than one in five of the old St. Thomas families, though the developer says expansion will add more. And those that are there feel threatened by tenant rules designed to make the neighborhood's market-rate inhabitants comfortable, including occupancy restrictions, Mr. Everard said. 
 ''Folks got cheated out of their dream,'' Mr. Everard said. ''The whole concept of the mixed-income community ended up dislocating the vast majority of poor people.''
 Yet a return to the old days is an outcome that even some former tenants do not embrace. 
 ''If they're talking about redevelopment, I'm for it,'' Natasha Dixon said at the meeting last month. ''But why can't y'all do it in phases? Why can't that happen now, to get the people home?''

HEADLINE: Starting Fresh in a New Home

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
There is no Christmas in New York. There are Christmases. How, after all, could it be possible to contain within a word the vastly different variations that the city mounts each year? 
 From the quiet pleasures of a working-class family opening presents in the Bronx to a father and son in matching bow ties taking holy communion on the Upper East Side, Christmas is a mirror and a lodestar for the city, reflecting its diversity and affirming its separate parts.
There are tourists looking at the Rockefeller Center tree and Jews looking for a decent Chinese meal. And there is a homeless man looking for something as simple -- and as difficult to find -- as a gift. 
 Here are a few scenes from these Christmases, a day that, at least in New York, makes sense only in the plural.

 The two girls opened their presents in a pajama-clad frenzy. Jade, 10, wrapped her arms around Winnie the Pooh. Veronica, 7, carefully arranged her new Bratz dolls inside a silver toy convertible.
 The girls' parents, Javier and Victoria Perez, had gifts waiting for them under the tree as well, but they were in no rush. They had, in a sense, opened their Christmas gift on Dec. 13, when they opened the door of their new apartment and moved in.
 ''That's worth more than a million bucks to me,'' said Mr. Perez, 44. 
 This was Christmas in the South Bronx, in the poorest Congressional district in the country, where happiness can be as simple as an affordable rent.
 For about 10 years, the Perez family lived in a one-bedroom apartment near Yankee Stadium. The girls slept in bunk beds at one end of the bedroom, the parents in a bed at the other end. The kitchen had one cabinet. 
 In 2002, Mr. Perez was laid off from his office job at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 He enrolled at City College and landed a part-time job in the admissions office there. Mrs. Perez worked in customer service at a Macy's facility in New Jersey. They needed to go on welfare to make ends meet. 
 Lately, though, things seem to have taken a turn for the better: The Perezes qualified for a two-bedroom apartment in a new housing complex for low-income residents on East 163rd Street, at the edge of Morrisania, with rent of $720 a month.
 Mr. Perez expects to graduate in the spring with a bachelor's degree in Latin American studies, and had an interview recently for a full-time job in city government. ''Everything is coming into place,'' he said. 
 On Christmas morning in Apartment 2G, Mr. Perez sat on the sofa watching Latin singers on television. Mrs. Perez, 39, was in the kitchen, scrambling eggs with one eye on the oven, where she was roasting pernil, pork shoulder. 
 Jade and Veronica sat on the hardwood floor, ripping, pulling and cutting at gifts, many of them provided by an after-school program run by the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, a Bronx nonprofit.
 It was hard to tell who was more excited: the girls, or their father. Mr. Perez loves Christmas. Last year, he dressed up as Santa Claus for the after-school program's holiday party. Two days after they moved into the new apartment, he bought a Christmas tree -- a real one, not a fake one like they had at their other place. MANNY FERNANDEZ

HEADLINE: Temporary Roadway for Cars May Be Transformed Into Permanent Refuge From Them

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A temporary detour route on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive that extends 25 feet over the East River would be remodeled into a waterfront park under a plan being studied by the Bloomberg administration.
 The Outboard Detour Roadway, completed in 2004 from roughly 54th to 63rd Street while that section of the drive was being refurbished, had been scheduled to be dismantled last month. Now, though, city officials are pressing to use the abandoned 2,500-foot strip of roadway to extend the esplanade around Manhattan to a portion of waterfront currently inaccessible to pedestrians and cyclists.
The plan, in its very early stages, calls for demolishing all but the roadway's westernmost underwater support beams and building a new structure that would not extend as far over the river. 
 The new park would probably be at most 20 feet wide, city officials said, enough room for bicycle lanes and a narrow pedestrian walkway. Advocates say the result would be akin to the High Line park being developed out of an abandoned elevated railway line on the West Side, although it would be much smaller, and over water.
 ''It is on the water, it is already built, and we would like to have a nice bikeway, a nice walkway that would connect to the rest of the esplanade,'' said Lyle Frank, chairman of the local community board. ''This is a tremendous opportunity to do it.''
 The plan faces substantial obstacles. The Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers have expressed concern that the design would interfere with shipping traffic, and the State Department of Environmental Conservation has voiced fears that the park would disturb fish habitats because of the permanent shadow it would cast on the water.
 ''It's something we are very interested in, but a lot more work has to be done to make sure it is feasible,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''We're trying to find as many creative ways as we can to give people access to the waterfront.''
 The Bloomberg administration has made it a priority to complete an uninterrupted greenway around the waterfront of the five boroughs, particularly in Manhattan. While there is generally contiguous riverfront access along the West Side except for a stretch from approximately 81st to 91st Street, there are several significant gaps on the East River esplanade. Among them are the Consolidated Edison site from 34th to 41st Street and the United Nations headquarters at 42nd Street.
 The site of the proposed park also lacks waterfront access because the F. D. R. Drive extends to the river there. 
 When a plan to refurbish the drive was proposed in the 1990s, some residents of the adjacent neighborhood worried that vehicles seeking to avoid highway delays would clog its streets, creating noise and safety problems. 
 Because the drive, which carries about 150,000 vehicles daily, is among the city's busiest arteries, state and city officials ruled out closing a heavily used section of the highway for several years of repairs or even blocking off a few lanes at a time for weekend and night work.
 Instead, the Outboard Detour Roadway was designed. The detour, which cost $139 million in federal money, is essentially a bridge built parallel to the existing F.D.R. Drive. The section from 53rd to 60th Street alone, which is entirely over the river, cost about $40 million to construct.
 Because the detour extended so far over the river -- which at that point is particularly turbulent and only about 800 feet wide -- engineers had to figure out how to ensure that the 2,100 vessels a year that pass through that stretch of water would not strike the roadway. 
 So they designed a system of floating guardrails held in place by four anchors drilled into the bottom of the river, some as deep as 120 feet below the surface. 
 The anchors are secured to one another by a heavy chain with links that weigh more than 150 pounds each. They keep the system in place during changing tides and currents, which moved water levels up and down by as much as six feet a day during construction. For the last two years, even with that safeguard in place, large ships have been required to have tugboats help them navigate that stretch of river. 
 When the detour was completed in 2004, it won engineering awards for its innovation. 
 Now, even as sections of the detour are being dismantled to allow ship traffic unimpeded access in the river, advocates for a new esplanade are wondering whether spending the estimated $50 million it would cost to build a base for a park would make sense. 
 ''We have to decide if the structure is worth the cost,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''It is too early to give odds, but if I could give odds -- outside of cost -- based only on our desire, they'd be pretty high.''
 ''But,'' he added, ''desire is not the only factor involved.''

HEADLINE: It's Pure Greed, By Any Measure

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As an attorney working with low-income clients for almost 30 years, I found ''The Bonus Army,'' by Henry Blodget (Op-Ed, Dec. 20), more than a little interesting.
It reminded me once again that so many talented people in our society work overtime making the case for acquisition without limit in a world of widening gaps of income and wealth. Would that we had them constructing logical-sounding arguments for a more equitable society instead of rationalizing greed without limit.

Mike Carroll
Philadelphia, Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor: 
 Henry Blodget defends the multimillion-dollar bonuses at Goldman Sachs by falling back on the argument that capitalism ''is surely the worst economic system on the planet except for all the others.'' 
 But the issue is how to improve the workings of capitalism, not whether it should be replaced by another economic system.

Peter Rutland
Middletown, Conn., Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 Henry Blodget defends multimillion-dollar bonuses for Wall Streeters by saying that capitalism is great at encouraging successful risk-taking. His argument might be more persuasive if the traders who are being so extravagantly rewarded had actually taken risks with their own personal assets proportionate to their gains. In fact, all they risk is some of their time.
 When they fail, it is their shareholders and clients who suffer the financial losses, so that risk and reward are actually unlinked. This sounds to me not like a tribute to the efficiency of capitalism but a self-serving subversion of its principles. 

Allen H. Kassof
Princeton, N.J., Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 In Henry Blodget's apologia for huge Wall Street bonuses, he defends free-market capitalism's mechanism for rewarding those who ''successfully take risks, adapt to change and develop profitable opportunities.'' But surely those qualities, in and of themselves, are not worthy of praise, or society would think better of drug kingpins and war profiteers.
 Perhaps we should not demonize those top traders at Goldman Sachs who reportedly made $17,000 to $33,000 an hour this past year. But please, Mr. Blodget, don't tell us that we need to consider them heroes and role models for our children.

David C. Wrobel
Larchmont, N.Y., Dec. 20, 2006

To the Editor:
 The compensation Goldman Sachs gives to its employees at the end of the year is a turnoff, any way you look at it. Henry Blodget argues that such a bonanza is provided by the unrestrained capitalism that prevails in this country, which he promotes as the best economic system on the planet.
 I am from Sweden, a prosperous, pluralistic country where socialism and capitalism walk hand in hand, and where a liberal welfare system prevents unfortunate individuals from falling deep into poverty and hardship, while allowing talented and ambitious individuals to make themselves a fortune. Sweden consistently ranks among the top three countries in the world whether judged by level of democracy or economical competitiveness.
 I think individuals and society as a whole are far better off with an economic system that does not have a huge polarity in wealth, such as between the homeless person and the Goldman employee on Broad Street.

Peter Hook
New York, Dec. 21, 2006

To the Editor:
 Henry Blodget argues that Goldman Sachs's annual bonuses, on average $623,000 this year, are justified on the grounds that capitalism rewards risks taken.
 Depends on what risks. As a postdoctoral researcher working on the genetics of bird flu, I take an entire year to earn what Mr. Blodget informs us Goldman Sachs's top traders score in an hour.
 For those of us struggling paycheck to paycheck, the personal risks more and more of us are taking to keep Goldman Sachs employees alive and well seem less and less worth taking.

HEADLINE: Near-Death of a Salesman

BYLINE: By Bob Newhart. 
Bob Newhart is the author of ''I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This: And Other Things That Strike Me as Funny.''

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
TRADITIONALLY, the two busiest days in retail are the day after Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas, but for two very opposite reasons. One is for sales and the other for returns. But let me back up.
 In 1957, I left my job in accounting, largely because I was troubled by the illogic of spending four hours (at $6 an hour) to find a $1.68 underage in the petty cash drawer at the Glidden Company's soy division in Chicago.
I then took the logical step of devoting myself to a career in comedy, because accountants, of course, are known for their sense of humor. 
 Since I was not initially overwhelmed with offers, I needed to sustain myself with part-time employment. This included working for the Illinois State Unemployment office. Behind the counter, not in front of it. 
 It is no longer called the Illinois State Unemployment office. Shortly after I left, the name was changed to the Illinois State Department of Human Resources, apparently because of presumed sensitivities among the unemployed at being called unemployed. (I think they were called ''underutilized human resources.'')
 But the high point of my part-time work came during the Christmas season. Those December days were a godsend, offering numerous opportunities at department stores. The nice thing about these jobs is that they extended beyond Christmas -- all because of ''returns'' day.
 One year I was temporarily employed at Von Lengerke & Antoine, a division of Abercrombie & Fitch. When returns day arrived, I was asked to work in the camera department while the guy who ran it went to lunch. Before long, I was approached by a customer who had what I took to be a severe case of Connecticut malocclusion. 
 I him asked if I could be of help. He told me he wanted to return the batteries he had received for his camera on Christmas. He frequently went to Africa on safari, he told me, and the humidity destroyed this particular type of battery. 
 Suddenly, my problems -- having to work part time on the day after Christmas, trying to make it as a comedian -- seemed somehow insignificant. It gave me a whole new outlook on life. 
 Other returns days offered similarly useful lessons. But perhaps the most memorable returns day experience centered on a return that never took place. This also occurred at V.L.&A., probably in 1957, when I was working in the tobacco department.
 That Christmas season, a gentleman accompanied by his wife stopped by the counter and, in a surprisingly short time, purchased any number of lighters, ashtrays and other accessories. (Many of the ashtrays he selected had gambling motifs, like dice or roulette wheels.)
 The bill came to more than $3,000, a considerable sum in those days. I asked him if he wanted the gifts wrapped and delivered. He said yes. So I went through the formalities of asking him his name and he told me a name I immediately recognized as the name of the reputed head of ''the outfit'' in Chicago.
 In a slightly higher voice, I asked him his address, which was River Forest, an affluent suburb of Chicago. He said he preferred to pay by check. I didn't require any identification.
 Before sending his considerable order over to the shipping desk, I felt compelled to explain to this gentleman (and his wife) that once the shipping clerk picked up his presents, they would be out of my control. If any arrived damaged, he should be in touch with the shipping department -- not me.
 My sleep the eve of December 26 could probably be described best as fitful. Work was equally unsettling. In fact, that particular returns day was one of the longest in the history of returns days. The clock didn't move. 
 In the end, however, the workday came and went without incident. Two men with suspicious bulges in their jackets never visited V.L.&A. that day. Apparently, everything survived undamaged -- including, thankfully, me.

HEADLINE: In Bolivia's Affluent East, Anger at Morales Is Growing

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
If anything captures the growing tension between La Paz, the capital, and this flourishing city in the eastern lowlands, it is an alarming photomontage people send to one another's cellphones showing President Evo Morales with a gunshot wound to the head and the words ''Viva Santa Cruz'' scrawled above him in blood.
 The image has become a symbol of the rift between Mr. Morales, an Aymara Indian who after one year in office is celebrating populist feats like energy nationalization and the start of an ambitious land reform plan, and the conservative political and business elite of Santa Cruz, who speak of a country on the cusp of being torn asunder. 
 ''We're turning into another Zimbabwe, in which economic chaos will become the norm,'' said Branko Mavinkovic, the president of a cooking oil manufacturer and one of Bolivia's richest men. ''Evo wants to create a situation where we're driven to civil war,'' he said, speaking English with a light Texas twang he picked up at Southern Methodist University.
 Bolivia remains far from such a dire predicament. But pressure for more political autonomy in Santa Cruz and neighboring eastern provinces is the most pressing challenge to Mr. Morales's government. 
 This city of 1.3 million people, with its beauty contests, overflowing discotheques and dynamic business culture, seems to gaze not westward toward the Andes for its inspiration but east, to the industrial powerhouse of Brazil. 
 Scenes of extreme poverty stand in contrast here with the construction of garish new headquarters of corporations from Brazil, Europe and the United States. 
 One million people flooded the main avenues here this month to protest an effort by Mr. Morales's supporters to amend the Constitution with a simple majority vote instead of a two-thirds majority. 
 Protesters have painted the phrase ''Evo, Chola de Chavez'' which loosely translates as ''Evo, Chavez's Indian Woman,'' on walls throughout this city, a reference to Mr. Morales' tightening alliance with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
 It is no surprise that many Bolivian supporters of Mr. Morales view Santa Cruz as a redoubt of racism and elitism. 
 After students pelted his motorcade with rocks when he visited here last month, Mr. Morales expressed his disdain for some of the region's political and civic leaders who were on a hunger strike by saying they were doing so because they had grown ''very fat.'' 
 Venezuela's influence in Bolivia has added to the tension. Julio Montes, Venezuela's ambassador to Bolivia, said this month that Venezuela would consider military intervention on behalf of Mr. Morales in the event of a crisis. Mr. Montes also said Venezuela would finance 20 border posts, including 2 at major trade routes in the east -- plans that inflamed Mr. Morales's critics here. 
 ''We do not want a Communist state shoved down our throats,'' said Carlos Dabdoub, chief spokesman for the Santa Cruz civic committee and a candidate for vice president last year, explaining that eastern provinces were seeking political autonomy similar to that of certain regions in Spain. 
 While much attention has focused on political and cultural differences, at the heart of the dispute is control over proceeds from the extraction of natural resources like iron ore, timber, oil and, above all, natural gas. The state of Santa Cruz produces almost half of Bolivia's tax revenues while it has about a fifth of the population.
 Bolivia's government has had a $500 million revenue windfall after exerting more government control over the energy industry this year. Most of the gas is extracted and processed in another eastern state, Tarija, and Santa Cruz. 
 ''The east wasn't clamoring for autonomy when the mineral wealth was in the tin mines of the Bolivian highlands,'' said Jim Schultz, a political analyst in Cochabamba. ''Strip away the rhetoric on both sides and this is about who controls the gas revenues.'' 
 Autonomy advocates for Santa Cruz often say their differences with La Paz go back to the colonial era, when affairs in the highlands were managed from Lima, and the lowland plains were linked to royal representatives in Asuncion. 
 Of course, Santa Cruz's reality these days differs from its history. An impressive economic expansion that started 50 years ago, when Santa Cruz had just 50,000 residents, has attracted hundreds of thousands of inhabitants from throughout Bolivia, many of them indigenous migrants. Many people in Santa Cruz support Mr. Morales's efforts to promote indigenous cultures and exert more authority over the traditional elite here. 
 ''When the oligarchs ask for autonomy, that means they're finally losing some of the power they've had for the last 180 years,'' Silvestre Saisari, a prominent land rights advocate here, said in an interview. 
 Even Mr. Morales's market-oriented critics acknowledge that the nationalization announced in May has gone better than expected, at least for now. Foreign energy companies from Brazil, France and Spain agreed to stay in Bolivia and cede control of operations after Argentina recently said it would purchase large amounts of gas for three times what Bolivia had been receiving for its exports. 
 Carlos Alberto Lopez, an independent energy consultant, said the new arrangement would allow the companies to remain profitable in Bolivia even as the government struggled to manage the industry with a national oil company that was still short of qualified technicians and engineers. ''Evo's been very lucky when it comes to energy,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''He's been able to portray the nationalization as a political masterstroke.''
 Indeed, Mr. Morales's nationwide approval ratings have climbed to 62 percent after falling as low as 50 percent in October, when his government appeared stymied after more than a dozen miners died in clashes with the police. In Santa Cruz, his approval rating is 35 percent. 
 Comparisons to Zimbabwe aside, much of Mr. Morales's popularity is tied to the strength of Bolivia's economy, which is expected to grow more than 4 percent this year, an impressive performance for a country that remains the poorest in South America. 
 A write-off of Bolivia's debt with foreign lenders and prudent management of the economy have resulted in a 6 percent budget surplus, allowing Mr. Morales to move ahead with social welfare programs like one that provides poor families with a modest stipend if their children remain in school.
 ''We're witnessing the best economic conditions in Bolivia in the last 45 years,'' said Gonzalo Chavez, an economist at Catholic University in La Paz. ''It's hard to envision civil war in this environment.''


CORRECTION-DATE: December 28, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the opposition to the populist policies of President Evo Morales in Bolivia's eastern region misspelled the surname of a wealthy cooking oil manufacturer who predicted that economic chaos would become the norm in the country. He is Branko Marinkovic, not Mavinkovic.

HEADLINE: Absence of Reports Keeps Trading Light

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street rebounded in light trading yesterday as lower oil prices encouraged investors to add to their portfolios in the final days of the year.
 Buyers came into the market after major indexes retreated in three consecutive sessions last week, but volume was thin in the absence of major economic reports.
Oil's slide lent support as investors brushed off concerns about Iran's reaction to United Nations sanctions over its nuclear program. Crude oil hovered near $61 a barrel, raising the prospect of lower gasoline prices to prop up consumer spending. 
 That was welcome news for retailers after reports showed holiday shopping might have been weaker than expected.
 Trading volume is expected to remain light this week, which tends to skew price moves and make them appear more drastic than they may actually be. European stock markets remain closed for an extended holiday break.
 ''We're seeing lower oil prices being a minor catalyst for the market,'' said Joe Ranieri, managing director of equity trading for Canaccord Adams. ''Other than that, you're just seeing a quiet week with added volatility.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.41, or 0.52 percent, to 12,407.63.

HEADLINE: A SoHo for the South Boston Waterfront

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
After Tony Goldman first saw this city's turn-of-the-last-century manufacturing and warehouse district in Fort Point, he took mere minutes to envision the district's redevelopment.
 ''This is a snapshot of architectural history,'' said Mr. Goldman, the founder and leader of Goldman Properties and the developer who is described as one of the inventors of SoHo. He was on a recent tour of the 16 buildings he owns along with a partner, the Archon Group, which is an affiliate of the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs (no relation to Mr. Goldman).
Like SoHo's cast iron structures, the buildings of Fort Point were built in a distinct period, with the same architects designing all of them, Mr. Goldman said. ''It's not that each individual building is so important, but with its sheer mass, it creates tremendous aesthetic power and an aura that's unique,'' he said.
 Since he helped turn around SoHo in the 1970s by attracting artists to its industrial loft spaces and eventually turning the area into a world-class shopping district, Mr. Goldman has tried his hand at redeveloping the derelict quarters of other large cities: South Beach and Wynwood in Miami and the B3 district of Philadelphia. 
 Fort Point Channel district in Boston seemed like the perfect neighborhood for Mr. Goldman's brand of alchemy, he said. It includes dozens of historic buildings in the South Boston waterfront, an isolated, gritty area that was reconnected with downtown Boston when an elevated barrier, Interstate 93, was relocated underground in the Big Dig project. 
 The five- and six-story red and yellow brick buildings, all built from the 1880s to the 1920s by the Boston Wharf Company, still comprise a strong commercial district full of artistic industrial uses, architecture and design firms and contractors. There was also, at the district's height in the early 1990s, an enclave of 600 artists, a population that has declined to about 400 people in recent years.
 Architectural experts say it is the only industrial neighborhood in Boston that comes close to TriBeCa or SoHo in architecture.
 Mr. Goldman, a self-described real estate ''doctor'' who specializes in neighborhood reinvention, reuse of historic buildings and retail design, has even bought the original Boston Wharf Company sign -- refurbished recently in ruby red neon. He also bought the trademark to the area. 
 Mr. Goldman said he intended to rebrand the quarter as the Boston Wharf District, and construction of the first phase of his project, which begins in March, entails creating 87 condominiums at 316-322 Summer Street. A second phase, scheduled for construction next year, will add 150 to 200 more. The price of the apartments will be about $400,000 to over $1 million, with an average price of about $500,000. Within five years, Goldman Properties also plans to create about 90,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space, said Albert Price, a managing director of the company. 
 The type of retail establishments chosen will be critical to redeveloping the neighborhood, Mr. Goldman said. He is forgoing national name-brand retailers, which often pay higher rents, in favor of boutique retailers, like a florist, a hair salon, a vintage car showroom, lighting stores and art galleries, among others. He said boutique retailers can be worth the expense when they attract a buyer willing to pay more to live there.
 ''I know if I bring this kind of customer in, or this kind of restaurant in, it's going to have a huge impact on the upstairs value of the square footage,'' he said. ''It's hard to prove, but I can prove it, because I've been through it.''
 Mr. Goldman also plans to dig up pavement in alleys to reveal original cobblestone and rail ties, and will add architectural flourishes to facades like awnings to create the feel of the meatpacking district in New York.
 Berkeley Investments, a real estate development, investment and asset management company in Boston purchased about 13 buildings, mostly containing commercial space, in the Fort Point Channel district two years ago. Coincidentally, it has adopted tactics used by Goldman Properties in the B3 district of Philadelphia to develop the retail mix in their buildings, said Tim Love, principal of Utile Inc. Architecture and Planning of Boston, a firm hired to do that planning.
 ''Our planning work was based in many ways on the strategy used by Goldman in Philadelphia,'' Mr. Love said. ''The economic equation is, I'm going to subsidize this destination restaurant entrepreneur to get them here, because then I can generate more income from the condominiums and the co-ops. Because if a developer is only analyzing the revenue generation of the retail alone, it doesn't make any economic sense.''
 The strategy means less focus on physical planning -- especially since the buildings already exist -- and more focus on marketing, Mr. Love said. Both Berkeley and Goldman have been competing for the same boutique retailers, he said.
 Berkeley, which is upgrading an office building at 12 Farnsworth Street, and redeveloping 346-354 Congress Street into luxury condominiums called FP3, has been adding popular Boston restaurateurs to the mix, said Young K. Park, president and principal of Berkeley. He has signed a branch of the Flour Bakery and Cafe from the South End, along with three spinoff restaurants created by the owner of No. 9 Park in Beacon Hill.
 ''The South End has been a little bit of a model for what we're doing in terms of putting in restaurants and boutiques,'' Mr. Park said.
 He agreed that Mr. Goldman was also an influence.
 ''I think we both are kind of reading from the same script,'' Mr. Park said. ''We think that restaurants and bakers are kind of essential ingredients, at least at an initial stage.''
 Artists in the community say they would like Goldman Properties to support an effort to create 200 studios, where artists can live and work, to retain the character of a community with a long contemporary history of artistic pursuits.
 ''We do take exception to some of the comments that a white knight developer is going to ride into the wasteland and turn it into a new neighborhood, because it already is a neighborhood,'' said Cheryl Forte, a board member of the Fort Point Cultural Coalition, who has worked in the neighborhood for three decades.
 In fact, Fort Point artists became property developers themselves more than two decades ago in an attempt to secure their space in the quarter. They have created 249 A Street and 300 Summer Street, both small developments, and then Midway Studios, a much larger development that opened in 2005. The latter became a possibility when another large property owner, Beacon Capital Partners, turned over 206,500 square feet to artists that was then converted to 89 art studios as well as an event space, cafe and arts-related commercial space.
 The artists say they hope that Goldman and Berkeley will follow suit.
 ''The difference between Fort Point and some of the other areas that developers have redeveloped before is this neighborhood has never been blighted,'' said Claudia Ravaschiere, an artist who works at a studio on Melcher Street and is president of Fort Point Arts Community Inc. ''These aren't burnt out, abandoned buildings that nobody's wanted. Somebody's always wanted these buildings.''

A Royal Affair
George III and his Scandalous Siblings
By Stella Tillyard
Illustrated. 352 pages. Random House. $26.95.
 It is natural enough to think of the American War of Independence not as a revolution but as a family quarrel. The colonists, like restive adolescents ready to leave home, resisted parental control. The British, having paid for room and board, reacted with predictable outrage, and George III, to an unusual degree, tended to see all political strife as a family drama. In ''A Royal Affair,'' a portrait gallery of the king and his many siblings, Stella Tillyard argues that the domestic troubles of the royal family during George's first 20 years goes a long way toward explaining his inept handling of the American crisis. 
Ms. Tillyard's George III is a sad, sympathetic figure, a man of modest gifts who took his familial and royal duties very seriously. As the eldest son, he saw it as his job to act as a guide and manager for his eight brothers and sisters, who nearly all presented him with nothing but headaches. While he fretted over the integrity of the Hanoverian dynasty and its public image, his brothers pursued a life of pleasure, and his sisters, although married off to distant princes, somehow managed to disturb the royal peace in unexpected, creative ways. The colonists imagined that the king stayed up nights devising tortures like the Stamp Act. Not so. More often than not, he was putting out brushfires started by his willful, unpredictable family. 
 Although scrupulously researched, ''A Royal Affair'' looks at history sentimentally. The driving force behind events is not policy, but personality and the clash of temperaments and wills. This approach can make the House of Hanover seem like a reclamation project for Dr. Phil. The king's main problem is not the global economic restructuring brought about by empire, but his unstable character, in which self-doubt coexisted with mulelike stubbornness, and plodding conventionality belied a lurid imagination prone to interpret events in apocalyptic terms. 
 If Caroline Mathilde, the youngest sister, nearly drags Britain into a war with Denmark, it's all because she has a hungry heart, eager for love, which she finds in the arms of a sexy doctor with advanced Voltairean views. Ms. Tillyard seems happiest when emotional temperatures reach fever level.
 For this reason George III drops out of the picture early on, displaced by his more colorful siblings. First in line is Edward, the buoyant, pleasure-loving second son, who quickly finds his element in a London set that Ms. Tillyard characterizes as ''fast-living, fast-talking and seriously committed to folly.'' Following the rake's progress, Ms. Tillyard surveys, in arresting detail, the sexual stock exchange in which lovely young flower sellers and shopgirls traded up, thanks to patrons like Edward, to a life of luxury, notoriety and, in some cases, a nice pension. 
 Edward died young, but other brothers waited in the wings, each determined, it seemed to George, to chase after prostitutes and then marry precisely the wrong woman. What made his brothers' behavior doubly maddening was George's own example. He had given up the love of his life to marry, as duty and dynasty required, a suitable mate, Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He lived virtuously and frugally, careful not to squander the public's money. His brothers squandered their allowances at gaming tables and in brothels, and then turned to George for emergency infusions of cash.
 Unfortunately, as Ms. Tillyard notes, many of the royal escapades ended up in the newspapers. Although there was no royal rat pack, a change in the stamp duty in 1757 made it economical to print larger newspapers, whose extra white space was quickly filled with tittle-tattle and scandal. Readers all over London, therefore, could delight in the lusty adventures of the Duke of Cumberland, yet another royal brother, as he assumed the disguise of a Welsh farmer and pursued a cross-country affair with the wife of the enormously wealthy Richard, Lord Grosvenor. All the lurid details came out in court. 
 The brothers were bad, but little Caroline Mathilde was worse. By all rights she should have disappeared from the story after being sent off to Denmark as the wife of King Christian VII. But Christian was no ordinary king, and Caroline Mathilde proved to be a woman of uncommon abilities and ardent temperament. Christian VII, given to manic-depressive episodes, and strongly inclined to masochism, sank into a strange torpor as king, a position he had dreaded since childhood. 
 Caroline Mathilde, neglected in every way, fell into the strong arms of her husband's doctor and adviser, a forward-looking German reformer named Johann Friedrich Struensee. Together the lovers engineered sweeping political reforms, creating the freest press in Europe, abolishing ancient privileges, rationalizing the bureaucracy and raising the young prince according to Rousseauist principles. A palace coup, backed by the officer corps, restored order and wiped the slate clean. Struensee was beheaded, and Caroline Mathilde imprisoned, in Hamlet's castle at Elsinore, touching off an international crisis that captured the English imagination, Ms. Tillyard writes, ''precisely because it combined mythic entertainment and a genuine political crisis.''
 The long, involved tale of doings in Denmark more or less hijacks the book. Ms. Tillyard, enchanted by Caroline Mathilde and her tempestuous love affair, throws George overboard and insists on documenting, in sometimes numbing detail, the rise and fall of Caroline Mathilde. It's too much. The reappearance of George III, as the colonial crisis mounts, comes just in the nick of time.
 By 1775 five of George III's siblings were dead, giving him much more psychic space to devote to American affairs, described by Ms. Tillyard as just more of the same old family fuss.
 ''Family and nation were inseparable for him,'' Ms. Tillyard writes, ''and when the American men and women who were a part of his family repudiated his fatherly love and protection, it almost broke him.'' There you have it in a nutshell. If only there could have been a group hug.

BYLINE: By ERIN AIGNER

 BODY:
The most recent survey of teacher salary trends by the American Federation of Teachers found that the average teacher salary increased by only $1,000 from 1994 to 2004, much less than the average increase for other professionals. In 2004, the last year for which data was available, the average annual salary for teachers was $46,597, lower than many other professionals in the private sector. And for the first time since 1982, teacher salaries were less than the average earnings of government workers. One third of teachers who leave the profession within the first 10 years of teaching cite low salaries as a reason. ERIN AIGNER

HEADLINE: Advancing Water Poses Threat to Eskimo Villages

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWTOK, Alaska, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
The last time chronic flooding forced this tiny village to relocate, sled dogs pulled the old church to its new home three miles away, far from the raging Ninglick River. That was in 1950.
 Half a century later, the river has again crept to the edge of this community of Yupik Eskimos. Persistent erosion has eaten an average of 70 feet of riverbank a year, and melting permafrost is subsiding, further subjecting the village to severe flooding from intensifying storms.
So once again Newtok must move, leaving residents and officials grappling with a crisis that looms over scores of Native Alaskan villages along the state's western coast. 
 These once-nomadic people can no longer pack up and go. The crucial difference this time: finding the money to move and to replace millions of public dollars invested in schools, clinics and government offices. Replacement costs are beyond the reach of these remote communities, which typically rely on subsistence foods for economic survival.
 ''We can't even move an inch without any money,'' Nick Tom, former Newtok tribal administrator, said as he led visitors through mud and snow, pointing out shifting houses and crumbled soil along the Ninglick.
 The problem is taking on a new urgency as the effects of climate change escalate. Erosion and flooding affect 184 of 213 Native Alaskan villages to some degree, according to a 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office, and the Army Corps of Engineers is trying to determine which communities need the most help from a network of state and federal agencies.
 ''When there is a problem that develops over years and decades, such as Alaskan erosion, the perception of urgency is not as acute,'' said Bruce Sexauer, a senior planner with the corps. ''The impacts of a hurricane can be felt nationwide, whereas similar situations in remote communities are oftentimes only known by a select few.''
 Newtok and two other western Alaska villages, Shishmaref and Kivalina, face the shortest life spans at their current locations. Some officials believe that conditions are most urgent in Newtok, tightly wedged between two rivers. The vast, rushing Ninglick has cut into the smaller Newtok River, turning it into a slough. This is the sewage dumping place for Newtok's 315 residents, who have no indoor plumbing and use buckets as toilets.
 Compounding the problem, fall storms send floodwaters surging through the Ninglick and up the Newtok, turning the village into an island, said Brenda Kerr, the Newtok planner for the Corps of Engineers.
 ''The water is scary enough in and of itself, and then you consider what's in it,'' Ms. Kerr said of the public health concern.
 Newtok is ahead of other villages facing a need to move, having completed a federal land trade in 2004 for a hilly area called Mertarvik on Nelson Island nine miles to the south. But that is just on paper. The corps estimates that moving would cost as much as $130 million, or more than $412,000 a resident. That cost reflects the challenge of carrying some existing structures and tons of construction supplies to undeveloped tundra to build a new community.
 ''I think there's very little likelihood that the federal government or the state government could come up with $150 million to say, 'O.K., Shishmaref or Newtok or Kivalina, we're going to move you next year,' '' said Gary Brown of the state's emergency management office. ''When you look at the numbers, it's kind of staggering. But if a community can figure out a way through the maze of political processes to do it incrementally, it might be more palatable.''

HEADLINE: Iran Is Seeking Greater Influence in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE; Michael Moss contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Michael Slackman from Damascus.

DATELINE: ISLAM QALA, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Two years ago, foreign engineers built a new highway through the desert of western Afghanistan, past this ancient trading post and on to the outside world. Nearby, they strung a high-voltage power line and laid a fiber-optic cable, marked with red posts, that provides telephone and Internet access to the region. 
 The modernization comes with a message. Every 5 to 10 miles, road signs offer quotations from the Koran. ''Forgive us, God,'' declares one. ''God is clear to everyone,'' says another. A graceful mosque rises roadside, with a green glass dome and Koranic inscriptions in blue tile. The style is unmistakably Iranian.
All of this is fruit of Iran's drive to become a bigger player in Afghanistan, as it exploits new opportunities to spread its influence and ideas farther across the Middle East. 
 The rise of Hezbollah, with Iran's support, has demonstrated the extent of Tehran's sway in Lebanon, and the American toppling of Saddam Hussein has allowed it to expand its influence in Iraq. Iran has been making inroads into Afghanistan, as well. During the tumultuous 1980s and '90s, Iran shipped money and arms to groups fighting first the Soviet occupation and later the Taliban government. But since the United States and its allies ousted the Taliban in 2001, Iran has taken advantage of the central government's weakness to pursue a more nuanced strategy: part reconstruction, part education and part propaganda. 
 Iran has distributed its largess, more than $200 million in all, mostly here in the west but also in the capital, Kabul. It has set up border posts against the heroin trade, and next year will begin work on new road and construction projects and a rail line linking the countries. In Kabul, its projects include a new medical center and a water testing laboratory. 
 Iran's ambassador, Muhammad Reza Bahrami, portrayed his government's activities as neighborly good works, with a certain self-interest. Iran, he said, is eager to avoid repeating the calamities of the last 20 years, when two million Afghan refugees streamed over the border. 
 ''Our strategy in Afghanistan is based on security, stability and developing a strong central government,'' he said. ''It not only benefits the Afghan people, it's in our national interest.'' 
 Still, there are indications of other motives. Iranian radio stations are broadcasting anti-American propaganda into Afghanistan. Moderate Shiite leaders in Afghanistan say Tehran is funneling money to conservative Shiite religious schools and former warlords with longstanding ties to Iranian intelligence agencies.
 And as the dispute over Iran's nuclear program has escalated [leading the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran on Dec. 23], Iranian intelligence activity has increased across Afghanistan, American and Afghan officials say. This has included not just surveillance and information collection but the recruitment of a network of pro-Iranian operatives who could attack American targets in Afghanistan. [On Dec. 20 in London, British officials charged the interpreter for NATO's commanding general in Afghanistan with passing secrets to Iran.]
 Discerning Iranian motives is notoriously difficult. Government factions often have competing agendas. Even so, the question of Iran's intentions in Afghanistan has come under a microscope in recent weeks amid debate in Washington over whether the United States should begin dealing with Tehran as part of a possible solution in Iraq. Some American officials have suggested that Iran's seeming cooperation in Afghanistan may be something of a model for Iraq. 
 So far, even as it declines to talk with the Iranians about Iraq, the Bush administration has adopted a posture of uneasy detente over Afghanistan. American officials say that they are watching closely, and no evidence has emerged of recent arms shipments to Iranian proxies, as there have been in Iraq, or of other efforts to destabilize the country. Iran's Shiite leaders appear to be maintaining their historic opposition to the Sunni Taliban, who consider Shiites heretics. Iran, they also say, is failing to gain popular support among Afghans, 80 percent of whom are Sunni Muslims. 
 Of far greater concern, according to American, European and Afghan officials, is Pakistan, America's ostensible ally against terrorism. They say the Pakistanis have allowed the Taliban to create a virtual ministate and staging base for suicide attacks just across Afghanistan's eastern border. Suicide attacks have quintupled, from 23 in 2005 to 115 this year, killing more than 200 Afghan civilians. 
 [It is too early to know if the Bush administration's position will be at all affected by the latest source of tension between Washington and Tehran -- the American arrests of several Iranians in Baghdad on Dec. 20 and 21 on suspicion of conducting attacks on Iraqi security forces.] 
 Western diplomats say that, at the very least, Iran's goals in Afghanistan are to hasten the withdrawal of American troops, prevent the Taliban from regaining power and keep the Afghan west firmly under Tehran's sway. 
 ''Keep this area stable, but make it friendly for them,'' said a senior European diplomat in western Afghanistan. ''Make it difficult for outsiders to operate here.''
 Afghanistan, analysts say, is one example of the way Iran is increasingly spending its oil money in a variety of countries to realize its self-image as an ascendant regional power. One Western official said that by focusing on high-profile construction projects, diplomacy and public relations, Iran was, in effect, employing American cold-war tactics to increase its soft power in the region. 
 In Iraq, that means not just financing an array of Shiite political parties and militias; the Iranian ambassador in Baghdad, Hassan Kazemi-Qomi, said Tehran was already providing power and planned to build three hospitals and set up a $1 billion loan fund for Iraqi businesses. Similarly, Iran gave Hezbollah not just weapons and training but also the money for roads, schools and social services that made it the de facto government in southern Lebanon. Iran already has a strong and growing presence in Syria, too. 
 Iranian officials cast themselves as a counterweight to the United States, which they say has mishandled opportunities to stabilize both Afghanistan and Iraq.
 ''U.S. policies, particularly under the current administration, have created a huge amount of resentment around the world,'' said a senior Iranian official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. ''I'm not saying Iran is gaining power all over the world. I'm saying the U.S. is losing it fast.'' 

A History of Intervention
 Afghanistan, a fragile mosaic of ethnic and religious groups, has long been susceptible to intervention from more powerful neighbors. As the world's largest predominantly Shiite country, Iran is the traditional foreign backer of Afghanistan's Shiites, roughly 20 percent of the country's population. 
 During the anti-Soviet jihad of the 1980s, Iranian Revolutionary Guards financed and trained fundamentalist Shiite militias, as well as Sunni fighters. In the civil war after the Russian withdrawal in 1989, Iran became a patron of the Northern Alliance, while Pakistan supported the ultimately victorious Taliban. 
 When the Taliban were ousted in 2001, Iran promised to help stabilize Afghanistan. In Germany that December, it was Iranian diplomats who stepped in to save foundering talks to form a new Afghan government, persuading the Northern Alliance to accept the agreement. Soon after, Iran pledged $560 million in aid and loans to Afghanistan over five years, a ''startling'' amount for a nonindustrialized nation, according to James Dobbins, the senior American envoy to Afghanistan at the time. 
 A week later, President Bush situated Iran on the ''axis of evil.'' But even as they assailed that characterization, Mr. Dobbins said, Iranian officials privately offered to train Afghan soldiers. The Bush administration rejected the offer. 
 Today, the American training and reconstruction effort dwarfs Iran's. The United States has spent a total of $4.5 billion since 2001, according to Afghan officials. But while the United States has built more than 1,000 schools, government buildings and clinics, and paved more than 730 miles of roads, a 2005 government audit found that reconstruction had been slowed by inconsistent financing, staff shortages and poor oversight. Amid rising Taliban attacks and public perception of corruption in the government of President Hamid Karzai, recent opinion polls show optimism declining across the country.
 Iranian officials said they had focused on roads and power as a quick way to strengthen Afghanistan's economy. A major project has involved upgrading roads linking Afghanistan with the Iranian port of Chabahar, on the Gulf of Oman.
 In many ways, Muhammad Reza Dabbaghi embodies Iran's new approach in Afghanistan. Mr. Dabbaghi, a 46-year-old engineer, is the top executive here for the Iranian company that built the new 70-mile highway linking western Afghanistan to Iran two years ago, is paving much of the northwestern city of Herat and hopes to build the new railway, all with Iranian government financing.
 As his staff served green tea, apples and sweet cookies from southeastern Iran, he handed over a glossy color brochure and CD-ROM touting his company's work. Mr. Dabbaghi, a fastidious man in a stylish blazer and slacks, said his company was trying to work in neighboring countries, but he complained that the United States was spreading ''mass propaganda,'' lobbying governments not to hire Iranian companies, especially in Afghanistan. 
 In Kabul, American contractors, advisers and aid projects clearly dominate the city, but Iran is there, too. In addition to a handful of Iranian advisers at government ministries, Iranian experts have trained more than 1,200 Afghan teachers, librarians and diplomats.
 Last year, the Iranian Embassy opened the Iranian Corner, a room in Kabul University's main library filled with computers, books and magazines from Iran, promoting Iran's ancient culture and modern achievements. Librarians say it is more popular than the adjoining American Corner, sponsored by the United States Embassy, primarily because it has a better Internet connection. Unlike in Iran, where the government blocks thousands of Web sites, the Iranian Corner offers open Internet access. 

Going West for Jobs
 Afghanistan's economic reliance on Iran has increased in another way, as Taliban attacks have slowed the economy. Each morning, hundreds of Afghan men line up outside the Iranian missions in Herat and Kabul for visas to work in Iran. Iranian officials said they expected to issue up to 450,000 visas to Afghans this year, nearly twice the 250,000 issued in 2005. 
 In the murky world of western Afghanistan, centuries of Iranian influence have left many local people with a perception of Iran as all-powerful nemesis. Many said their lives would be in danger if they publicly criticized Iran or its Afghan proxies. Behind every suspicious event in the Afghan west, they contend, lies an Iranian hand. 
 Such accounts are clearly exaggerated. Still, Western and Afghan officials say that, beyond its much-trumpeted reconstruction program, Iran is also engaging in a range of activities it is less eager to publicize. 
 Qari Ahmad Ali, a Shiite commander once backed by Iran, said that since 2001, his former patrons had funneled millions of dollars to a web of Shiite religious schools and charities in western Afghanistan. He said the Sadaqia Madrasa, one of the largest Shiite religious schools in Herat, was at the center of an effort to spread Shiite fundamentalism.
 ''Iran does not have military activities,'' Mr. Ali said. ''They have political and social activities.'' 
 Muhammad Siddique Tawakulay, the Sadaqia school's cultural director, said it received no assistance from Iran. ''We are saying the truth and the facts,'' he said, before giving a tour of the school. But a second, unsupervised tour produced evidence of Iranian influence. 
 In a small ground-floor room, photos of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian revolution, were for sale. The main library had two dozen books published in Iran that criticized Israel and the United States. One, ''Dark Star,'' had a photo of a Hasidic Jew with a star of David burning ominously on its cover. A religious magazine printed in Iran assailed the United States for supporting Israel's attacks on Lebanon last summer. 
 Shopkeepers said that during the Lebanon fighting, madrasa officials distributed posters praising Hezbollah. One of them, still hanging in a local shop, featured photographs of dead Lebanese children and a heroic image of the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. 
 A senior Afghan intelligence official said that Radio Mashhad, a state-run station in northeastern Iran's largest city, broadcast anti-American messages over the border.
 ''Iran is providing a lot of assistance for religious and cultural activities in Afghanistan,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the secret nature of his work. ''That is the easy way to build influence.''
 Moderate Shiites agreed. ''We worry about the situation,'' said Abbas Noyan, a Shiite member of Parliament. ''Right now, the Iranians have a strong hand.''
 In interviews, three Shiite officials said new religious schools were being built with Iranian money. They also said that more Afghans were celebrating formerly obscure Shiite religious holidays.
 Western diplomats said Iran's influence waned two years ago, after the United States doubled aid to Afghanistan and removed Ismail Khan, the governor of Herat and a powerful Iranian-backed warlord who dominated the west. 
 Since then, though, American troops have turned responsibility for Herat over to the Italians, and this year, the United States cut aid to Afghanistan by 30 percent. Iran, meanwhile, has kept its aid money flowing steadily and continued to back its proxies in the region, according to a Western diplomat.
 The last known example of Iranian weapons shipments came in late 2004, when Tehran provided weapons and training to a junior commander loyal to Mr. Khan. Since then, the commander is suspected of having orchestrated a bombing and other incidents to pressure the Afghan government into reinstating Mr. Khan. 
 In February, Herat experienced its first religious violence in decades. Six people were killed as Sunnis and Shiites staged gun battles on city streets, according to religious leaders. Some local officials blamed Mr. Khan's protege for fomenting the violence. Others attributed it to rising grass-roots Sunni-Shiite tensions.
 As in Iraq, the American-backed effort to build a democracy has fostered a Shiite revival here. Shiites now serve as governors in 4 of 34 provinces, including Herat. Hard-line Sunnis in Herat said they chafed at being ruled by Shiites, blamed Iran for the Shiite rise and expected more violence.
 In Kabul, though, Afghan government officials, desperate for aid, say they have decided to trust Iran's intentions. 
 ''History may prove that overly optimistic,'' said Jawed Ludin, President Karzai's chief of staff. ''But it is in our interests today to trust our Iranian neighbors and expect the same in return.''

HEADLINE: Our Founding Illegals 

BYLINE: By William Hogeland; Thomas L. Friedman and Maureen Dowd are off today.. 
William Hogeland is the author of ''The Whiskey Rebellion: George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and the Frontier Rebels Who Challenged America's Newfound Sovereignty.''

 BODY:
EVERY nation is a nation of immigrants. Go back far enough and you'll find us all, millions of potential lives, tucked in the DNA of our African mother, Lucy. But the immigrant experience in the United States is justly celebrated, and perhaps no aspect of that experience is more quintessentially American than our long heritage of illegal immigration. 
 You wouldn't know it from the immigration debate going on all year (the bipartisan immigration bill-in-progress, announced this week, is unlikely to mention it), but America's pioneer values developed in a distinctly illegal context. In 1763, George III drew a line on a map stretching from modern-day Maine to modern-day Georgia, along the crest of the Appalachians. He declared it illegal to claim or settle land west of the line, all of which he reserved for Native Americans. 
George Washington, a young colonel in the Virginia militia, instructed his land-buying agents in the many ways of getting around the law. Although Washington was not alone in acquiring forbidden tracts, few were as energetic in the illegal acquisition of western land. And Washington was a model of decorum compared to Ethan Allen, a rowdy from Connecticut who settled with his brothers in a part of the Green Mountains known as the Hampshire Grants (later known as ''Vermont''). The province of New York held title to the land, but Allen asserted his own kind of claim: He threw New Yorkers out, Tony Soprano style, then offered to sell their lots to what he hoped would be a flood of fellow illegals from Connecticut.
 Meanwhile, illegal pioneers began moving across the Alleghenies and into the upper Ohio Valley, violating the king's 1763 proclamation and a few more besides. (George would today be accused of softness on immigration; he kept shifting the line westward.) Immigrants from such declasse spots as Germany and Ireland violated the laws and settled where they pleased. The upper Ohio was rife with illegal immigrants, ancestors of people who, in country clubs today, are implying a Mayflower ancestry.
 Parallels to today's illegal immigration are striking. Then as now, it was potentially deadly to bring a family across the line. But once across, illegals had a good chance of avoiding arrest and settling in. Border patrols, in the forms of the British Army and provincial militias, were stretched thin. The 18th-century forest primeval, like a modern city, offered ample opportunities for getting lost. Complex economies thrived in the virgin backwoods, unfettered by legitimate property titles. 
 When conflicts developed between the first and second waves of illegals, some salient social ironies arose, too. By the early 1770's, George Washington had amassed vast tracts to which his titles were flatly invalid. The Revolution rectified that. With British law void, Washington emerged from the war with his titles legal by default. But he acquired another problem: low-class illegals were squatting on his newly authenticated, highly valuable property.
 Washington harbored no fond feeling for breakers of laws that he too had recently flouted. ''It is hard upon me,'' he lamented without irony, ''to have property which has been fairly obtained disputed and withheld.'' He went to court to have the squatters evicted, complaining that they had ''not taken those necessary steps pointed out by the law.'' He was appealing to righteousness from atop a high but wobbly horse. 
 Descendants of the great immigration experiences of the 19th and 20th centuries visit the Ellis Island Immigration Museum to learn of the tribulations of ancestors who risked much to become Americans. Those of us whose ancestors risked everything as illegal immigrants, and in the process helped found a nation, owe our forebears a debt of gratitude, too. Without their daring disregard of immigration laws, we might not be here today.

HEADLINE: Ruling Upholds Eli Lilly's Patent on Drug

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Eli Lilly & Company won a federal appeals court ruling on Tuesday upholding its patent on Zyprexa, the world's top-selling schizophrenia drug.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in Washington, affirmed a lower court decision that the patent was valid. The Ivax unit of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories had claimed a federal judge was mistaken in ruling the drug was protected until Lilly's patent expires in 2011. 
In addition, ''Lilly did not fail to disclose information'' to the patent office, as its rivals suggested, the judges said in their 21-page opinion. The opinion upheld a decision by Judge Richard L. Young of United States District Court in Indianapolis. 
 Lilly is also defending its marketing of Zyprexa in lawsuits filed by the attorneys general of Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia and Alaska alleging the company promoted the drug for unapproved uses and hid the risks of weight gain and diabetes. 
 Sales of Zyprexa dropped 16 percent and fell behind AstraZeneca's Seroquel as America's best-selling antipsychotic in 2005, according to IMS Health, which provides data on drug sales. 
 Worldwide sales of Zyprexa dropped 4.9 percent to $4.2 billion last year and accounted for about 29 percent of Lilly's revenue. 
 The drug has been Lilly's biggest seller since generic competition emerged to the antidepressant Prozac in 2001.
 Stock in Lilly, which is based in Indianapolis, rose 43 cents in regular trading, to $51.78 a share.
 Ivax and Dr. Reddy's, both of which have said their proposed alternatives to Zyprexa would infringe Lilly's patent, claimed the patent should not have been issued by the Patent and Trademark Office in 1993. 
 They asked the Washington-based court in April to rule the patent invalid.

HEADLINE: The Biggest Private Equity Firms Are Turning Their Focus to Asia

BYLINE: By DONALD GREENLEES

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
After the extraordinary growth in private equity deals in the United States and Europe, Asia is emerging as the next frontier. The top firms are already poised to take advantage.
 That, at least, is the view of David Bonderman, a co-founder of the Texas Pacific Group, who at a recent conference here referred to an ''explosion'' in the size of deals in Asia. Despite a surge in the number of homegrown private equity firms, he predicted that just 10 global firms, Texas Pacific among them, would end up leading the Asian market.
''It's going to be a global market dominated by the same global players who dominate the marts in America and Europe,'' he said. 
 For such firms, Asia offers a rich bounty. This year, private equity firms committed $28.9 billion through the first nine months of the year to investments in Asian companies outside Japan -- a 78 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Dealogic, a financial data provider.
 Texas Pacific and its Asian investment arm, TPG Newbridge, were among the first to see the opportunities in Asia more than a decade ago and they remain leaders in size and geographical reach. Over the last year, the firms allocated 30 percent of their total investment capital to Asia, more than double the amount of the previous four years.
 Texas Pacific has invested about $1 billion this year, buying into hospitals in Singapore and Malaysia, a department store in Australia, a natural-gas producer in China and finance companies in Taiwan and India.
 With as much as $4 billion still earmarked for Asia, the pace of investments by Texas Pacific in Asian companies is likely to be sustained, barring major upset in regional markets.
 ''Asia clearly offers long-term potential as a private equity market,'' said Timothy D. Dattels, a Texas Pacific partner and Asia specialist. ''The great enterprises of the next 100 years are being built today in some of these markets, like China and India. And there is a role for global players in private equity, who bring in the management expertise, the experience in international markets, to partner some of these companies and help them create value and realize their potential.''
 The number of private equity firms with Asia funds or operations in the region has mushroomed over the last decade. Texas Pacific has been joined by major global firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and CVC Capital Partners.
 But obstacles in Asia are also forcing firms to change the way they approach a deal.
 As in parts of Europe, private equity firms have encountered some resistance because of a mixture of nationalist sentiment against foreign ownership, suspicions about the desirability of private equity firms as asset owners and a maze of regulations or policies affecting foreign investment in some industries. 
 Texas Pacific had a taste of those difficulties this year when its bid to buy PCCW, the Hong Kong telecommunications company, was rejected because Beijing did not want a strategic asset to fall into foreign hands.
 The concept of private equity is not always an easy sell in Asia, where companies are often conservatively managed and where some governments see businesses primarily as vehicles for nation building. Moreover, many Asian companies are family firms committed to providing wealth for future generations.
 But private equity firms and their investors -- typically pensions, endowments and other institutions -- usually are not looking to hold on to companies for long. They buy a minority stake in a company and borrow enough to gain control, with the idea of either selling the company or taking it public in 3 to 10 years. 
 Daniel A. Carroll, who runs Texas Pacific's operations in Asia, based in Hong Kong, said the image of private equity in Asia had been helped by some successful company turnarounds, but he acknowledged it had also been hurt ''by the windfall profits that resulted from a lot of the deals done during the economic crisis'' in the late 1990s.
 ''I think the industry needs for its own survival to prevent the backlash that we are seeing in some of these countries,'' he said.
 Mr. Carroll added there was still a perception that private equity could ''make money coming in and stripping the assets of a company and selling off the assets and firing all the people.''
 ''Nobody actually stops to do the arithmetic,'' he said. ''If you figure it out, you can't make much money doing that.''
 In the deals that private equity does now, said James G. Coulter, who co-founded Texas Pacific with Mr. Bonderman, the emphasis is on the ability to bring in highly skilled managers or support existing managers to ''build and sustain a company.''
 As an example, Texas Pacific points to Qantas Airways in Australia, which the firm is buying for $8.7 billion as part of a consortium with Macquarie Bank. The firm's partners say they strongly support management but aim to bring their extensive experience in aircraft purchasing and low-cost carriers to what will probably be a long-term investment. The first deal that Texas Pacific did in 1993 was to buy and turn around Continental Airlines.
 With most markets awash with capital, investors need to bring something more than just money. Private equity firms face an even greater challenge in parts of Asia when making their case in places where boards and owners have been reluctant to sell noncore assets or cede management control to outsiders.
 ''There is no magic to doing a deal in Asia,'' Mr. Coulter said. ''However, if a private equity firm can deliver value to a company in Beijing, that's something special.''

HEADLINE: Many Private Planes to Store, but Not Enough Hangars

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
With the demand for private air travel increasing and space at most airports in urbanized areas at a premium, fixed-based operators -- the companies that perform maintenance and other services for noncommercial aircraft -- are under pressure to expand into whatever areas they can find, or to improve the facilities they have.
 Take the case of Avitat Westchester, which has been storing and servicing private aircraft here since 1993. Using some of the last property available for new construction at Westchester County Airport, Avitat opened a high-security $9 million, 48,000-square-foot office and hangar complex this month. In addition to renting out space in its two hangars to corporations and businesses, Avitat also refuels private aircraft and provides other ground services for clients like J. P. Morgan Chase, American Express, Hillary and Bill Clinton, Paul Newman and Richard Gere, said Michael W. Dolphin, the company's president and chief executive. 
The company caters to its clientele from its gleaming new glass and steel building with a two-story lobby, five floor-to-ceiling fish tanks, a baby grand piano and a Starbucks. 
 Avitat is one of a handful of thriving fixed-based operators that have long-term leases for hangar and tarmac space at the airport. 
 But further development of private ground services at the Westchester airport, which also handles commercial flights, is sharply limited because of its proximity to densely populated residential neighborhoods in Westchester and in adjoining Fairfield County, Conn., said Salvatore J. Carrera, Westchester's director for economic development.
 Rents paid by fixed-base operators have risen sharply as a result.
 To rent its original hangar and office space -- 36,000 square feet altogether -- Avitat pays $61,000 annually, almost twice what it paid in 1993. The lease on the new space dates back to the hangar's former occupant and will be renegotiated when it expires in 2010 to reflect the current market. In all, Mr. Dolphin said, Avitat pays $1.46 million a year in rent, and $314,000 annually in property taxes. Like Avitat, other fixed-based operators are scrambling to find new hangar space, said Mr. Dolphin, a former corporate pilot. 
 In the last three decades, the New York metropolitan area has lost about 50 airports, many of them on Long Island and some of them very tiny. In Camden, N.Y., a former airport is now a shopping center and part of a highway. At airports like Westchester and those in Newark and Teterboro, N.J., ''it is almost impossible to expand their footprints, in part, because many developers have built right up against airport fences,'' said James K. Coyne, president of the National Air Transportation Association, a trade group in Alexandria, Va., representing 2,000 private businesses like fixed-based operators and air taxi services.
 ''One of the truisms for all kinds of real estate is location, location location, and that is especially the case when it comes to runways,'' Mr. Coyne said.
 As a result, some fixed-based operators are looking at smaller, underutilized airports, like Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, N.Y., formerly an Air Force base, about 55 miles north of New York City.
 Gary W. Briggs, the owner of Ascend Development, a fixed-base operator in Hayward, Calif., near San Francisco, has signed a long-term ground lease for 32 acres at Stewart. He plans to build about 538,000 square feet of hangar space for 41 private jets.
 But instead of renting the space, Mr. Briggs plans to offer them as hangar condominiums, with most selling for $2 million, depending on the size of the aircraft. The private planes he stores are comparable in size to Boeing 737s and Boeing 757s with up to 30 seats, sleeping quarters, a conference room and the ability to make long-range flights. 
 Because they offer corporate executives a fast, secure and private way to travel, with no long lines in the airport or extended waits on the tarmac for takeoff, large private jets have become increasingly popular. Even if they are based in remote locations, they can fly into major city airports to pick up or drop off passengers. 
 There are about 221,000 general aviation aircraft in the country today, according to the National Air Transportation Association. In 2000, the latest year for which the trade group has figures, general aviation flew 31.8 million hours, compared with 14.4 million hours for commercial air carriers.
 The Federal Aviation Administration listed 5,280 airports (most of them privately owned and serving small general aviation planes) in 2004, the most recent year for which information is available, compared with 5,474 in 1994. Only 563 of those airports, like the one in Westchester, are served by scheduled air carriers. 
 Typically, corporate and private owners rent hangar space and adjacent offices for $18,000 to $20,000 a month a plane, depending on the size of the aircraft and where it is stored.
 With hangar condos, like the ones Ascend Development plans to build at Stewart, the property manager -- in this case, Ascend itself -- is responsible for building maintenance, snowplowing and other repairs. 
 Mr. Briggs and one of his sons, Scott, who is his business partner, are also building hangar condos at the Hayward Executive Airport near San Francisco. The first phase of that development included 60,000 square feet of private hangar space, which has sold out. Phase 2 of that development, an 80,000-square-foot building with nine hangars, is under construction, and is 65 percent sold.
 Stewart International Airport, the first privatized commercial airport in the United States, operates under a 99-year lease agreement with the New York State Department of Transportation. National Express Corporation operates the airport and is the United States subsidiary of the National Express Group in Britain.

HEADLINE: You Are What You Eat: 2006 and the Politics of Food

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
THE headlines about food this year read like a remarkable replay of Woody Allen's ''Sleeper,'' in which the things Americans think they should eat more of -- lettuce and spinach -- were suddenly the ones that could make them sick, or even kill them. 
 Yet critics of American agribusiness, like Marion Nestle, a professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University, and the author of ''What to Eat,'' see an upside to all the bad news. 
''This is the year everyone discovered that food is about politics and people can do something about it,'' she said. ''In a world in which people feel more and more distant from global forces that control their lives, they can do something by, as the British put it, 'voting with your trolley,' their word for shopping cart.''
 Eric Schlosser, author of ''Fast Food Nation,'' about the horrors of industrialized food for the animals, the workers and the consumer, is equally upbeat. ''Those negative events brought attention to the problems,'' he said of the past year. ''Even the growers think the system is broken and has to be fixed,'' he added, referring to the California spinach farmers, who are now demanding that the government step in and set some rules about growing and processing produce.
 Food safety isn't the only place Mr. Schlosser sees progress. ''There is growing bipartisan consensus on obesity,'' he said. Former President Bill Clinton ''brokered a deal with soft drink and snack food companies to remove sodas and junk food from schools,'' he added, and ''Governors Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California have made nutrition in schools an important priority.''
 This was the year when Americans got in touch with their food, and its varied political and social connections came into focus in different media. The Nation devoted an entire issue, developed in collaboration with Alice Waters of Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley, to food. Michael Pollan's ''Omnivore's Dilemma,'' a book that took a look at industrial agriculture and other topics, became a best seller. ''Fast Food Nation'' was made into a film by the director Richard Linklater.
 Partly as a result of the renewed focus on where food comes from, animal welfare groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, once relegated to fringe status, have captured some attention. Animal rights supporters persuaded officials in Chicago to ban foie gras because they say force-feeding ducks and geese is cruel. 
 Whole Foods threatened to terminate its contract with a California duck grower because he processed and distributed the products of a foie gras producer. The supermarket chain has stopped selling live lobsters, it says, until it can figure out how to keep them more comfortable on their trip from ocean to fish counter. Lobster ''condos'' have been suggested.
 The organics movement went mainstream this year, too, as Wal-Mart rolled out a wide selection of food bearing the United States Department of Agriculture's organic certification. The chain also vowed to price these products only slightly higher than conventional foods.
 But there were signs that organics may have become too successful for their own good. Once welcomed as the savior of the small farmer and the conscientious eater, organic farming has lost some of its luster, dulled by large operators who follow the letter of the law but ignore the larger principles that once characterized the organic movement. 
 Today the word no longer stands for small-scale farming and animals raised in a traditional pastoral setting. As Mr. Pollan wrote in The New York Times in 2001, about the dairy farms operated by the organic milk producer Horizon, ''thousands of cows that never encounter a blade of grass spend their days confined to a fenced dry lot, eating (certified organic) grain and tethered to milking machines three times a day.''
 The Department of Agriculture is now considering allowing salmon farmers to call their fish organic even if the fish are fed nonorganic fishmeal. The increasingly loose meaning of the word has led some consumers, who once bought anything labeled organic, to rely on new signifiers, like grass-fed, sustainable or local.
 It is not only individual shoppers who are choosing to vote with their food dollars. Tired of waiting for the federal government to act, local governments have stepped in. New York City banned trans fats in restaurants and told restaurants with standardized recipes that they must provide easy access to calorie information. Other municipal and state governments are requiring public institutions to buy more nutritious, locally produced food. 
 The slow drip-drip-drip of foodborne outbreaks over the last 20 years has not desensitized people to the fact that food can harbor harmful bacteria; it has made them skittish. After the outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in spinach in August, sales of the vegetable plummeted 60 percent. With several outbreaks this year, including one involving E. coli at the Taco Bell chain, the idea that eating local may be safer is taking hold. When the fruits or vegetables from dozens of farms are combined before shipping, the opportunities for contamination are greatly increased.
 The discovery of contaminated produce is happening at a time when advice about eating more fruits and vegetables seems to be having an impact. So concerns about safety may be contributing to the success of local farmers' markets. 
 ''I see this happening everywhere, and it is enormous,'' Ms. Nestle said. ''It's the recognition that food ties into extremely important social, economic, environmental and institutional issues. Ordinary people don't have access to these really important issues except through food.''

HEADLINE: Iran Parliament Debates Reply To U.N. Penalties 

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Parliament began debate on Tuesday on how to respond to sanctions imposed by a United Nations Security Council resolution on Saturday, but two high-level officials said they doubted that Iran would bar nuclear inspectors and drop out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 Before the Security Council vote, hard-line politicians and conservative newspapers in Iran had called for taking those strong actions.
Kazem Jalali, an influential member of Parliament and its foreign policy committee, said it did not appear to be the right time to bar United Nations' inspectors or withdraw from the treaty, although he reserved Iran's right to do so later.
 Muhammad Saeedi, the deputy leader of the country's Atomic Energy Organization, doubted a majority in Parliament wanted to pull out.
 ''They are upset about the resolution, but Parliament will make a reasonable decision,'' he said. 
 The Security Council resolution is meant to curb Iran's nuclear program and bans the import and export of materials and technology used in uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missiles. The resolution, weaker than what the United States proposed, has been debated in the United Nations since Iran ignored Council calls to suspend nuclear activities by Aug. 31.
 Iran says its nuclear program is allowed under the treaty and is intended for domestic energy production. The United States and others contend that the program is a cover for a plan to produce nuclear bombs.
 The discussions in Parliament were at an early stage on Tuesday, and no consensus was reached about what action should be taken, if any.
 Newspapers here have been prohibited from criticizing Iran's nuclear policy, and none have done so.
 But this week, several moderate newspapers indicated in editorials that the sanctions might have a greater economic effect than the government had acknowledged. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has vowed that the sanctions will not prevent the country from proceeding with its nuclear program.
 An editorial on Tuesday in the daily, Aftab-e-Yazd, said an ''unreasonable and emotional'' reaction to the sanctions could be very dangerous.

HEADLINE: Putin's Assertive Diplomacy Is Seldom Challenged

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Inside the Kremlin last week, the executives of three major international companies -- Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi and Mitsui -- heaped praise on the man whose government had effectively forced them to cede control of the world's largest combined oil and natural gas project.
 ''Thank you very much for your support,'' Shell's chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, told President Vladimir V. Putin during a meeting that ended a six-month regulatory assault on the project, Sakhalin II, but only after the companies surrendered control of it to the state energy giant, Gazprom. ''This was a historic occasion.'' 
It was also a telling one, with lessons that extend beyond energy policy to such disparate matters as the killings of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. agent in London, and Anna Politkovskaya, a prominent journalist.
 Mr. Putin's Russia, buoyed by its oil and gas riches, has become so confident -- so arrogant, its critics say -- that it has become impervious to the criticism that once might have modified its behavior. And those who might have once criticized, from investors to foreign governments, have largely acquiesced to the new reality.
 The Kremlin is now dictating its terms with greater assertiveness than it has at any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which was 15 years ago Monday, to be precise. Many hoped that Russia's presidency of the Group of 8 industrial nations this year would temper Mr. Putin's diplomacy, but it has not.
 Russia began 2006 by making good on a threat to cut off natural gas to Ukraine to get a higher price for Gazprom. The shutoff, though brief, provoked concern in Europe about dependency on Russian energy, and now Russia is ending 2006 by warning Belarus of the same fate.
 Vice President Dick Cheney famously leveled the harshest criticism of the Kremlin to date when he accused it of using oil and gas as ''tools of intimidation or blackmail.'' That was in May, but since then American policy toward Russia has changed imperceptibly, with one significant exception: the Bush administration gave its approval for Russia's long-coveted membership in the World Trade Organization.
 ''Russia since last year has been enjoying some feeling of euphoria, that feeling that we have so much money, so many resources that we can do what we want,'' said Fyodor A. Lukyanov, the editor of Russia in Global Affairs.
 The United States and Europe have little leverage beyond persuasion. And persuasion no longer works, as the Kremlin's campaign against Sakhalin II, the largest foreign investment project in Russia, showed. The campaign was so transparent that it seemed comical, beginning with surprise inspections by a little-known environmental inspector who threatened to fine the project's developers for every tree they cut down.
 As the campaign unfolded, analysts issued warnings. Western diplomats and their governments protested. But in the end the Kremlin got what was clearly its goal: state control of a lucrative project that opens the gas market to Asia.
 The three companies with the most to lose said nothing critical as they sold 50 percent plus one share of Sakhalin II for what some analysts called a discounted price, $7.45 billion. Mr. Putin immediately declared that the project's environmental problems could ''be considered resolved.''
 ''Experience has disappointed many foreign investors in Russia,'' said Valery Nesterov, an energy analyst at Troika Dialog, an investment firm in Moscow. And yet when it comes to energy or other investments, it does little to deter them. ''The attraction is so large,'' Mr. Nesterov said, adding that companies like Shell still held out hope of winning access to Russia's other oil and gas fields in the future.
 The Sakhalin affair has revived memories of the government's assault on Yukos Oil and its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, in 2003 and 2004. When it all started, even Russia's supporters worried about the potential damage to the country's reputation, especially among investors.
 If damage was done, it is hard to quantify now. The company is a rump of its former self, under bankruptcy receivership with its major assets now belonging to the state oil company, Rosneft. Mr. Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia, remains in a Siberian prison on charges of fraud and tax evasion, and he is reportedly facing a new round of criminal charges.
 Although Russia's stock market plunged 21 percent in the month after Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, with the Russian Trading System Index dipping below 500, it is now above 1,800.
 The international response to the killings of two prominent Kremlin critics -- Mr. Litvinenko in exile in London and Ms. Politkovskaya here in Moscow -- also underscores the new reality.
 There is as yet no evidence directly linking anyone in Russia to the killings, even if critics have been quick to say so, reviving some of the worst fears about the country Russia has become.
 In the wake of Mr. Litvinenko's death, The Daily Telegraph of London declared flatly, ''Russia is rotten to its heart.'' A recent cover of The Economist showed Mr. Putin dressed like a gangster, holding a gasoline nozzle as a machine gun.
 The British government, by contrast, has said nothing so critical, even after British detectives who came to Moscow were confronted with strict limits on their ability to question witnesses.
 Wealth has emboldened Mr. Putin and those around him. At a roundtable interview this month, the first deputy prime minister and chairman of Gazprom's board, Dmitry A. Medvedev, brushed aside questions about the company's management, its corporate philosophy and its investments in newspapers and other ventures seen as political. He suggested that the Kremlin, perhaps, had been right, and all of its critics wrong.
 ''The value of Gazprom in 2000 was $9 billion,'' Mr. Medvedev, often cited as a potential successor to Mr. Putin, said. ''Today it is between $250 and $300 billion.''
 Others warn that Russia is ignoring the consequences of its behavior, that the monopolistic policies of Gazprom, the erosion of political competition and the easy dismissal of critics blinds the Kremlin to the dangers of the overly centralized system Mr. Putin has created.
 Mikhail A. Kasyanov, Mr. Putin's prime minister from 2000 until 2004 and now one of his biggest critics, said the foreigners who rushed to join Russia's boon were equally complicit. ''Investors are very shortsighted,'' he said in an interview.

PERSON: Gerald R. Ford

HEADLINE: GERALD FORD DIES; NIXON'S SUCCESSOR IN '74 CRISIS WAS 93

 BODY:
Former President Gerald R. Ford, who was thrust into the presidency in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal but who lost his own bid for election after pardoning President Richard M. Nixon, has died, according to a statement issued late last night by his wife, Betty Ford. 
 He was 93, making him the longest living former president, surpassing Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004, by just over a month. 
The statement did not give a cause, place or time of death, but Mr. Ford, the 38th president, had been in and out of the hospital since January 2006 when he suffered pneumonia, most recently in October at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., for medical tests. He returned to his home in Rancho Mirage after five days of hospitalization.
 ''My family joins me in sharing the difficult news that Gerald Ford, our beloved husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather has passed away at 93 years of age,'' Mrs. Ford said in a statement issued from her husband's office in Rancho Mirage, also the location of the Betty Ford Center. ''His life was filled with love of God, his family and his country.'' 
 President Bush praised Mr. Ford for his contributions to the nation ''in an hour of national turmoil and vision,'' in a statement released early today from his ranch in Texas.
 ''With his quiet integrity, common sense, and kind instincts, President Ford helped heal our land and restore public confidence in the presidency,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The American people will always admire Gerald Ford's devotion to duty, his personal character, and the honorable conduct of his administration.''
 Mr. Ford, who was the only person to lead the country without having been elected as president or vice president, occupied the White House for just 896 days -- starting from a hastily arranged ceremony on Aug. 9, 1974, and ending with his defeat by Jimmy Carter in 1976. But they were pivotal days of national introspection, involving America's first definitive failure in a war and the first resignation of a president. 
 After a decade of division over Vietnam and two years of trauma over the Watergate scandals, Jerry Ford, as he called himself, radiated a soothing familiarity. He might have been the nice guy down the street suddenly put in charge of the nation, and if he seemed a bit predictable, he was also safe, reliable and reassuring. He placed no intolerable intellectual or psychological burdens on a weary land, and he lived out a modest philosophy. ''The harder you work, the luckier you are,'' he said once in summarizing his career. ''I worked like hell.'' 
 Gerald Rudolph Ford was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha to Leslie Lynch King and Dorothy Ayer King. He rose to House minority leader in 1963 and served in the House until 1973, when Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned, and President Nixon appointed Mr. Ford to succeed Mr. Agnew. 
 When Mr. Ford took the oath of president in 1974, the economy was in disarray, an energy shortage was worsening, allies were wondering how steadfast the United States might be as a partner and Mr. Nixon, having resigned rather than face impeachment for taking part in the Watergate cover-up, was flying to seclusion in San Clemente, Calif. 
 There was a collective sense of relief as Mr. Ford, in the most memorable line of his most noteworthy speech, declared that day, ''Our long national nightmare is over.''

HEADLINE: High-Design Makeover For an Old Italian Firm

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE

 BODY:
WHETHER it's in the middle of the night or of a creative thought, Ross Lovegrove, the award-winning British designer, always answers when the call is from Patrizia Moroso, creative director of the Italian upholstery company Moroso, founded by her parents more than 50 years ago. 
 Once, Mr. Lovegrove said, ''it was 2 or 3 in the morning, and she was talking excitedly about some design idea.''
 ''It must have been about 45 minutes,'' he said, ''before she asked, 'Ross, caro, where are you anyway?' And I said, 'Uh, the Philippines.' ''
 ''With Patrizia,'' he added, ''it's never a professional relationship -- it's personal. And when she commits to you, it's forever. It makes you want to fight to give her your best.'' 
 With her short black bob, cherubic smile and signature outbursts, Ms. Moroso, 51, has built her business on that spirit. She has remade Moroso, once known for its stolid upholstery, into a fast-breaking contemporary furniture brand that prides itself on cajoling both well-established and newly tapped design talents into performing at the top of their game. 
 In the spring the company will open its first New York store, called Moroso at Moss, in SoHo. This complex venture with the design swami Murray Moss involves taking over 2,000 square feet once occupied by the original Moss store, plus a lower level. The cool objects Moss is known for will be spread out to accessorize equally cool sofas and chairs from Moroso; the companies will also collaborate on lines to be available only at Moss. 
 Although her success brings to mind Miuccia Prada's high-design revival of another venerable Italian family firm, Ms. Moroso is not a designer herself. ''I hope to be a lucky charm for people,'' she said. ''Every year my big ambition is to find people with something to say and to show and to put that person under the big lights.'' She was speaking over lunch this fall while in New York to celebrate a Moroso-made collaboration -- part chair, part garment -- between the fashion designer Issey Miyake and the furniture artist Ron Arad. 
 In recent years Moroso has tapped just about every major design talent, including, in addition to Mr. Arad and Mr. Lovegrove, Marc Newson, Marcel Wanders, Konstantin Grcic and Tord Boontje. The company is credited as well with giving the first impetus to a rarity in today's design world: a female star, Patricia Urquiola, whose Fjord chair for Moroso is in the Museum of Modern Art's design collection. 
 ''You see companies with one or two design stars, but to see 15 fantastic designers, that's really unusual,'' said Phil Robinson, director of the annual International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York. 
 As the roster grows, Ms. Moroso increasingly helps set the agenda for contemporary design. The recent craze for intense patterning can be traced almost directly to Mr. Boontje's laser-cut floral fabric screens for Moroso in 2004. ''Moroso is definitely a trendsetter, especially for the anti-modernist streak appearing in design right now that favors the etched, the floral, the textured, the organic and the brightly colored,'' said Julie Lasky, editor in chief of I.D. Magazine, a trade journal on design. 
 In conversation at a downtown restaurant, Ms. Moroso managed to mix name-dropping suavity, sharp business acumen and gabby girl talk with an effortlessness that could be described only as Italian. Choosing a designer is ''like choosing a friend,'' she said, picking at an arugula salad and removing a bulky beaded ring made by a pal whenever she wanted to write down the name of anything unpronounceable. ''You cannot program how you find talent. It's usually someone who talks a little funny -- you know, not in the normal way. I just know immediately.'' 
 She described one of her first encounters with Ms. Urquiola, who has since become a selling powerhouse not only at Moroso but also at such other Italian brands as B&B Italia and Kartell. At the time, Ms. Urquiola had just stopped working for another designer and gone into business on her own. 
 ''She came to me with an idea for a couch,'' Ms. Moroso recalled. ''And you know I am so used to seeing technical drawings and maquettes and so forth. But she built her model right in front of me entirely out of felt, layering it piece by piece. And I said, 'Ecco -- we have to work together.' '' 
 By American standards, Moroso today is a small but healthy private company, on par with a fashion house like Stella McCartney. It has $30 million to $40 million in annual sales, according to Ben Watson, the managing director of Moroso U.S.A. It's also one of the last of a kind that flourished in Italy after World War II: the entirely family-run operation. 
 At the Moroso factory in Udine, an hour or so north of Venice, Ms. Moroso's parents -- Augustino and Diana, now in their 70s -- come to work every day, as does her brother, Roberto, who handles the business side while she runs the creative side. Ms. Moroso grew up at the factory, playing on the floor while her parents worked. ''Family legend says there was music all day, and in the evening there was dancing,'' she said. ''They worked with so much gusto, and very quickly they had a big company.''
 She went to college in Bologna hoping to become an artist. But in the late 70s the Italian economy was in crisis, and so was the company. ''I got the call -- 'You have to come home now' -- and I was crying and so upset,'' Ms. Moroso remembered, turning down her mouth with a look of mock devastation that once must have been quite genuine. ''And I agreed, but only if I could do things my way.'' 
 Her first bold move as creative director was to hire Massimo Iosa Ghini. Now an established furniture designer, he was then a cartoonist. She translated the shapes in his drawings, inspired by Italian Futurism crossed with American streamlining, into furniture and made an international splash. 
 Much of Moroso's business today is dedicated to furniture destined for hotels, offices and cruise ships. Without knowing exact financial details of Moroso, Mr. Robinson of the International Contemporary Furniture Fair noted that its elaborate displays at international trade shows, as well as its new ventures in the United States and its large number of new products in recent years, indicate a growth spurt. 
 ''The new affiliation with Moss is a shrewd move,'' said Michele Caniato, president of Culture and Commerce, a design management company in New York. ''He gets her noticed, and she establishes his connection to the working design world.'' Like Fred and Ginger, but in reverse: he gives her sex appeal; she shows he's got technical savvy. 
 Ms. Moroso's intense involvement has endeared her to designers. Mr. Lovegrove recalled a visit with her to a factory where the mold for his new plastic Supernatural chair was being made. He was unhappy with its shape, so Ms. Moroso donned gloves to help him reshape the scorching polypropylene prototype while it was still soft enough to bend. ''She represents the dynamism we all love about Italy,'' he said.
 Her interest in discovering new design talent has not diminished. Tomek Rygalik was barely out of school when she called him on his cellphone to praise a frameless leather chair he had just designed for a class at the Royal Academy of Art in London. She told him she wanted to feature it at the 2006 International Furniture Fair in Milan (and she did). ''I was cycling home but, of course, had to stop in the middle of the street,'' the 30-year-old designer said. ''It's one of those things you only hope one day will come true.''
 Right now Ms. Moroso is eyeing Tobias Rehberger, the German artist, as well as a little-known design team in London called Doshi Levien, which makes ornamental cookware. 
 Not all her collaborations with designers have been smooth. Mr. Grcic, 31, designed his first product for Moroso in 2004. In a recent phone call from Munich he said he was not happy about his current work with the company. Last year he developed the prototype for his Ultra chair, with a molded plastic seat meant to be as pliant and comfortable as leather or fabric, but he has not yet been able to get the complicated chair into production. 
 ''Maybe I was misled by her passion,'' he said. ''It's hard to give up, but we may be at a dead end.'' 
 Ms. Moroso said she is confident that things will work out. ''I know from experience that sometimes beautiful things can come from changing something, modifying a little here and there,'' she said. 
 In spite of his concerns, Mr. Grcic did speak of an infectious determination in Ms. Moroso that may reveal the secret to her success: ''I'm already thinking ahead about doing something really great. I'm really doing it for her, as a gift for a friend.''

HEADLINE: Home Sales Rose 3.4% Last Month

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Builders sold new homes at a faster rate last month than they did in October, shrinking the backlog of unsold homes on the market, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. 
 But many economists said the report, rather than foreshadowing a quick rebound, highlighted how fragile residential construction remained and suggested that the downturn now rattling the housing market had not yet run its course.
The report showed that sales of new single-family homes rose 3.4 percent in November, seasonally adjusted, to an annual rate of 1.05 million. That followed a 3.8 percent decline in October. 
 The news helped propel stocks on Wall Street to another record high -- its 22nd so far this year -- with the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 100 points to finish the day above 12,500 for the first time.
 It was a session typical of the often-buoyant final trading days of the year in which stocks gain on light volume as investors seek to polish their portfolios. [Page C13.]
 Shares of homebuilders like Pulte Homes, Toll Brothers and Lennar all gained more than 1.5 percent as investors interpreted the home sales numbers as a sign that the slowdown in the housing market may have bottomed out. 
 Economists typically do not use November figures to make generalizations about trends in the housing market because the month is shortened by the Thanksgiving holiday. In fact, when the numbers are not seasonally adjusted, the number of new homes sold in November -- 72,000 -- was the lowest in almost four years. Inventories, a 7.7-month supply unadjusted, were the highest since December 1995.
 ''There's a relatively large adjustment factor here,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. ''I wouldn't read too much into those numbers.''
 At first glance, many numbers in the report seemed to hint at a recovery in new-home sales. The median price of a new home in November rose, for example, and sales in the Northeast, Midwest and West all grew by double digits for the month. Beyond the numbers for November, however, few signs in the report pointed toward a reversal of the overall downward trajectory in residential housing.
 Despite the November advance, sales of new homes are off 15.3 percent compared with a year earlier.
 ''Although the rebound in sales is consistent with the housing slowdown bottoming out, it seems too early to rejoice,'' said Dimitry Fleming, an economist with ING Financial Markets. ''Supply is still high.''
 Many economists do not expect the market to stabilize until mid-2007. 
 When the statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations, the backlog of unsold new homes on the market declined to a 6.3-month supply in November, down from a 6.7-month supply in October. But that is still far higher than November 2005, when there was a 4.9-month supply.
 The median price of a home rose 5.8 percent from November 2005, to $251,700. But economists said the increase was most likely the result of a rise in sales for the month in the Northeast and the West, where homes are more expensive. In November, sales in the Northeast climbed 22.5 percent compared with October, while the West saw a 19 percent jump.
 The sales data from the last year, however, is more sobering. The Northeast was hit particularly hard; sales fell 42.4 percent from a year ago. Sales in the South declined 19.2 percent, and they fell 9 percent in the West. In the Midwest, however, sales rose 1.2 percent.
 Despite the rise in the national median price, economists said the jump in sales during November suggested that buyers were still enjoying a market tilted to their advantage. Builders continue to offer incentives like upgraded kitchen appliances, landscaping and mortgage points at no additional charge. Incentives are not reflected in home price data.
 Julia Coronado, chief United States economist with Barclays Capital, said buyers were still shopping in a market that was highly favorable to them. ''We do know that it's more of a buyer's market, and builders are not eager to sit around with excess inventory on their books. It's extremely expensive to do that, so they move it quickly.''
 Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with the Bank of America, said, ''Despite a monthly rise in the median new home price in November, prices remain on a flattening trend.''
 While the housing market has been in the midst of a sharp slowdown in recent months -- some economists are calling it a full-blown housing recession -- the damage to the broader economy has been limited so far. The decline in residential construction during the summer months knocked more than a full percentage point off the nation's gross domestic product growth, pulling it down to 2 percent in the third quarter.
 But strength in other areas of the economy -- consumer spending and commercial construction, for example -- has helped to keep growth from stalling.
 In another sign of distress in housing, the Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday that its index of applications to buy a home or refinance a loan dropped to the lowest level in four months.

HEADLINE: A New Idea in Security Would Put Vehicle Barriers on a Pavement-Level Turntable 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
IT is easy to criticize haphazard security measures that cannibalize and demean public space.
 It is not so easy to come up with alternatives besides those ever-multiplying sidewalk posts known as bollards. But a couple of intriguing ideas from Rogers Marvel Architects are on view in the Municipal Art Society's Urban Center, at Madison Avenue and 51st Street.
One, an unobtrusive truck barrier, is already a reality at Battery Park City. The other, a turntable barrier, may become a reality next year. 
 The turntable, 20 feet in diameter, would be embedded in Broad Street. It would support a row of posts capable of resisting a heavy speeding truck. There would be room enough between the posts for pedestrians to pass, and the surface would be paved in the same material as the surrounding roadway. 
 Usually, the barrier would be in the closed position, perpendicular to traffic. For authorized vehicles, the turntable would rotate 90 degrees, shifting the row of posts parallel to traffic and creating an opening large enough to drive through.
 Rogers Marvel and its offshoot firm, Rock 12 Security Architecture, designed the turntable to help reclaim the streetscape outside the New York Stock Exchange, which created a seven-block security belt around itself after 9/11. This included makeshift checkpoints at which heavily laden pickup trucks, parked crosswise, blocked the streets.
 Five years later, there are still two pickup trucks at Broad and Beaver Streets, surrounded by concrete planter tubs and police barricades. 
 If the turntable survives the scrutiny of the Police Department and the Art Commission, it will replace the trucks sometime next year. It would be made by the Macton Corporation of Oxford, Conn., one of whose turntables is on stage at the Metropolitan Opera House. 
 This is the second phase of a streetscape program begun in 2003 by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Department of City Planning and the city's Economic Development Corporation.
 In the first phase, temporary barricades around the exchange were replaced with 30-inch-high barriers that Rogers Marvel calls NoGos. Their faceted, polygonal bronze surfaces cover concrete cores weighing a couple of tons. They are large enough and just flat enough to double as benches. The turntable posts would resemble the NoGos, said Graeme Waitzkin of Rock 12.
 What if pedestrians are on the turntable when it begins moving? Robert M. Rogers of Rogers Marvel answered with a question of his own: ''Did your grandmother ever fall down when she was having brunch at the revolving restaurant?'' 
 Rudin Management, the builder and owner of 55 Broad Street, which stands at the checkpoint, supports the project. Asked what made the turntable so attractive, John J. Gilbert III, the chief operating officer at Rudin, said, ''No. 1, it's cool.''
 MUCH less conspicuous is a barrier called a Tiger Trap that Rogers Marvel and the Engineered Arresting Systems Corporation of Aston, Pa., have designed for the Battery Park City Authority. It functions like a moat but looks like landscaping.
 In the Tiger Trap system, which has been installed at Vesey Street and North End Avenue, a threshold made of compressible concrete extends in front of a low wall. The concrete bed is covered with plantings (sedum, in the case of Battery Park City) or paving. It is strong enough to bear the weight of people on foot.
 But if a truck tried to cross it, the concrete threshold would collapse, sending the truck into the barrier wall, which extends several feet below ground. It has been shown to stop a 15,000-pound truck hitting it at 50 miles per hour. Compressible concrete is also used to stop aircraft that overrun the ends of runways.
 ''It's been well tested,'' James E. Cavanaugh, the president and chief executive of the Battery Park City Authority, said yesterday.
 ''Our hope is that we can convince the corporate community to get away from ringing their buildings with bollards,'' he said. ''We want to provide the feeling of a city, rather than an armed camp.''
 ''You know what the obstacle is?'' Mr. Cavanaugh continued. ''When you talk to corporate security people, they like the look of being protected. They like the idea of bollards because it sends a signal to would-be terrorists.'' However, he added, ''anyone who's going to look to breach security at a building is going to do their homework and find out who's protected and who's not.''
 He recalled the attitude among corporations a few years ago when the authority started trying to integrate security less conspicuously into the streetscape. ''There wasn't a lot of sympathy for the direction we were headed in,'' he said. ''But I sense that interest is starting to grow.''
 The turntable and the trap are featured in an exhibition, ''The New Street: Innovation at the Perimeter,'' organized by Rogers Marvel. It runs through Wednesday in the Urban Center Galleries, which are open daily from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., but closed Thursdays and Sundays. Admission is free.

HEADLINE: It's Free, Plentiful And Fickle 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Wind, almost everybody's best hope for big supplies of clean, affordable electricity, is turning out to have complications.
 Engineers have cut the price of electricity derived from wind by about 80 percent in the last 20 years, setting up this renewable technology for a major share of the electricity market. But for all its promise, wind also generates a big problem: because it is unpredictable and often fails to blow when electricity is most needed, wind is not reliable enough to assure supplies for an electric grid that must be prepared to deliver power to everybody who wants it -- even when it is in greatest demand.
In Texas, as in many other parts of the country, power companies are scrambling to build generating stations to meet growing peak demands, generally driven by air-conditioning for new homes and businesses. But power plants that run on coal or gas must ''be built along with every megawatt of wind capacity,'' said William Bojorquez, director of system planning at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. 
 The reason is that in Texas, and most of the United States, the hottest days are the least windy. As a result, wind turns out to be a good way to save fuel, but not a good way to avoid building plants that burn coal. A wind machine is a bit like a bicycle that a commuter keeps in the garage for sunny days. It saves gasoline, but the commuter has to own a car anyway. 
 Xcel Energy, which serves eight states from North Dakota to Texas and says it is the nation's largest retailer of wind energy, is eager to have more. Wind is ''abundant and popular,'' said Richard C. Kelly, the chairman, president and chief executive, speaking at a recent conference on renewable energy. 
 But Frank P. Prager, managing director of environmental policy at the company, said that the higher the reliance on wind, the more an electricity transmission grid would need to keep conventional generators on standby -- generally low-efficiency plants that run on natural gas and can be started and stopped quickly.
 He said that in one of the states the company serves, Colorado, planners calculate that if wind machines reach 20 percent of total generating capacity, the cost of standby generators will reach $8 a megawatt-hour of wind. That is on top of a generating cost of $50 or $60 a megawatt-hour, after including a federal tax credit of $18 a megawatt-hour.
 By contrast, electricity from a new coal plant currently costs in the range of $33 to $41 a megawatt-hour, according to experts. That price, however, would rise if the carbon dioxide produced in burning coal were taxed, a distinct possibility over the life of a new coal plant. (A megawatt-hour is the amount of power that a large hospital or a Super Wal-Mart would use in an hour.)
 Without major advances in ways to store large quantities of electricity or big changes in the way regional power grids are organized, wind may run up against its practical limits sooner than expected.
 At a recent discussion of clean energy technologies held at General Electric's research center in Niskayuna, N.Y, Dan W. Reicher, a former assistant secretary of energy for conservation and renewable energy, predicted that renewables, led by wind, could reach 20 percent of demand in the next decade or two. President Bush has also said that wind could supply 20 percent of the nation's electricity. 
 But Mr. Reicher drew a quick response from James E. Rogers, chief executive of Cinergy, one of the nation's largest utilities, and chairman of the Edison Electric Institute, the industry's trade association. ''I love his optimism,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''But unfortunately, I have to deliver electricity every day.'' 
 Mr. Rogers said that wind and another big renewable source that is available only when nature cooperates, solar power, will be necessary because the government would eventually regulate carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. He later said that his reply to Mr. Reicher had been a ''cheap shot,'' but he and others are still wondering how much wind the nation can absorb. 
 General Electric, a major maker of wind machines, says that along with lowering the price for a megawatt-hour, engineers have made other improvements in wind machines. With better electronic controls, many of them now help stabilize voltage on the grid, and have been cured of their tendency to shut off when detecting a voltage fluctuation, a problem that can escalate into a blackout. 
 Juan de Bedout, manager of the electric power and propulsion systems lab at G.E., said this was more important now because wind machines had grown from a few hundred kilowatts to 1.5 gigawatts, and his company was exploring machines four times bigger than that. ''That's ginormous,'' he said.
 In many places, wind tends to blow best on winter nights, when demand is low. When it is available, power from wind always displaces the most expensive power plant in use at that moment. If wind blew in summer, it would displace expensive natural gas. But in periods of low demand, it is displacing cheap coal.
 And in places where suppliers enter bids each day to supply power on the next day, on an hour-by-hour basis, wind is at a disadvantage. Wider use of wind requires the invention of a new kind of weather forecasting, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., sponsored by the utility industry and its suppliers. Rather than forecasting from temperature or rainfall, what is needed is a focus on almost minute-by-minute predictions of wind in small areas where the turbines are.
 The economics of wind would change radically if the carbon dioxide emitted by coal were assigned a cash value, but in the United States it has none. Coal plants produce about a ton of carbon dioxide each megawatt hour, on average, so a price of $10 a ton would have a major impact on utility economics. 
 Another possibility is energy storage, although this presents other difficulties. 
 In May, Xcel and the Energy Department announced a research program to use surplus, off-peak electricity from wind to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could be burned or run through a fuel cell to make electricity when it was needed most. Xcel plans to invest $1.25 million, and the government $750,000. But storage imposes a high cost: about half the energy put into the system is lost. 
 The Electric Power Research Institute said that existing hydroelectric dams could be used as storage; they can increase and decrease their generation quickly, and each watt generated in a wind machine means water need not be run through the dam's turbines; it can be kept in storage, ready for use later, when it is most needed.
 The institute listed another possibility, still in the exploratory stage: using surplus electricity made from wind to pump air, under pressure, into underground caverns. At peak hours, the compressed air could be withdrawn and injected into generators fired by natural gas. Natural-gas turbines usually compress their own air; compression from wind would cut gas consumption by 40 percent, the institute said. 
 That would help with an important goal, reducing consumption of natural gas, which is increasingly scarce and costly in North America. But not everyone is so sanguine that wind will do that.
 Paul Wilkinson, vice president for policy analysis at the American Gas Association, the trade group for the utilities that deliver natural gas, said that wind, while helpful in making more gas available for home heating and industrial use, would still need a gas generator to back it up. And the units used as backup are generally chosen for low purchase price, not efficient use of fuel. 
 At the American Wind Energy Association, Robert E. Gramlich, the policy director, said that one solution would be to organize control of the electric grid into bigger geographic areas, so that a drop-off in wind in one place would be balanced by an increase somewhere else, reducing the need for conventional backup. That is among several changes the wind industry would like in the electric system; another is easier construction of new power lines, because many of the best wind sites are in prairies or mountain ranges far from where the electricity is needed. 
 A problem for new power lines is that they would be fully loaded for only some of the year, since the amount of energy that the average wind turbine produces over 12 months is equal to just 30 to 40 percent of the amount that would result from year-round operation at capacity. That number runs closer to 90 percent at a nuclear or coal plant. 
 Thus a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant will produce nearly three times as much electricity as 1,000 megawatts of wind turbines. But operating costs at the wind farm are lower, and the fuel is, of course, free.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the difficulties of relying on the wind to provide electricity included an outdated reference to the company led by James E. Rogers, who expressed some concern about wind energy. It is Duke Energy, not Cinergy, which was acquired by Duke. The article also misstated the size of the wind turbines produced by General Electric. They are 1.5 megawatts, not gigawatts.

HEADLINE: Portfolio Polishing Helps Dow Set Record

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrials surged past 12,500 for the first time yesterday as year-end bargain hunters picked up stocks across a variety of sectors.
 The auto industry was in focus after a meeting between executives at Toyota Motor and Ford Motor raised hopes of a potential alliance. Shares of both companies moved sharply higher.
Further takeover activity lent support to the overall market after the McClatchy Company announced late Tuesday that it had agreed to sell The Star Tribune in Minneapolis to a private equity fund. 
 But investors looking to buff their portfolios by year's end were behind most of the gains.
 ''What you're seeing is window dressing,'' said Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher. ''People want to finish up the year looking like they own the best names. And for those that missed the market, they're trying to put their cash to work and play catch-up.''
 Volume was thin again, as is typical of the week between Christmas and New Year's. The New York Stock Exchange began the session with two minutes of silence as a tribute to President Gerald R. Ford; the Nasdaq had a similar observance later in the morning.
 The Dow rose 102.94 points, or 0.83 percent, to a closing record of 12,510.57. The index hit a record trading level of 12,519.22 earlier in the session.
 Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 9.94 points, or 0.70 percent, at 1,426.84, and the Nasdaq rose 17.71 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,431.22.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 9.56 points, or 1.21 percent, at 797.73.
 A Commerce Department report that showed new-home sales rose more than expected in November sent bonds lower. The benchmark10-year Treasury bill fell 13/32, to9925/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.65 percent, from 4.60 percent. Many investors are hoping that signs of economic weakness will motivate the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, so a sign of strength in home sales was troublesome for bondholders. 
 Oil and natural gas continued to fall as mild winter weather depressed demand for heating fuel. The price of a barrel of light, sweet crude fell 76 cents, to $60.34, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Home builders advanced on the home sales report. The data also indicated that inventories fell and that the median price of a new home rose. Hovnanian Enterprises rose 46 cents, to $33.70; Toll Brothers added 60 cents, to $32.29; and KB Home was up 97 cents, at $51.76.
 Ford rose 9 cents, to $7.58, on speculation that it might be in talks about a possible alliance with Toyota. Toyota shares rose $2.65, to $134.26.
 Investors also were tracking the slide of Apple Computer after a legal publication reported that federal prosecutors were investigating whether former company executives forged documents to maximize executives' stock option profits. Shares rose a penny, to $81.52.
 McClatchy, the nation's second-largest daily newspaper publisher after Gannett, said it would sell The Star Tribune to Avista Capital Partners for $530 million. The sale follows a decision earlier this year to spend $4.5 billion to buy the Knight Ridder newspaper chain. Shares of McClatchy fell a penny, to $43.06.

HEADLINE: Universal 401(k) Accounts Would Bring the Poor Into the Ownership Society 

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and co-writes a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com.

 BODY:
Of the current proposals to address income inequality, the universal 401(k) is the most likely to bring general prosperity. 
 The core idea is simple. The federal government creates tax-free retirement accounts for lower-income Americans, supplementing private accounts where they already exist, and matching personal contributions to those accounts. The amount of the match would depend on the income of the family and how much they save.
Gene B. Sperling, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and the best-known proponent of this idea (americanprogress.org/issues/2004/01/b289151.html), calls for a mix of 2-to-1 and 1-to-1 matches, but of course the exact ratios depend on what we are willing to spend. 
 Just as the earned-income tax credit pays poor people to work, the universal 401(k) would pay poor people to save. The idea is to bring the benefits of markets and investing to the poor. An H&R Block study (''Saving Incentives for Low- and Middle-Income Families: Evidence From a Field Experiment With H&R Block,'' by Esther C. Duflo, William G. Gale, Jeffrey Liebman, Peter R. Orszag and Emmanuel Saez, published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics in November) indicated that lower-income Americans have a strong demand for easy-to-use matching retirement accounts. 
 But currently only 55 percent of Americans working full time hold a job with a retirement savings plan; the rate is even lower for part-time workers and the poor. Thus the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers receives only 10 percent of the tax incentives for savings. 
 A universal 401(k) plan would spread these tax benefits more evenly and induce more Americans to save. As in current 401(k) plans, the assets would be protected from creditors, the account would be attached to the individual and thus be portable, and penalties would discourage early withdrawal.
 By directing the benefits toward the neediest, the universal 401(k) savings plan tries to increase economic security in a cost-effective manner. 
 There is an obvious way to pay for a universal 401(k) plan. For every dollar spent on the universal 401(k), the federal government could spend one dollar less on Medicare and Social Security benefits. 
 Economic and fiscal conservatives would be pleased to see government assistance more closely linked to true need, in lieu of expanding programs that subsidize all income levels. Yet the resulting benefit freezes and cuts would apply to all recipients, not just lower-income groups, so the poor would still come out ahead. 
 Since the reform is revenue-neutral, it would not increase tax rates on the work and savings decisions of wealthier Americans. In the longer run, the increased savings and investment would, to some extent, help pay for the additional government transfer of money to the poor. 
 America would move closer to President Bush's vision of an ownership society, while addressing income inequality. The poor get more upfront, and their longer-run gains are greater through the returns on induced savings. Historically, equity returns have far exceeded what banks pay on checking accounts, yet many lower-income Americans have little or no investment in the stock market. 
 Furthermore, if we suspect that globalization and information technology will erode future wage gains, increasing the extent of capital ownership will spread the benefits from economic growth more evenly. 
 It may seem that what the poor need is more money to spend, but the universal 401(k) plan is taking a gamble by encouraging them to lock up more savings. Perhaps support for a culture of savings and discipline is more important than subsidizing additional spending.
 The catch is this: the universal 401(k) plan would split the poor into two classes. The first group would allow savings to accumulate and reap the wonders of compound returns for their old age. But other low-income recipients would undermine the intent of the plan. Either they still would not save or, as the government added to their accounts, they would borrow more elsewhere or behave more irresponsibly toward their future in other ways. Their net positions would not much improve.
 The uncomfortable truth is that many of the most effective antipoverty measures leave more than a few people behind. A leveraged antipoverty plan offers incentives for the poor to change their behavior in a favorable manner; for these incentives to matter, it has to hurt not to save. If a universal 401(k) is to create a culture of savings and investment, it cannot extend the same benefits to all of the poor. 
 Poor Americans who are hit by bad luck, like unforeseen medical expenses, would create a policy dilemma. These individuals might seek to remove funds from their 401(k) accounts, but a generous government match in savings would require tough restrictions on removals. Otherwise, people would just take the savings bonus, and then pull it out, spend it and pay the penalty, circumventing the goal of the plan. 
 A successful universal 401(k) plan would have to be run as a tough-minded investment opportunity and not as a welfare program. It is an open question whether we have the political will to make this work. One option is to spend some money enforcing a medical expenses withdrawal exception, as found in current 401(k) plans. But of course not every negative contingency can be covered.
 A fiscally responsible universal 401(k) plan would not make everyone happy. Libertarians and conservatives would be suspicious of government-created accounts. Liberals might not like freezing or reducing future expenditures on Medicare and Social Security. But if we are looking for policy initiatives that address real-world problems and offer something to each side, encouraging low-income savings is a good place to start.
