HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: AN OVERVIEW: APRIL 5, 2003; 
Lightning Raid in Baghdad, Commando Operations and Postwar Planning

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
 For the first time, American forces led by tanks and armored vehicles thrust into the heart of Baghdad, battling Iraqi troops in the streets for three hours in a rolling firefight that left hundreds of enemy soldiers dead and scores of Iraqi vehicles, rocket launchers and other equipment in smoldering ruins. 
 It was not the beginning of the invasion of the Iraqi capital, but American commanders called it a strategic display of force and a psychological blow that could hasten the fall of Saddam Hussein. "We're not ready to go in and occupy the city," one commander said. "We just wanted to let them know we're here."
INSIDE BAGHDAD -- The attack, after a night of heavy air raids, was mounted at dawn by a battalion of 60 tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and other armored carriers that rumbled into the city from the south. It rolled fast, blasting at Iraqi fighters who fired from streets, groves of trees and highway overpasses.
Many civilians were caught in crossfires. One American tank commander was killed by a grenade, six Americans were wounded, some seriously, and one tank was destroyed. Col. David Perkins, the battalion commander, estimated that more than 1,000 Iraqi fighters had been killed and 100 enemy vehicles destroyed.
IRAQ'S VERSION -- The Iraqi information minister, Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, denied that any American forces were in Baghdad, insisting that Republican Guard forces had "crushed" the Americans and were still in control of the capital. He also said Iraqi troops had driven the Americans from the city's international airport, killing hundreds. "Everything is O.K.," he said, listing victories.
But the Army's Third Infantry Division still held the airport, and American forces were proceeding to encircle and seal off Baghdad in preparation for a final assault on Mr. Hussein's last citadel. As the war drew near, many Baghdad residents heeded their instincts and fled on foot or in cars packed with blankets and belongings.
ON OTHER BATTLEFIELDS -- Helicopter troops of the 101st Airborne Division staged a ground and air assault on Iraqi paramilitary forces in the city of Karbala, southwest of Baghdad, which had been bypassed. Southeast of Baghdad, American marines moving toward the capital clashed with Republican Guard troops and seized the abandoned headquarters of the guard's Medina Division at Suwayra.
To the east, at Aziziya, marines were digging up fresh concrete at a school in search of chemical or biological weapons. At Zubayr, outside Basra, British forces discovered the remains of hundreds of people in bags and boxes at an abandoned Iraqi military base, along with documents and photos showing that the victims had been tortured and disfigured.
COVERT RAIDS -- Throughout the war, Special Operations commandos of the United States, Britain and other coalition partners have been carrying out secret missions across Iraq, even penetrating into the streets of Baghdad to pinpoint targets and hunt down enemy leaders. The largely invisible campaign by 10,000 covert operatives has struck at Mr. Hussein's palaces, knocked out missile launchers, organized Kurdish militiamen, smashed Iraqi command headquarters, interdicted smuggled weapons from Syria, and cleared the way for the largest allied parachute landing of troops since World War II. The teams also helped save oil fields and a dam from sabotage and helped rescue Pfc. Jessica Lynch.
DESIGN FOR POSTWAR IRAQ -- France, Germany and Russia want the United Nations to play the leading role in shaping postwar Iraq. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has called for a substantial U.N. role. But the Bush administration says the United States and its coalition partners will be in charge.
The practical work is going on in Kuwait, where hundreds of American military officers, diplomats and aid experts meet daily with British officials and a handful of Iraqi exiles to plan the shape of Iraq's future government and economy. They envision only a limited role for the United Nations.
IMAMS AS INFORMERS -- In America's war on terrorism, law-enforcement agencies have been recruiting and training a new kind of undercover agent: Muslim clerics. It is unclear how many imams have been recruited, although two dozen graduated in January from a short course in New York on detection and forensic techniques. They are not full-fledged informants, but they report suspicious characters in mosques, act as interpreters for the police and spread the word about crime-fighting programs. Some are worried, however, about implicating innocent people and alienating followers who may regard them as snoops or, worse, spies. ROBERT D. McFADDEN

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
'Scenario planning' explores the many routes chaos could take for business in these very uncertain days.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
STEP back from the war in Iraq for a few moments, if possible. The larger picture -- a struggling global economy and no shortage of geopolitical tensions -- looks pretty dicey. Now, imagine that events veer toward something close to a worst case. What are the implications, and how could companies cope in such an environment?
 That was the drill when a couple dozen business executives, academics and futurists gathered in New York for a two-day workshop conducted by the Global Business Network, a firm that specializes in so-called scenario planning. The resulting 36-page report, "The New World (Dis)Order: Managing Risk in Tumultuous Times," has been sent to the firm's clients, including I.B.M., Ford, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, UPS, Morgan Stanley and the government of Singapore. 
 Here are some excerpts from the gloom-and-doom script: Japan goes bankrupt. Al Qaeda cements alliances with Palestinian extremists and sets off a series of terrorist attacks, mostly in Israel, hoping to create a political split in the Western alliance to thwart Qaeda-sponsored terrorism.
There are more: The belief in globalization as a benevolent economic force is shaken further, rendering the International Monetary Fund and World Bank all but irrelevant. In the United States, a new government organization, the Home Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, is created to set the national agenda for technology research, shifting the emphasis from ubiquitous computing and biotechnology to focus on the security economy. Meanwhile, major cracks develop in the world legal order protecting intellectual property rights, threatening the livelihoods of companies like I.B.M., Microsoft and Merck.
"It's all completely plausible," insisted Steven Weber, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley who wrote the pessimistic, if plausible, story line for the workshop.
The meeting occurred in January, when a war with Iraq was assumed but projected mainly as a "catalyst for other shocks and challenges," according to the report.
"This is about the bigger picture," said Mr. Weber, who directed the workshop and is also a member of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy.
Scenario planning is intended not to predict the future but to prod people to think more broadly, unconventionally, and perhaps view events with a new perspective. "These kinds of exercises prepare the mind's eye to see change when it occurs," explained Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a unit of the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm.
The peril of even fine minds thinking too narrowly, Mr. Schwartz says, was illustrated by the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, which nearly collapsed in 1998 because its brilliant traders and Nobel prize-winning economists did not foresee events beyond their risk models. Their efficient-market theories proved incapable of coping with the turmoil in the global financial markets after Russia defaulted.
A participant in the workshop, Andy Hines, a senior manager for business development at the Dow Chemical Company, said he benefited from listening to experts in geopolitics and others from disciplines far from his own. "The real value is people who yank the conversation in places you never thought of," he said.
One such presentation came from Joseph Fuller, the chief executive of the Monitor Group's Action Company, who questioned the management assumptions of recent years. Mr. Fuller noted that a generation of executives has been taught that "speed is good, commitment is good, make your decision and go for it." Yet in more uncertain, turbulent times, the priority may be on keeping alternatives open instead of the speed of making single-path decisions. In 10 years, Mr. Fuller said, venturing a prediction, business schools will not teach topics like discounted cash flow calculations but will instead teach executives how to analyze their options.
A higher-risk world could require the rethinking of many tenets of conventional business wisdom. The canons of globalization included shopping the world for low-cost parts, developing tighter relationships with fewer suppliers, and deploying an itinerant corps of key managers and engineers who were willing to travel anywhere on a moment's notice to meet a customer or solve a problem. Those assumptions would all be challenged if more developing nations, in particular, became politically unstable.
Another arena of possible instability, according to the scenario planners, is intellectual property rights. For Mr. Weber, the crisis in the music industry over digital piracy and file-sharing software is just the beginning of the problem, which he says goes beyond the entertainment industry. Hollywood, software publishers and pharmaceutical companies have all assumed that the United States government, through international trade agreements, would be the trusted world policeman enforcing intellectual property rights.
Yet Mr. Weber points to what happened when worries over anthrax and bioterrorism surfaced in October 2001. After the Canadian government overrode Bayer's patent for Cipro, an antibiotic used to treat anthrax, some senators said the United States should follow Canada's lead. The Bush administration resisted and anthrax fears soon waned.
The incident, however, should be unnerving to corporations whose businesses are deeply dependent on intellectual property protection, Mr. Weber says.
"The conceptual and political foundation for intellectual property rights is really insecure," said Mr. Weber, who is writing a book on open source software -- code that is distributed for free.
Already, some legal scholars have advocated that the duration of most forms of intellectual property protection should be shortened. What, Mr. Weber asks, might be the effect on intellectual-property companies like Microsoft, I.B.M. or Merck? "It has the potential to be a bit like the crash in the telecommunications business," he observed. "Is there is an I.P. bubble in technology companies? There could be."
Or not. After all, times and situations change. Indeed, Mr. Schwartz is perhaps best known as the champion of "The Long Boom," which was the basis for a cover story in Wired magazine and a book published in 1999, written by Mr. Schwartz, Peter Leyden and Joel Hyatt. Its vision of almost unabashed technological and free-market optimism held out the possibility of what Mr. Schwartz called "a global economic boom on a scale never experienced before," running from the mid-1990's through about 2020. There is, to be sure, a long way to go on that one -- 17 years, either to realize the Long Boom vision or to refute it.
Then again, Mr. Schwartz and his Global Business Network also contributed its thinking to a government commission on national security that was led by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman. The commission's report, "New World Coming: American Security in the 21st Century," published in 1999, warned that the United States was "increasingly vulnerable to attack on our homeland," that "rapid advances in information and biotechnologies will create new vulnerabilities" for American security, and that "new technologies will divide the world as well as draw it together."
Of war, the Hart-Rudman commission warned that its essence would not change. "There will be casualties, carnage and death," the commission report said. "It will not be like a video game."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Untethering From Clunky PC Box, Silicon Valley Hikes Wireless Frontier

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Eric Engstrom spent seven lucrative and exhilarating years at Microsoft -- working on big projects, making a name for himself, even testifying on the company's behalf in its federal antitrust trial. But in 2000, Mr. Engstrom walked away from Microsoft and the personal computer industry, which seemed to have settled into maturity. He founded his own company and set off to pursue innovation and riches elsewhere.
 "The opportunities are out on the edge, and the edge of software development has got to be the phone," said Mr. Engstrom, 38, the chief executive of Wildseed, a start-up in Kirkland, Wash. 
 Mr. Engstrom personifies the migration of talent, excitement and investment in computing toward the wireless business as cellphones become more like computers and hand-held computers morph into phones. To veterans of past cycles in technology, the wireless world today has the look of the personal computer business in the late 1970's or the Internet in the early 1990's. 
"It's starting to happen, it's getting exciting again," observed Esther Dyson, who plays host to PC Forum, an annual gathering of technology executives, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists that was held late last month in Scottsdale, Ariz. PC Forum began in 1977. But now the PC stands not for "personal computer" but "Platforms for Communication."
The economics of wireless is still unclear and technology standards are not yet in place. Nor does the move to wireless computing spell the death of the personal computer, any more than the rise of the PC meant the demise of the mainframe computer. But as wireless telephony and computing combine, the center of gravity in digital technology is clearly shifting.
"People see the PC as played out, and they are looking for new technology platforms to build new businesses on," said Brad Silverberg, a former senior Microsoft executive who left three years ago and is the founder of Ignition, a venture capital firm that has invested in wireless businesses, including Mr. Engstrom's start-up.
The wireless convergence of phones and computers is made possible by steady progress in chip making, memory and miniaturization. Today's advanced cellphones have the equivalent computing power of the desktop PC's of the mid-1990's. 
Yet while the trend of advancing technology is clear, little else is apparent. What companies, products, services and technology standards will emerge as leaders in the wireless arena is still uncertain. And that is because the real competition has barely begun.
More than 450 million cellphones will be sold worldwide this year, industry analysts predict. But less than 10 percent of those will be the cellphone-computer hybrids -- sometimes called smart phones -- that can handle not just short text messages, but also send and receive e-mail, display color photos and video, play music and games with rich graphics, and browse the Web.
"These hand-held smart phones are the frontier, but we're just getting to the point where they are beginning to be widely distributed," said Berge Ayvazian, president of the Yankee Group, a research firm.
The wireless computing field today resembles the PC business a quarter of a century ago: people were excited by the opportunities, technology standards were not yet established, start-ups proliferated and many failed as the economy was in doldrums.
"It feels eerily similar in some ways," said David Nagel, a former executive at Apple Computer and now the chief executive of PalmSource, whose Palm operating system is used on some smart phones. "But this new era in computing is much more complicated."
The added complexity is the result of a number of forces -- government regulation of telecommunications, multiple layers of competing technologies, and an unruly crowd of major telecommunications carriers, computer companies, cellphone makers and upstarts in all these fields vying for a piece of the business.
Competing technology standards in wireless is one source of industry uncertainty. At the level of "radio protocols" for handling calls and data exchange, there are currently two main standards -- the global system for mobile, or GSM, and code division multiple access, or CDMA.
Qualcomm, a wireless technology company based in San Diego, developed CDMA, and its users include Sprint, Verizon Wireless, all of South Korea, and several other companies overseas. GSM was a standard nurtured in Europe, and its champions include Nokia and other European companies, AT&T Wireless, Cingular and T-Mobile in the United States. About three-fourths of cellphone subscribers worldwide use GSM. In the United States, about 40 percent of subscribers use CDMA.
Meanwhile competition for the software to animate the new hybrid computer-phones is just getting under way. An early leader is the operating system made by Symbian, a British company with several cellphone makers as investors, including Nokia, Motorola, Siemens and Sony Ericcson. But Microsoft is pushing its Stinger operating system, Qualcomm has Brew, PalmSource offers Palm, and the freely distributed Linux is starting to gain adherents, too. Sun Microsystems and I.B.M. are promoting software based on Java, which Sun created, as a layer that can run on any operating system.
These different approaches -- whether operating systems or Java -- are a step toward a more "open" technology platform for the cellphone business. In the past, each cellphone maker typically had its own embedded operating system tailored for its phones. The new generation of wireless operating systems can run on devices made by various manufacturers.
In the PC industry, the business took off when software developers had a standard operating system that ran on standard silicon chips, which became a technology platform on which many thousands of applications, from business programs to games, were built. Those standards for the PC industry came to be dominated by Microsoft's Windows operating system and Intel's microprocessor.
In wireless computing, most analysts expect the number of software platforms to diminish over the next few years, but with no single technology ruling the industry as Microsoft does in PC's. Indeed, Microsoft's strength in the PC market has somewhat worked against it in the wireless field as handset makers in particular seek software alternatives like Symbian and Java. Cellphone makers say they want to avoid being beholden to Microsoft, which owns the crucial Windows software for PC's and collects much of the industry's profits.
Sun Microsystems estimates that 75 million cellphones with Java technology were shipped last year. "We're way ahead of Microsoft in the wireless market," said Mark Tolliver, Sun's chief strategy officer. "We're building a big platform, attracting a developer community and creating a business opportunity for companies in the wireless industry."
Microsoft, too, sees plenty of opportunity. Its strategy seems to rely on bringing the familiar desktop functions of e-mail, address lists, calendar programs and Web browsing to the new smart phones. It hopes eventually to persuade a portion of the millions of software developers who write programs that run on Windows, mostly specialized software for use inside corporations, to write applications tailored for Microsoft's smart phone operating system.
"We're all entering a market that doesn't really exist yet," said Ed Suwanjindar, a product manager at Microsoft.
Indeed, there are many obstacles still to be overcome. Financially strained telecommunications companies have been reluctant to invest in the high-speed wireless technology needed to deliver video clips and other multimedia to smart phones with color screens. One of the reasons European carriers are so burdened with debt is that they spent more than $100 billion merely to license the radio spectrum needed for high-speed, third-generation wireless, or 3G. South Korea and Japan are the leaders in embracing 3G technology.
As a less costly transition step, a number of companies are working on software that would link cellphone networks with Wi-Fi, also known as wireless fidelity, the increasingly popular technology that uses unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver high-speed Internet access wirelessly to notebook computers. The software would allow high-speed links near local Wi-Fi hubs and lower-speed connections to the Internet elsewhere in a service described as "seamless roaming" by Rod Atkins, general manager of I.B.M.'s pervasive computing unit.
The entrepreneurial programmers writing for the wireless market want their software, from games to business applications, to be distributed as widely as possible.
"We're on the cusp of the mobile Internet experience, but the key is going to be making sure the technological architecture of this world is open," said William Plummer, Nokia's vice president for government and industry affairs. "The better it is for developers to write programs or services that work with many handsets and across networks globally, the better off we will all be."
Last June, the Open Mobile Alliance was created to further that goal. Its 16 founding companies include Nokia, Motorola, I.B.M., Microsoft and Sun, and the alliance now has 300 corporate members. The group is pushing to reach agreement on technology standards so that wireless computing can, like the Internet, work as an open network where data, voice and video can be passed among many telecommunications carriers and devices. A year ago, for example, it was difficult to send short text messages between carriers. No longer.
Today, multimedia messages carrying photos, animation or music files can only be exchanged with someone who has the same kind of cellphone over the same network. Within a year, that barrier may also fall away.
Start-ups like Wildseed see enough promise in the wireless sector to press ahead. The company has designed specialized software and cellphone "skins" that change the look and operation of a smart phone so that it can combine a phone with a gaming machine, music player or video platform -- tailored to a person's favorite games, rock stars, sports teams or fashion tastes. Besides having different colors and styles, the skins, or faceplates, also have embedded chips storing specific Wildseed software. Its backbone software is also loaded on the cellphone.
The company hopes to attract 12- to 24-year-olds, and its first products are coming to market later this year on smart phones made by Kyocera Wireless of Japan and early next year by Curitel of South Korea. Wildseed plans to charge $25 to $50 for its themed "smart skins" as well as charging carriers and cellphone makers a license fee for its software.
While expectations are high, there's also a healthy dose of realism in the wireless world. As Michael Kwatinetz, who for years was a leading PC analyst on Wall Street and is now one of Wildseed's venture backers, observed, "You can get the trends right, but the timing wrong."
The operating style for start-ups these days is far different from the free-spending days of the dot-com boom years of the late 1990's. On the subject of company perks, Todd Ferkingstad, a 33-year-old engineer who left Microsoft to join Wildseed, cited the takeout dinners provided on "work-late Tuesdays," when the programmers stay into the night. "That's about as extravagant as we get," he said.

HEADLINE: Travel Fears Cause Some to Commute Online 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
As fears of terrorism, the mysterious respiratory disease known as SARS and consequences of the Iraq war have mounted over the last several weeks, many businesses are reducing travel in favor of virtual meetings, and more employees are learning how to telecommute.
 The Sprint Corporation has seen minutes spent on teleconferences spike in recent months, rising 23 percent in March from February, and 58 percent from March of last year for its top customers, according to Jackie Bostick, a spokeswoman for the company. Sprint expects to have more growth in the coming weeks as businesses squeezed by the slow economy and constrained by travel fears switch to Web-conferences, video conferences and old-fashioned telephone conference calls. 
 AT&T has also experienced an increase in use recently, said a spokesman, Michael P. Cuno. "It's nothing that we would attribute to the Middle East situation per se," Mr. Cuno said. "The trend that we're seeing has developed over several months." 
Increases in investments in technology that allow companies to hold virtual meetings and employees to work remotely date back to the weeks and months after Sept. 11, according to telecommuting consultants. Now some executives and employees say the new capabilities are beginning to be used more often, though teleconferencing is still a tiny fraction of what is spent on regular telephone calls or on business travel.
At Fulbright & Jaworski, a law firm based in Houston, more lawyers are holding meetings using videoconference technology: 13 last month, compared with just four or five a month last summer. Likewise, lawyers at Morrison & Foerster, a large law firm with several offices in Asia, "certainly are using our teleconferencing capability a lot more," said Keith Wetmore, the firm's chairman.
And at HSBC, which has curtailed all non-essential travel to Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam as a result of concerns about SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a spokeswoman said that teleconferences and videoconferences would probably become more common.
But technology is not always a substitute for an in-person meeting, especially one involving a large group of people. "It's not really practical to say no one's going to travel between the China offices," Mr. Wetmore said.
The Sept. 11 attacks forced companies to evaluate telecommuting and teleconferencing as part of their business plans, said Timothy J. Kane, chief executive of Kinetic Workplace, a consulting firm in Pittsburgh. "Many of those programs are up and in place now," he said. 
But several consultants said they doubted the use of virtual meetings and telecommuting would necessarily increase. "After 9/11, we conducted a survey to see how that changed attitudes," said Bob Smith, executive director of the International Telework Association and Council, or ITAC. "It changed a bit, but quite frankly not dramatically."
Spokesmen for several companies agreed that the shift has not been drastic. "It's an ongoing activity, making good use of whatever technology we have available," said Gerald Davis, a spokesman for Sunoco. "I wouldn't say that because of the geopolitical situation and the strife and the war that we have altered any activities, but you always have to be prudent," he said.
I.B.M., where more than one-third of the company's roughly 310,000 employees already work from remote locations using laptops and other tools, has developed its own technology so that employees can hold teleconferences more easily, said Jim Sinocchi, a spokesman for the company. "What we've done over the past five years or more is start to deploy the equipment," Mr. Sinocchi said. "When world events mandate that you not travel for any reason, we're already set up."
Employees at Cisco Systems, another high-tech company, have alsoalready grown accustomed to meeting via Internet or by videoconferences, said Abby Smith, a company spokeswoman. And at AT&T, 17 percent of managers work full time as telecommuters, said Joseph Roitz, who coordinates and directs such work at AT&T. "We've seen an upswing in terms of our employed teleworkers. But it goes back several years, even before 9/11," he said. "The big driver is really time. I don't really see fear driving a lot of the telework. I haven't seen any major upswing in demand since the whole Iraq thing kicked off."
Identifying any such increase in teleconferencing and telecommuting is difficult. "There aren't surveys or polls," said Joanne H. Pratt, head of Joanne H. Pratt Associates, which studies telecommuting trends.
She pointed out that people are now better equipped to work from home because of broadband connections to the Internet. Still, Ms. Pratt said she was disappointed that more companies were not more generous in providing technology to support telecommuting. "I think it's still the reluctance of management to trust that employees will work when they're at home," she said.
But companies that provide products and services for virtual meetings and telecommuting are optimistic. Pixion, a 45-employee company in Pleasanton, Calif., that markets software to hold conferences on the Web, is hoping for a big increase in demand, and recently offered free Web conferencing to the first 5,000 American companies to sign up. 
"We've been seeing a lot of interest," said Charles Orlando, the director of marketing for Pixion, which is privately held and does not disclose sales information.
CKE Restaurants, owner of restaurant chains including Hardee's, is a Pixion client. Travel has dropped as much as two-thirds for some categories of employees, said Tom Lindblom, CKE's chief technology officer. While the company's road warriors are still traveling, he said, other employees -- trainers, product development experts and others whose jobs do not require constant travel -- are now much more likely to stay where they are.
"We don't require people to travel who aren't comfortable traveling," Mr. Lindblom said.

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo; 
What Price War? It's Too Soon to Tell, But Expect the Final Tab to Be High

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4 

 BODY:
The price of war is usually measured in blood, but the number of dollars required can also be staggering. Though it is too early to know how expensive the war in Iraq will ultimately be, members of Congress paid a first installment this week that gives a glimpse of the high costs -- and the possible trade-offs -- yet to come.
 Late Thursday night, both houses of Congress finished their initial votes on legislation to pay for the war. By the time they added indirectly related costs for domestic security, foreign aid and airline assistance, the bill had risen to nearly $80 billion -- the largest single supplemental appropriation, as these unexpected spending bills are known, in Congressional history. 
 By way of comparison, that is roughly twice the size of the annual budget of New York City. It is more money than Michigan, Massachusetts or 40 other states sent to the Internal Revenue Service in taxes last year. It is more than the entire 2003 budgets of the federal departments of Agriculture, Education or Justice. And it is five times the annual budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
But this may be only the beginning. Of the $80 billion in the bill, about $63 billion will be spent directly on the war, but half that amount was committed to getting the troops there and back, and the Pentagon says the rest will run out if the war lasts much longer than a month or two. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that the continuing cost of fighting a war with Iraq would be up to $9 billion a month.
"I have no doubt that we will incur more costs for the war before the fiscal year is over" in September, said James W. Dyer, staff director for the Republican majority on the House Appropriations Committee. "When you consider the stress on the military, all the troop deployments they've got all over the world, all the weaponry and the size of the force, you've got yourself a pretty expensive deal. I expect they'll come back to us with another supplemental request soon."
Occupying and reconstructing Iraq after the war could cost $20 billion a year, according to a study released last month by a special task force of the Council on Foreign Relations. That amount assumes that the United States keeps 75,000 troops in Iraq as a stabilization force, but if more troops are required to quell continuing small rebellions, "the funding requirement would be much greater," the task force report said. 
Administration officials say the cost of war and rebuilding is a small fraction of what the country would pay to recover from another terrorist attack, or from the use of weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein against Americans.
"The cost of Sept. 11 is measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars -- $100 billion right out of taxpayers' pockets and, by the estimates we've made, $225 billion on up to $400 billion or $500 billion of damage done to the economy," a senior administration official told reporters at the White House last week, after President Bush released his spending request. "So money spent to reduce the chance of further events, perhaps even more horrific than that one, is money well spent."
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Friday that this war would be particularly expensive, because of the precision weaponry needed to avoid damaging civilian areas and the cost of protecting against a chemical attack.
"A high-tech war like this one may cost a little more per dollar, but look at the lives that are being saved," Senator Warner said. "We lost 41,000 Americans in the Battle of the Bulge, but we've had only 61 casualties so far. I'd much rather have our savings in lives than in dollars."
But many Democrats and liberal budget analysts say the administration's ability to come up with an instant $80 billion, near the end of a fiscal year, undermines its argument that there is not enough money to pay for a variety of social programs now facing cuts. The budget resolution passed by the House last week would cut Medicaid by $92 billion and child nutrition programs by $5.8 billion over 10 years, in part to pay for the $726 billion tax cut proposed by Mr. Bush. It includes no money to keep troops in Iraq, so by the time those costs are evident, the budget will be squeezed even further.
"The war provides an easier rhetorical justification for the Republicans to start squeezing these programs, to find something to sacrifice to come up with the costs," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization in Washington. "It's a lot easier than saying the sacrifices are necessary for the tax cut."
A group of House Democrats plans to introduce a bill next week to require that the administration spend as much on building schools and hospitals in the United States as it plans to spend on the same activities in postwar Iraq. The bill has little chance of passage, but its sponsors intend to use it as an illustration of what they call the administration's misplaced priorities.
"When you talk about access to quality schools or health care for the uninsured, there's no money for it -- they can't find the checkbook," said Representative Rahm Emanuel, an Illinois Democrat and a former Clinton administration official who is one of the sponsors of the measure. "But for Iraq, they've got a credit card with an unlimited amount."
Congressional budget officials say the credit card analogy is apt, because all the money for the war will have to be borrowed. The 2003 budget was already in the red by $246 billion before the war, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and all new spending for the war will simply be piled on top of the deficit. But even though some moderate Republicans are now so concerned about the red ink that they are trying to reduce the tax cut, there were almost no voices in Congress dissenting from the price of the war itself.
"Do we have any alternative?" Mr. Warner asked. "We're there fighting for our freedom -- for the freedom of future generations, too. What price do you put on that?"

HEADLINE: New Deal Puts Fresh Face on Proposal for Indian Casino in Catskills 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Many people in the Catskills thought Robert A. Berman's dream of building a $500 million casino at the Monticello Raceway died -- just like every other scheme to resurrect the faded resort area once known as the borscht belt -- when he lost his American Indian partners three years ago.
 But on Friday, Mr. Berman, who grew up just outside Monticello and is chairman of Alpha Hospitality, resurfaced, signing a definitive agreement to build a casino next to the aging track in partnership with the Cayuga Nation, a tribe that has traditionally opposed gambling. The two partners plan to apply this week with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to allow Alpha, which owns the racetrack, to transfer 30 adjacent acres to the tribe. The company would develop a casino resort with hotels, restaurants and retail shops on that land. 
 "From the first day we got involved in this nine years ago, we wanted to bring casino gambling to the Catskills and revitalize the area," Mr. Berman said. "Our intentions never changed." 
Clint Halftown, a leader of the Cayugas, a federally recognized tribe that does not have a reservation, was enthusiastic about the plans after a three-year tribal debate over gambling. "The Cayuga people have been landless and in economic distress for over 200 years," he said. "Our people need housing, education, medical care and the means to keep links to our culture and land. A casino would bring economic life back to Sullivan County as well as our nation."
But the road to gambling has proven treacherous in New York, where there are battles among casino operators, intertribal rivalries and a constitutional challenge to the October 2001 legislation authorizing Gov. George E. Pataki to negotiate with Indian tribes for six casino resorts, three in western New York and three in the Catskills. So far only one has opened, the Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls. But there has been little progress in the Catskills, which everyone agrees is potentially the most lucrative location because it is only 90 miles from New York City.
The greatest ally for those who favor gambling may be the weakening economy of of the state, which faces a $11.5 billion budget gap and is borrowing $600 million against the projected revenues from the six casinos.
"I find the governor's lack of progress regarding casinos in the Catskills somewhat incredible since they would be big money generators," said Assemblyman Jake Gunther, a Democrat who represents Sullivan County. "It's a paradox."
State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican from New Paltz, agreed. "Progress has been incredibly slow," he said. "We have been encouraging the governor to negotiate with the tribes and put a Catskill casino on the fast track."
Mr. Berman started planning an Indian casino in 1994. He said he first approached the Cayuga tribe, but they were not interested in gambling. His group, then known as Catskill Development, signed an agreement with the St. Regis Mohawks, beginning an arduous four-year effort to gain federal approval.
In April 2000, the Bureau of Indian Affairs granted the project tentative approval. But a week later the Mohawks suddenly renounced their partners and signed an unusual and exclusive arrangement with Park Place Entertainment, the largest gambling company in the world, in exchange for a $3 million loan. That sparked a bitter legal battle that continues to this day.
Trying to revive the project at the raceway, Mr. Berman went back to the Cayugas, but once again they rejected a casino as antithetical to Indian values. However, the debate within the tribe continued.
"For a long time our nation was anti-gaming," Mr. Halftown said. "We always sought resolution of our land claim and monetary damages. We've been in litigation for 23 years, and I don't know how much longer it'll go on. Now we have to explore other possibilities that can bring economic prosperity to our nation."
But Mr. Berman and his partners also had to deal with internal problems of their own. Alpha Hospitality's founder, Stanley S. Tollman, and four other men were indicted a year ago on tax evasion charges in connection with a separate hotel company. Mr. Tollman is now a fugitive living in London.
Mr. Berman, who became chairman of Alpha last year, said the company removed Mr. Tollman and the others from their posts and converted their stake in Alpha into a passive interest to satisfy regulators and allow Alpha to continue.
This week the Cayugas and Alpha will file an application with the Bureau of Indian Affairs that is similar to the one that won federal approval in 2002.
Federal officials say the application could move relatively quickly "If it's essentially the same application, it will make things easier," said George Skibine, director of the Indian gaming office at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A state official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and who is involved in talks with Indian tribes said he viewed the Cayuga proposal for a Catskill casino as encouraging.
But nothing is certain. Mr. Berman and the Cayugas must still deal with state and federal regulators and also contend with the Sullivan County Legislature, which wants the Cayugas to pay the county $15 million a year. Two other tribes, the Mohawks and the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians of Wisconsin, have proposed casino resorts nearby and agreed to make the $15 million payment to the county if their projects are approved.
"We'd be thrilled to support a new project at the racetrack," said Ira Jay Cohen, the Sullivan County attorney, "provided the tribe enter into a local service agreement with the county."
But Mr. Berman says that he plans to stick with the $5 million agreement he struck with Monticello in 1996. He contends that under federal law, payments to local communities are designed to mitigate the impact of a casino, not buy political support.
Gary P. Sommers, the mayor of Monticello, is hedging his bets.
"Our general feeling is that we have an agreement with the Berman group for gaming at the racetrack," Mr. Sommers said. "We'd be more than willing to go along with the county if it was able to get a better deal. But I question whether the $15 million payment will be approved by the B.I.A. I don't think it's enforceable."
Mr. Bonacic and others have lobbied in Albany on behalf of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band and its partner, Trading Cove, which bought 333 acres along Route 17 opposite the raceway to build a $600 million casino, saying that they are well financed and willing to begin construction as soon as they have approval.
"The only real player in this is the Stockbridge-Munsees," said the supervisor of the town of Thompson, Anthony P. Cellini. "If they got approval from Pataki, they'd put a shovel in the ground yesterday."
But Governor Pataki does not recognize the tribe's historic claims to New York, and refuses to negotiate gambling compacts with out-of-state tribes. The Pataki administration is acting in deference to the Oneidas, the St. Regis Mohawks and other New York tribes that have huge land claims in upstate New York.
Mr. Pataki has urged the Bureau of Indian Affairs to approve the St. Regis Mohawk's proposal to build a $500 million casino resort at Kutsher's Country Club, outside Monticello. But negotiations between the tribe and the state over a gambling compact have stalled because of the Pataki administration's demand that the tribe pay taxes on cigarettes and gasoline sold on casino grounds, according to a state official. The Mohawks already run a failing casino on their reservation 350 miles to the north in remote Hogansburg.
The application from the Mohawks and Park Place Entertainment is also wending its way through the regulatory process. Mr. Skibine said "approval is not imminent," adding that after the bureau completes its review of the environmental reports, Park Place will need to make modifications to the project.
One thing is certain, said Cornelius D. Murray, a lawyer who expects a ruling by the Court of Appeals later this year on his legal challenge to casino gambling: "It's a quagmire. Anything can happen. There are just so many stakeholders."

HEADLINE: Workers Who Feel Discarded 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"I've gone through a few stages of depression and frustration," said Dina Ziskin, who is 31 and lives in Brooklyn. "Why is it taking me so long? I panic a lot. I did not think it would be this difficult to find a job."
 "I can't tell you the number of divorces we hear about," said Janelle Razzino, who runs an executive search firm in Westwood, N.J. "The job loss in these cases was probably the final straw. Nobody needs that kind of pressure, stress, whatever." 
 "It's like someone ran an electric shock through your system," said Dr. Steve Korner, a psychologist in Cresskill, N.J. "People are anxious, depressed, feeling unwanted, powerless. The job market is really awful for a lot of people."
Among the many things overshadowed by the war is the substantial human toll that is quietly being taken by the faltering U.S. economy. Putting Americans to work is not part of the agenda of the Bush administration, and the fallout from this lack of interest is spreading big time.
The U.S. is hemorrhaging jobs. On Friday the government reported that 108,000 more jobs were lost in March. Some 2.4 million jobs have vanished since the nation's payrolls peaked two years ago.
The jobless rate held steady at 5.8 percent last month, but that is extremely deceptive. People who have become discouraged and stopped looking for work are not counted when the unemployment rate is calculated. This keeps the official rate artificially low. There are five million people in the discouraged category and their ranks are growing.
David Leonhardt, in an article in The Times on Saturday, wrote:
"Last month's job losses cut across almost every sector of the economy. Manufacturers reduced employment for the 36th consecutive month. The vast services industry, usually a source of stability, has cut 121,000 jobs in the last six months, with department stores, restaurants, airlines and hotels all paring their payrolls in March. After adding jobs through last year, local and state governments have also begun to make cuts to close budget deficits."
There is not much of a sense anywhere that things are about to improve. "It seems to me that the recovery's been six months away for two years running," said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the international outplacement firm. "The latest version of that is that when the war ends the euphoria will trigger enough optimism on the part of either consumers or businesses to finally turn things around. I'm certainly dubious about that."
The loss of a job is like a blow to the solar plexus of an individual family. Grand plans give way to a state of emergency in which it is not at all clear how the rent or the mortgage will be paid, or how the bill collectors can be satisfied from month to month, then week to week, and finally day to day.
"I've got my own little Ponzi scheme going," a distraught former executive told me last week. "When the credit card companies pull the plug on me, I'm finished."
The executive, who asked not to be identified, said he was depressed but could not afford to see a therapist.
John Sampson helps run a support network in northern New Jersey for telecommunications experts who have lost senior positions. "This is the bleakest employment picture I've ever seen," he said. "The number of people looking for jobs is overwhelming. We've got a whole bunch of people now who are doing everything from selling cars to driving limousines to working in retail."
Mr. Sampson, who is 62, said he's been out of work for more than a year.
There doesn't seem to be much awareness in the Bush administration of the terrible distress of the unemployed American worker. This is an ache that does not extend to the gilded towers of the very wealthy, which is where the administration has always focused its concern.
The White House response to the latest job loss figures is the same response it has had all along to bad economic news: more tax cuts are the cure.
Mr. Sampson, who described himself as coming from a "Republican background," said he feels the American worker has been abandoned. "While I'm not a big Bill Clinton fan," he said, "I liked what his labor secretary had to say. Robert Reich always talked about the work force as a national asset. It is. We should treat it that way."

HEADLINE: The Spam That Isn't Via E-Mail 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, April 6 

 BODY:
If your money was on the guy with the big belly, you lost.
 Jack LaForge, a 17-year-old Honolulu resident of unimpressive size, ate an entire can of Spam -- cold -- in roughly two minutes on Saturday, beating 11 other Spam eaters during a celebration to honor the meat sometimes called "Hawaiian steak." 
 "I had a little bit of water left so I just stuck a whole piece in and swallowed it whole, right down with the water," Mr. LaForge said, adding that he really felt he needed a smoke. 
The Spam eating contest was one event in the first Waikiki Spam Jam, a three-day festival designed to draw local residents and their wallets into Waikiki by honoring the state's favorite comfort food. Hawaii consumes 6.7 million cans of Spam each year -- more than any other state -- and this fixation drew thousands of people this weekend, helping along a tourism economy recently slowed by war fears.
Music blared from two stages as people downed creative Spam dishes and posed for pictures with a giant can of Spam in blue hightops. The festival started with the creation of the "world's longest" Spam musubi, usually a four-inch rice block topped with Spam and wrapped with seaweed, a standard local snack. (Think Spam sushi.)
"We tried to get Guinness to certify it as the longest Spam musubi, but they said they never heard of musubi," said Matt Bowden, engineer of the 132-foot-by-8-inch tribute to luncheon meat. "Poor things."
Spam showed more elegantly at Friday's event, a cook-off featuring leading hotel chefs who offered dishes like mushroom and Spam ravioli and gratin of Spam with roasted eggplant.
"I really liked the brochettes," said Doug Inouye, a lawyer for a local nonprofit group who settled on the Asian-style Spam skewers served with salmon and coleslaw. "Not too salty, and the miso-marinated salmon complemented it well. The Asian slaw brought out the taste of the Spam."
Despite its temporary elevation to the status of "haute cuisine," Spam is still daily fare in Hawaii, a must-have on any self-respecting breakfast menu, including at McDonald's, and a staple of community cookbooks.
The Spam Jam could not have come at a better time. Local merchants were happy to welcome the crowds after a slow winter, exasperated by a war that has shaken Hawaii's post-9/11 tourism industry even further.
"Sales are a bit stronger than yesterday," said Brian Naganuma, retail supervisor at the clothing store Crazy Shirts on duty Saturday during the street festival. "It definitely brings a lot of foot traffic."
Hotels had hoped to cash in on Spam love, too, offering free room upgrades to anyone who presented a can at check-in. As of Friday, the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach had collected only four cans, but the guest services manager, Debbie Murakami, was hoping for more.
Even if they did not stay over, many local residents who said they rarely come to Waikiki -- often considered too touristy -- dropped in to pay homage.
"I love Spam," said Darrel Lau, who lives about 20 minutes away. "I've been eating it all my life, and this is the first time something like this is going on."
Some of the tourists were baffled, though.
"I said 'Spam?' " said Gilbert Acuna, a visitor from Los Angeles who said he grew up eating the stuff, had not touched it in 30 years and certainly was not going to start again. But, he said, munching a plate of grilled prawns and rice, "I've always liked street fairs."

HEADLINE: How a Venerable Hospital Helped Undermine Its Own Health 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN; Janny Scott contributed additional reporting for this article.

 BODY:
On the morning of March 19, Dr. Kenneth I. Berns, chief executive of Mount Sinai Medical Center, was preparing for a meeting with union officials when he received a visit from the chairman of the board, Peter W. May. 
 The two men -- the respected medical academic and the corporate turnaround artist famed for resuscitating the Snapple beverage brand -- had been brought in a year before to lead the rescue of Mount Sinai, one of ahandful of elite teaching hospitals in New York City. Not only was it bleeding tens of millions of dollars a year, but the death of a liver donor in its heralded transplant program had dealt Mount Sinai's reputation a stinging blow. 
 Now, with the hospital's annual financial report -- a verdict on the rescue so far -- to be released in a matter of days, Dr. Berns, according to hospital and union officials, was planning to tell the union that he needed to cut several hundred more jobs. 
Mr. May, it turned out, had something else in mind. 
He did not wait to discuss it with the full board, or even the executive committee, several trustees say. He contacted several key members to nail down their support, and then he made his move: Would Dr. Berns agree to step aside? 
Behind Mr. May's urgency was a hospital spiraling ever deeper into debt. The new financial documents showed that despite one executive shake-up, hundreds of layoffs and an array of program cuts, Mount Sinai's budget deficit had actually grown, to $72 million last year from $14 million in 2001. In January of this year alone, the hospital lost $12 million more, executives said. By the end of 2003, its losses since early 2000 are expected to reach $200 million. Its bonds are in danger of being rated as junk, the rating agencies say.
"The turnaround plan did not have the impact on Mount Sinai Hospital's operations in 2002 that was anticipated," the report concluded with frosty restraint. 
The problems do not stop at the bottom line. 
Layoffs of housekeepers have left parts of the hospital visibly dirtier. Some clinics for the poor have been closed or cut back. While doctors and administrators insist that the quality of care remains high and that the liver transplant case was a disastrous aberration, many admit that the medical staff is being stretched thin. Physicians say they are working far harder, in some cases for less money; some have left. Morale has suffered badly; patient satisfaction is down. 
Mount Sinai's troubles, of course, reach back far beyond the last tumultuous year. Its leaders tend to depict their hospital largely as a victim, overwhelmed by the external forces that have reshaped American health care. As they explain it, Mount Sinai and many other academic medical centers -- especially those in New York -- are being suffocated between the dwindling flow of government money and their ever-more-costly obligations to the poor. 
That is certainly one side of the story. But an examination by The New York Times -- based on dozens of interviews in recent months with current and former employees, trustees and outside experts, as well as a review of tax records and state documents -- shows that Mount Sinai has been a constant collaborator in its own decline. 
Sandwiched between the gold coast Upper East Side and the East Harlem barrio, Mount Sinai is one of those old-line New York institutions, deeply bonded to the city's social and philanthropic elite. Increasingly, it has aspired to be the kind of medical center that could do it all -- train doctors, be a leader in research, perform transplants and other high-tech surgeries and still heal the poor at its back door. Now, many people are wondering if perhaps it overreached. 
Years of generous Medicare and Medicaid payments spawned a culture of fiscal laxity and excess, according to the hospital's outside consultants, the Hunter Group. For example, the consultants found that flawed billing systems cost Mount Sinai tens of millions of dollars, even as it pursued ambitious expansion and building plans and paid its top executives salaries, detailed in tax records, that many experts say were unusually high for a struggling nonprofit institution. 
In the late 1990's, as fiscal trouble mounted, Mount Sinai's management was distracted by the long-running psychodrama of its grandest project -- merger with New York University Hospitals Center. Both sides now admit the merger was a failure, and it has been largely unwound. 
Mount Sinai's board boasts many of the city's leading business minds, including Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary, and Henry Kravis, the financier. But many trustees and outside experts say the board failed to exercise strong, independent oversight, especially as the merger careered toward the rocks. After the deal's chief architect, the longtime chief executive Dr. Jack Rowe, was eased out, the board waited more than a year before hiring Dr. Berns, leaving the hospital rudderless in the gathering storm. 
Finally, Mount Sinai used an array of acrobatic accounting maneuvers that obscured the precise depth of its fiscal distress, financial statements show. Mount Sinai is a many-chambered whole -- a medical center encompassing the hospital, medical school and real estate interests -- and it has long shunted money from one part to another. In 2001, for example, the hospital made itself $33 million "richer" by selling a staff residence on Park Avenue to the medical school. 
When Dr. Berns's resignation was announced two weeks ago, a Mount Sinai spokesman said the chief executive was not being removed for poor performance. But in an interview, Mr. May put it this way: "The speed of implementation is lower than any of us would have liked." Dr. Berns would not be interviewed for this article. 
At the same time, a number of trustees and physicians said the swift and surprising change at the top showed Mr. May's determination to seize control after years of drift. Many people spoke highly of the new chief executive, Dr. Kenneth I. Davis, who was already the medical school dean. 
Still, beyond the sheer size of the deficit, one crucial item in the new financial report points to the enormity of the task ahead. Since the liver case, some patients are staying away; with occupancy down, the hospital has been shutting down beds, leaving itself 10 percent smaller than in 1997. Without a rebound, Mount Sinai knows, its turnaround will falter, especially with the state threatening new Medicaid cuts that would cost Mount Sinai $15 million a year. 
No one is suggesting that Mount Sinai might close, but people in health care and government say that what is at stake in these churning times is the shape of the place, the future of its aspirations and many missions. 
"The question is not, 'Does it survive?' " said Bruce C. Vladeck, a professor of health policy who ran Medicare and Medicaid during the Clinton administration. "The question is, 'What kind of place is it likely to be 10 years from now, and what might it have been had not all these problems occurred?' " 

The Fat Years
Not too long ago, as one trustee put it, a hospital "had to be awfully weak or stupid to lose money." Insurers paid the cost of each patient's stay, and then some. Costs and reimbursements rose in tandem. 
Those were the rules when Dr. Rowe arrived in 1988. He would not speak for this article, but in a 1990 interview with Crain's New York Business, he vowed to make Mount Sinai "the best medical center in New York City." 
Mount Sinai built up its relatively young medical school, developed expertise in areas like transplantation and, with a growing share of federal research money, expanded its work in basic science. It strengthened its system of clinics for the poor. And it conducted a building campaign whose snazziest production was the new Guggenheim Pavilion, a $500 million, I. M. Pei-designed box of glass and brick overlooking Central Park. Most everyone calls it "The Palace." 
Then, in the mid-90's, the old economic model hit the wall. 
To stem health care costs, hospitals, even nonprofits, would be run like businesses. Insurers, led by giant health maintenance organizations, began linking reimbursement to diagnoses, not the length of hospital stays. Government pulled back, too, and no one was hit harder than urban teaching hospitals like Mount Sinai. 
Some adjusted better than others. Nationally, studies show the average big urban hospital on the mend by 2001. 
The transition has been rockier at Mount Sinai, with its smaller endowment and multiple missions. Dr. Rowe, masterful at reputation-building in the fat years, proved less adroit in adversity, trustees say. Having sown seeds of fiscal woe, the hospital was slow to undertake the soul-searching that could have rooted them out. 
Mount Sinai executives often complain that several competitors were able to qualify for an extra $50 from Medicaid per clinic visit. Yet Mount Sinai lost even more money, the consultants found, by failing to bill some clinic patients on the flawed assumption that the reimbursement was too low to bother. 
Everywhere, the new economics have strained the inevitably uneasy balance between doctors and business types. According to executives and union officials at Mount Sinai, the Hunter Group found that operations often started late, creating a costly backlog; doctors often ordered redundant tests. Doctors said the built-in inefficiency was part of the teaching process. To the consultants, that reasoning became a crutch. 
Even so, the business people were running what the Hunter Group indicated was a top-heavy shop. It had 1 manager for every 14 employees; comparable institutions make do with 1 for 17. That translated to between 150 and 220 extra managers. And trustees admit they put up little resistance when Dr. Rowe and top executives negotiated six- and seven-figure contracts. 
Hospital officials would not discuss the pay of subsequent management, but the chief spokesman, Gary Rosenberg, who himself made $744,000 in 2000, said, "We think we're competitive, barely competitive." 

The Merger Plan
Through the late 90's, Mount Sinai might have been digging itself into a hole, but its attention was riveted elsewhere -- on the merger with N.Y.U. 
When the deal was announced in 1997, after a tortuous courtship, Mount Sinai appeared to have the upper hand: it would control the merged board, and Dr. Rowe would run the entire enterprise. The medical schools -- till then the main sticking point, especially among the doctors -- would remain separate, at least for the time being. 
Everywhere, hospitals were merging for leverage in a changing world. Mount Sinai was still profitable -- it made $30 million in 1997 -- but Dr. Rowe and his colleagues hoped to save millions by fusing back-office operations and sharing expensive clinical services and equipment. They envisioned great bargaining power with insurers. 
N.Y.U.'s trustees were thrilled to have Dr. Rowe in charge. But what they wanted most was a shield. 
The university's chairman at the time, Laurence A. Tisch, feared that the vicissitudes of the hospital business could imperil his quest to make N.Y.U. a world-class institution. He wanted the hospitals off N.Y.U.'s books, and the merger seemed the way to do it. 
But the merger never really stood a chance. Just why it failed tends to depend on whom you talk to -- trustees who pushed for it, or doctors who resisted it. 
The doctors' arguments are laid out in an unsuccessful lawsuit filed in January 1998 by the N.Y.U. faculty council, seeking to block the merger. Though the suit never got much publicity, its claims have proven remarkably prescient.
The dissidents argued that the merger would never be the promised bonanza, with earnings rising to $50 million in 2002. Instead, they predicted losses climbing to $40 million to $52 million in 2002. 
In part, those doctors said, the deal's architects had greatly overestimated their influence with insurers and their ability to attract patients. They also feared added administrative costs and new bureaucracy. 
To many trustees, though, the resistance of the doctors -- crucial players in such a marriage -- became a self-fulfilling prophecy. It was easy to meld laundry and catering. Medicine was another matter. 
By way of illustration, they tell the story of the gamma knife, a device that uses radioactive cobalt to destroy brain lesions without surgery. N.Y.U. doctors used it just half the week; the rest of the time it sat there losing money. At a cost of $4 million and a useful life of seven years, it was just the sort of asset the merger's framers hoped would be shared. 
But Mount Sinai's doctors largely shunned it, continuing instead to send patients to other hospitals. They also began lobbying for one of their own. And while Dr. Rowe resisted, after his departure Mount Sinai decided to order a similar device, a Novalis, that will ultimately cost it $5.5 million. 
It wasn't only the doctors who cast stones. One longtime trustee on the Mount Sinai side, Frederick A. Klingenstein, pledged $75 million to its medical school in late 1999 on the condition that it never merge. N.Y.U. officials considered it "a hostile act," another trustee said. Mr. Klingenstein declined to comment for this article.
With all the feuding, the partners decamped to their respective campuses -- referred to icily as the "northern and southern hemispheres." Mostly, what was left of the merger was a running, never-resolved battle over just how merged the two institutions -- and especially their prized medical schools -- ought to be. 
Michael Urfirer, an investment banker, joined the merged board as a Mount Sinai appointee in March 2000. "It was strange," he recalled, as if "you walked into a soap opera halfway through the season." 
A year later, both institutions decided to face facts: they reached a preliminary agreement freeing them to manage their own affairs while pursuing ways to sever their final bond, $700 million in joint debt.

Changes at the Top
Dr. Rowe did not stay for the unwinding; in the summer of 2000, losing trustees' support -- especially at Mount Sinai -- he left to run the insurance giant Aetna. 
Through the Rowe years, trustees and outside experts said, the board had essentially followed its chief executive's lead. 
"These board members come in for a few hours each month and there's no possible way they can get their arms around the total complications of these big medical centers," said Charles M. Ewell, chairman of the Governance Institute, which tracks hospital boardroom issues. "So they depend on the management." 
Problem was, in the 16 months it took to replace Dr. Rowe, Mount Sinai had only interim management. Absent an activist board, several trustees say,the result was ever-deeper distraction and drift. 
One issue was the sheer size of the board -- or more precisely, boards. Fifty-four trustees sit on the hospital's board, 50 on the medical school's and 28 on the board of the parent, the medical center. An executive committee of 20 sits on all three. 
With such a large group, there is a temptation to assume someone else will ask the important questions. In interviews, many trustees profess ignorance about anything beyond their immediate duties. 
One director, Mr. Urfirer, said that since the boards meet together, until recently he didn't even know which one he was on. (It was the medical school's.) So when trustees were informed last year that the school was being asked to buy the Park Avenue building, he says he did not realize whose interests he was representing. 
"Most of our trustees honestly don't know which board they're on," said Mr. Rosenberg, the spokesman. A letter went out last year with updated information.
Several trustees say things are improving under Mr. May. 
"For the first time on that board, not only do they recognize and openly discuss the issues, but everybody is prepared to act," one trustee said. 

Deeper Distress
The financial problems, however, were much worse than the hospital was letting on. Financial statements show that the hospital was able to hold its losses to $14 million in 2001 only by engineering $66 million in unusual transactions. 
The largest was the sale of the Park Avenue residence.
A second transaction involved a related entity called Mount Sinai Realty, which owns 1,800 Upper East Side apartments. It came through with a $16 million "contribution." 
Finally, management drew off $17 million from a joint hospital-medical school endowment, even though footnotes warn that $6.5 million might have to be returned to the medical school if donors object. 
The gains from all three transactions were classified as "operating" income -- meaning they appeared to have come from Mount Sinai's basic business. 
At public companies, such window-dressing is often done to keep stock prices aloft and executive options in the money; in extreme cases, it can be illegal. 
No one is suggesting Mount Sinai came close to that line; all three transactions were disclosed in footnotes to financial statements and vetted by the hospital's auditors, Ernst & Young. Still, the question remains why a nonprofit like Mount Sinai would go to all that trouble. 
Mr. May said the transactions were intended to mollify bondholders worried about the hospital's cash levels; no deception was intended. At the same time, several people suggested that one-time maneuvers were considered a relatively harmless way of keeping up appearances. 
"I guess it was beneficial to have a lower number reported out there from an image standpoint and donor standpoint," said someone involved in the process. 
Whatever the precise motivation, the quick fixes served as a mask.
"That's our issue with these guys," said Pamela S. Federbusch, an analyst at Moody's, the bond rating agency. "They'll run out of assets to sell. They have to focus on improving their operations." 

Looking Ahead
It has all made for gloomy days. Faculty members say they have not seen a pay raise in years. Even the modest perks of academic medicine are disappearing: Breakfast meetings no longer include breakfast; subscriptions have been curtailed; money for travel to scientific meetings is drying up. 
On top of -- and ultimately entwined with -- the fiscal mess came the death of a man who had donated part of his liver to his brother in January 2002. A state investigation found that the donor had died after receiving "woefully inadequate care." It found violations in 80 of the 195 complaints that patients brought it its attention and imposed $126,000 in fines. The sum of it all has been a crisis of spirit, within the hospital and without. 
"You'd have to be a moron not to have a morale problem when every patient walks in and goes, 'I read about Mount Sinai, what's the story?' " said Dr. Anthony Squire, a cardiologist who heads an association of private-practice physicians at Mount Sinai. 
Over the first half of last year, Mount Sinai put together its new team and began mapping a turnaround, advised by the Hunter Group, which specializes in ministering to troubled hospitals. Dr. Berns, who had been dean of the University of Florida Medical School, was the choice of the search committee headed by Mr. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, and Mr. Kravis. The cutting began -- subsidies for the medical school, several outpatient programs, roughly 700 jobs, including 300 managers deemed superfluous -- and with a new chief financial officer on board, the hospital began trying to modernize billing. 
Officials refused to release the Hunter Group's report, but several people who have seen said it advised, among other things, that Mount Sinai could bring in $20 million more a year by pressing doctors to be more productive, by seeing more patients or getting more research grants. 
"People have been told their salaries will be reduced or their space will be taken away" if they fail to do so, said Mr. Vladeck, the health-policy professor. 
Mr. May began receiving daily financial updates, beamed right onto his pocket computer. What they showed was that the turnaround was too little and too slow.
Most worrisome are the occupancy numbers. Volume, already shaky after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks kept some suburban patients in the suburbs, fell 5 percent last year. It fell 4 percent in January and February over the first two months of 2002. There was also the reported $12 million loss in January. 
In interviews, a number of doctors, trustees and union officials say there was a growing perception that Dr. Berns, who is 62 and has had some health problems, was not up to the job's considerable demands. Several said he had been a remote figure, somewhat lacking in leadership and charisma. 
"It seemed to a number of people that he didn't have as much energy in recent months as he had earlier," said Dr. David Hamburg, a longtime trustee and mentor of the new chief executive, Dr. Davis. 
Asked about the situation, Mr. Rubin said: "Peter reached the conclusion that the key now is to get these plans implemented, and in his judgment he was very much supported by the board." 
The new chief executive, Dr. Davis, is a Mount Sinai insider who went to medical school there and built up the psychiatry department. "He's an extremely energetic, charismatic guy who has an enormous amount of experience and knows our institution inside out," Mr. May said. 
So far, he seems to have considerable support, especially among a crucial constituency: his fellow doctors. Asked about his vision for a turnaround, he looks back over the last year and says he has every intention of restoring his colleagues' confidence in the institution and in themselves. "You remind them that they're spectacular," he said. 
People know the turnaround won't be instant -- to wit, the hospital expects to lose at least $72 million in the current year. But one long-awaited piece of confidence-buildingnews came the day after Dr. Davis's appointment, when the state gave Mount Sinai permission to resume live-donor liver transplants. Officials say the suspension cost $10 million in lost revenue and as much as $1 million in profits. 
Management says it is hoping to recruit more private doctors who can admit patients to the hospital. There is talk about concentrating energies and resources on a core of specialties, including cardiovascular disease, genetics, aging, cancer and neurobiology. 
Longtime doctors, trustees and financial backers remain optimistic. Among them is Vicki Modell, whose family has been giving to the hospital for many years. 
"Mount Sinai has made a lot of mistakes," she said. "Let's hope we've made our last mistake."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, a chart yesterday about budget problems at Mount Sinai Hospital omitted a line showing a decline in hospital occupancy. A corrected version appears today, on Page D5.
An article on April 7 about financial troubles of the Mount Sinai Medical Center referred imprecisely to an accounting strategy that allowed the hospital to reduce its budget deficit in 2001. In one transaction, the hospital drew $17 million from "capital and gift funds" donated in earlier years. In a second transaction, $6.5 million in unrestricted gifts was transferred to the hospital from Mount Sinai's medical school, with the proviso that donors could later ask that it be returned to the school. Neither transaction involved the permanently restricted part of the institutions' joint endowment.

HEADLINE: Fear Reigns as Dangerous Mystery Illness Spreads 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY; Reporting for this article was contributed by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Keith Bradsher, Lawrence K. Altman, Clifford Krauss, Donald G. McNeil Jr. and Amy Harmon.

 BODY:
Last November in Foshan, a small industrial city in southern China's Guangdong province, a businessman became desperately ill with an unusual type of pneumonia. Doctors could not identify the germ that was making him sick. Ominously, although pneumonia is not usually very contagious, the four health workers who treated him also fell gravely ill with the same disease.
 Now, scientists say, the Foshan businessman appears to have had the earliest known case of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has since become an international epidemic. As of Saturday, 2,416 people in 20 countries were reported to have the disease, and 89 had died. An overwhelming majority of cases were in mainland China, with 1,220, and Hong Kong, with 800. 
 The cause of the disease is unknown, but scientists suspect it is a new coronavirus, from a family of highly changeable viruses that until now have been known to cause only minor illnesses in people, like colds and diarrhea. 
SARS was brewing in Guangdong province for months, but was not disclosed by the Chinese government until February, when it began reporting cases to the World Health Organization. The businessman's case was made known just last week, when Chinese officials finally agreed to open their case books and hospitals to international experts. The businessman recovered, but Chinese officials have not discussed what happened to those who took care of him, nor have they said where or how he might have contracted the disease.
The rest of the world did not know about SARS until March 15, when the W.H.O. issued an alert, calling the disease a "worldwide health threat." Since then, fear of SARS has led many countries and corporations to halt tourism and business travel to China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, and is expected to cost the region billions of dollars. And a single traveler from Hong Kong to a Toronto suburb is believed responsible for an outbreak in Ontario that has already claimed eight lives.
Efforts to control the disease in Hong Kong appeared to be making headway last week, but the progress may have been short-lived, as cases jumped sharply over the weekend. There were 42 new cases reported yesterday, in addition to 39 on Saturday and 27 on Friday -- a total of 108. The new cases included doctors and nurses. Two women aged 68 and 71 died, bringing the number of deaths in Hong Kong to 22.
Health experts say it is too soon to tell whether SARS will turn into a global wildfire, or cool down. But scientists insist the disease must be treated as an urgent public health threat. What worries epidemiologists is that SARS can spread rapidly through the air, via coughing and sneezing, and its death rate of 3 to 4 percent is significant, particularly when healthy people are among those who have died.
In the United States, there were 115 suspected cases, in people who had traveled to the affected areas or had been exposed to travelers. No one had died. So far, experts say, most Americans do not have to worry about catching the disease, but scientists warn that a pandemic is still possible.
Public anxiety about SARS appears to be increasing, with a hotline at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta receiving more than 1,000 calls a day late last week. The nervousness took other forms as well. 3M, the largest maker of disposable masks, said sales had "significantly increased" because of SARS.
People of all ages have caught SARS. The illness typically starts like any other acute respiratory infection: with a fever, chills, headache, malaise and dry cough. Chest X-rays tend to show what doctors call "atypical pneumonia" in a lower lobe of a lung. In the following days, a victim may develop difficulty breathing as the pneumonia spreads to another lobe.
About five to seven days after onset, the symptoms improve in about 80 to 90 percent of patients and worsen in the remainder. Many of the sickest patients require intensive care, even to the point of being connected to a respirator. Why some people improve and others die is not known. So far, it appears that people most susceptible to severe symptoms are 40 or older and those who have had a chronic disease in the past. Aside from regular nursing care and help in breathing, there is no effective treatment, and recovery seems to depend on a patient's own immune system.

Economically, A Potent Impact
SARS may have spread at jet speed with air travelers, but fear of the respiratory disease is traveling even faster, hurting businesses and economies around the globe.
The disease's economic consequences are still modest in North America and Europe. But SARS is clearly slowing growth in east Asia, which, at least until the last three weeks, had been one of the few regions in the world with briskly expanding economies.
On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley cited SARS in lowering its forecast for economic growth in Asia, aside from Japan, to 4.5 percent this year, from 5.1 percent. The lower estimate reflected an analysis that the disease would cut about $15 billion in business this year, mainly from less tourism and lower retail sales.
Andy Xie, a Morgan Stanley economist, cautioned in a report that the actual economic effect could be considerably greater. "We believe this medical crisis is the gravest since the 1998 Asian crisis," he warned, referring to a drop in the value of Thailand's currency that set off a series of devastating financial crises across southeast Asia.
Airlines and hotel chains have been hurt the most by the SARS outbreak. The resulting losses are hurting even strong travel companies, like Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's main airline. The disease may have been the final blow for some already troubled businesses, like Air Canada, which filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday.
"We anticipated war, we didn't anticipate this," said Vivian Deuschl, a spokeswoman for the Ritz Carlton Hotel Company, a Marriott subsidiary.
The harm is not confined to the travel industry. Business has plunged at stores and restaurants in heavily affected cities like Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, as well as in locations inaccurately perceived as affected, like the Chinatowns in New York and San Francisco. Electronics companies have struggled to stay in touch with their operations in China, one of the world's largest producers of computers and wireless local area networks. 
Hardest hit have been retailers in Hong Kong. Customers have simply stopped coming into the store of Peter Chan, who sells bronze and ceramic Buddhas across the street from the Man Mo Temple, where clouds of incense billowed last week as Taoists prayed for an end to the disease.
"I have been working in this field for more than 20 years and I have never seen such a bad situation before, not even after 9/11," Mr. Chan said.
One big worry is that, as hospitals -- in Hong Kong in particular -- become flooded with SARS patients, the quality of medical care over all will decline. The State Department said that part of its reason for offering free tickets out for nonessential diplomats and diplomatic families was "concerns over our ability to obtain suitable medical care."
Adding up all these disparate effects has proved a guessing game for economists. A few, like Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley, say that SARS could make the difference in tipping the world into a recession if the war in Iraq also becomesprolonged.

A Suspect From the Ranks Of Minor Illnesses
No one is certain what causes SARS, but a microbe known as a coronavirus is the chief suspect, most likely a new strain that originated in Guangdong province.
Coronaviruses take their name from their appearance under the electron microscope: a circular, crownlike shape with protruding spikes. Until now, these viruses were thought to produce only minor illnesses in people, like colds, diarrhea and other intestinal disorders. In cats, dogs, chickens, pigs and cattle, coronaviruses cause severe and often fatal illness. 
All coronaviruses have an extraordinary ability to capture stray bits of genetic material from related viruses and weave them into their own genomes, a feat biologists call recombination. Such natural recombination favors the creation of new viruses, and in theory could turn a benign microbe into a biological time bomb.
For a virus already inclined to transform into new identities, there could be no better environment than southern China. The region is known to be one of the world's great incubators of new viruses, particularly influenza. Though coronaviruses are not related to influenza, scientists said that coronaviruses could easily take advantage of the same conditions that make the region the birthplace of new flu strains. 
Southern China is populated by millions of farmers living on small plots of land in close quarters with pigs, ducks, chickens and other livestock -- ideal for passing microbes back and forth between species and for viruses to swap genetic material.
Gene swapping is not the only way a new coronavirus could emerge. Another possibility is that an earlier version of the virus, one that did not cause severe illness in people, underwent a genetic mutation making it more virulent. It is also possible that an animal virus "jumped" to humans. Such jumps are known to occur, sometimes with severe consequences. 
Coronaviruses became the chief suspect in SARS when scientists used a device called a gene chip, or microarray, to scan tissue samples from disease victims. The chip is a glass slide containing bits of genetic material from about 1,000 viruses. If the tissue sample contains genetic material from any of them, it will stick to the corresponding bit on the slide.
When tissue samples from SARS victims were scanned, the slides indicated matches with coronaviruses not only from humans, but also ones that normally infect turkeys and cows -- suggesting a strain that has never been seen before.

Epidemic Aided By an Official Silence
In November and December, outbreaks of the mysterious disease cropped up repeatedly in cities in Guangdong province, including Zhongshan and Guangzhou. By January, local doctors were investigating what they believed was a new kind of "atypical pneumonia." But the Chinese government and its state-controlled press said nothing of the evolving panic in Guangdong and for months, little information seeped to the outside world.
Finally, on Feb. 9, the World Health Organization received its first report from China. Before the end of the month, cases had popped up in Hong Kong and Hanoi, and in March, one infected traveler from Hong Kong caused an outbreak that led to 7 deaths and included more than 150 suspected and probable cases. By early March, the disease had begun to spread swiftly among hospital workers in Hong Kong and Hanoi.
By mid-March, it was clear that a highly contagious disease was poised to begin seeding around the world. Officials at the W.H.O. realized they had to take drastic action, even though that action might have devastating economic consequences in Asia and elsewhere. 
"Hong Kong is an international airline hub," said Dr. David Heymann, the organization's executive director of communicable diseases. "We had to let other countries know that this was coming. And we had to let passengers know what the disease was as well, so that if they got it they could tell their doctors and get themselves isolated."
On March 15, the W.H.O. took the highly unusual step of issuing the global health alert, describing the new disease and where it had been found.
"It was a pretty radical decision, and I didn't sleep that night because I knew that what we were doing was going to have a lot of different repercussions," Dr. Heymann said.
Last week, after months of international pressure, a team from the W.H.O. was finally permitted to go to Guangdong. But until the past two weeks, health officials in China were not only unwilling to share their data, but denied that the four-month-long pneumonia outbreak affecting Guangdong had anything to do with SARS.
Chinese doctors have the longest and deepest experience in dealing with the new pneumonia, and their lack of cooperation greatly hampered the investigation into a developing worldwide health crisis.
On Friday, the head of China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered an apology for at least some of its prior inaction: "Today, we apologize here to all of you that our health departments did not have enough close cooperation with the media," Li Liming told Chinese reporters.
Still, he did not explain why, for most of the epidemic, Chinese reporters were explicitly banned from reporting about it. Also, while Chinese newspapers began publishing articles on SARS this week, there were still strict limits on what could be covered. For example, the reports did not mention Dr. Li's apology.
Such signs of ambivalence have left many scientists and citizens skeptical that the Chinese are being completely candid even as they release daily updates of new cases to the W.H.O., starting last week. While doctors say there are more than 50 people with SARS being treated at Beijing's main infectious disease hospital, yesterday's statistics from China acknowledge only 19 confirmed cases and 4 deaths in Beijing. 
The most recent death was a Geneva-based official of the United Nations International Labor Organization, Pekka Aro, 53, who traveled to China after spending a week in Bangkok in mid-March. Mr. Aro, whom health officials in Beijing said had no known exposure to anyone with the disease, arrived in Beijing on March 23 aboard a Thai Airlines flight and took ill on March 28. He was hospitalized on Wednesday at Ditan Hospital, an infectious disease hospital in Beijing, because doctors at the international clinic he visited suspected SARS.
He died there on Saturday of respiratory failure. Doctors in China insist that he had acquired SARS before arriving in China. China's Ministry of Health still says that there is no evidence that the disease can be acquired in Beijing.
What is clear, though, is that Chinese doctors knew a lot about SARS long before it had a name or had left China's borders, and chose not to share that information for many months. After the initial spate of outbreaks, doctors fully understood that they were dealing with a new and potentially fatal disease that spread far more easily than ordinary atypical pneumonias. 
One lung specialist from Guangzhou wrote to friends in January that he would have to cancel all conference plans because he was so consumed with controlling the mystery pneumonia. 
On Feb. 3, at the Zhongshan Number 3 Hospital, a 10-year-old boy -- later nicknamed the "poison emperor" -- came to the emergency department with pneumonia.
Two weeks later, six health care workers had been infected and two -- a doctor and an ambulance driver -- were dead, a doctor at the hospital said. 
Around the same time a severely ill man in his 40's from the suburbs of Guangzhou came for help to Zhongshan Number 2 Hospital. By the middle of the month, the hospital had an entire ward filled with doctors and nurses as patients, most infected by this one man. 
Experts at the W.H.O. now believe that many, if not most, of SARS cases may be attributable to a small number of people who passed on the disease with great efficiency -- so-called superspreaders.
Many hospitals in Guangdong developed strict infection control procedures, including quarantines and use by medical personnel of gowns, gloves, shoe covers and masks for any contact with pneumonia patients. With such efforts, doctors said, new cases have slowly declined and SARS wards are emptying.
But China did not share its knowledge with the rest of the world. And sick patients continued to travel.
One of those, a 64-year-old doctor who worked at Zhongshan Number 2 Hospital, left China for Hong Kong in late February. He apparently was a superspreader and helped to ignite the outbreak that is raging there. He died in March, but before he did, he is believed to have infected eight people on his floor at Hong Kong's Metropole Hotel and, health officials now believe, far more at other locations as well. 
By mid-March, with SARS circling the globe, China could no longer suppress its data. 
Two weeks ago, China began cooperating with a W.H.O. team that is now working in Guangzhou. Just last week, the Ministry of Health began producing the daily reports of new cases and deaths. Suddenly, after months of taboo, the state-controlled media is discussing SARS and ways to prevent it. But it will take some time to win the confidence back among foreign businesses, tourists and the ordinary Chinese as well.

Leaping the Pacific To Land in Canada
The disease came to Canada in March by way of Sui-chu Kwan, an elderly immigrant, who was returning from Hong Kong to her home in Scarborough, a Toronto suburb. She had apparently contracted the disease while staying on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, the epicenter of a large outbreak. Sui-chi Kwan died at home on March 5, then of unknown causes.
Then a week later her son, Chi Kwai Tse, 44, was stricken with the disease and died at Scarborough Grace Hospital, which became the epicenter of SARS in Toronto. His wife also died. Two other offspring of Sui-chu Kwan, a daughter and a son, also got sick but later recovered. This family is the origin of SARS in Toronto, and they passed the disease to other patients and health care workers.
Ontario health officials are hopeful that the disease has been contained, and so far all 160 probable and suspected SARS cases in Canada have been related to the original cluster. Eight people have died so far, at least five of whom were in their 70's, and all had previous health problems. Six more people are in critical condition. 
Still, local health officials have become increasingly optimistic, and on Friday were happy to report that there were only three new cases in Toronto, an apparently slowing of the disease. Throughout Canada, there were 187 suspect and probable cases as of Friday, up from 178 on Thursday.
About 3,000 people have been put in isolation inCanada, the vast majority in the Toronto area. Among those in quarantine was Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious disease specialist and medical microbioloigst and epidemiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont.
Dr. Loeb was quarantined for 10 days because he had been exposed to a health-care worker who came down with SARS. In an interview, he said he did not expect to fall ill himself, but had taken the possibility seriously enough to send his wife and children off to stay with relatives before he would even return to his home. 
And, he admitted, "I take my temperature about seven times a day. Not that I'm anxious, but when you're in quarantine there are only so many things you can do."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Aconservative forecaster shows a bit more optimism on ad spending for this year and next.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A LEADING media services agency is increasing its estimate for advertising spending this year in the United States, citing a belief that the war "has not (yet) damaged hopes of recovery." As if to underscore that, several advertisers are describing plans to increase their ad budgets in coming months.
 The agency, ZenithOptimedia, is predicting in a report to be released today that American ad spending this year will grow 2.2 percent from 2002. That compares with a forecast the agency made in December for an increase of 1.9 percent, which it described as bearish. 
 The change is likely to be deemed bullish because executives of ZenithOptimedia, owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe, are typically less ebullient in their ad-spending predictions than other forecasters.
United States advertisers in important categories like automotive, retail and telecommunications are "so far unfazed by jumpy consumers or the outfall of war," said John Perriss, chief executive at ZenithOptimedia in London.
While "we qualify our forecast with the risk that prolonged war would gravely damage advertiser confidence," Mr. Perriss said, "a swift conclusion would do the opposite, and in particular make an already firm upfront market tighter still."
That reference was to the market in which the big broadcast and cable television networks will sell commercial time ahead of the 2003-04 season, likely to begin in late spring. Mr. Perriss's upbeat comments are intriguing because initial forecasts of a robust upfront market had recently been tempered by fears that the war would weaken consumer spending, thus reducing demand from marketers for TV commercial time.
ZenithOptimedia predicts growth in demand for commercial time in other media like radio. The forecast for newspapers remains soft because classified advertising "looks weak short-term," according to the report, while the forecast for magazines calls for an unspecified "refreshment" from weak results last year.
ZenithOptimedia is also raising its forecast for ad spending growth in the United States in 2004. The new prediction is for an increase of 4.5 percent from 2003, compared with an estimate made in December calling for an increase of 3.6 percent.
The update for 2003 brings ZenithOptimedia a bit closer to the prediction made in December by another leading forecaster, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York. He estimated then that United States ad spending this year would increase 5 percent from 2002.
Mr. Coen said late last month that he wanted to wait before deciding whether to revise his forecast because of the effects of the war. Universal McCann is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
One advertiser intending to increase spending is Meijer Stores, the regional retailer based in Grand Rapids, Mich., which operates 156 Meijer Supercenter discount stores in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio. Meijer may spend as much as $40 million this year on advertising compared with the $31.2 million spent in major media in 2002 as tracked by CMR in New York, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
Meijer on Friday named DeVito/Verdi in New York as agency of record on its broadcast account, which had been handled by Meyer & Wallis in Milwaukee. The decision came after a five-month review that had been narrowed to those agencies and two other finalists.
AirTran Airways, a low-fare airline, will "step up its efforts to attract more passengers," said Tad Hutcheson, director for marketing and corporate communications in Orlando, Fla., as it expands with new service in May and June to the Denver, Las Vegas and Los Angeles markets.
Plans call for the airline's 2003 ad budget to be increased to about $23 million, Mr. Hutcheson said, from about $18.5 million last year, reflecting the service expansion to come as well as flights already added in markets like Baltimore, Milwaukee, Rochester and Wichita, Kan. The AirTran agency is Cramer-Krasselt in Chicago.
Another advertiser that expects to increase ad spending is Hotwire in San Francisco, an online discount travel company. Monica Ma, a spokeswoman for Hotwire, said the company planned to spend on a new campaign, called "Our kind of customer," more than the $35 million that was spent on a previous campaign, which ended last month. Just how much more is to be determined, Ms. Ma said, as the year unfolds.
Hotwire is scheduled to start running today a radio campaign to promote www.hotwire.com, where it sells airline tickets, cruises, hotel rooms and car rentals. The campaign, coincidentally also from DeVito/Verdi, urges consumers to "Fly. Sleep. Drive. Cheap." Investors in Hotwire include the Texas Pacific Group and six airlines.
The ZenithOptimedia report also includes updated forecasts for ad spending this year in other large markets, which in contrast to the United States are being revised downward.
The prediction for a five-nation European region -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain -- is now for an increase of 0.4 percent from 2002 compared witha forecast in December for an increase of 1.8 percent. The reduction is being attributed to deteriorating economies in France and Germany as well as weakened corporate confidence in Italy.

HEADLINE: The Senate Rebels 

BYLINE:  By Stanley E. Collender; Stanley E. Collender, a senior vice president for the public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard, writes a weekly column on the federal budget for National Journal.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The budget debate gives Congress its annual opportunity to send a message to the White House. This year, the Senate didn't merely send a message. It hit the executive branch with the equivalent of a fiscal two-by-four. 
 Late last month saw one of the most remarkable Senate votes in recent memory. With its vote to reduce President Bush's proposed tax cut by more than half, the Senate told the administration in no uncertain terms that it could not take Capitol Hill for granted. 
 Not only did the Senate reverse a significant administration victory from the previous week, when the president's supporters protected most of what the administration proposed. But a Republican-controlled Senate also voted against the preferences of a Republican president -- a wartime president at that. And then there is the substance of the vote itself: senators essentially voted against a tax cut.
All this was a surprise for an administration that has largely had its way with Congress. The president's popularity and the White House's determination to assert the power of the executive branch has turned the administration into a legislative juggernaut. White House tax cuts passed easily last year and in 2001, and the president has shown an extraordinary ability to manage the public debate.
It would be easy to dismiss the Senate vote as an aberration. After all, the president's attention is on the war, and some Bush supporters are saying that the vote will be reversed now that the administration realizes the extent of Congressional discontent. But even if the president eventually wins Congressional approval for his full tax cut -- the House has approved $726 billion in cuts, but the Senate's vote reduced that to $350 billion -- the White House now has to deal with several things that it has so far avoided.
Until the Senate vote, for example, the deficit had not been much of an issue. The administration had insisted that it was not a problem the country needs to worry about. But several senators, including moderate and conservative Republicans, made clear during the debate that a big reason they were voting to reduce the tax cut was that the projected deficit, at close to $400 billion, was getting too high.
In addition, the White House relies on the president's popularity to carry the day on most issues. This is especially true on the budget, where the administration's primary strategy seems to be to use what it sees as an inevitable postwar spike in support for the president to convince recalcitrant members of Congress to vote with him.
But the Senate vote shows that using the president's overall popularity may not work as effectively when it comes to the economy -- especially with polls showing the administration as somewhat vulnerable on the issue. Once the war ends, the economy is very likely to be the overwhelming concern of most voters.
Perhaps most significant of all is that the administration now knows it cannot automatically count on its majority in Congress to vote in lock step with the White House. The narrow Republican majorities in both houses are certainly an asset. But the message sent by the Senate shows that it has depreciated in value.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Mr. Murdoch's War

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
On the first day of the war with Iraq, Rupert Murdoch watched the explosions over Baghdad on a panel of seven television screens mounted in the wall of his Los Angeles office, telling friends and colleagues over the phone of his satisfaction that after weeks of hand-wringing the battle had finally begun.
 The war has illuminated anew the exceptional power in the hands of Mr. Murdoch, the 72-year-old chairman of the News Corporation. He was already well known for his willingness, rare among the chiefs of the biggest media companies, to personally shape the editorial policies of his newspapers, which include The New York Post, The Times of London and nearly a dozen major English-language papers. 
 But in the last few years, Mr. Murdoch has become even more influential with the newest additions to his media empire. The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, has become closely read in the Bush White House, while the Fox News Channel last year surpassed CNN to become the top-rated cable news network in the United States. And Mr. Murdoch is expanding his television news operations elsewhere in the world, including India, China and Italy. 
In the last several months, the editorial policies of almost all his English-language news organizations have hewn very closely to Mr. Murdoch'sown stridently hawkish political views, making his voice among the loudest in the Anglophone world in the international debate over the American-led war with Iraq. 
Mr. Murdoch, however, plays down his personal role in the unanimous views of his papers, explaining that he no longer has the time to dispense day-to-day instructions to his editors or producers. "I think that all our papers are certainly supportive of the armed forces," Mr. Murdoch said in an interview last week, "But that is not me calling the editors."
Still, he has made no secret of his opinions. "We can't back down now, where you hand over the whole of the Middle East to Saddam," Mr. Murdoch told the Bulletin, an Australian magazine, in February. "Bush is acting very morally, very correctly," he said. "The greatest thing to come of this for the world economy, if you could put it that way, would be $20 a barrel for oil. That's bigger than any tax cut in any country."
And at a business conference last week, he reiterated his bellicose position: "There is going to be collateral damage. And if you really want to be brutal about it, better we get it done now than spread it over months."
The spotlight on his political influence comes at a crucial moment for Mr. Murdoch and his company. News Corporation is the one remaining significant bidder in the auction for the satellite broadcaster DirecTV, an acquisition that would complete a network of satellite systems that already covers Europe, Asia and Latin America. And it would greatly multiply Mr. Murdoch's bargaining power with United States networks and competing cable systems.
At the same time, Mr. Murdoch is starting all-news networks in Italy and India, loosely modeled after Fox News in the United States. And he is steadily pushing to expand in China, where his company owns a minority stake in a Chinese concern that operates a news channel as well. 
As he expands, Mr. Murdoch is also fighting regulatory battles over media ownership restrictions around the world, in Washington, London and New Delhi. To his critics, Mr. Murdoch's reach illustrates the perils of media consolidation. Some compare him to press barons of decades past, like William Randolph Hearst in the United States or Lord Beaverbrook in Britain.
Gene Kimmelman, a director of the Consumers Union, which is lobbying to preserve ownership limits in the United States, said of Mr. Murdoch: "He has extended the most blatant editorializing in the entire world through his media properties, and that is exactly the example of what we need to worry about when any one entrepreneur owns and controls too many media outlets." 
But Mr. Murdoch's supporters say he is guilty of nothing more than exercising the First Amendment right of any owner to influence the editorial contents of his properties, noting that his power is circumscribed by competition from a growing diversity of cable channels, Web sites and other media outlets. "I can turn on Fox News or I can turn on CNN," said Irwin M. Stelzer, a friend and economic adviser to Mr. Murdoch.
Mr. Murdoch, who was born in Australia and is now a U.S. citizen, says he was hardly the most powerful figure in English-language media. "That is flattering, but it is just not true," he said in an interview last week. "Maybe it would be if I tried to impose my views but I just don't do it."
He might like to, he added, but he did not have time. "Unfortunately, I have a very big company to run," he said. "Twenty years ago I used to enjoy spending a couple of hours in a newsroom. But now I am not in any one place long enough to domuch direct managing of anything." 
He argued that there was much greater power in the hands of the controlling shareholders of smaller publishing companies with prestigious properties like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
Still, Mr. Murdoch is never fully removed from his company's flagship newspapers and television news organizations, and he has been in contact with them even more frequently during the war, people who work with him said. When Mr. Murdoch is in New York during major news events, as he was during the first full week of the war, he attends the 8 a.m. meetings of the producers of Fox News, sometimes two or three times a week, said John Moody, a senior vice president of Fox News.
When he does attend, Mr. Murdoch sits in a straight-backed chair against the wall, browsing a stack of newspapers and frequently interrupting with questions about the news. "Sometimes he will make a comment like, 'They seem to be getting further into Iraq than we expected at this point,' " Mr. Moody recalled. "But he really comes down looking for information. He's got the bug. He is a newsman at heart."
Indeed, Mr. Murdoch is constantly on the phone with his company's editors and news executives from wherever he is, several people who work with him said. Occasionally, he offers praise or criticism of their coverage, but more often he is hunting to pick up the latest bits of information for himself, sometimes passing them on from one newsroom to another. "He'll say, 'Do you know what The Times of London is saying?' " Mr. Moody said. "He is a source for us. He is like a very well-dressed information service."
During one reporter's recent visit to the office of Col Allan, editor of The New York Post, both Rupert and his son Lachlan Murdoch called more than once. (Lachlan Murdoch, 31, chief operating officer of the company, is in charge of its United States publishing operations and publisher of The Post.) 
In the broadest strokes, Mr. Murdoch's influence on his publications is clear. In 1997, for example, The Sun, Britain's most widely read newspaper, followed Mr. Murdoch's lead in dropping its traditional conservative affiliation to endorse Tony Blair, the New Labor candidate.
News Corporation's other British papers, The Times of London, The Sunday Times and the tabloid News of the World, all concurred. The papers account for about 35 percent of the newspaper market in Britain, and some British columnists have argued that the combined endorsements played a crucial role in Mr. Blair's election. As prime minister, Mr. Blair has become one of the staunchest and most articulate supporters of the war. 
Mr. Blair is now backing a communications bill in the British Parliament that would loosen restrictions on foreign media ownership and allow a major newspaper publisher to own a broadcast television station as well -- a provision its critics call the "Murdoch clause" because it seems to apply mainly to News Corporation. But Mr. Blair has differed with Mr. Murdoch and his papers over other issues, such as the possible adoption of the euro.
In the United States, Mr. Murdoch's creation of the Fox News Channel has shifted the entire spectrum of American cable news to the right. Convinced that many people found CNN and the major broadcast networks too liberal, Mr. Murdoch and the former Republican political consultant Roger Ailes chartered Fox to be more conservative -- or, from their point of view, more centrist. Last January, Fox became the top-rated cable network, and it now draws more than 2 million viewers inprime time.
The war has underscored the difference between Fox News and its rivals more starkly than ever. From the start, the network displayed an American flag waving on its screen. Its newscasters speak of American and British troops as "we," "ours," and "liberators." After other networks reported setbacks to American and British forces, the Fox commentator Bill O'Reilly denounced its competitors as "liberal weenies" who were exaggerating the difficulties of the fight and underestimating the American public's tolerance for casualties. 
There are certain limitations to Mr. Murdoch's sway even within News Corporation, sometimes because of government regulations. British laws, for instance, require that television news programs meet standards of fairness and impartiality. At Sky News, the British news channel one-third owned by Mr. Murdoch's company, correspondents have expressed much more skepticism toward the American military's statements than their counterparts at Fox News. The two channels' stepped-up efforts to share footage and reporters in Iraq have sometimes presented sharp contrasts and even on-air disputes.
Fox newscaster Sheppard Smith, for example, scolded a Sky News correspondent in Baghdad for suggesting that both sides of the war were waging a propaganda battle. "Clearly, it seems to me that one side could be argued as more noble than the other, that one side is manipulating people and trying to keep this tyrannical regime alive," Mr. Smith said. 
Mr. Murdoch, too, has told friends he is dissatisfied with the staid presentation and, to his mind, liberal bias of Sky News, sometimes calling it "BBC Light," in reference to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Asked if Sky News has begun imitating Fox News, Mr. Murdoch replied: "I wish. I think that Sky News is very popular and they are doing well, but they don't have the entertaining talk shows -- it is just a rolling half-hour of hard news all the time." 
People who work with Mr. Murdoch said his degree of influence over the content of his newspapers varies significantly depending on the paper. At the broadsheets, The Times of London and The Sunday Times, he maintains a greater distance, in part because of agreements he made with British authorities at the time that he acquired the papers. The agreements bar him from naming the editors or dictating their editorials. Instead, the editors are named by a board of directors, although Mr. Murdoch still interviews candidates, makes recommendations and approves the final selection.
Even on the crucial question of the war in Iraq, some news articles and columnists in News Corporation's Times of London and The Sunday Times, have diverged sharply from Mr. Murdoch's own views. In a front-page story in The Times of London last week, for example, a British officer excoriated an American pilot for "showing no regard for human life" in inadvertently attacking British troops. On March 29, the columnist Matthew Parris posed the question, "Are We Witnessing the Madness of Tony Blair?" 
But the principal editorials of both papers, and a majority of the columnists, have concurred with Mr. Murdoch's own support for the war. And at his major tabloids, like The Sun in Britain and The Post in New York, Mr. Murdoch feels he should be very involved in the contents of the paper, his friend and adviser Mr. Stelzer said. 
Still, Mr. Murdoch said he was hardly on the phone dictating headlines or opinions. "When a new editor is hired I will be asked for approval, but that will be all," Mr. Murdoch said. He continued: "I don't put them through a litmus test on every belief they have." 
His main responsibility was to shareholders, he said, although if a paper was not performing that might include looking at its political slant. "In the end, the buck stops with the chief executive," Mr. Murdoch said. "If you have an editor who wants to be a great hero and go against the public will and lose all the readers, the shareholders are going to blame the chief executive."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the influence of Rupert Murdoch on the News Corporation's properties misidentified the Fox News Channel commentator who accused competitors of dwelling on casualties in Iraq and misstated the term he used for them. He was Fred Barnes, not Bill O'Reilly; he called the competitors "weenies," not "liberal weenies."
An article in Business Day on Monday about the influence of Rupert Murdoch on the News Corporation's properties misstated the year in which the company's four British papers endorsed Tony Blair for prime minister. It was 2001; in 1997 two of the papers endorsed Mr. Blair while two opposed him.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: CHURCH; 
Some in Bronx Congregation Doubt Fellow United Methodist (the President)

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
With Baghdad seeming close to being encircled, the pastor of Calvary United Methodist Church in the Bronx appealed yesterday for an end to the war in Iraq. "We pray that hope will be restored to a world where hope seems to be a dwindling presence," said the minister, the Rev. Gordon A. R. Edwards.
 The words were mild, but stronger currents of anger and fear run underneath at Calvary, a relatively apolitical and stolidly middle-class church in the struggling Morris Heights neighborhood. Opinions there bear some special weight, because President Bush also belongs to the United Methodist denomination, and feelings about the war easily intermingled with views of the president's religious convictions. 
 In conversations with nearly 20 members over the past five days, opinions ran heavily but not unanimously against the invasion of Iraq, and did not seem to change with the prospect of a climactic battle for Baghdad.
"I've been against the war from day one," said McKeever Quinland, 38, a record promoter. "I haven't changed and will never change. I don't know why we're fighting."
Most of Calvary's members immigrated from the Caribbean, but African-Americans, African immigrants and Latino men and women are also among the members. The congregants are schoolteachers, cooks, shopkeepers, nurses' aides and home attendants, with a smattering of professionals.
It is a place where the women wear hats, the children wear lace and the pianist keeps playing an ill-tuned grand as the minister gives her communion. The weekly calendar is filled with bible study classes and choir practices and men's- and women's-group meetings.
The church was built in 1924, fashioned of rough stone blocks and shaped like an austere Norman castle. It stands on University Avenue, a four-lane boulevard of apartment buildings and two-story houses.
In quiet ways, the war has become a regular congregant at Calvary. At least 10 members of the congregation of 300 have a close relative serving in the gulf. Almost all know a service member in the region, church leaders said, pointing out that like the children of many immigrant groups, the islanders' children sought opportunities in the military but have found themselves now facing unexpected danger.
The Rev. Vera Annum, an assistant pastor, weaves antiwar messages into her preaching and worries about all the former Boy Scouts from the church troop who have gone off to fight, including twin boys from the apartment building next door. "All you can do is pray for them and ask God to protect them," she said.
Clara Edmond, whose nephew in the Navy serves in the gulf, is laying on extra prayers, too, for him; for all American soldiers; for her fellow Methodist, President Bush; even for Saddam Hussein. "We have to pray for our enemies," she said.
Some of Calvary's members, like Shirla Heywood, worry that the economic effects of the war will only sharpen financial hardships.
"Our country is going to the pits right now," said Mrs. Heywood, who retired from a job cleaning laboratories at Rockefeller University. 
Talk inevitably turns to President Bush. Pastor Edwards raised his religious affiliation during an interview before yesterday's service.
"I'm mindful of the fact that President Bush is a United Methodist," he said. "United Methodists are United Methodists many times in name, not in subscribing to social principles. When push comes to shove, social principles go to the winds." In going to war, the president violated those principles, he said.
A few members at Calvary expressed skepticism even about the president's religious conviction.
"Why did my good Christian-minded president get into war?" asked Ereen Simon, 53, who was back for a visit. She has been staying at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, to help her daughter, a specialist in an army unit, care for her own 5-month-old daughter.
The baby's father, who is also in the Army, has already left for the Gulf. She worries her daughter is next. "I'm praying they won't take her," she said.
Mrs. Simon spoke after a small midweek service led by Pastor Annum, which began with hymns. One of them, "The Right Hand of God," included the lines, "Our selfishness and lust, our pride and deeds unjust/ Are destroyed by the right hand of God."
Pastor Annum said, "Every time I hear those words, I'm thinking of what we are doing in Iraq."
The congregants stayed in the pews to discuss the war with a reporter.
Ethel Porter, a retired home care attendant and one of the few African-Americans in the pews, said President Bush has "been talking about war and planning for it" from early in his presidency. She said the President was motivated for the Iraqi war by a personal vendetta and added, "He's a liar."
For some, the criticism seemed to go too far. "That's your president you're talking about," scolded Mrs. Heywood.
"That's right!" responded Mrs. Porter.
Mrs. Heywood's husband, Hilton, a retired bauxite miner, intervened. "I'm thinking about the generation to come," he said quietly. "Saddam Hussein is a bad man, no doubt about that. The man is a dictator. Saddam Hussein is today what Hitler was. The whole world sat by and allowed the Jews to be murdered. The time has come for these dictators, these brutes, to go." 
Like a chorus of lilting, angry doves, the women in the group protested. What about the innocent Iraqis who are dying? It is inevitable the innocent will suffer for a greater good, Mr. Heywood said. "What if one of yours was there and was killed?" said Ms. Simon, the mother of the Fort Bragg soldier.
"I feel for you," Mr. Heywood said, trying to make peace. "I might feel the same as you." But he pointed out that people who join the armed forces risk harm.
The tension soon eased and the comedian of the group, actually named Geri Lewis, joked that the war was interrupting her television watching. "I miss my soap operas," she said. Her voice turned serious. "I don't want to hear about nobody dying."

HEADLINE: Texans Call In a Monster Fish to Tame a Monster Weed 

BYLINE:  By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
Perhaps it is only fitting that in Texas, where everything is famously big, people battling an invasive aquatic plant should seek out an appropriately enormous solution: the grass carp, a plant-devouring fish that can reach 400 pounds.
 Said to be able to eat their weight in greenery every day, grass carp have been known to denude entire lakes of vegetation of every kind. Though they are strictly vegetarian, and do not eat other fish, they can destroy underwater flora that other fish species need. 
 So what? say many people who have had to live with the foreign plant, known as hydrilla, that is plaguing Texas.
A fast-growing tangle, hydrilla is clogging lakes and rivers, putting an end to days of boating and swimming, jamming water intakes and shutting down hydroelectric operations. In some places it has formed tangles so thick that it has been blamed in drownings. 
When 1,600 grass carp were released into Lake Austin in February, homeowners and many water resource managers hailed the fish as the best hope for subduing hydrilla. But others fear the fish could become an even bigger environmental problem than the one that it was brought in to solve -- a situation that has become all too familiar to those releasing one foreign species to eradicate another.
If the fish destroy all the lake's vegetation, critics say bass fishing and water quality will decline in this drinking-water reservoir and recreational lake formed by the damming of Texas' Colorado River. 
And if the fish escape from the lake, as many predict they will, they could make their way downriver to destroy sea grass beds in estuaries that are home to productive fisheries. 
"The carp don't just go away and die after they are done with the hydrilla," said Dwayne Anderson, the Texas program director for Clean Water Action, an environmental group. "It's another nonnative species with no predator, and it will be an eating machine, and it will be destructive."
Ed Parten, president of a fishermen's association created to fight the grass carp, described the fish as a scourge on the state's tradition of bass fishing. "Wherever the carp has been used, the bass fishing has declined from fabulous to extremely poor," he said, adding that fishing should be of wide interest because it brings the state billions of dollars each year.
But the fishermen have yet to sway homeowners around Lake Austin who miss the lakeside life they once enjoyed and who fear property values may fall as the plant clogs the waters. Also, many dismiss the economic importance of bass fishing.
"Maybe they bought a six pack of beer before they put the boat in," said Shirley Coleman, who lives on the lake where the average home costs more than a million dollars. She is a member of Friends of Lake Austin, a group of lake users organized to eradicate the weed. "Hydrilla is wicked stuff," she said. "While we're sitting here arguing about it, hydrilla is taking over more and more of the lake."
Hydrilla, originally native to Asia and Australia, is believed to have been introduced accidentally in Florida in the 1950's, possibly when someone emptied a fish tank and set the aquarium plant free. Because hydrilla can resprout from the tiniest piece of a broken stem, the plant has traveled easily on motorboat propellers and boat trailers across the country to Arizona and California, costing many millions of dollars in eradication, control and water-system repairs. Hydrilla has shown up as far north as Washington State, and last year it turned up in Maine.
Hydrilla covered 23 acres of Lake Austin in 1999, but by last May it covered 300. Growing in long strands upward from its roots in the sediment and branching out profusely at the surface, the plant creates dense curtains and mats of vines, tangling boat propellers, tripping up wake boarders, snagging water-skiers and frightening off swimmers.
So far no method of control has satisfied everyone. There were vehement objections to the use of herbicides in this reservoir. Boats can mow and harvest hydrilla, a method preferred by fishermen and environmentalists, but many say the process is too expensive and inefficient.
Dams have been used to lower the level of water in the lake, exposing the hydrilla to killing cold in the winter. But the plants surge back in the spring. Managers have even explored using tiny enemies, like the hydrilla fly and a hydrilla beetle, though neither has proved terribly effective.
For many, the only answer is to buy grass carp that have been rendered safely sterile, and then release the hungry swimmers by the thousands, as is under way at Lake Austin. 
"I work with foreign species problems so I have some qualms, but I've looked at this issue from all kinds of different angles," said Dr. Tom Arsuffi, an aquatic ecologist at Southwest Texas State University, who recently completed a tracking study showing that even in a flood, small numbers of radio-tagged fish did not escape the dammed Lake Austin and swim downriver. "This is a long-term solution. With the right amount of fish, the grass carp can keep the hydrilla trimmed for 20 years."
So far, the 1,600 grass carp released into Lake Austin have had no obvious effect. Texas Parks and Wildlife gave the city a permit to release as many as 6,400. Mary Gilroy, an environmental scientist with the city, said it would release the fish in increments as necessary.
But far from achieving a neat solution, scientists say Lake Austin's ecological experiment has just begun.
For years, researchers have tried without success to find a method for determining how many grass carp are required for a given situation. Still shooting in the dark, managers can never be sure if they will get no effect, perfectly proportioned elimination or if the fish will eradicate every bit of greenery.
Critics also fear there is a danger that fertile fish could end up in the water. Companies that sell grass carp typically subject fertilized eggs to intense pressure, causing the egg to retain an extra set of chromosomes and rendering it sterile.
Dr. Earl Chilton, aquatic habitat enhancement program director at Texas Parks and Wildlife, said that every fish was tested once. Any fertile fish, that is, any fish carrying the normal number of chromosomes, are removed. A second small sample is tested later and if any fish are fertile, the entire batch is tossed out, Dr. Chilton said.
But despite safeguards, critics say it is still possible for a fertile fish to be released and establish a permanent population of these crafty creatures that are so difficult to catch, even in a net.
So far, all the heat around grass carp seems to center around Lake Austin. Yet it is in the Rio Grande, where another major release of grass carp was approved by the state last month, that hydrilla has arguably done its most awesome damage.
With the river already low because of a drought, hydrilla has clogged its channel, slowing water flow and encouraging quicker evaporation. As a result, the mighty Rio Grande, an international waterway and an international border, has turned into a drying dribble, just yards short of the ocean.
In fact, because the United States-Mexico border is in the river, the control of hydrilla is considerably more complex than in Lake Austin. Cutter boats must avoid crossing the border. Herbicides have been out of the question because scientists were unable to find an appropriate chemical approved for use in both countries.
Yet despite the fact that 23,000 grass carp will soon be released in the Rio Grande, Dr. Chilton said only two people showed up for a public meeting on the situation. He noted that the Mexican government was in favor of using the fish and that the Fish and Wildlife Service had sent written notice that it expected no bad effects from the carp.
Twenty years ago though, nearly 300,000 fertile grass carp were released in Lake Conroe, Tex.
"Lake Conroe went from being a world-class bass fishery to a big mudhole," said Mr. Anderson, describing the lake as an unmitigated disaster, stripped of vegetation, foreign and native.
But not everyone agrees. 
"It's so strange," said Ms. Coleman, who found the negative reaction quizzical. "The Lake Conroe people successfully conquered it. They say it's beautiful."

GRAPHIC: Photos (Al Granberg/The New York Times; photo by Brian Nelson, Southwest Florida Water Management District) Chart: "A Destructive Tangle, a Controversial Cure"Hydrilla verticillata, a water plant native to Southeast Asia and Africa, has spread throughout lakes and rivers of the Southeast, carpeting surfaces like that of the Withlacoohee River in Florida, below. Profuse branching creates dense canopies at the surface, interfering with swimming, fishing, waterskiing and boating. Canopies restrict water flow, causing evaporation and floods and providing breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Canopies reduce light, killing off native plant species.And fishing suffers as native species like bass lose habitat. Fragments drifting away or carried by trailers and motors can establish new infestations in other lakes. IS THIS FISH THE ANSWER?Grass carp, a voracious eater, could consume the hydrilla. But it could also eliminate other plants. (Source: Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection)

HEADLINE: War Tests a German Niche Industry 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: ERKRATH, Germany, April 3 

 BODY:
From the makers of the duct tape bought by Americans fearful of a terrorist attack to the suppliers of sandstorm-proof goggles to British and American troops, German companies have profited handsomely from the American-led war on Iraq. 
 Perhaps nobody has done as well as Hasso von Blucher, a spry 61-year-old businessman who has spent his career studying how to stop chemical weapons from incapacitating soldiers in the field. 
 Mr. von Blucher's company produces the carbon-laced fabric that goes into the protective suits worn by the soldiers and marines in Iraq. If Saddam Hussein were to resort to a chemical attack, Mr. von Blucher's fabric could make the difference between a nuisance and a nightmare. 
Over lunch recently in the 19th-century castle that serves as both his home and the headquarters of his company, Blucher G.m.b.H., he seemed preternaturally calm about the threat of an assault. 
"I know the performance of the suits," said Mr. von Blucher, who is the company's owner and president. "They are good. They are very, very good. They will protect the bodies of the soldiers perfectly."
Only when pressed did he acknowledge, "It's a critical moment for us."
Self-doubt, it seems, is not a Blucher family trait. Mr. von Blucher is the son of a general in Hitler's chemical defense corps. He is a descendant of Gebhard von Blucher, the celebrated Prussian field marshal, who helped the Duke of Wellington vanquish Napoleon at Waterloo.
Growing up in a military family during the cold war, Mr. von Blucher was fascinated by chemical and nuclear arms. After a tour, at his father's behest, in the unit of the West German Army responsible for defense against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, he decided to turn his experience into a business.
Mr. von Blucher's company, based in Erkrath, a leafy suburb of Dusseldorf, commands nearly 80 percent of the world market for the fabric that goes into chemical-protection suits. Since he and a cousin started the company in 1969, it has sold fabric for 5.5 million suits to the armies of 21 countries, including nearly 3 million to the United States military.
The company's secret is a layered design that uses thousands of tiny beads of extremely absorbent carbon, which trap lethal chemical substances but allow air to circulate around the body. The system, known by the trade name Saratoga, makes the suits lighter and cooler than their bulky predecessors.
Even so, Mr. von Blucher estimates that suits made with his fabric reduce the mobility of soldiers by 20 percent. He is working on a new generation of suits that he hopes will be no more confining than regular uniforms.
"My personal goal is to neutralize the effect of chemical weapons by dramatically improving the suits," he said. "I want to make them so advanced that it no longer makes sense to launch the artillery." 
Blucher makes its fabric here and through a subsidiary in Eastport, Me., called Tex-Shield. The suits are stitched together by seven garment manufacturers in the United States, which supply the finished products to the military. With 80 employees, Blucher had sales of close to $200 million last year. 
The company first broke into the American market shortly before the 1991 Persian Gulf war, when the Air Force and the Marines concluded that their existing protective gear was inadequate to a chemical weapons assault. 
Iraq, Mr. von Blucher acknowledges, has been great for business. 
"Of course we profit from it," he said. "Suppliers of bread and butter to the army also profit from it." 
Nevertheless, Mr. von Blucher has distinctly mixed feelings about the war. He does not oppose it outright, as do a majority of Germans. But he is skeptical that the Iraqi government poses a dire threat to the world, even if it is hiding stockpiles of chemical and biological agents. 
"Does Saddam have theinfrastructure to deliver weapons of mass destruction?" Mr. von Blucher asked. "I doubt it." 
At best, he contended, Iraq would be able to fire a handful of rockets armed with chemical warheads to slow the advance of the Americans. Such a strategy would kill few soldiers, but rattle many of them. 
Mr. von Blucher's misgivings run deeper than his doubts about Iraq's capabilities. He said he would support the war if he believed that the removal of the Iraqi government would begin to redress what he sees as the malignant legacy of colonialism in the Middle East. 
"The difficult thing is all the other motivations," Mr. von Blucher said, choosing his words carefully. "It is, of course, an oil war. It is, of course, driven by the military-industrial complex." 
Although Mr. von Blucher turned away from a military career -- he spent the latter part of the 1960's as a left-wing intellectual in Frankfurt -- he still has evident respect for professional warriors. 
He recites the exploits of Field Marshal von Blucher, whose portrait has pride of place in the dining room of his home. He is proud, too, of his father, Johann Albrecht von Blucher, who he says advised Hitler to avoid using chemical weapons because the Nazis lacked air superiority over the Allies and would be vulnerable to retaliatory strikes. 
"My biggest concern in this war is that the civilians have undercut the military," Mr. von Blucher said. 
Since 75 percent of his sales come from the world's armed forces, Mr. von Blucher has an interest in not offending his customers. It is a sign of the times, however, that he may not have to rely as heavily on the military as he has in the past. Mr. von Blucher said he was already gearing up to supply suits to protect emergency workers in the United States from a terrorist attack.
"The civil defense industry is a growing business," he said. "The first responders are all going to be wearing our suits."

HEADLINE: Retail Borrowing Slowed in February 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing through credit cards and auto loans edged up at a slower pace in February as Americans bought fewer new cars and trucks, Federal Reserve statistics released today showed.
 Household credit increased 1 percent, or $1.5 billion, after rising by a revised $12.3 billion in January. 
The smaller increase reflected the biggest drop in nonrevolving credit, which includes auto loans, since October 1991. The Fed's report excludes loans secured by real estate, like mortgages. 
 The economy lost 357,000 jobs in February and unemployment rose to 5.8 percent. With confidence in the economy at a nine-year low, consumer spending stalled at the levels of December and January. Such spending, constituting a majority of the economy, is sensitive to the job market.
Economists had predicted a $3 billion rise in February credit. The Fed previously said January consumer credit surged $13.2 billion.
The increase brought total nonmortgage credit in January to $1.74 trillion.

HEADLINE: War and a Slowdown Empty Caribbean Beaches 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: JUAN DOLIO, Dominican Republic, April 5 

 BODY:
Just when tourists were finally beginning to think it was safe to travel, a slowing economy and nervousness over flying during the Iraq war are threatening to stop the slow recovery from the post-Sept. 11 slump that hit the Caribbean islands.
 Fears of terrorist attacks and a sluggish economy have cut new bookings almost by half in some popular resort areas, with the smaller islands of the eastern Caribbean especially vulnerable, travel executives and tourism officials said. They nevertheless expressed relief that there had not been the kind of widespread cancellations that followed the Persian Gulf war of 1991 or the paralysis of air travel after the 2001 terrorist attacks. 
 Tourism officials met this weekend in Jamaica to consider incentives and promotional campaigns to bolster the industry, although they are holding off on aggressive advertising so as not to appear callous or overeager. In time, they want to emphasize the peace and calm of the islands. 
The beachfront boulevard here is too quiet, however, for the idle bartenders and gift shop vendors who thrive on the tourists who customarily cram the sidewalks and streets. There is word that the British tour groups that descend upon this resort strip east of the capital, Santo Domingo, each May have already canceled a third of their reservations.
"Things started to drop quickly a month ago," said Manuel Gonzalez, who sells souvenirs at Chocolate Plaza. "The war is to blame. The street should be busy. The best things the Dominican Republic has are baseball and tourism. But look at that street." 
The Persian Gulf war hit the region hard a dozen years ago, with destinations like the Dominican Republic losing 28 percent of their business, officials said. The Sept. 11 attacks were devastating, as well, because most tourists arrive by air. 
Business plummeted, prompting layoffs, discounts and subsidies to lure visitors. Officials said that the Dominican Republic lost $450 million in tourism revenues from Sept. 11, 2001, through last December.
As travelers from the main markets of Europe and North America adjusted to the new realties of air travel after Sept. 11, business inched upward this past winter, with resorts reporting near-capacity crowds. The first half of March had hotels posting 85 percent occupancy rates in the Dominican Republic, officials said. Jamaican destinations were also doing well.
"In the first gulf war, cancellations were overwhelming," said Gordon Stewart, the chairman of Sandals Resorts and the majority shareholder in Air Jamaica. "This one, it is as if people had almost two years of getting accustomed to a different way of life. In some ways, they were saying it was time to get on with life."
Time and experience also allowed the industry to prepare, as executives huddled with officials at the highest levels of government. The Dominican Republic's president, Hipolito Mejia, discussed contingency plans for tourists stranded by suspensions of air travel. The government also assured the airlines that it would provide them with jet fuel even in the event of supply disruptions.
A half dozen Swiss tourists sipped rum drinks and played cards along the beaches of Juan Dolio, where a coconut vendor introduced them to a couple of local women. Rudolf Lehmann, a salesman from Bern, said he had no worries about coming here for the fourth time since 1996. The beaches may be emptier, but they are also better kept and calm.
"This part of the world has no problems," he said, looking over at the near-empty beach. "This country does not have oil, only bananas. For us, we did not feel nervous at all coming over here."
Tourism officials hope to lure more people by emphasizing quiet, lazy vacations in nearby havens that are easily reached. Mr. Stewart said that his airline -- and Jamaican tourism -- benefited by having numerous direct flights from many American cities. They also think they could appeal to Europeans who would normally go to the southern Mediterranean coast.
"If we take advantage of this opportunity, we can do well," said Frank Rainieri, president of Punta Cana Resort and Club, a popular destination that has rejuvenated the southeast tip of the Dominican Republic. "The Europeans have a tradition of summer vacations."
But until the war is over, it will be difficult to advertise, industry executives say, particularly on television. "What can we do until then?" said Mr. Stewart, who added that although his resorts were full, Jamaican tourism as a whole had seen future bookings drop by 40 percent since the war's start. "Almost nothing except go through your routines, every day you stay in touch with the marketplace, building on it block by block and make sure you are in place. But it is wrong to blast away with advertisements. people are at war," he said.
Industry analysts said that one of the more debilitating factors, especially among the smaller, more vulnerable islands, was the general economic downturn in the United States, where people are reluctant either to travel or, if they do, to spend much while they are on vacation.
"In the Caribbean, it's more about the economy," said Scott Berman, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who tracks the hotel industry. "The war is additional pressure put on hotel managers to attract visitation. The challenges they have had to face started well before 9/11 because the economy and the airlines were already slumping."
Those problems may worsen, given the financial problems at American Airlines, which handles a majority of the traffic to the Caribbean. Officials worry that the airline may increase costs or reduce service, which would most hurt the smaller islands that do not have a national carrier or other partners. Some officials have suggested that the island carriers form a regional Caribbean airline as an alternative to American Airlines.
Mr. Rainieri said another option was to form a regional tourism booking and promotion company, an idea reflecting his strong belief that individual islands compete too much with one another while putting themselves at the mercy of large tour operators and cruise lines.
"We Caribbean people have to do what the Europeans did," he said. "We have to unite to be allowed to market this unique brand which is the Caribbean. It is not being done now because of the mental mediocrity that exists."

HEADLINE: American Air Discloses Cuts In May Flights 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
American Airlines said yesterday that it would curtail its May flight schedule by cutting its international service by 13 percent and domestic service by 2 percent from planned levels because of the travel slump caused by the war in Iraq and a slow economy.
 American, the world's largest carrier, is struggling to cut costs and return to profitability during the worst downturn ever for the airline industry. Last week, it said it barely avoided having to file for bankruptcy protection by getting its workers to agree tentatively to $1.8 billion in annual concessions. American's three leading unions are expected to vote on their shares of those cuts before next Monday. 
 Last month, after the war began, American joined other carriers in saying it would reduce the number of seats it has in the air. It said then that its April international schedule would have a 6 percent capacity reduction compared with April last year. Its domestic capacity for April would take a 7 percent reduction, the company said, but that had already been planned before the onset of the war.
The cuts to come in May are an entirely new set of reductions.
Continental Airlines also said yesterday that it was cutting service. It will suspend, from April 12 to June 2, its five-days-a-week flight from Newark to Hong Kong. The airline said fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which is spreading in Hong Kong and southern China, were curtailing traffic to those parts of Asia.
Last week, Gordon M. Bethune, the chief executive of Continental, said about a third of passengers booked on Newark-Hong Kong flights were not showing up. The usual no-show rate is less than 10 percent, he said.
Continental also runs flights between Hong Kong and Guam and said it would keep up that service.
Tara Baten, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said SARS did not factor into American's decision to cut capacity in May because its network is much less exposed to Asia than those of some of its rivals. Last Friday, United Airlines, operating under bankruptcy protection, said it was suspending flights between Hong Kong and Singapore for two weeks in April because of low demand. Northwest Airlines has 26 percent of its capacity on Asian routes, but it has not announced any cutbacks.
John Heimlich, an economist at the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group, said yesterday that passenger traffic on large domestic airlines fell 15.8 percent systemwide for the week ending April 5, compared with the same period last year. Trans-Pacific traffic was down 23.4 percent, he said. Domestic traffic fell 13.1 percent.
In the last week, companies have curtailed travel to Asia. The Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group for business travelers, said yesterday that a survey it had just completed showed that 58 percent of 144 responding companies were banning travel to Asia. Last Tuesday, it released a similar survey showing that 27 percent of respondents were banning travel to Asia, with another 8 percent considering doing so.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
As PricesFall For Crude Oil, OPEC Leader Calls for Talks

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
OPEC's president called yesterday for a special meeting later this month to discuss the recent slide in oil prices, which have fallen almost 20 percent since just before the war with Iraq began.
 Speaking to reporters in Paris after meeting with French government officials, the OPEC leader, Abdullah al-Attiyah, who is Qatar's oil minister, said: "My main worry is how to deal with the dramatic price drop. The market is full of oil. It's facing a glut, not a shortage." He suggested a meeting on April 24 at the group's headquarters in Vienna. 
 Since the beginning of the year, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has gradually increased output above its official quotas to provide extra oil for global markets in the wake of a national strike in Venezuela and in anticipation of war in Iraq. Oil prices remained stubbornly high for most of the winter, despite OPEC's efforts, until the recent decline, caused largely by the expectation that a swift victory by United States-led forces would quickly revive Iraqi oil exports.
To halt the fall in crude oil prices on world markets, OPEC may decide to rein in production, holding it at its official quota levels, industry analysts said. "They're worried about a price slide," said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London research group. "They will tell each other: 'We must go down to our quotas. The crisis is over, prices are at $23 a barrel and we must act.' "
Mr. Drollas was referring to the cost of Brent crude oil on the International Petroleum Exchange in London, which fell as low as $23.40 a barrel yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for May delivery closed at $27.96, down 66 cents.
Retail prices, particularly for gasoline, though still at relatively high levels, eased for the third consecutive week. The Energy Department said the average price at the pump for regular unleaded gasoline fell 1.9 cents, to $1.63 a gallon, in the week ended yesterday. That was down from a record $1.728 in the week of March 17. Prices are higher in some parts of the country, notably California and sections of the New York metropolitan area.
Industry analysts said that crude oil prices might remain somewhat volatile for some time, given the political instability in several major exporting countries.
"How stable is the Venezuelan recovery?" said Vera de Ladoucette, senior director for Middle East research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, expressing a worry that still vexes the market. "When will Nigeria be back? And when will Iraq will be back? We know there is no damage to Iraqi oil installations, but it takes time to bring that all back on stream."
As OPEC countries have increased production over the last few months to compensate for these problems, Ms. de Ladoucette said, OPEC has worried that it could be creating a glut. Nearly all members of the group are producing at their capacities, pumping a total of about three million barrels a day more than their official quotas, Mr. Drollas said.
Any change in output would probably not take effect until June or even July, said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, mainly because OPEC members already have contracts with buyers for next month's oil sales.
"You're not talking about a faucet they will turn on or off," Mr. Goldstein said.
In the meantime, the extra OPEC production is replenishing supplies of crude oil in the United States that were badly depleted by the fall in exports from Venezuela and the cold winter. Wholesale oil prices had been much more volatile until extra OPEC exports began arriving in the United States a few weeks ago and were then counted in Energy Department estimates of oil inventories around the country. 
Mr. Goldstein said, "We think that the worst is over as far as crude oil supplies go."

HEADLINE: Stock Dealing at Union-Owned Insurer Creates a Schism Within Labor 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The nation's labor leaders are split into two feuding camps over how to respond to the stock trading under investigation at Ullico, the beleaguered union-owned insurance company, and to the company's deepening financial crisis.
 Some, led by John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, are pressing Ullico directors who made more than $6 million trading the insurer's stock to surrender their profits. With the trades a subject of three federal investigations, these labor leaders say giving up those profits to the company would be a step toward ending a profound embarrassment to the labor movement and restoring confidence in Ullico, which some directors say may not survive without major changes. 
 But those in the other camp, led by Martin J. Maddaloni, president of the plumbers' union, and including other officials in the building trades unions, say there is no need for such "disgorgement." They maintain that the directors who made large trading profits did nothing wrong and acted no differently from directors on many corporate boards. 
In the deal at issue, many company directors bought Ullico stock in November 1999 at a price set by the board, knowing that the board would soon most likely reset the share price far higher. A year later 17 of those directors, half of what was then the entire board, sold the stock back to the company at nearly three times the purchase price, knowing that the board was likely to reset the stock price far lower. All the 17 sellers were current or former union officials.
An investigative report by James R. Thompson, a special counsel retained by the board, found that the directors had enriched themselves at the expense of other shareholders, mainly unions and their pension funds, which had not been granted the same trading opportunities. Mr. Thompson, former governor of Illinois, found that a forceful argument could be made that Ullico's chairman and chief executive, Robert A. Georgine, had violated his duties to the company by engineering the transactions.
"All this has seriously undermined the labor movement," said Charles Craver, a professor of labor law at George Washington University. "It's bad enough when we see these shenanigans at Enron or WorldCom, but when union officials get involved in anything that has an appearance of impropriety and it looks as if they're benefiting like capitalists, workers begin to question whose side they're on."
Like Mr. Sweeney, the presidents of the laborers' union, the operating engineers and the hotel and restaurant employees have called on Ullico's directors to return their trading profits. They point to the decision by Douglas J. McCarron, president of the carpenters' union, to return more than $200,000 he made.
"I think disgorgement by everyone would be a step in the right direction," said the laborers' president, Terence O'Sullivan, a Ullico director who did not engage in the trading. "All this has been a distraction. It's time to focus the board's time and attention on ensuring the future success of Ullico on behalf of the men and women of organized labor."
Ullico was founded in 1925 to provide affordable life insurance to blue-collar union members. Its value soared in the late 1990's after its $7.6 million investment in Global Crossing, a telecommunications company, had skyrocketed to more than $1 billion. But by 2000, Global Crossing shares had begun a nosedive, cutting Ullico's value and fostering its financial crisis.
Some Ullico directors say privately that it is time for Mr. Georgine to step down. They maintain that if the current management remains, it will be hard for Ullico to obtain the $50 million in new investment that he says it needs. 
Many labor leaders say they were shocked to learn how much Mr. Georgine, former president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s building trades department, had earned at Ullico. Mr. Thompson calculated that Mr. Georgine, who made $6 million in Ullico stock trades separate from the arrangement on which the federal inquiries are focused, received $10.7 million from 1999 to 2001, including the proceeds of those trades. Two directors said that in addition, the board had established an $11 million deferred compensation plan for him. Further, Mr. Georgine had Ullico buy a corporate jet that board members say costs $3 million a year to operate.
At a board meeting on March 28, several directors said, Mr. Georgine proposed returning his trading profits but met resistance from members who understood that this would increase pressure on them to return their own.
Thomas C. Green, a lawyer for Ullico, defends the stock trades, saying they were consistent with what directors do at other companies. 
"Considering the success of Ullico's portfolio, the compensation for Mr. Georgine and other officers is not just compatible with what exists in other areas of our commercial society, it's less than what's comparable," Mr. Green said. "There's no fundamental unfairness here. No one was disadvantaged in some classic notion of someone taking advantage."
Several union officials critical of Mr. Georgine say that after Mr. Thompson's report was issued to the board last fall, the chairman and other directors received bad advice from Ullico's outside lawyers, a circumstance that, these officials say, helped cause the controversy to fester. According to these officials, Ullico's lawyers urged the directors to dig in, telling them that Mr. Thompson was wrong to have concluded that they had breached their fiduciary duties. The lawyers also told the board that Mr. Thompson had found no violations of law.
In a highly unusual statement last Friday, Mr. Thompson accused Ullico and its lawyers of making defamatory statements on one hand, in describing his inquiry as inadequate, while on the other misrepresenting its findings to mount a public defense. Far from the assertion that his investigation found no violations of law, he said, he actually found compelling evidence of state securities law violations.

HEADLINE: In Budget Fight With Legislature, Pataki Threatens to Run State With Emergency Bills 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 7 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki defiantly threatened today to run the government for the rest of the year on emergency spending appropriations because legislative leaders have refused to pass his proposed budget, which includes deep cutbacks in education and heath care.
 Mr. Pataki, a Republican who has vowed not to raise taxes to bail the state and city out of their fiscal problems, said the demands for new spending from the leaders of both legislative chambers were still far above what he believed the state could afford. 
 He added that neither leader had come forward with realistic proposals for raising new revenue and that budget talks over the last week had made "little or no progress" toward an agreement. 
"We are preparing to run the state throughout the fiscal year using emergency bills in a way that continues to meet the obligations of the state and provides ongoing services that the people expect, and appropriately so, from the state," Mr. Pataki said, making a rare appearance after a meeting with legislative leaders. "And I hope it doesn't come to that, and I think we have a limited period of time to avoid that."
It remained unclear as the governor spoke how he would meet the state's obligations to pay school districts, local governments and contractors on time if a final budget were never passed. The governor's spending plan for the fiscal year that began April 1 hinges on $3.8 billion in borrowing. Mr. Pataki has proposed a zero-growth $90.8 billion budget that would reduce spending on schools by $1.2 billion and curb the growth in Medicaid spending by cutting $1 billion in health care services.
Mr. Pataki's aides maintain that he can slow government spending enough to meet the state's basic obligations, and his budget director has already cut back state spending significantly in the two emergency appropriations bills passed in the past seven days, one last week and one today. The governor retains total control over how much to spend under those bills.
"We are not and never were planning on shutting down the government," said one senior budget official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We are going to be able to limp along and make payments when we have to."
Aides to the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, doubted that Mr. Pataki could operate the government for long without borrowing money. State law, for instance, requires the administration to make a $1.3 billion payment to local school districts June 1. Mr. Silver's aides said it was unlikely that the state would collect enough tax revenue in April and May to meet that deadline without the borrowing. Earlier this year, the Pataki administration predicted that the state would have only about $195 million on hand at the end of May even with the borrowing in place.
Still, the state budget has not been passed on time in 19 years, despite a constitutional requirement to do so, and the school districts have managed in the past by borrowing money themselves or by raising local property taxes. So some lawmakers saw the governor's threat as real.
"The deadline is phony," said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman of Manhattan, who voted against the one-week emergency appropriation of $1 billion passed today. "This is politics, not economics. The governor can just force local jurisdictions in areas like schools to make up the gaps caused by cuts in state funding."
If history is a guide, Mr. Pataki is not making an idle threat. In 2001, as the economy soured, the governor refused for months to approve spending increases above his original budget plan, relying instead on emergency appropriations. Frustrated, legislative leaders finally passed a stripped-down budget in August that removed many of the governor's treasured programs in an effort to force him to the negotiating table.
It did not work. The Sept. 11 attacks ended up breaking the impasse, and a final budget was adopted in October that raised spending and paid for it, in large part, with the largest expansion of casino gambling in the state's history.
Mr. Pataki cited his actions that year as proof that he was willing and able to run the state with emergency appropriations. The governor's threat today appeared intended to throw the burden on the Legislature to come up with new sources of revenue.
The legislators could bring the government to a halt at any time by refusing to pass the emergency appropriations bills, but doing that would run the risk of a standoff with the governor that might be politically devastating to them. The other option open to the leaders for the two houses would be to vote down the governor's budget and approve their own, but then they would have to be prepared to override his veto.
There were signs today that the impasse between the governor and legislative leaders was growing worse. For starters, neither the Republican governor nor his colleagues in the Senate have dropped their opposition to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's request for a commuter tax. "We're not going to put it back," declared Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, after an hourlong meeting with Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki.
The governor was equally blunt, saying as he has in the past that the commuter tax would drive jobs away to other states. "I have gotten calls from business leaders with significant employees in New York City, saying, 'Put that commuter tax in and I'm moving out of the state,' " he said.
Mr. Silver said Mr. Pataki's budget cuts would drive businesses elsewhere, because they would force New York City and other local governments to raise property taxes to cover the cost of education and health care. "No business ever made a decision based on the commuter tax," he said.
William T. Cunningham, the mayor's chief spokesman, said the Bloomberg administration had heard the same sort of comments from the governor and Senator Bruno before. "What we don't hear is any ideas on how to help us," he said.
All three leaders in Albany voiced their opposition to another proposal that would raise money for the city: putting electronic slot machines in Off-Track Betting parlors, creating what would amount to small casinos. The idea, first proposed by some Republicans in the Assembly, was presented this weekend in private budget talks, but seemed to lose luster today.
"We don't need casinos on the street corner," Mr. Silver said. He added that the proposal would deepen social problems, like bankruptcy, prostitution, theft and substance abuse. Those problems would cost more to cure than the potential revenue from gambling, he said.
The governor made it plain that he had not changed his rigid opposition to new broad-based taxes as a way to balance the state's books, despite a concerted campaign by unions, teachers and social-service advocates to persuade him that taxing the wealthy would be a better choice.
"It is always easy in the short term to raise a tax, and God knows this state has done that many times in the past," he said. "But the consequences are limited growth, fewer jobs, fewer state revenues coming in because you have that limited growth, less investment and, ultimately, less ability to invest in schoolsand health care."

HEADLINE: Holocaust Survivors' Insurance Ordeal 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
When Jack Weiss got out of the concentration camp at Muldorf at the end of World War II, he returned to Vrable, Czechoslovakia, to find his family home in ruins. Exhausted and weak, he moved into an abandoned house with other refugees. 
 Scraping by on relief agency handouts, Mr. Weiss, his sister and three brothers, who had also survived concentration camps, remembered that their father, who was killed at Auschwitz, had taken out a life insurance policy from a big Italian company, Assicurazioni Generali. In the late summer of 1945, they contacted the insurance company. But when they could not produce a death certificate or policy, they were turned away. 
 "Of course you couldn't get a death certificate from Auschwitz," said Mr. Weiss, who is now 75 and living in Toronto and Los Angeles. "And how could we have the policy? They took everything from us when they took us away. The company gave us the runaround, and after a while we just gave up." 
Now, nearly 60 years later, Mr. Weiss, a retired watchmaker, is again trying to have Generali pay the old claim. He and seven other Holocaust survivors have filed a suit against Generali for the value of their policies, which their lawyer, William M. Shernoff, estimates may now be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each, perhaps even millions of dollars, with punitive damages included.
The new lawsuits, which were filed late yesterday in Superior Court in Los Angeles, represent an escalation in a long-running story that, some insurance experts say, could eventually involve tens of thousands of plaintiffs and billions of dollars in payments, far exceeding the $1.25 billion settlement with the Swiss banks in 1998 on behalf of Holocaust survivors.
Generali, one of the world's largest insurance companies, is at the center of the argument over Holocaust-era insurance. Founded by Jewish merchants in 1831 in Trieste, it had a thriving business in Jewish communities in Europe before the Holocaust. Insurance policies and annuities were often referred to as a poor man's Swiss bank account. Tens of thousands of people turned to these investments, trusting in companies like Generali to pay claims if trouble broke out in their home countries. 
Beginning in 1997, more than 20 European insurers were sued for failing to pay claims on these policies. But most of the suits have been settled or dismissed; the German insurers were exempted as a result of a $5.1 billion settlement on Holocaust issues by the United States and Germany in 2000. That left Generali as the main defendant. 
What allowed the new lawsuits against Generali to go forward -- along with a dozen existing ones, including three that are seeking class-action status -- was a recent decision by Federal District Judge Michael B. Mukasey in Manhattan. Generali and another insurer, Zurich Life Insurance, a unit of Zurich Financial Services that is named in one of the lawsuits, tried to persuade Judge Mukasey to dismiss the lawsuits and force the plaintiffs to try to resolve their claims through an international commission that was set up to guarantee payments. 
But the judge said the commission, financed by the insurance companies and without judicial oversight, could not be relied upon for fair treatment. "In a sense," he wrote, "the commission is the company store."
The real driving force for the plantiffs is a deep, burning fury at what they say is the persistent dodging and stalling of the insurance companies, particularly Generali, and the woeful performance of the international commission, formally known as the International Commission for Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims.
For its part, Generali says that legally it owes nothing to its old policyholders and their heirs but that it has made efforts for what it calls humanitarian reasons to find policyholders and to offer compensation. It has paid claims over the last several years through the commission, which was set up with the participation of three large Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, and sanctioned by the United States government. The idea was that, by adopting a nonadversarial process, the commission would be able to get compensation to claimants quicker than courts. 
Lawrence Eagleburger, chairman of the commission and a former secretary of state, initially declined to comment. But in a statement yesterday, he defended the commission, saying that it had "instituted a number of creative solutions that benefit claimants." He praised Generali and said it had paid claims through the commission when "it would not have been required to do so under normal insurance practices." 
Generali contributed $100 million of the commission's $400 million -- by far the biggest contribution by a single insurance company -- and, like the five other insurers that joined, was promised that regulators would drop threats to suspend the licenses of the insurers' subsidiaries in the United States and try to discourage potentially embarrassing lawsuits. 
But the commission has been criticized by survivors and insurance experts as favoring the insurers, processing claims slowly and offering paltry payments. Since its inception, the commission has offered payments on about 2,900 claims for a total of $36.9 million. But the commission's expenses as of 17 months ago had already climbed to $40 million. The offers average about $12,500 each. Some have been as low as $500, but Generali has paid some claims for several hundred thousand dollars each, including one for nearly $600,000. Altogether, Generali said it had paid about $35 million, mainly through the commission, to 2,200 claimants. 
Barbara Senn, a former insurance commissioner for Washington State, had high hopes for the commission. But in a recent interview she said it had been "a huge disappointment." 
Generali has maintained that it is not liable for these policies, in part because many were confiscated by the Nazis, who then demanded payment. Later, governments took over the company's offices in many countries. While the policyholders may not have received the money, "the insurance company paid somebody," said Kenneth Bialkin, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who is leading Generali's legal team. 
Generali said on Friday and Sunday that its operations in Czechoslovakia were taken over in May 1945, before Mr. Weiss says his family was rebuffed for lack of documents.
But Tomas Jelinek, who served as an economic adviser to Vaclav Havel when he was president of the Czech Republic, said in a telephone interview that the nationalization of insurance companies in his country began after a presidential degree was issued on Oct. 24, 1945. Guidelines for procedures were not published until October 1946. In a hearing on Holocaust insurance in Miami on May 19, 1999, Ricardo Nicolini, a senior Generali executive, said the takeover of Generali's offices took place on Nov. 20, 1946.
Generali maintained in a statement that it was never company policy to demand death certificates and policies from Holocaust victims and that it was unaware of any Generali customers who were treated that way. In 1999, however, Generali paid a reported $1.25 million to settle a lawsuit by Adolf Stern, a retired owner of necktie stores in New York. Shortly after getting out of Buchenwald in May 1945, Mr. Stern said, he made his way to the Generali offices in Prague, hoping to collect on a policy on his father, who died in Auschwitz. But he said Generali demanded to see a death certificate and a copy of the policy. 
Reminded of the Stern case, a Generali executive in New York said Mr. Stern had since backed away from that statement. Reached in Miami on Sunday, Mr. Stern said he stood by his account.
Mr. Weiss has received an offer through the commission of about $2,000, or five times the original value of his father's policy. "They're offering me something ridiculous," he said. "For all these years, they were trying to avoid paying. Now, I'd rather have nothing than that they should write me off with $2,000."
Jack Brauns, a retired surgeon in Southern California, said he was offered $5,000 for a $2,000 policy that he first tried to collect on in Rome in 1945 after getting out of the concentration camp at Dachau. He sued Generali nearly three years ago.
One of the other new plaintiffs, Suzanne Weiner-Zada, an artists' representative in Los Angeles, is trying to getpayment for a handful of policies, including one on her 10-year-old brother, Laszlo, killed in Auschwitz. Like Mr. Weiss, Mrs. Weiner-Zada says that Generali insisted upon proof of coverage. Last July, through the commission, Mrs. Weiner-Zada received a settlement offer of $10,533, which was raised over the weekend to $16,012. She became furious, she said, when she was asked to acknowledge in writing that Generali was acting out of charity and not in fullfilment of any obligation.
"It's like they're offering this money out of the goodness of their heart, that I should be grateful to them," she said. "But I'm not grateful to them. My father paid for this policy, and I should be able to enjoy the benefits. That I have to be grateful to them is such a cry for injustice that the sky should fall." 
As the case moves forward, lawyers for both sides have been taking videotaped depositions of the plaintiffs, all of whom are elderly and may not live to see a trial. 
Though billions of dollars are at stake, Generali's finances are strong. Its earnings lately, like those of other European insurers, have suffered because of the slump in the markets. In 2002 it reported a loss of 754.5 million euros (about $777 million) on revenue of 46.9 billion euros. But it reported capital and reserves of 8.6 billion euros. 
In a business that relies heavily on public trust, insurance experts say the potential damage to Generali's reputation from having survivors testify in court that for decades it ignored or denied their claims, is far more worrisome than the immediate costs of any settlement.
"They don't want to be tarred with the historical responsibility" of not having paid claims they should have paid, said Daniel Kadden, a former aid to the insurance commissioner of Washington and a consultant to Holocaust survivor organizations.

United Ways across the country have struggled to raise money in the charity's 2002-03 campaign, which is shaping up to be one of the worst fund-raising periods in three decades for the organization.
 Brian A. Gallagher, the president and chief executive of the United Way of America, the umbrella organization, said the system's annual campaigns were likely to produce as much as 4 percent less than they did in the 2001-02 campaign, when $3.95 billion was raised. 
 The United Way had expected fund-raising to fall by 2.3 percent, even with early reports of increases in places like Milwaukee, where the campaign pulled in $34 million, a 6.2 percent increase over 2001-02, and Birmingham, Ala., where donations rose by 4.1 percent to $31 million.
But those gains have not been enough to offset losses in bigger markets like Atlanta, Dallas and Chicago, where fund-raising fell by 11.1 percent, 11.5 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively. Local campaigns typically start and end in the fall, although it varies by chapter. 
At the national organization in Alexandria, Va., which is supported by dues from the local organizations, the 200 staff members have been told to expect 25 to 40 job cuts on Wednesday. A spokeswoman said the layoffs were unrelated to lower fund-raising. 
"More positive results come in early, more negative results later, and those are the ones we're starting to get now," Mr. Gallagher said. "It's an incredibly mixed bag of results this year."
Charities have anticipated steep declines since stock markets fell sharply in early 2000, but in most places giving only began to wane late last year.
"This isn't a sharp recession over an eight-month period that then produces a sharp turnaround," Mr. Gallagher said. "This is a slow burn, and no one seems to be sure when it's going to end."
The United Way has proved remarkably resilient to economic downturns. Since 1971, donations to the system's annual workplace campaign have declined only once, in 1992 when the president of the United Way of America, William Aramony, was indicted on charges of embezzlement and fraud.
Last year, the organization was hit by a scandal at the United Way in Washington, D.C., which exposed problems with accounting and other practices that were subsequently found in some other United Ways. That scandal cost the United Way system an estimated $30 million.
New accounting standards adopted this year spell out how local United Ways are to account for the money they handle, and a few experts say some of the fund-raising decline could be due to those changes.
"The kind of problems we had in Washington are probably affecting other cities around the country at least to some degree," said Anthony De Cristofaro, a former United Way marketing executive. "The new accounting standards have certainly raised the awareness of those issues."
Mr. Gallagher agreed but said that the impact of the standards on fund-raising would probably be minimal.
"There is no question local United Ways are reading the standards and checking their reporting against them, because we're getting calls from them asking for interpretation," he said. "But I don't think the numbers involved will be significant."
In Daytona Beach, Fla., however, ending the practice of counting the value of in-kind contributions in campaign totals -- a practice that the United Way of America last year vigorously denied existed -- eliminated roughly $400,000 from the campaign results, which fell 18.8 percent to $3.4 million, said Thomas M. McClelland, the former chairman of the United Way of Volusia-Flagler Counties.
A steep fall in tourism, with local merchants and residents having less money to donate, also contributed to the decline, Mr. McClelland said.
"Spring break was down by something like 15 percent," he said. "A college reunion that brought in 150,000 visitors last year brought in 110,00 this year. And for the first time in recent memory, some of our events, like the Daytona 500, have not been sellouts."
Last year, the Volusia-Flagler United Way used about 80 percent of its $500,000 in reserves to cover shortfalls in fund-raising, but this year it will have to cut its support to charities, Mr. McClelland said.
Gary G. Godsey, president of the United Way of Dallas, said he had been assured by local businessmen that last year's scandals had nothing to do with the 11.5 percent decline, to $45.6 million, in his organization's annual fund-raising.
"This is purely economic," Mr. Godsey said, "and in Dallas, we've been particularly hard hit. Our unemployment rate has skyrocketed to the highest of any Texas metropolitan area."
Mr. Godsey said that corporate giving, which often helps United Ways cover administrative costs, had fallen by more than 10 percent. Two large corporations that he would not name cut their gifts by more than $500,000 each.
But the news is not all bleak. In Tennessee, the United Way of Sevier County started a program called the Alexis de Tocqueville Society to recognize donors who give $10,000 or more, and fund-raising jumped 53.7 percent to $674,321 this period, the biggest increase reported by a local organization as of March 27.

PERSON: Leon Levy 

HEADLINE: Leon Levy, Philanthropist, Is Dead at 77 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Leon Levy, a hedge fund pioneer who began investing at 13 with $200 and went on to make many millions, enough to make him one of the main individual backers of archaeological research, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77.
 The cause was a heart attack, Shelby White, his wife, said. 
 Mr. Levy, who joined what was then the small brokerage firm of Oppenheimer & Company in 1951, when he was 25, and founded Odyssey Partners with Jack Nash in 1982, gave gifts ranging from $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for a new wing, to more than $100 million to Bard College. 
The support he and his wife gave to archaeology resulted most famously in the 1990 dig in Israel that found a golden calf of the kind described in the Bible as being worshiped as an idol. 
Mr. Levy had a knack for leading trends in finance. Oppenheimer & Company was among the first to offer general investors the chance to invest in hedge funds, which are mainly used by sophisticated investors seeking to control their risks and maximize their returns.
He was a pioneer at recognizing how to make money on companies' depressed assets, first in the 1970's wave of leveraged buyouts, then by investing in bankrupt companies. His most famous deal was buying the shares of the parent company of the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad for almost nothing in 1983 and eventually selling them for $150 each after the sale of valuable assets.
Odyssey Partners earned an average annual return for its investors of 22 percent over 14 years. Investing as an individual for the last two years, Mr. Levy warned people of the fragility of the stock market and moved away from it himself. He put some of his money into a complicated investment instrument involving Eurodollars and multiplied his investment by 16, said Eugene Linden, with whom he wrote his autobiography, "The Mind of Wall Street" (Public Affairs, 2002).
Mr. Levy firmly believed that investing is as much a psychological as an economic act and argued forcefully that the stock market surge in the 1990's did not reflect a new economic reality but only people's hopes. He warned in 1999 that the roaring market was likely to go down.
Much of his approach was simple common sense. For instance, in his book he said stock traders forget that whoever is on the other side of a transaction has an opposite theory of future price movements.
"There is a genius on one side of every trade and a dolt on the other, but which is which does not become clear until much later," he wrote.
Mr. Levy was born on Sept. 13, 1925, in Manhattan. His father, Jerome, a dry goods merchant, amateur economist and successful investor, predicted the stock market crash of 1929 and sold much of his stock before it happened. He taught his son many financial lessons, particularly the importance of corporate profits in charting overall economic directions.
The younger Mr. Levy graduated from Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan in 1939 and from the City College of New York in 1948. He majored in psychology. His grades prevented him from being admitted to an advanced course on security analysis.
From 1945 to 1947, he served in the Army in Germany. 
In addition to his wife and a brother, Jay, who lives in Somers, N.Y., Mr. Levy is survived by his daughter, Tracy White of Manhattan.
In 1948 Mr. Levy took a job as a stock analyst with Hirsch & Company, a small firm. When Max Oppenheimer left to set up his own firm, Mr. Levy went with him as chief research analyst. The firm now manages more than $120 billion. By 1957, Mr. Levy and Jack Nash had become managing partners. In 1982, they sold Oppenheimer and formed Odyssey Partners, which was a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997 in favor of smaller, less unwieldy operations.
Mr. Levy developed and perhaps embellished a reputation as a forgetful sort, once abandoning his wife at a party.
"How does a guy who can't find his pipe when smoke is coming out of his pocket manage to do so well?" he wrote. His modesty, which his friends said was absolutely genuine, was exemplified by his and Mr. Nash's decision not to put their names on their office door.
His wife said his forgetfulness seemed to have limits: he could remember the exact price he paid for a bond in 1953, for example.
And he was eager to learn new things. He wrote that his love of archaeology had a similarity to his fascination with new ways to invest. He called it "the delicious thrill of finding something that confounds the conventional wisdom."
Mr. Levy gave more than $140 million to nonprofit institutions, Business Week reported last year. Recipients included the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton and Rockefeller University. One gift went to Harvard to pay for printing reports on archaeological digs, something for which it is hard to get money. 
Usually, he preferred to give with no strings attached. But when Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, offered to name the museum's new wing dedicated to Greek and Roman antiquities for him and his wife "in perpetuity," Mr. Levy wondered how long that was.
"For you, 50 years," Mr. de Montebello answered.
Mr. Levy asked for 75. He thought his daughter's feelings might be hurt if the name were changed during her lifetime. Mr. de Montebello agreed, and the museum got its wing.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: CAIRO; 
Egyptian Intellectual Speaks Of the Arab World's Despair

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 6 

 BODY:
Early in the morning, while most of Cairo is asleep, Ahmed Kamal Aboulmagd watches the war on television and despairs over the path taken by the United States. Even in the gloom of 4 a.m., this is not a normal emotion for Mr. Aboulmagd, a sprightly man of 72 who has lived through more than his share of revolutions, wars and international crises, yet has maintained a marvelously sunny outlook.
 "We should never lose hope," he remarked the other day from his 18th-floor law office overlooking the Nile, a room crammed with books and brightened with paintings of sailboats on calm waters. "Frustration is not an option." 
 But in truth, Mr. Aboulmagd admitted, he is just whistling in the dark. Never have America's Arab friends, he said, felt so estranged from the United States. 
"People in Egypt and many parts of the Arab world used to love America, and now they have a sense of being betrayed, misunderstood, taken lightly," he said. "And when it comes to the central problem of the Middle East -- the Arab-Israeli conflict -- we feel that even a minimum of American even-handedness is missing."
Mr. Aboulmagd is one of Egypt's best-known intellectuals, a senior aide to former President Anwar el Sadat, consultant to the United Nations and ever-curious polymath whose interests range across the fields of Islamic jurisprudence, comparative religions, literature, history and commercial law. 
Like many educated Egyptians of his generation, he is a man whose views on democracy and political values were shaped by reading the United States Constitution, the Federalist papers and the writings of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson. 
For him the United States was a "dream," a paragon of liberal values to be emulated by Arabs and Muslims seeking to have a voice in the modern world. 
One of his daughters lived in the United States. Mr. Aboulmagd studied there, earning a master's degree in comparative law at the University of Michigan in 1959. He served as president of the administrative tribunal of the World Bank in Washington. And he has spent more than 20 years of his life working on projects aimed at promoting dialogue between the Western, non-Muslim civilization and the Arab-Muslim world. 
Yet these days, in his opinion, something has gone terribly wrong. 
"Under the present situation, I cannot think of defending the United States," said Mr. Aboulmagd, a small man with thinning white hair who juggles a constant stream of phone calls and invitations to speak about modernizing the Arab world.
"I would not be listened to," he added. "To most people in this area, the United States is the source of evil on planet earth. And whether we like it or not, it is the Bush administration that is to blame."
When speaking of President Bush and his administration, Mr. Aboulmagd uses words like narrow-minded, pathological, obstinate and simplistic. The war on Iraq, he said bluntly, is the act of a "weak person who wants to show toughness" and, quite frankly, seems "deranged."
Such language from a man of Mr. Aboulmagd's stature is a warning sign of the deep distress that has seized the Arab elite, those who preach moderation in the face of rising Islamic radicalism and embrace liberalism over the tired slogans of Arab nationalism. 
Similar opinions can also be heard these days from wealthy Arab businessmen, university professors, senior government officials and Western-leaning political analysts -- the people whose support could help advance the Bush administration's professed mission: to bring democracy to the Arab world.
Mr. Aboulmagd has a hand in just about every institution or board that counts in Egypt, including al Azhar, the authoritative institution of Sunni Muslim learning. He is consulted on inter-cultural dialogue by the United Nations, the Arab League and the European Union. He has taught law in universities in Egypt, Sudan and Kuwait.
He is the epitome of the Arab establishment. Sprinkled throughout his conversation are anecdotes about President Sadat and recollections of discussions with luminaries like the United Nations general secretary, Kofi Annan. He receives phone calls from Arab presidents and kings. His office is filled with mementos from trips around the world as a lecturer and consultant. An oversize Koran in a green leather case rests on a coffee table along with a rendition of the scales of justice in brass and alabaster. 
He has devoted decades of his life and his writings to the cause of modernizing Islamic life and promoting understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims. 
Now those efforts, Mr. Aboulmagd said, have been set back by President Bush's "exaggerated" response to the terror attacks of Sept. 11, a response he believes only encouraged mutual enmity and suspicion by painting Muslims and Arabs as potential enemies to be reformed or destroyed.
"I find what is happening to be a serious setback in the endeavors of noble people who have realized the commonalities among different civilizations and nations," he said. 
The problem, he said, is that the war on Iraq is widely seen in the Arab world as an attack on all Arabs, meant to serve the interests of Israel with no compensating outreach to aggrieved Arabs.
While the 1991 Persian Gulf war, under Mr. Bush's father, was waged with the understanding that the United States would engage itself in the search for peace, he said, this war was launched without a parallel American effort to compel Israel to forge a genuine peace with the Palestinians.
"The United States has played a destructive role by giving direct or indirect green lights to the Israeli government to do what it pleases," Mr. Aboulmagd said. "This is ruining Israel's future in the area. And whatever, even if all the Arabs sign up, this is a truce, this is a ceasefire, this is not peace. It is not peace. If you want peace you must have genuine desire for peace."
If the Iraq war comes to be seen as an American war against Islam, he added, President Bush may be partly to blame. "He believes he was chosen by the Almighty to fulfill a Christian mission," Mr. Aboulmagd said. "Or at least he was made to believe that by the people around him."
Still, at the end of three hours of discussion, he returned to an optimistic viewpoint -- a position that clearly fits his nature.
"Many people are talking about planet earth being no more a safe place for anyone, but I am optimistic," he said. "I believe dialogue is needed now, so we should not give in to desperation, to loss of hope, to pessimism. Rather we should act actively and continue the path of dialogue and the path of understanding, simply because we cannot afford the other consequence."

LEVY-Leon. On April 6, 2003 at age 77. Beloved husband of Shelby White. Father of Tracy Ann White. Brother of S. Jay Levy of Somers, NY. Services at Park Avenue Synagogue, 50 E. 87th Street at Madison Avenue, Wednesday, April 9th, 9:30AM. Contributions may be made to The Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey. 
LEVY-Leon. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Leon Levy, a dedicated and longtime friend and benefactor whose knowledge of, and respect for, ancient cultures has educated, inspired, and benefited this institution, its staff, and the public. With his wife, our Trustee Shelby White, he was a noted collector of art, with a special interest in classical antiquities, and he gave generously to the Metropolitan Museum over the past 46 years in many areas, including acquisitions, objects conservation, and education. In 1990-91 their collection was the subject of the exhibition "Glories of the Past: Ancient Art from the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection," and in 1989 they helped fund a permanent position for a senior scholar in the Department of Greek and Roman Art. Most notably, in 1995-in celebration of Leon Levy's 70th birthday-he and his wife provided extraordinarily generous funding for creating the Museum's future Roman court and galleries, which will bear their names and will be a lasting monument to their philanthropic spirit and devotion to this museum. Leon Levy will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to Shelby and to the entire family. James R. Houghton Chairman Philippe de Montebello Director David E. McKinney President 
LEVY-Leon. The Rockefeller Uuniversity notes with profound sorrow the loss of our beloved friend Leon Levy, a dedicated member of The Rockefeller University Board of Trustees and longtime University benefactor.

He was a brilliant and legendary investor, an erudite scholar and astute collector of antiquities, an enlightened patron of archaeological expeditions, and a philanthropist of generosity and distinction. His generosity, in company with his wife, Shelby White, helped shape many of New York City's academic, medical, and cultural institutions, including this one, where he created the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind, Brain and Behavior to further scientific understanding in the neurosciences. We extend our deepest condolences to Shelby and the family. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Richard B. Fisher, Chairman of the Board Thomas P. Sakmar, Acting President Torsten N. Wiesel, President Emeritus and Director The Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind, Brain and Behavior The Rockefeller University

His involvement with the University, and in particular with its renowned Institute of Fine Arts of which he was a trustee, was invaluable. He was wise, supportive, and generous. He was widely known for his enormous talents as a businessman, but his interests were not confined to business. He was a serious writer, whose recent, "The Mind of Wall Street," was widely acclaimed. He was a connoisseur of art and beauty, and with his wife, Shelby, assembled one of the great private collections of Greek and Roman art and artifacts, developing a deep and impressive expertise in the subject. His absence will be keenly felt by his many friends and admirers at NYU, and our thoughts are with his wife, whom he deeply loved, and his family. John Sexton President, NYU Marty Lipton Chair, NYU Board of Trustees 
LEVY-Leon. The Institute for Advanced Study is profoundly grateful for the life of Leon Levy. Leon thought beyond the parameters of conventional wisdom and was in all respects a visionary.

HEADLINE: Justices Limit Punitive Damages in Victory for Tort Revision 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court set new constitutional limits on punitive damages today in a ruling that the business community hailed as a major victory in the long-running effort to shield corporate defendants from unconstrained jury awards.
 Punitive damages are not new to the court, which has wrestled with the issue for 20 years and has become increasingly sympathetic to defendants. But this decision in favor of the State Farm insurance company went beyond recent rulings in ways that could have a widespread effect. 
 The most significant departure in the 6-to-3 decision was the court's declaration that juries should generally not be permitted to consider a defendant's wealth when setting a punitive damage award. The practice is common, and the court had not previously addressed it in a majority opinion. "The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said for the majority today. 
The court overturned $145 million in punitive damages that a Utah jury awarded against State Farm and that the Utah Supreme Court upheld. The jury had awarded $1 million in compensatory damages to a Utah couple, State Farm policyholders, who sued the company for its refusal to settle a claim and for exposing them to personal liability beyond the limits of their policy for a car accident in which a jury found the husband liable. State Farm eventually paid the claim.
Justice Kennedy said the ratio of 145 to 1 resulted in a damage award that was "neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed." He called it "an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant."
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg objected that the court had arrogated to itself a task best left to state courts and state legislatures. She called the court "boldly out of order."
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas also dissented in separate opinions, citing their views expressed in earlier cases that the Constitution's due process guarantee simply does not apply in the context of punitive damages. All three dissenters today had also dissented in the court's last major punitive damages ruling, a 1996 decision that overturned a $2 million punitive damage award against the BMW automobile company, won by an Alabama man who was not informed that the paint had been touched up on his new car.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the dissenters in the 1996 case, BMW of North America v. Gore. Today, he changed sides, without explanation, signing Justice Kennedy's majority opinion along with Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer.
State Farm's appeal presented a wide array of issues, and the argument in the case last December appeared confusing and inconclusive. But there was nothing inconclusive about the court's decision, State Farm v. Campbell, No. 01-1289. "This case is neither close nor difficult," Justice Kennedy said.
While State Farm's treatment of its policyholders, Curtis and Inez Campbell, "merits no praise," and could even be considered "reprehensible," he said, the punitive damage award fails to meet any of the guidelines the court set in the 1996 case for evaluating such awards.
He said that rather than insisting that the punitive damage award bear a reasonable relationship to the harm done to the Campbells -- essentially, 18 months of uncertainty on their financial future -- the Utah Supreme Court had permitted the case to be "used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm's operations throughout the country."
That was impermissible for two reasons, Justice Kennedy said. First, states do not have "a legitimate concern" in imposing damages for conduct outside their borders or in reaching conclusions about what another state's court system might deem worthy of punishment. That was "a basic principle of federalism," he said.
And second, Justice Kennedy said, punitive damages must relate to the harm done to the individual plaintiff and not to other plaintiffs, real or hypothetical. "A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business," he said, adding that without that constraint, defendants could be punished multiple times for the same conduct.
The BMW decision had not set a particular ratio between punitive and compensatory damages that would be acceptable, but suggested that 4:1 would be a reasonable maximum in most cases. Today, the court moved closer to setting a firm line. "When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee," Justice Kennedy said.
This part of the opinion drew a sharp response from Justice Ginsburg. Such line drawing "could hardly be questioned" if done by a legislature or a state supreme court, she said, but was "boldly out of order" when done by the United States Supreme Court and imposed on the states. Her opinion included a discussion of State Farm's business practices that was more unflattering than the description of the case history contained in the majority opinion.
Finally, Justice Kennedy said, a punitive damage award should be related to the size of a civil penalty the state could impose for the same conduct. In this case, he said, State Farm could have been fined $10,000 under Utah law for its treatment of its policyholders.
The decision today was undoubtedly not the court's last word on punitive damages. Several times, Justice Kennedy noted the court was dealing with a case in which only economic, and not physical, harm had occurred, suggesting the court might make a more generous allowance for punitive damages in product liability cases involving injury or death.

 BODY:
 BIOGRAPHY
ROBERT A. CARO
"Master of the Senate"
Mr. Caro, a previous winner, won this time for the third volume of his life of Lyndon B. Johnson. Mr. Caro won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for "The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York."
 "Master of the Senate" covers the years from Johnson's election to national office in the 1940's to his rise to majority leader of the Senate. 

FINALISTS -- "The Fly Swatter" by Nicholas Dawidoff; "Beethoven: The Music and the Life" by Lewis Lockwood.

FICTION
JEFFREY EUGENIDES
"Middlesex"
In this epic novel of ideas about three generations of a Greek-American family, a girl discovers at 14 that she is a boy, or, rather, a hermaphrodite. In naming it one of the seven best books of 2002, the editors of The New York Times Book Review said that it was "colossally curious, shaggy and exuberant." This is his second novel; his first was "The Virgin Suicides."
Mr. Eugenides, who is 43, lives in Berlin.

FINALISTS -- "Servants of the Map" by Andrea Barrett; "You Are Not a Stranger Here" by Adam Haslett.

GENERAL NONFICTION
SAMANTHA POWER
" 'A Problem From Hell': America and the Age of Genocide"
An Irish-born freelancer who went to Bosnia a year out of Yale in 1993 to report on the war, Ms. Power was shocked by the massacres -- and more shattered by the failure of American authorities to stop them, even at a time of high interest in the Holocaust. She sought a book to explain the discrepancy, found none and decided to write one herself. Ms. Powers, 32, is the executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard.

FINALISTS -- "The Anthropology of Turquoise: Meditations on Landscape, Art, and Spirit," by Ellen Meloy; "The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature," by Steven Pinker.

POETRY
PAUL MULDOON
"Moy Sand and Gravel"
"One doesn't expect anything from poetry," Paul Muldoon, 51, a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, said when he heard he had won.
Mr. Muldoon's poetry is difficult and rigorous, but it also "shimmers with play," a reviewer wrote in The New York Times. In "At the Sign of the Black Horse, September 1999," he pays tribute to his countrymen who built a nearby canal, "those thousands of Irish navvies piling clay, hay, hair into their creels/ and bearing them at shoulder height, or above, with all the zeal/ of creel catechumens."

FINALISTS -- "Music Like Dirt," by Frank Bidart; "Hazmat," by J. D. McClatchy.

DRAMA
NILO CRUZ
"Anna in the Tropics"
Nilo Cruz, 42, who was born in Cuba and came to this country when he was 8 years old, became the first Latino-American to win the drama prize. His lyrical play,"Anna in the Tropics," is set in Ybor City, Fla., in 1929, when the local commerce is centered on a cigar factory and the traditional method of hand-rolling cigars is being threatened by modernization. Another tradition -- that of the "lector," who reads to the laborers as they work -- is also in danger; "Anna Karenina" may be the last classic the community will seize on together.

FINALISTS -- "The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?" by Edward Albee; "Take Me Out" by Richard Greenberg.

MUSIC
JOHN ADAMS
"On the Transmigration of Souls"
John Adams had less than a year to create the first commission of Lorin Maazel's tenure at the New York Philharmonic, a memorial to Sept. 11 for the opening of the new season. His response was a soundscape of layered sounds and textures, from tapes of screeching car brakes in the city's streets to a recitation of names of World Trade Center victims to fragments of text from missing-persons posters and cellphone messages, broken up between two choruses and intertwined with the orchestra.

FINALISTS -- "Three Tales," by Steve Reich; "Camp Songs," by Paul Schoenfield.

HISTORY
RICK ATKINSON
"An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942-1943"
In this meticulously researched, personality-driven account, Mr. Atkinson, 50, a former assistant managing editor of The Washington Post, maintains that the often-overlooked Allied campaigns in North Africa marked the beginning of the United States' emergence as a great military and political power.
Speaking by satellite telephone from central Iraq, where he is embedded with the 101st Airborne Division, he added: "It's completely dark here. I'm hot and I'm tired and I'm filthy and completely thrilled."

FINALISTS -- "At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America," by Philip Dray; "Rereading Sex: Battles Over Sexual Knowledge and Suppression in 19th-Century America," by Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz.

PUBLIC SERVICE
THE BOSTON GLOBE
The Boston Globe was honored for its yearlong series revealing that the Boston Archdiocese had covered up child sexual abuse by dozens of priests, which led to the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law.
"The Catholic Church is a pretty impenetrable institution, with neither the inclination nor a history of sharing any of its internal workings," said Walter V. Robertson, the editor of The Globe's investigative team.
"It's not for us to hope -- we are reporters -- but maybe this is a moment to make an exception. We believe and we hope that because of what has come to light, some number of children will not be abused."

FINALISTS -- Norman Sinclair, Ronald Hansen and Melvin Claxton of The Detroit News, for articles on Michigan's criminal justice system; The Pensacola News Journal, for articles on corruption in Escambia County, Fla.

INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
KEVIN SULLIVAN and MARY JORDAN
The Washington Post
Mr. Sullivan, 43, and Ms. Jordan, 42, co-chiefs of the Mexico City bureau and a husband-and-wife team, wrote a series of articles exposing the horrible conditions in Mexico's criminal justice system and their effect on people's daily lives.
"To us it was the most important issue facing Mexico," Mr. Sullivan said. "For Mexico to move forward it needs to address the questions we tried to raise in the series: the lack of the rule of law and the unequal justice."
He added, "The best thing for us is that we did it as husband and wife."

FINALISTS -- Alix M. Freedman and Steve Stecklow, The Wall Street Journal, for revealing little-known ways that Saddam Hussein profited from United Nations sanctions; R. C. Longworth, The Chicago Tribune, for a series on emerging tensions between the United States and Europe.

INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
CLIFFORD J. LEVY
The New York Times
Mr. Levy, a reporter for the Metro section of The Times, uncovered widespread neglect and abuse of thousands of mentally ill adults living in adult homes regulated by New York State, including the deaths of many residents.
His three-part series, "Broken Homes," found that the most troubled adult homes in New York City had become little more than psychiatric flophouses where untrained workers looked after severely ill people and medical fraud was common.
After the articles were published, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed spending at least $80 million on new housing and other initiatives. 
Mr. Levy, 35, joined the Times in 1990 as a news assistant and has been a reporter on the metropolitan desk since 1992. He was Albany bureau chief in 1999 and 2000.

BEAT REPORTING
DIANA K. SUGG
The Baltimore Sun
Ms. Sugg was honored for bringing to her beat the perception that health care is, above all, about people.
Her stories described ordinary people as they passed through some of health care's extraordinary events: parents at the bedside of a dying child, brothers offering themselves as test subjects for a sickle-cell anemia treatment, a bereaved scientist's reaction to her own baby's stillbirth. Ms. Sugg addressed medicine's scientific and economic issues in the poignant stories of patients, families and health workers.
"These were stories about the border between life and death," Ms. Sugg said. "Painful things that weren't necessarily a news story."

FINALISTS -- Cameron W. Barr of The Christian Science Monitor for coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; David Cay Johnston of The New York Times for reports on how individuals and corporations turn the tax code to their own advantage.

BREAKING NEWS
THE EAGLE-TRIBUNE
This Lawrence, Mass., daily was honored for its "detailed, well-crafted stories" on the efforts by six boys to save a companion who fell into the icy Merrimack River. Three of the rescuers and the initial victim drowned.
As the disaster unfolded on Dec. 15, the paper's staff was heading to a Christmas party at the home of Gretchen M. Putnam, the metro editor. "I threw up a sign on my front door saying 'Party canceled. Go to work,' " she said, "and 12 people showed up to work immediately."

FINALISTS -- Staff of The Baltimore Sun, for its coverage of the Washington sniper killings; Staff of The Seattle Times for its coverage of the local connections to the two people ultimately arrested in the sniper attacks.

EXPLANATORY REPORTING
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
The Journal was honored for a package of 10 articles by 17 reporters on corporate scandals. The Pulitzer judges, who shifted The Journal's entry from the public service category, said the reports "illuminated the roots, significance and impact of corporate scandals in America."
The Journal's reporting included coverage of misconduct at individual companies and a five-part series called "What's Wrong" that took a broader look at the scandals.

FINALISTS -- The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, on how social and economic distress rises as a variant of mad-cow disease spreads in Wisconsin's deer population; Jim Haner, John B. O'Donnell, and Kimberly A. C. Wilson, The Baltimore Sun, about how police blunders undermine homicide prosecutions.

NATIONAL REPORTING
ALAN C. MILLER and KEVIN SACK
The Los Angeles Times
Mr. Miller and Mr. Sack were honored for "The Vertical Vision," a four-part series that documented the troubled history of the Harrier, a military aircraft nicknamed "the Widow Maker" for its role in the noncombatant deaths of 45 Marine pilots. The articles led to a Congressional investigation into the Harrier fleet, a third of which has been lost to accidents since the 1970's.

FINALISTS -- The Chicago Tribune staff for its exploration of the fall of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm; Anne Hull of The Washington Post for her account of young immigrants coming of age in the American South; the staff of The New York Times for its articles that exposed and explained corruption in corporate America.

FEATURE WRITING
SONIA L. NAZARIO
The Los Angeles Times
Ms. Nazario, 42, in what the judges called a "touching, exhaustively reported" account, retraced the arduous journey of a teenage boy, identified only as Enrique, from Honduras to North Carolina in search of his mother. Ms. Nazario said she hoped her 30,000-word series captured the wrenching separation Latin American families experience when women immigrate to the United States.
"These separations are really devastating a lot of Latino families," Ms. Nazario said yesterday.

FINALISTS -- Connie Schultz of The Plain Dealer, in Cleveland, for an article about a wrongfully convicted man; David Stabler of The Oregonian, in Portland, for chronicling the life of a 16-year-old cellist.

CRITICISM
STEPHEN HUNTER
The Washington Post
Stephen Hunter, the first film critic to win in this category since Roger Ebert in 1975, was recognized for "authoritative film criticism that is both intellectually rewarding and a pleasure to read." Mr. Hunter, 57, said he hoped his award would bolster the Pulitzer committee's attention to popular culture writing.
"There are many, many fine film critics in this country," he said. "Right now, film criticism is better than film."

FINALISTS -- John King, The San Francisco Chronicle, for criticism of architecture and urban design; Nicolai Ouroussoff, The Los Angeles Times, criticism of architectural development and preservation.

COMMENTARY
COLBERT I. KING
The Washington Post
After a career that varied from the Army to the State Department, from the World Bank to private business, Mr. King, who is known as Colby, joined The Washington Post's editorial board in 1990.
The Pulitzer board cited his "against-the-grain columns that speak to people in power with ferocity and wisdom." Mr. King, 63, described his work in this way: "I try to be a megaphone for people in this city who have weak voices." 

FINALISTS -- Edward Achorn, The Providence Journal, for columns on government corruption in Rhode Island; Mark Holmberg, The Richmond Times-Dispatch, in Virginia, for columns on various topics.

EDITORIAL WRITING
CORNELIA GRUMMAN

In early 2000, a few months after Gov. George Ryan declared a moratorium on capital punishment in Illinois, Ms. Grumman, a reporter covering state government, moved to The Tribune's editorial board, where she quickly made the death penalty her signature issue. Ms. Grumman, 39, was cited yesterday for "her powerful, freshly challenging editorials against the death penalty." Last week, the Illinois legislature adopted a broad package of death-penalty reforms.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE PRESIDENT; 
BUSH MEETS BLAIR

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, April 7 

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair turned their attention today to planning for a postwar Iraq, seeking to bridge their differences over how much of a role to give the United Nations in rebuilding the country and putting together a new government.
 Mr. Bush flew here tonight for a 20-hour visit with Mr. Blair, his closest ally in confronting Saddam Hussein, to discuss questions made increasingly urgent by the rapid military progress American and British forces have made. 
 Mr. Blair has been under pressure at home and from much of Europe to support giving the United Nations a strong role in stabilizing Iraq. But the White House has consistently signaled that it wants the United States and Britain to play the lead role in creating a new Iraqi government. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told reporters traveling with the president that the United States was sending officials to the region this week to begin assembling a group of Iraqis who would constitute an interim governing authority, which would be put in place alongside the American-led military and civilian authorities.
In a sign of the speed with which the maneuvering for power in post-Hussein Iraq is unfolding, Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the main Iraqi exile opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress, was reported to be heading to Baghdad from southern Iraq.
"The hostilities phase is coming to a conclusion," Mr. Powell said. "It's time for all of us to think about the post-hostilities phase, how we create a representative government consisting of all elements of Iraqi society."
Mr. Powell and British officials played down the magnitude of the differences between the United States and Britain over the United Nations role.
The United Nations, Mr. Powell said, would have "an endorsing role to play to the interim authority to give it legitimacy," a formulation that appeared to reserve for the United States and Britain the right to select the leaders of the temporary postwar administration. 
A spokesman for Mr. Blair used similar language, referring to the United Nations' being involved "in a way that endorses that new Iraqi authority" as a step toward establishing a full-fledged Iraqi government.
Initially, primary responsibility for administering Iraq would rest with a team led by a retired United States Army general, Jay Garner, and the interim Iraqi authority would be likely to begin assuming power after that, perhaps 90 days later, the British spokesman said.
Clearly wary of getting into another diplomatic squabble with other members of the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Powell and other administration officials have emphasized in recent days that the United States and Britain, having waged the war and paid for it with blood and money, will not be drawn into a negotiation with countries like France and Germany over the immediate postwar period.
But Mr. Powell emphasized today that part of his focus now would be on "healing" diplomatic wounds and granting the United Nations an important role once Iraq is stabilized.
Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, arrived here tonight from Moscow, where she met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who had broken with Mr. Bush over the war but whose country has longstanding economic interests in Iraq, including oil.
At the United Nations, Secretary General Kofi Annan said he would travel to Britain, France, Germany and Russia this week to test whether the Security Council might be able to agree on a postwar plan.
Mr. Annan announced today that he had been working on post-conflict issues with a special adviser, Rafeeuddin Ahmed. Mr. Annan said he expected the United Nations to play an important role, whether as a political facilitator or dealing with issues like reconstruction or human rights. 
"Above all, the U.N. involvement does bring legitimacy, which is necessary, necessary for the country, for the region and for the peoples around the world," Mr. Annan said.
Mr. Bush's trip to see Mr. Blair here was the third British-American summit meeting in as many weeks. It coincided with news that American forces were attacking the presidential palaces and other symbols of the Iraqi government in the heart of Baghdad and that British soldiers had taken control of Iraq's second-largest city, Basra.
The two leaders met at Hillsborough, a castle south of Belfast, and began their sessions with a half-hour walk through the gardens early this evening before dinner. On Tuesday, they will hold a news conference and further talks, including a session on the Northern Ireland peace effort.
The presence of the two leaders drew crowds of antiwar protesters and set off a local debate about whether this city, which has been trying to put behind it a history of sectarian violence, was an appropriate location for a war council.
The city authorities in Belfast had to divert traffic and clear public buildings in various locations this morning after a series of bomb scares. The scenes were reminiscent of the conflicted time before the Northern Ireland peace agreement in 1998 put an end to organized sectarian violence that cost the lives of more than 3,600 people over three decades.
In the conversations about Iraq, Mr. Blair is playing his customary role of trying to bridge trans-Atlantic differences. He hopes to placate criticism at home and ease relations with his European neighbors by pushing for a United Nations resolution authorizing an interim governing authority.
He had earlier envisaged a more prominent role for the United Nations, but he emerged from his last meeting with Mr. Bush, at Camp David on March 27, emphasizing the need for the United Nations to endorse the transition plans rather than play a central part in the plans, as he had advocated at the first summit meeting, in the Azores on March 16.
Europeans have expressed alarm at what they see as the marginalization of the United Nations. At the same time, European critics of the war, like France, Germany and Russia, may object to Mr. Blair's compromise proposal on grounds that it legitimizes a war they oppose.
Even in Britain, the one European country where the war has majority support, there is great resistance to American domination of the postwar running of Iraq. An opinion poll in today's Daily Telegraph showed that while Britons' enthusiasm for the war had grown to a high of 60 percent and their approval of Mr. Blair's conduct had also risen, there was only 2 percent approval of an American-controlled administration of Iraq.
Mr. Powell said the United States was only trying to lay out a plan under which military control of Iraq could give way to a mix of civilian and military control, including substantial involvement by Iraqis, and then to a full-fledged government.
He said United Nations involvement might be necessary to convince banks and financial markets that they could safely and legally lend money to Iraq. Asked about peacekeeping duties, he said NATO was open to the possibility of helping to provide postwar security or assisting in the search for weapons of mass destruction.
Planning for the peace has exposed differences not only between the United States and Britain, but also within the Bush administration and between the administration and Congress.
Mr. Blair chose to hold his meeting with Mr. Bush in Northern Ireland in part so that the president could lend his support to the long-running efforts by Britain and Ireland to find a peaceful solution to the strife between Catholics and Protestants in the province.
The White House, however, seemed not to be paying much attention to Northern Ireland diplomacy. The schedules and credentials it distributed to reporters here listed the site as "Belfast, Ireland."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
Beaujolais, Shedding the New for the Old

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: ROMANECHE-THORINS, France 

 BODY:
BEAUJOLAIS has been going through a quiet revolution. For years it was a high-profile fun wine with ever-more outlandish stunts to introduce the arrival of the "nouveau" every November. The annual race to bring the new wine to market enlisted marathon runners, automobile racers, horse-drawn carriages, even parachutists, to see who could have the first bottles of the new wine. Parties were held everywhere -- Paris, New York, Sydney -- to welcome the new wine. 
 In recent years, much of the carefully orchestrated hoopla has been toned down or shelved and last November, in many places, the 2002 Beaujolais nouveau arrived almost unnoticed. 
 New York retailers generally conceded that Beaujolais was nowhere near as popular as it had been a decade ago. And too, there were rumors about oceans of the stuff being unsold and dumped, along with a widespread sense of gloom here in the Beaujolais region. And all this well before the current diplomatic divide between the United States and France. 
So I took a train down here from Paris to talk to Georges Duboeuf, who knows about these things. Mr. Duboeuf is called the King of Beaujolais, probably because he sells 30 million bottles of the wine each year. 
As if to forestall any questions I might have about the local economy, or his share of it, anyway, he took me first -- after a solid Beaujolais lunch of course -- to a new, multimillion-dollar Duboeuf winery going up across the road from the company headquarters. With its Gallolike rows of gleaming wood and steel fermenters, it almost smelled of prosperity. From a visitors' deck on the roof, the timeless beauty of the Beaujolais region spread out before us -- there, Moulin-a-Vent, and just behind it, Chenas and Julienas, and to the west, Fleurie and Chiroubles. The vines were still wintry brown but splotches of yellow, the first spring flowers, were everywhere. Off to the east, the haze softened and almost obscured the majestic Alps. 
Harsh economic questions fade into insignificance in such a setting -- and, indeed, everywhere is the unmistakable look and feel of well-being. 
Prosperous, yes, but not as prosperous as other wine regions. Beaujolais represents about 2.15 percent of all French wine production and about 5.37 percent of A.O.C. -- appellation d'origine controlee -- production. A.O.C. wines are France's best; they come from specified areas and are made in controlled quantities from specified grapes. In the early 1980's, however, Beaujolais represented almost 9 percent of A.O.C. production. Since then, Beaujolais production has increased about 20 percent while in Alsace and Bordeaux it has doubled and in Champagne it has increased 114 percent.
It's not difficult to see what has happened. While much of what is written is about wine deals with the minuscule luxury market, most wine drinkers are looking for good wines for everyday drinking and the competition at that level is fierce. Australia and Italy have moved into the market to the point where, around the world, they virtually dominate it. 
Beaujolais, a name once synonymous with value, still makes plenty of wine but has given up some of its share of the market. To many, the culprit was, or is, Beaujolais nouveau. In its time, it was one of the best marketing tools ever. By selling up to half of their annual production in November, two months after the harvest, the Beaujolais producers beat their competition around the world by six months. And they paid all their bills by Christmas. 
What's more, they created a carnival-like atmosphere for the arrival of the nouveau that had people clamoring to buy it. 
But like all marketing gimmicks, the boisterous annual arrival of the nouveau wore thin. Consumers soon learned that the "race" was contrived and the importers ran out events to promote it. 
Moreover, the nouveau arrival created confusion. Each year, its arrival is followed in February or March by another, the arrival of the "real" Beaujolais, the wine that has evolved in the traditional fashion, spending the winter maturing in the vintners' cellars. Beyond that, the number of Beaujolais wines can be confusing. There are Beaujolais and the marginally better Beaujolais-Villages on top of the nouveau, plus the wine of 10 towns in the Beaujolais region that are allowed to use their own names on their best bottles. 
In addition to Moulin-a-Vent, Chenas, Julienas, Fleurie and Chiroubles, they are Brouilly, Cotes de Brouilly, Morgon, St.-Amour and Regnie. 
To muddy the waters further, most of those appellations are further divided into sectors that make their own claims to quality. For example, the Cote de Py is said by some to be the best part of Morgon. Fleurie has 13 of those subdivisions, including La Madone and Grille-Midi. 
Confusing? You might say. Experts can expound at length on the qualities of the individual sites and the wines made from them, but the differences can be elusive to casual wine drinkers, most of whom prefer wines that go by their varietal, or grape names, like merlot and cabernet. 
For varietal fans, Beaujolais is made exclusively from gamay, which the wine writer Andrew Jefford has accurately described as "a thin-skinned, prolific, early-ripening grape of fundamental inconsequentiality." 
Beaujolais makers today are downplaying the nouveau phenomenon and emphasizing quality. "Old vines" is seen more often on bottles and some producers like Mr. Duboeuf are creating new lines. His new Prestige Cuvee, with its elegant labels -- like the labels of the Beaujolais from Louis Jadot's Chateau des Jacques -- are an attempt to play down the rustic image of Beaujolais and to create a new market. 
I like Beaujolais; I hope they succeed.
By the way, the 2002's now in the shops are mostly excellent. The 2000 Beaujolais were good, as well. The 2001's not so good.

HEADLINE: Japan Tries A New Tack On Economy: Buying Debt 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 8 

 BODY:
Its arsenal of traditional tools rendered largely ineffective, the Bank of Japan said today that it would consider taking the unconventional step of buying corporate debt to make it easier for small companies to borrow, and in the process battle deflation.
 The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by the central bank's new governor, Toshihiko Fukui, responding to pressure from the government to do more to shore up Japan's frail economy. In the month since he took up the bank's top post, Mr. Fukui has demonstrated that he is much more willing than his predecessor, Masaru Hayami, to work with lawmakers and to tinker with the central bank's policies. 
 The bank concluded a two-day policy board meeting today, the first of Mr. Fukui's tenure, without taking other steps on monetary policy. The bank already sets short-term interest rates effectively at zero and has been pumping extra liquidity into Japan's money markets in various ways for many months, so there is little left in the standard central-bank playbook for it to try.
Still, the announcement today focused new attention on the plight of small companies in Japan, which have been particularly hard hit by the five-year decline in consumer prices and which tend to be the first customers cut off by banks that are retrenching to clean up their own balance sheets. 
Small business is a crucial constituency for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, and lawmakers have often gone to great lengths to help the sector. The government has offered loan guarantees for small companies since 1998. It has also pushed the major commercial banks to step up their small-business lending, with little success.
The central bank said it would consider closing the gap by buying asset-backed securities issued by the banks, including some backed specifically by commercial paper from small companies. Buying these securities relieves the banks of some risk and frees up bank capital that can then be put to use making new loans.
Typically, securitized loans in Japan have been backed by tangible collateral assets like land and buildings. But property values have fallen in Japan for 12 consecutive years, and commercial banks are increasingly reluctant to lend against them.
So the central bank's review will include a type of security common in the United States but not often seen in Japan: one backed by bundles of loans and receivables.
Though the central bank already accepts asset-backed securities as collateral, the "outright purchase of private debt is an unprecedented measure for a central bank," the Bank of Japan said in a statement. The bank's staff is to work out details for the board to discuss at its next meeting in May. 
Wary of wrecking its own balance sheet by taking on risky assets, the central bank said that it would consider buying the asset-backed securities only as a temporary measure. Still, it would be a big step away from the conservatism of Mr. Hayami's tenure. 
The careful wording of the central bank's announcement is a sign of the political tightrope Mr. Fukui walks. As a longtime central banker, he wants to preserve the bank's independence and maintain continuity with past policies. But he must also face the glum realities of Japan's 12-year economic slide and appease the politicians, including Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who named him. 
"Today's move is a kind of Band-Aid," said Akio Makabe, an economist at the Mizuho Research Institute. "But Fukui is in a very difficult situation; he has to do something quickly." 
Several economists said that even if the bank decided to go ahead with the proposed debt purchases, that would only patch over a few of the sorest parts of the economy, not solve its broader problems. The most important question now, Mr. Makabe said, is whether the government will respond by announcing new measures to stimulate the economy, or use the bank's move as an excuse to do nothing. Recent history suggests that the latter is more likely.
In fact, leading ruling-party lawmakers are pressing Mr. Koizumi's administration to roll back some of the measures it hasalready taken to try to bring Japan's financial system up to global standards.

HEADLINE: Films Flee the Loop, but Chicago Fights Back 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 8 

 BODY:
If Hollywood were to make a movie about the film industry here, it would chronicle the making of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," set in Chicago's Greek neighborhoods, and "Chicago," the musical set in its namesake city. But it would be shot in Toronto.
 These two blockbusters were among 57 feature films with Chicago backdrops that have been shot in Canada since 1985, taking what Richard Moskal, director of the Chicago film office, estimates is $1.9 billion and 17,000 jobs from the local economy. 
 While it has been much publicized that the loss of the commercial film business to Canada and other countries, known as "runaway production," has hurt movie production in Los Angeles and New York, a recent study by the United States Commerce Department found that it had been devastating to the much-smaller film markets in Chicago and other cities between the coasts. 
"It's not just a Hollywood issue," Mr. Moskal said. "It's a small business issue, a lunch-bucket Joe issue. A lot of people less visible than Julia Roberts are trying to make a living." 
Several other cities and states, particularly in the country's midsection, also lost productions last year. A recent report by the Center for Entertainment Industry Data and Research in Los Angeles said Colorado, Iowa, Michigan Wisconsin trimmed the size of their film offices in 2002, as did Phoenix; their counterparts in Ohio, Massachusetts and the Washington State have all but shut down, viewed as nonessential programs, their budgets eliminated. 
In Illinois the runaway production trend has accelerated in recent years. The nation's third-largest film-production market throughout the 1990's, it now ranks fifth, behind not only Los Angeles and New York but also Texas and Florida.
Screen Magazine, a Chicago-based industry publication, reported that 70 percent of the companies listed in its 1999 industry directory were no longer in business when it printed its 2000 edition. 
Last year production spending in the city was the lowest since 1977, as 18 films with Chicago story lines were made in Canada, and last summer, usually the busiest season for production, only one major feature, "Uncle Nino," starring Joe Mantegna, was shot entirely in the metropolitan area. This low-budget film, scheduled for release this year, agreed to stay in large part because local trade unions took pay cuts of about 30 percent at the urging of the local film office.
Now the Illinois Production Alliance, an industry advocacy group formed in December, wants to make the state more like Canada. The new group includes representatives of companies, the state and city film offices and the industry's various arms, among them the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, the actors' union, Directors Guild of America and local chapters of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
"It's sort of like being an alcoholic," said Eileen Willenborg, executive director of the Chicago Screen Actors Guild. "You have to hit rock bottom before you begin your recovery program, and we have." 
One of the group's top priorities is to help save Chicago Studio City, the largest full-service production center east of Hollywood. Its three cavernous buildings, with a total of 151,000 square feet of stage and office space on the city's West Side, used to handle about 80 percent of the area's film and television studio production. After a year of sitting empty, it is up for sale. Ron DeRosa, vice president of the studio, said only 2 of the company's 11 employees -- he and his secretary -- remained on the job. 
Business began to sour for the studio in October 2001, when "What About Joan," the ABC situation comedy starring a Chicagoan, Joan Cusack, was canceled. The show was the first sitcom to be filmed outside Los Angeles or New York and employed a cast and crew of more than 100. Mr. DeRosa said his company spent $400,000 on new equipment for the show.
The new alliance is trying to persuade the state to purchase Chicago Studio City's property and offer it to producers free or at low prices to lure productions from Canada. Members are also lobbying state lawmakers for tax and wage incentives to reduce filming costs and spur new production. 
"There's always going to be a cheaper place for a movie to be made," Mr. Moskal said. "But you can't change anything by guilt-tripping or sticking your hand out and complaining that you need some help. You have to present yourself as a unified, distinguished and credible community to give government a good reason to help you out." 
Mr. Moskal said the new group was more organized, more united and better financed than previous industry lobbying coalitions. But with Illinois facing a $5 billion deficit this year, it also faces an uphill battle to convince state lawmakers to give the industry any of the financial breaks it needs to compete.
The alliance is presenting itself as a potent revenue raiser for the state. It points to films like "Road to Perdition," starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, that added almost $30 million to the state's economy during its 87 days of shooting in the Chicago area in early 2001. 
New York has not suffered as much from the runaway trend, at least it did not last year. Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the city's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, said the number of films made in New York increased to 180 from 174 in 2001. 
But film offices in St. Louis and Boston closed permanently last year, the Commerce Department report said, and plans to shut the offices in Kansas City and the state of Missouri were only scrapped because of campaigns by industry alliances. 
Roger Ebert, the Chicago-based film critic, gave his trademark "thumbs down" to the industry these days for preferring the bottom line to location integrity. 
Robert Teitel, a producer of last fall's surprise box-office hit "Barbershop," said that "if the movie's a Chicago movie, they should just shoot in Chicago, and that's your answer." Mr. Teitel and his creative partner, George Tillman Jr., both Chicago natives who now live in Los Angeles, filmed their comedy starring Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer entirely on Chicago's South Side despite MGM's attempts to have the movie shot in Canada. 
"I want to shoot everything in Chicago," Mr. Teitel said. "But it's always a fight for us to get back there. In Canada, 'You can't beat the dollar' is what it is." 
In 1997 Mr. Teitel and Mr. Tillman shot the film "Soul Food" on Chicago's North Side. But the Showtime cable network's television series based on their movie is filmed where else? In Toronto.

HEADLINE: Why Wine Costs What It Does 

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER 

 BODY:
LAST year, when Paul Hobbs, a California winemaker, was about to release his 1999 Beckstoffer cabernet sauvignon, lots of things were going through his mind. He had investments to pay off and a reputation to build on the wine, but he was also facing a market that had softened tremendously. It was up to Mr. Hobbs to determine a retail price that would let him pay off some debts and draw the attention of serious wine drinkers, yet be low enough that he could actually sell the wine, not just this year but for vintages to come.
 Mr. Hobbs thought long and hard and decided: $135. 
 Why does one bottle of fermented grape juice cost $135, and another just $15? Americans consumed 14.9 million cases of California cabernet in 2001, according to a study by Impact, a trade publication that tracks the wine industry, and customers in a wine store, faced with walls of bottles that range in price from the low end to the high, confront the question every time they shop. 
"It's definitely more art than science," said Mannie Berk, the owner of the Rare Wine Company, an importer in Sonoma, Calif. "It's finding the right point in the market where you're priced appropriately in relation to other wines that are similar in stature and style and level, where both merchants and consumers will be eager to buy the wine."
Price also plays into the perception of value, said Vic Motto, a senior partner at Motto Kryla Fisher, a wine industry consulting company in St. Helena, Calif. "If I made the best wine in the world and charged $1 for it," he said, "no one would believe it was the best. They'd say it's a great bottle of $1 wine."
But there is much more to the cost of a bottle than the wine inside. To begin with, the retail price on the shelf is generally twice what the winery sold the wine for. That means a $100 wine was $50 when it left the winery and had $50 tagged on by the distributor and the retailer. Mr. Hobbs's 1999 Beckstoffer left his winery at $67.50.
Wineries, of course, also like a profit. A $100 wine that cost $50 when it left its maker may have cost as little as $25 to produce. For wines in the $7 to $10 range, the margin is far less, because the makers make money on volume. Mr. Hobbs said his margin is around 40 percent on his most expensive wines, meaning that the Beckstoffer cost about $48 to produce. But coming up with a precise number is hard because overhead like electricity and staff costs are devoted to all the wines a winery produces.
Christian Miller, director of research at Motto Kryla, said: "Probably the most important ingredient in changing the price from $20 to $60 to $100 wine is scarcity. Almost all the high-priced wines around the world are produced in small amounts. It's the oldest economic rule of all. When you have a very small supply, with all things being equal, you can charge a high price." 
On Mr. Hobbs's Web site, www.paulhobbs.com, buyers may purchase a maximum of six bottles of the Beckstoffer, whose production came to about 800 cases in 1999. There are exceptions to Mr. Miller's scarcity rule -- Opus One and Silver Oak Cellars, for example, produce thousands of cases, not hundreds -- but they are few. 
Mr. Miller added: "The thing you're paying for as you move up would be prestige, scarcity and to some extent intensity of flavor."
For that, the winery must invest in high-quality grapes, French oak barrels, skilled winemakers, even fine packaging. "It's pretty much to send a consistent message," Mr. Hobbs said. That message? I look expensive; I am expensive; I am worth every penny.
First, the grapes. "The very best grapes grow in very few places," Mr. Motto explained. "You can grow very good $15-a-bottle grapes all over."
Mr. Hobbs's Beckstoffer cabernet sauvignon is a single vineyard wine from a vineyard with a prestigious history. It was once owned by Andre Tchelistcheff, the legendary oenologist, who produced some of the Napa Valley's first great cabernets, and some of its grapes were supposedly used in the esteemed Georges de Latour Private Reserve from Beaulieu Vineyard.
Grapes are no small item. According to Bob Holder, a wine industry accountant at G & J Seiberlich in St. Helena, they can vary from $1,000 a ton at the low end up to $10,000 a ton from the very best land. (Last year, cabernet sauvignon commanded an average of $4,021 a ton in the Napa Valley. Mr. Hobbs declined to say how much his grapes cost.) A ton of grapes yields about 700 bottles of wine, and so can add anywhere from roughly $1.40 to $14 to the production cost of a single bottle.
And if you want to buy your own land, get in line. Vineyard prices have soared over the years. In the 1980's, Far Niente, a respected winery in Napa, bought a property for $18,000 an acre. A vineyard it bought five years ago cost $100,000 an acre, which is now the average. A vineyard with a top pedigree could run to $300,000 an acre.
Expensive wines like Mr. Hobbs's also require more labor, both in the fields and in the winemaking. Grapes may be placed in small tubs after they are picked, so that none are crushed. The wine may be racked by hand and tasted daily. And by pruning heavily to concentrate the flavor in the best grapes, winemakers get lower yields.
Mr. Hobbs said he got just 3.2 tons of grapes per acre from Beckstoffer in 1999; a typical yield is more like 5 tons. High-end winemakers often use only the "free-run juice," or juice that bleeds from the grape with minimal pressure. The maker of a $15 wine is likely to press all the juice he can out of his grapes. And in that juice will be more tannins and more solids, which will result in a coarser wine.
Once a wine is made, it must be aged in oak barrels, which can cost from $300 for American oak to $750 for French. A wine to be sold for $15 might be aged in less expensive barrels, which are used for a few years. But a winery like Far Niente, whose cabernet sauvignon retails for $100, buys French oak barrels and replaces them every year. A barrel holds 280 or so bottles, so French oak can add more than $2 to every bottle. Last year, Far Niente briefly considered replacing only 70 percent of its new oak and using the other 30 percent twice, saving $400,000. The owners decided against it.
A $100 bottle of wine also tends to be aged longer in both the barrel and the bottle. "You have to sit on the money," Mr. Holder, of G & J Seiberlich, said. "With reds you might pay for and own several vintages before you start selling." Mr. Hobbs, for instance, has not released his 2000 Beckstoffer, which, for three years, has done nothing but cost him money.
Distinctive packaging helps sell a wine, too. A $100 wine will often be bottled in thicker, more expensive glass with a tall punt, or indentation at the bottom. Bottles can cost 50 cents to $2. A Beckstoffer bottle, which costs $1.25, is significantly heavier than a standard bottle, and the punt seems so high that it could cover an egg without breaking the shell.
"Entry-level corks," Mr. Holder said, "are probably a dime apiece, and an expensive one might be 50 cents, and a very expensive cork might be as much as 75 cents to $1." Mr. Hobbs's Beckstoffer corks, extra long and smooth, cost 75 cents.
Some winemakers also spend thousands, up to $100,000, on package and label designs, and then 20 to 30 cents to produce each one. Mr. Hobbs's labels cost about 25 cents, and he packs Beckstoffer in a wood boxthat holds just 6 bottles, as opposed to the standard 12. He pays $11 for the box. His alternative is a sturdy cardboard box, which holds 12 bottles and costs $5 to $7. (Standard flimsy boxes often come free with bottles.) 
Someone producing a $100 bottle of wine rarely benefits from economies of scale. A restaurant, for instance, might order just six bottles, while a discounter like Costco might take a whole truckload of $10 wines.
Once the wine has left the winery, a small winery can do little to make it succeed. According to Eileen Fredrikson, a partner at Gomberg, Fredrikson, a consulting company in Woodside, Calif., it must depend on its distributors to create a market for its brand. It can hope for a good rating by a critic, but that is not worth betting on. 
"Third-party endorsement is important for any consumer product," said Larry Maguire, the president of Far Niente and a partner in Nickel & Nickel, a new winery in Oakville, Calif. "Just ask a show that's closing on Broadway." 
But if you are lucky, Mr. Hobbs said, the small but vocal number of true wine fanatics will talk up your wine, revving the hype. "Those guys drive the market," he said.
Last July, for instance, three months before Blankiet Estate's 1999 Paradise Hills Proprietary Red was released, its price began soaring on WineCommune.com, an auction Web site. The vineyard the wine comes from was developed by David Abreu, and the wine was made by Helen Turley, both celebrated winemakers. With such a pedigree, said Michael Stajer, president of WineCommune.com, the wine first appeared at $270 a bottle, and soon began climbing. "In August," he said, "it reaches $450, and in September, a month before it's released, it sells well at $500." The wine's retail price was supposed to have been $90.
A hidden but significant marketing expense is the cost of wines provided for samples or donated to charity events. "It's not unusual to give away somewhere from 500 to 1,000 cases of cabernet," Mr. Maguire said, referring to Far Niente's $100 cabernet. Last year, the winery gave away about 600 cases, roughly $360,000 worth.
"The average business is out of business before the winery starts making money," Mr. Motto said. "It takes 15 years on average for a winery to be economically working well. In that period of time, eight restaurants have opened and closed."
Ms. Fredrikson added, "That is why they say the way to make a small fortune in the wine business is to start with a large one." 
All over California, that is the norm. Groth, Niebaum-Coppola, Harlan and Harrison were all begun by people who were already well off. 
Far Niente is just now unveiling Nickel & Nickel. The winemakers bought established vineyards at $100,000 an acre, paid Napa County some $300,000 in fees to build on the property and have invested $20 million in constructing the winery itself. They are producing just 8,000 cases of wine a year. While most businesses typically have a capital investment of $1 for every dollar of annual sales revenue, in the wine business the capital investment can be $4 to $8 for every dollar of sales revenue.
Wineries may not be so profitable, but they can be long lasting. As Mr. Motto pointed out, Thomas Jefferson's favorite wineries were Chateau Margaux and Chateau Latour, which are still flourishing. 
"At Nickel & Nickel," Mr. Maguire said, "there's not a price we can put on these wines that will make them profitable now." So while the winery's Oakville neighbors are Opus One, Harlan Estate and Dalla Valle, Nickel has played its new wines conservatively. Mr. Maguire says it has a zinfandel that could be sold alongside a Turley zinfandel that retails for $65, but has been put on the market at $45.
And yet a winemaker should not undersell his wine. "There's a perception among consumers that you need to be at a certain price to be taken seriously," Andrew F. Bell, president of Wine Symphony, a New York importer, said. "So if you're making a cabernet that's on the shelf for $20, it can't possibly be good."
Quality and perception are hard to separate. "You can get a really great bottle of wine for $40," Mr. Motto said. "Beyond that, it's something that depends on how discriminating you are, how important it is to your life, how much you can afford."
And just when a winery thinks it has settled on a good price, the weather changes. Mr. Hobbs has not yet set the price for his 2000 and 2001 vintages. The 2000 was less than stellar. He is considering pricing it so it would retail for about $100. The 2001, on the other hand, was a tremendous year. Look for it at about $150. 
A lot of labor went into that price. But it is up to you whether it is worth it.

HEADLINE: No New Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By Bob Kerrey, Sam Nunn, Peter G. Peterson, Robert E. Rubin, Warren B. Rudman and Paul A. Volcker; Bob Kerrey, Sam Nunn and Warren B. Rudman are former senators. Peter G. Peterson and Robert E. Rubin are former cabinet secretaries. Paul A. Volcker is former chairman of the Federal Reserve. All are members of the Concord Coalition, a group that focuses on federal budget policy.

 BODY:
With a war in Iraq and looming postwar costs, growing pressures for a prescription drug benefit, increased expenses for domestic security and a ballooning budget deficit, Congress must exercise restraint on both revenues and spending to prevent fiscal policy from spiraling out of control. The consensus in favor of long-term budget balance must be re-established. This issue is now directly before Congress as it debates the federal budget.
 The fiscal outlook is much worse than official projections indicate. These projections assume that the tax cuts enacted in 2001 will expire at the end of 2010. They also assume that discretionary spending, the part of the budget that pays for national defense, domestic security, education and transportation, will shrink continuously as a share of the economy. Neither of these assumptions is realistic. 
 Moreover, the official projections do not include the costs of war and reconstruction in Iraq. And they ignore the inevitable need to reform the alternative minimum tax, which is not indexed for inflation and will apply to some 40 million households within 10 years -- up from two million today.
Under more realistic assumptions, the deficit projections are cause for alarm. A recent study by Goldman Sachs includes this forecast: if the president's proposed new tax cuts are enacted, a Medicare prescription drug benefit is approved, the A.M.T. is adjusted and appropriations grow modestly, the deficits over the next 10 years will total $4.2 trillion -- even if the Social Security surplus is included. If it is not included, the deficit would be $6.7 trillion. Under these circumstances, the ratio of publicly held debt to gross domestic product climbs within 10 years to nearly 50 percent, from 33 percent just two years ago.
And all of this happens before the fiscal going gets tough. Looming at the end of the decade is a demographic transformation that threatens to swamp the budget and the economy with unfunded benefit promises, like Social Security and Medicare, of roughly $25 trillion in present value. Our children and grandchildren already face unthinkable payroll tax burdens that could go as high as 33 percent to pay for these promised benefits. It is neither fiscally nor morally responsible to give ourselves tax cuts and leave future generations with an even higher tax burden.
And yet tax cuts are the primary focus of this year's budget debate. To speed enactment of tax cuts, Congress is planning to use a special fast-track procedure called "reconciliation" in the budget resolution. While determining the size of the tax cut to be given fast-track protection in the budget is sometimes dismissed as a procedural matter, it is not: whatever its size, a tax cut that receives this protection is almost certain to be enacted in the later tax legislation. Members of Congress should not therefore approach the budget decision with the idea that a tax cut given such status now can be easily scaled back later.
The president has proposed a cut of $726 billion, which the House has already approved. The Senate has reduced the cut to $350 billion.
Given the rapidly deteriorating long-term fiscal outlook, neither proposal is fiscally responsible. It is illogical to begin the journey back toward balanced budgets by enacting a tax cut that will only make the long-term outlook worse. Furthermore, the proposed tax cuts are not useful for short-term fiscal stimulus, since only a small portion would take effect this year. Nor would they spur long-term economic growth. In fact, tax cuts financed by perpetual deficits will eventually slow the economy.
The tax cuts now before Congress do not pay for themselves. No plausible array of matching spending cuts or offsetting revenue increases has been, or will be, proposed to close the gap resulting from a large new tax cut.
We believe that there should be no new tax cuts beyond those that are likely to provide immediate fiscal stimulus, and that avoid growing revenue loss over time. If, however, Congress decides it must approve a tax cut, it should pass the Senate's. While a $350 billion tax cut does not fit our definition of fiscal responsibility, it comes closer than a tax cut of $726 billion. Moreover, Congress should re-establish the pay-as-you-go rule in which tax cuts and entitlement expansions must be offset. The discipline of this rule greatly contributed to the elimination of budget deficits in the 1990's and is clearly needed again.
Congress cannot simply conclude that deficits don't matter. Over the long term, deficits matter a great deal. They lower future economic growth by reducing the level of national savings that can be devoted to productive investments. They raise interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. They raise interest payments on the national debt. They reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with unexpected developments. If we forget these economic consequences, we risk creating an insupportable tax burden for the next generation.

HEADLINE: Sharing, Alaska-Style 

BYLINE:  By Steven C. Clemons; Steven C. Clemons is executive vice president of the New America Foundation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Though most Americans don't believe this war is about oil, much of the rest of the world does. How the United States handles Iraq's oil after the war is therefore crucial. For guidance, America might look to its experiences in Japan after World War II and -- perhaps more surprisingly -- in Alaska in the 1970's. 
 Most revolutions that produce stable democracies expand the number of stakeholders in the nation's economy. America's occupation of Japan succeeded not just because the United States purged Japan's warmongers and established a peace constitution but because it imposed land reform. American occupiers broke up vast estates held by the Japanese aristocracy and redistributed the land to farmers, thus linking Japan's most lucrative resource to millions of citizens. Now America should do the same with Iraq's most lucrative resource, oil. 
 Here is where Alaska comes in. In the 1970's, during the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the state realized that the new oil leases would produce an enormous windfall. Its citizens set up the Alaska Permanent Fund to manage this income, directing that the revenue be invested, the principal remain untouched and the gains be used for state infrastructure investments. A part of the proceeds was distributed as dividends to every Alaskan. By July 2002, the fund had grown to more than $23.5 billion. Dividend payments to Alaskan families averaged about $8,000 per year.
Iraq's annual oil revenue comes to approximately $20 billion. A postwar government could invest $12 billion a year in infrastructure to rebuild the nation. The other $8 billion could anchor an Iraq Permanent Fund, to be invested in a diverse set of international equities. The resulting income would go directly to Iraq's six million households. These payments would make a huge difference to families in a country whose per capita gross domestic product rests at about $2,500.
Establishing this fund would show a skeptical world that America will make sure Iraq's oil revenues directly benefit Iraqi citizens. By spreading capital broadly among new stakeholders, the plan would also prevent a sliver of Iraq's elite from becoming a new kleptocracy. Finally, the creation of an Iraqi oil fund could begin to help repair America's damaged image abroad -- itself no small dividend at a time when many people remain suspicious about American motives in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
IndexesFall Slightly, With Chip Shares Especially Weak

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks declined slightly yesterday after a wobbly session as disappointing outlooks from computer chip makers offset investors' hopes for a quick end to the war in Iraq.
 Investors kept a close eye on the fighting in Baghdad, but they began to look past the war to the economy and a dismal outlook for earnings. Semiconductor stocks pressured the market after the latest batch of earnings warnings. 
 "When the war is out of the way, the focus will shift to the weak economy and weaker-than-expected earnings," said Keith Keenan, vice president for institutional trading at Wall Street Access. 
The Nasdaq composite index slipped 6.57 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,382.94. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.49 points, or 0.02 percent, to 8,298.92. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged down 1.64 points, or 0.19 percent, to 878.29.
Shares of the Altria Group rose 3.4 percent after a court temporarily blocked a $3 billion punitive damages award against Philip Morris USA, a unit of Altria.
In technology, semiconductor shares lost ground after profit warnings from RF Micro and Microchip Technology.
More and more traders are taking profits from the recent war rally "ahead of what could be a long and dismal earnings season," said Steve Kolano, a trader at the Boston Company Asset Management. "It seems as though traders are suddenly switching to the underlying state of the economy."
Altria rose 98 cents, to $30, after the court ruling allayed fears that the company might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It was among the five most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
RF Micro declined 72 cents, or 11.9 percent, to $5.33, after saying demand for its more profitable products was weaker in the fourth quarter. The company, which ranked among the Nasdaq's most-active shares, warned that its loss would be wider than expected even as it raised its outlook for quarterly sales.
Microchip Technology declined $1.87, or 9.1 percent, to $18.66. After Monday's close, the company warned for the second time in three weeks that fourth-quarter results would fall short of expectations, blaming the war in Iraq and the spread of the illness known as SARS for a drop in sales. Chip equipment stocks slumped. Applied Materials fell 47 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $13.41; KLA Tencor dropped $1.03, or 2.7 percent, to $37.46.
Intel lost 25 cents, to $17.10. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index fell 3.74 percent.
"The market's still focused on developments in the Mideast, but as we go into corporate earnings season, I think there's going to be a shift toward fundamentals and the numbers companies are reporting," said Robert Mikkelsen, managing director at the Advest Group.
Among the gainers was Varian Medical Systems, up $4.87, or more than 10 percent, to $52.37. The company, a maker of cancer therapy systems, said it expected fiscal second-quarter earnings to exceed its previous estimates.
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday. The benchmark 10-year note climbed 11/32, to a price of 99 16/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.94 percent from 3.98 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond was up 22/32, to 106 24/32. Its yield declined to 4.92 percent from 4.97 percent.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
San Diego's Spreading Biotechnology Colony

BYLINE:  By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, April 3 

 BODY:
A sprawling office and laboratory complex inspired by Italian hill towns is the latest outcropping of biotechnology-related construction that has covered much of the rolling green hills and ravines here. 
 The $85 million headquarters for the IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation can also be seen as evidence of the rampant development making real estate professionals worry that the local biotechnology industry may be running out of room for growth. 
 In February, IDEC broke ground on a 350,000-square-foot complex just east of the University of California at San Diego in an area known as University Town Center. The complex, arranged in the form of two crescent-shaped rows of buildings on either side of a shallow ravine, is expected to be completed in the fall of 2004. 
A publicly held company that develops and manufactures drug therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, IDEC is one of about 300 biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the area of San Diego County centering on the outlying district of La Jolla and the University of California campus there. About 35,000 people are directly employed by biotechnology companies in the county, according to Biocom/San Diego, a trade group. 
Among those companies, IDEC is a comparative rarity: a biotechnology start-up that has graduated from pure research and development to making products for the market. The company's best-known product is Rituxan, used to treat cancer, which IDEC discovered. It markets Rituxan in an agreement with Genentech of South San Francisco.
Like the computer industry in Silicon Valley and the technology companies in and near Boston and Cambridge, Mass., San Diego's biotechnology community is a synthesis of academia and industry. The presence of at least 12 private research foundations, notably the Salk Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, has added to the talent pool of bioscience researchers. 
Like a single organism that reproduced many times, the biotechnology industry in San Diego was engendered by a single research-based company, Hybritech. "We have a family tree that shows how the first several companies came out of Hybritech," said Joseph Panetta, Biocom/San Diego's president, "and those companies in turn generated new companies."
The industry's connections to the university are obvious in La Jolla. For many years, virtually the entire biotechnology industry in San Diego could be found on a single street, Torrey Pines Road, which borders the university. The Salk Institute is on the same road, while Scripps Research Institute is on a side street nearby. 
Even today, about 80 percent of these companies in metropolitan San Diego can be found within a three-mile radius of Torrey Pines Road, according to Steven Bollert, an office broker and senior vice president of the life sciences group at Burnham Real Estate Services of San Diego.
A building boom occurred in the mid-1990's, when big companies including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Merck and Elan all moved into installations on or near Torrey Pines Road.
Today, the La Jolla area contains about 10 million square feet of combined laboratory and office space, according to Mr. Bollert. Mr. Panetta, the trade group official, added, "There is more space in San Diego County devoted to laboratories than there is in regional shopping malls. "
The vacancy rate in the La Jolla area office market is currently about 9 percent, higher than the 2 to 3 percent vacancy levels typical of the area before the economic downturn, Mr. Bollert said. He attributed the higher vacancy rate to the combined effects of companies moving out of the area into larger spaces, and other, less successful companies offering their unused space for sublease. 
Rents for combined laboratory and office space range from $24 to $36 a square foot annually, with the costliest space to be found on or near Torrey Pines Road. 
Part of the cost reflects the special design and structural requirements of laboratory buildings, which have 13-foot-high floors to accommodate extra air-handling ducts and water pipes; floors that can bear up to 100 pounds a square foot of "live load," or twice the requirement of ordinary office space; and steel reinforcements to the building structure, according to Mr. Bollert.
Today, San Diego is one of the largest centers of biotechnology in the country, after the San Francisco Bay area and the Boston-Cambridge area. Mr. Panetta noted that rankings can be misleading, adding that the biotechnology industry in San Diego, unlike other industry centers, is concentrated in a small area of several square miles. On the basis of density rather than the number of companies, "we are No. 1," Mr. Panetta said. Looking out his window a few miles east of the university, he said, "I can see the logos of five or six biotech companies."
Despite the number of research and development companies in La Jolla, only a small fraction will be successful beyond their initial venture-capital financing, according to Mr. Panetta. "The challenge of getting any new product to market is one of probability," he said. "You won't know if your product is going to work until there have been numerous tests. 
"The whole system is set up to filter out the toxic and the ineffective products, and it's no different with biotech," he said. "If you take all the 'silver bullet' companies that have a single product and single technology, the success rate among them is about one in 200." 
Even with such daunting odds for the industry, land for biotechnology development is increasingly scarce in La Jolla, Mr. Bollert said, adding: "There are only about 12 acres on Torrey Pines Road available for development. We are definitely running out of land" in San Diego County in general.
As a result, he said, "you will see the redevelopment of existing sites and more vertical development."
Those space limitations, combined with high land prices near the university, have sent the biotechnology industry spreading beyond La Jolla into surrounding areas. Carlsbad, some 15 miles to the north, has become a biotechnology center in its own right. IDEC is building a 470,000-square-foot drug manufacturing plant in Oceanside, a city just north of there that until now has had little biotechnology presence. 
For its headquarters, IDEC had to go about three miles east of Torrey Pines Road, where land was available for its 43-acre campus. It is being developed for IDEC by Cisterra Partners of San Diego. 
IDEC borrowed some headquarters design notions from Silicon Valley, opting for a campus with a connection to the natural environment, as well as one that would encourage casual socializing among researchers, according to Robert D. Wiley, the company's associate director of facility services. 
The architect is William Valentine, the president of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, who arranged the campus on two hills. Following the example of Italian hill towns, he situated each wing, one for office space and the other for laboratories, on separate hills. The buildings curve along the hills' topography. 
To avoid the authoritarian look of some corporate campuses, the architects broke up the mass of the building into separate pods at different heights, so that the roofline of the buildings step up and down. Although the buildings appear to be a chain of smaller buildings, they are actually continuous.
"In a hill town," the architect said, "everything is connected."
Below the buildings will be a artificial arroyo area with a stream and lake, including a small peninsula extending into the lake that is intended for private meetings. "It's a gathering place to walk through or think and relax," Mr. Wiley said. 
Small courtyards on the grounds, he said, are intended to surprise. "They are kind of 'aha!' spaces," Mr. Wiley added.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Rise, Perhaps Threatening Growth 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8 

 BODY:
Wholesaler inventories rose in February as snowstorms damped spending on automobiles and other durable goods, and at the same time confidence fell leading up to the war with Iraq, reports released today showed.
 Stockpiles grew 0.3 percent after there was no change in January, the Commerce Department said. 
Excluding an increase in the value of petroleum products, sales fell 0.7 percent, led by the biggest drop in imported vehicles since December 1997. 
 A sustained rise in inventories may restrain economic growth by causing factories to curb production, economists said. Business confidence in the first quarter was the weakest in more than a year, a separate report said.
"We're still in a situation where businesses have been extremely cautious," said Tim McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust in New York.
A measure of business confidence fell to 53 from January through March after a reading of 58 in the fourth quarter, according to the Conference Board, a private research group in New York. The survey was conducted during the buildup to the conflict in the Middle East.
"War, threats of terrorism, high energy costs and weak economic news have contributed to the decline," said Lynn Franco, director of the group's research center.
The government report released today showed companies were trying to keep stockpiles in line with the pace of sales. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a gauge of how long goods sit in warehouses and on loading docks, held at 1.22 months' worth, matching the lowest reading on record.
Economists had expected a 0.2 percent gain in February wholesale inventories. Wholesale inventories account for a quarter of business inventories. Stocks held by retailers and factories make up the rest.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET-- Englewood, N.J.; 
Where Downtown Redevelopment Paid Off

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J. 

 BODY:
On a shopping strip saturated with chain stores, the arrival of a Victoria's Secret might be a humdrum event. But in the northern New Jersey suburb of Englewood, the scantily clad mannequins on West Palisade Avenue send a vivid signal that a painstaking downtown redevelopment effort is paying off.
 Palisade Avenue, Englewood's broad main commercial street, is bisected by railroad tracks that are used only to transport freight. The lingerie store, which opened in late 2001, is located on the western flank, a section that many residents used to avoid. Surrounding it was a blighted residential neighborhood and a 30-acre park that was a magnet for drug users. 
 These days, however, West Palisade is humming with activity, and the east-west distinction is beginning to fade. Several new projects are in various stages of development, including a $40 million complex that will bring Englewood its first sizable chunk of market-rate housing in decades.
Englewood, with a population of 26,000, is a racially diverse city, where the median family income in 2000 was more than $67,000 but nearly 9 percent of the population had an income below the poverty level. 
More than two decades ago, downtown Englewood had a retail vacancy rate of 33 percent. Today, Robert L. Benecke, the city manager for the last nine years, says no vacancies exist. "We talk in terms of waiting lists," he said.
State officials say the city is a model for other communities because of its comprehensive approach to revitalization. Paul G. Stridick, the coordinator for Main Street New Jersey, a state program that provides technical assistance for downtown redevelopment, describes Englewood as "the jewel in the crown."
There have been bumps along the road. In 1992, Palisade Court, a 140,000-square-foot shopping center anchored by a ShopRite supermarket, opened behind West Palisade Avenue. The market got shoppers to cross the tracks but there was no spillover onto West Palisade.
The first breakthrough on the street occurred in 1998, when Group USA, a national discount women's clothing chain, opened a $2 million two-story retail building that also included the Children's Place, another chain retailer. Initially, Group USA had sought to build a store on city-owned land east of the tracks, but Mr. Benecke persuaded the family-owned company to team up with the city and build on West Palisade instead. The city's share, most of it from state funds, was $800,000.
"We gambled on it," said Peter Beronio, the city's economic development director. "We believed that if we could build the first one, the rest of them would follow." New ground-floor space on West Palisade Avenue now commands annual rent of as much as $35 a square foot, up from $20 or so five years ago, he said. In all, the city has spent about $10 million in city, state and federal money, he said, and will have attracted as much as $180 million in private investment if all the pending projects are built.
Before the complex opened, however, the city took numerous steps to improve the residential neighborhood, including cleaning up the park and buying several dilapidated houses on Armory Street, which intersects with West Palisade. Sidewalks, facades, streets and lighting were upgraded.
Spurred by the success of its first project, Group USA plans to begin construction on an adjoining site of 15,000 square feet of retail space and 38 condominiums, said Ali Amirniroumand, the company's chief operating officer.
The Real Estate Equity Company, the Englewood-based developer that built Palisade Court, is also responsible for the Victoria's Secret building, which abuts the shopping center. Now the company, known by its acronym, Treeco, plans to rehabilitate the neighboring building for three chain-store tenants and is negotiating with property owners on the opposite side of the street to make way for another project, Palisade South, with 32,000 square feet of retail space, 188 units of market-rate rental housing to be developed by the Starwood/Heller Group, 340 residential parking spaces and 106 metered spaces.
This fall, Michel Bittan, a private entrepreneur, plans to open a tapis restaurant and Moroccan-style nightclub in a brick building at the corner of Armory Street that once housed a Ford Motor showroom.
All this new development has, of course, created a demand for more parking. The city expects to choose a developer this summer to build a parking garage on city-owned land just east of the railroad tracks. The garage will be concealed behind two levels of retail space, probably a major bookstore, Mr. Beronio said.
One key to West Palisade's revival has been the city's long-term commitment to revitalization, Mr. Stridick said. "Our downtowns didn't get into bad shape overnight," he said. "Being in it for the long haul -- that tenacity -- that's what makes it successful."

HEADLINE: A Reporter Killed in Iraq Was Known For Tenacity 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
Despite the obvious perils of cycling in Manhattan, Julio A. Parrado knew there was no better means of navigating the traffic-choked city than on a beat-up three-speeder.
 During the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and the transportation paralysis that followed, Mr. Parrado used it to zip between ground zero and his Greenwich Village apartment, where day after day he typed out vivid accounts for El Mundo, the Spanish-language newspaper that employed him. Ambitious, adventurous and endlessly curious, Mr. Parrado, friends say, was perfectly suited to the frantic pace of his adopted home. 
 That sense of adventure, and a strong belief in the role of journalists during wartime, led Mr. Parrado to Iraq, where he was killed on Monday by a rocket that struck an Army encampment outside Baghdad. Pentagon officials say the surface-to-air missile, which killed three other people, including a German journalist, was fired by Iraqi forces. Mr. Parrado, who had been embedded with the Third Infantry Division, was 32. 
In Spain, where his father is a well-known politician and a peace advocate, Mr. Parrado's death has added more fuel to that country's widespread and strident opposition to the war. In New York, the loss has simply left a mournful hole in the vast circle of friends that Mr. Parrado had collected during his seven years in the city.
"There's just this huge emptiness, there's no sense to it," said Idoya Noain, a New York-based correspondent for El Periodico, another Spanish-language newspaper. 
Last night, dozens of his friends -- publicists, writers, bankers and human rights advocates -- gathered at the apartment of a downstairs neighbor to remember Mr. Parrado, an opera-loving, bar-hopping bon vivant who painted his kitchen a fluorescent green and always faced bad news with a bemused grin.
Ms. Noain recalled the day last year when his bicycle wheel was stolen. A few hours later, after he bought a replacement, the wheel was stolen again. "He just laughed about it," she said. "Laughing was like a passion to him."
Mr. Parrado was also passionate about New York, and his zeal for the city's political and economic life was reflected in his dispatches for El Mundo. In an Internet posting to El Mundo readers, Mr. Parrado likened his arrival in New York to a pilgrimage to Mecca. "To come here is almost a religious act," he wrote. "You learn tolerance and respect."
Carlos Fresneda, 40, a colleague and friend, said Mr. Parrado thrived in New York, although he missed the city of his birth, Cordoba, where his mother is a deputy mayor. His father, Julio Anguita, is the former head of Spain's main leftist party. In the months after the terrorist attack, Mr. Parrado seemed to cross some invisible threshold, both personally and professionally, Mr. Fresneda said. "He was like my little brother and I watched him evolve," he said.
When the Pentagon announced its policy of allowing reporters to travel with military units, Mr. Parrado volunteered. Although friends and co-workers said he was opposed to an American-led invasion of Iraq, Mr. Parrado thought he should bear witness to the realties of war. He spent a week training at a Marine base in Virginia, but when he learned that his newspaper had been passed over for a slot, Mr. Parrado traveled to Washington, talked his way into the Pentagon and managed to wangle a spot for himself and a colleague from a competing Spanish daily. 
With just two days before his departure, he scurried around New York trying to find protective equipment. He bragged to friends that he had bought the last Kevlar helmet in town, but he was unable to find a top-notch set of body armor. For that reason, Mr. Parrado decided he would try to stay away from any frontline action. 
In Iraq, he spent most of his time with an Army medical unit. His accounts, all of them published on El Mundo's front page, were unvarnished portrayals of combat mayhem or the heroism of American medics trying to save Iraqi lives.
Ana Bueno, an editor for El Mundo's online edition, said she spoke to Mr. Parrado three times the day of his death. American forces were making a foray into one of Saddam Hussein's Baghdad palaces, but Mr. Parrado, she said, had decided to remain at the Army encampment several miles outside the city.
"He thought it would be safer to stay back," she said. "But I guess you never know in a war. You can find death everywhere."

HEADLINE: ON EDUCATION; 
When a Student Prefers Learning of the Hands-On Variety

BYLINE:  By Michael Winerip 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
HIS first two years at Long Beach High School, Wes Moran was going straight downhill. "I was cutting a lot, did no homework," he said. He felt his teachers wanted him to learn new stuff daily, but he didn't see the point. People noticed he was skipping class and sneaking outside for a smoke and pegged him as a slacker.
 Then, in junior year, he decided to attend the Nassau County vocational high school, the Joseph M. Barry Career and Technical Education Center -- better known as Barry Tech -- "on a trial basis." He signed up for refrigeration and air-conditioning. 
 It took some getting used to. He had to be up at 5:30 to catch a little yellow bus for the half-hour ride to Barry Tech in Westbury and barely had time for a smoke before the three-hour class started.
If it was social studies, three hours would haved killed Wes, but with refrigeration, he was amazed. There was always something new. "We learned copper tubing, basic electricity, condensers, compressors," he said. "You do vinyl piping work, plumbing, evaporation, carpentry. There's so much to it."
He loved their field trip to a Marriott hotel. "Two maintenance guys toured us around," he said. "We went everywhere. They showed us the big machines, took us up to the roof to see the air handlers."
This year, he took Refrigeration II with Mr. S, Eugene Silberstein. "We worked with more complex things like defrost timers," said Wes, who began to see that refrigeration could play a big part in his future. "They say there's a lot of money in the industry. I want to start saving up and get a business."
Mr. Silberstein was a role model. "He's worked on a lot of famous people's houses," said Wes. Indeed, before becoming a teacher, Mr. Silbersteinhad done air-conditioning work for William F. Buckley Jr., Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Shriver, to name a few.
Mr. Silberstein sees big things for Wes: "He'll be a superstar in this industry. He has the desire and guts to go out and do what he wants."
Last week, Mr. Silberstein helped Wes review for the state vocational education championships in Syracuse. "He told me the whole theory about disconnect switches," Wes said. If Wes could win the state refrigeration title, he'd earn a trip to Kansas City, Mo., in June for the nationals, sponsored by SkillsUSA, a nonprofit group that has run vocational competitions for 39 years.
The bus ride to Syracuse was five hours. Wes packed his tool box, a roll of copper wire, goggles and his new, rubber-soled steel-tip shoes. Asked if he was nervous, he said, "No point in being nervous. I'm going to do how I'm going to do. Being nervous is just another thing to worry about."
Unlike Wes, people who believe in vocational education are very nervous. Even as unemployment rises, the Bush administration wants to cut vocational financing to $1 billion this year from $1.3 billion. In 2004 it plans to end all federal financing and reallocate that $1 billion to help students pass the state tests mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act. In New York, Gov. George Pataki has proposed a 25 percent cut in the state budget for vocational education.
With more states requiring students to pass standardized tests for a diploma, many vocational schools are losing them to traditional academic high schools. Barry Tech has undergone a $27 million renovation, including a $50,000 computerized framing machine for auto-body work; a paint shop that can mix 60,000 colors; and three new hair salons. And yet, since New York began requiring students to pass five tests for a diploma, Barry Tech's enrollment has dropped, to 1,121 today from 1,517 in 1999.
Yvette Bravo-Rivera, Barry Tech's principal, said that keeping a boy like Wes at a traditional academic high school for test preparation was cruel. "Giving them more of the same stuff they fail at is like screaming at a deaf person," she said.
Brad Smith, who ran the New York vocational education competition, believes many students are better off learning a trade than trying to get five 65's on state tests. "We're losing sight of the real purpose of public education," Mr. Smith said. "We'll always need people to fix our cars, build our houses, cut our hair. Not everybody needs college."
Fifteen hundred students in 68 trades came to Syracuse to compete. Most of Wes's judges worked for Carrier, which is based here and is the world's largest air-conditioning manufacturer. Robert Dohse of Carrier said the industry could not get enough skilled workers. "If you know a.c. and refrigeration, you'll never be out of work," Mr. Dohse said.
The 13 refrigeration competitors took a written exam, then performed six hours of hands-on tests. Wes had to make a copper tubing connection by brazing, swaging, flaring and deburring. He was surprised how hard the test was and how much the judges knew. He got to meet the best in the business, including Matt Huber of Brockport, N.Y., who won the state refrigeration/air-conditioning title last year and took fourth in the 2002 nationals.
When the results were announced, Wes was disappointed not to win, though fifth place was nothing to be ashamed of. "Not a lot of people get the opportunity to do this," he said.
Since Syracuse, he has been as busy as ever, with school and a job bagging groceries at a local Associated supermarket. He already has a summer internship lined up, working for a publishing company. "I'll be doing all the a.c. in the building," he said.
With the Wes Morans in mind, vocational educators are pressing Congress to restore the financing the budget cuts removed. In the Senate, Democrats are supportive, but only one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, has been willing to challenge the administration.
Senator Collins lives in blue-collar Bangor, was an educator herself and often visits the local vocational school, United Technologies Center. She said many students there "mention for the first time in their lives that they are interested in learning."
As any teacher knows, igniting that learning spark is everything. Often that means thinking beyond five state exams.

HEADLINE: AOL Time Warner in Talks To Sell Its Atlanta Teams 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
AOL Time Warner, under pressure to reduce its heavy debt load, is in discussions with at least two bidders to sell the Atlanta Braves and its two other Atlanta sports teams, an executive briefed on the talks said yesterday. One bidder is a group led by Dave Checketts, the former chief executive of Madison Square Garden, the executive said. 
 Separately, the company said it was confident enough in its attempts to raise more cash that it had decided to borrow an additional $812 million to use cash instead of stock to buy back a stake in AOL Europe. 
 Mr. Checketts and David McDavid, owner of a chain of car dealerships in Texas, are in talks to buy all or part of AOL Time Warner's three Atlanta sports teams -- the Braves in baseball, the Hawks in basketball and the Thrashers in hockey -- as well as the Philips Arena, the home of the Hawks and the Thrashers, a person involved in the talks said. The teams are expected to sell for a total of more than $650 million, either together or in pieces. The AOL Time Warner executive said the Braves might be sold separately. 
AOL Time Warner's attempt to sell its Atlanta teams is part of a nationwide reshuffling in the control of professional sports teams as owners stung by the economic downturn have put "for sale" signs on several teams, including the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Anaheim Angels in baseball and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks in hockey. 
Mr. Checketts was fired as chief executive of Madison Square Garden two years ago by Cablevision Systems, which owns the Knicks and the Rangers in addition to Madison Square Garden. He is also leading a group that is one of the bidders for the Dodgers, which is being sold by the News Corporation. He could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Mr. McDavid, who was long known for appearing in commercials for his car dealerships wearing a tuxedo and a cowboy hat, previously owned a minority stake in the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. He also could not be reached for comment. The AOL Time Warner executive briefed on the talks said there were other interested bidders as well.
AOL Time Warner has said it hopes to reduce its $28 billion in debt by about $4 billion this year and by $5 billion next year to preserve its investment-grade credit rating. 
Yesterday, the company added to its debt when it said it would pay $812 million in cash instead of stock to fulfill an obligation due this month to LineInvest Ltd., a European partnership. By paying cash, the company avoids having to use shares that are trading at about $12, down more than 75 percent since January 2001. Using such low-priced shares would have forced the company to issue a greater number to pay the bill, essentially handing over a larger portion of the company than using shares at a higher price. But AOL Time Warner instead had to increase its debt.
In a statement, the chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, said paying cash was better for shareholders, despite the additional borrowing. "Our continued strong free cash flow generation and the progress we are making toward sales of selected assets give us confidence that we can and will meet our debt reduction objectives," he said.
The company's debt to the European partnership originated in a March 2001 deal to pay Vivendi Universal for its 55 percent stake in AOL France. AOL Time Warner agreed to pay in preferred stock in AOL Europe, valued at $725 million at the time, with a promise to exchange it for either cash or shares of AOL Time Warner this month. Vivendi later sold the preferred stock to the partnership. 
The March 2001 Vivendi deal also coincided with an agreement to sell $25 million in advertising to Vivendi. AOL Time Warner made a similar but much larger agreement to sell $400 million in advertising to Bertelsmann as part of an agreement to buy it out of a partnership in AOL Europe for about $7 billion, and AOL Time Warner recently disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was questioning whether the advertising was sold at inflated prices, amounting to a rebate on the larger payment that increased the cash flow and revenue of its AOL division. AOL Time Warner says it accounted for the deal correctly.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Is There Life After Silicon Valley's Fast Lane?

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., April 8 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley's true believers are having second thoughts.
 If there is a religion here in the nation's high-technology heartland, its first commandment has long been Moore's Law, the 1965 observation by an Intel co-founder, Gordon E. Moore, that the number of transistors on a silicon chip would double annually. Dr. Moore later refined his projection, and the doubling rate has held to about every 18 months ever since, virtually dictating the pace of product obsolescence and innovation, and indeed the pace of life, in Silicon Valley. 
 Now some experts warn that Moore's Law may soon reach its theoretical limits, with dire consequences for the technology industry's economic engine. Yet an influential cadre of heretics is arguing that seeing an end to the slavish demands of Moore's Law could be the best thing to happen to the culture of Silicon Valley and maybe even to the future of technological innovation that is affected by that culture. 
"Forget Moore's law, because it is unhealthy," Michael S. Malone, a longtime member of the valley's technology community and an eBay founder, wrote recently in a trade publication. Forget Moore's law, "because it has become our obsession," Mr. Malone wrote. "Because high tech has become fixated on it at the expense of everything else -- especially business strategy."
"It is precisely this fixation," he added, "at the cost of other considerations like profit, product and market, that led to the dot-com bubble and bust." Fittingly, perhaps, Mr. Malone's article appeared in the February issue of Red Herring, a venture capital magazine, which has since ceased publication, another victim of the technology bust.
Sentiments like Mr. Malone's seem to find amplification in a new book by Po Bronson, an author who has chronicled life in Silicon Valley. His book "What Should I Do With My Life?," (Random House, 2002) explores "stories of people who found peace and fulfillment by giving up the frantic chase for their dream."
Several of Mr. Bronson's case studies are about people who found the valley's 24/7 relentlessness to be a "toxic environment." Tim Bratcher, for example, worked at Cooley Godward, one of the region's most prestigious law firms, but hated the pressures. He left Silicon Valley for Atlanta and ultimately turned to teaching law for satisfaction.
In an interview, Mr. Bronson said he found that during the boom, even though many people complained about the pace of work and the way their jobs dominated their lives, they were intoxicated by the action and left only after being laid off.
Others, like Mr. Bratcher were burned out by a corollary to the tyrannical Moore's Law: a pace of business that Intel's co-founder and chairman, Andrew S. Grove, referred to as "Internet time" in 1996, at the onset of the dot-com boom.
Dr. Moore's is not a law in the physical sense, but rather a prediction derived from the economics of the semiconductor industry. For more than three decades it has accurately predicted the accelerating power and plummeting cost of computing. Because of the exponential nature of Moore's prediction, each change has arrived faster and more furiously than the one before.
In 1968, for example, the cost of a transistor was $1. By 1995, a dollar bought about 3,000 transistors. It now fetches 50 million. Or take the clock speed of Intel's microprocessor chips, which rose gradually from about 100,000 instructions a second in 1971 to 25 million by 1989. By 2000, an Intel microprocessor was firing off 1.5 billion instructions, and now the rate is 3 billion -- and climbing.
It is a business burn rate that continues to claim casualties. Recently, for example, National Semiconductor, a pioneering chip maker, said that rather than continue fighting a multifront war against obsolescence the company would sell its formerly promising information appliance business.
"Hanging in there with the products that keep chasing Moore's Law is increasingly expensive," said Brian L. Halla, National's chairman and chief executive.
Not everyone in the valley is ready yet to call time out. Those who are still thriving have little time or patience for the new wave of reflection -- including Intel's Mr. Grove. Asked by e-mail message whether he had new thoughts about the meaning of Internet time, Mr. Grove issued a terse reply: "I am too busy to contemplate this."
Other executives argue that the bust simply provided a much-needed pruning of deadwood and that the valley's round-the-clock style of innovation was alive and well.
"Some people get burned out, but a lot more people come back and continue to participate in the ecosystem," said Kim Polese, co-founder and chairwoman of Marimba, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that makes software for corporate computing systems. "The valley is healthy and innovation is thriving, and we're marching forward."
Dr. Moore, for one, is standing by his principle. At the International Solid State Circuits Conference in February, Dr. Moore, who at 73 is Intel's chairman emeritus, predicted that the law would play out for another decade or so before designers reached fundamental physical limits that would prohibit the doubling of transistors in a given space.
"No physical quantity can continue to change exponentially forever," he said. But, he added, "Your job is delaying forever."
A growing number of Silicon Valley's technical experts, however, question whether Moore's Law can hold for another decade.
Each year, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which closely tracks the latest in manufacturing technology, issues a detailed International Technology Roadmap. The map is color-coded to indicate where potential challenges might develop in the future. Areas where a clear path can be seen are marked in green, and those that require more engineering in yellow. Obstacles for which there are yet work-arounds and which could stop progress entirely are marked in red -- known in the chip industry as the "red brick wall."
Commenting on the latest road map at a February meeting of the International Society for Optical Engineering in Santa Clara, Calif., an I.B.M. scientist said the industry could hit a wall well before the decade was out.
William D. Hinsberg, an I.B.M. chemist at the company's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., reported that the light-resistant materials that are currently used in projecting circuit patterns onto chips may fail at dimensions below 50 nanometers. (A human hair is roughly 100,000 nanometers in width.) To keep Moore's Law on track, Mr. Hinsberg said, the industry would need to devise materials that can accommodate circuitry narrower than 50 nanometers -- and would need to do so by 2007.
At the same meeting, Chris A. Mack, a vice president for lithography technology at KLA-Tencor, a company in San Jose that makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, said in a presentation that the popular conception of Moore's Law had become outdated.
"Moore's Law is not about scaling up, it's about scaling down," Mr. Mack said in a telephone interview after his talk.
The Moore's Law race to put more transistors on a single chip is losing relevance, he said, because of limitations in the Microsoft Windows desktop computer operating system, which can process information only in 32-bit chunks and which restricts a PC's memory to four billion bytes.
If Moore's Law is reaching practical as well as physical limits, the implications could be far-reaching in Silicon Valley.
"In the future, maybe faster and cheaper would not be as important as functionality," said Doug Henton, founder and president ofa Silicon Valley consulting firm, Collaborative Economics. He argues that the valley's designers and engineers took a wrong turn in adopting 24/7 lifestyles that emulated the machines they were creating.
"Productivity should be about producing more with less rather than more with more," he said.
He is far from alone in his conclusion.
"The skill sets and people's lives didn't adjust as fast as the stock market ticker," said Randy Komisar, 48, a longtime Silicon Valley executive whose credentials include tours through Apple, the Go Corporation and WebTV.
Mr. Komisar is author of a 2001 book "The Monk and the Riddle: The Art of Creating a Life While Making a Living," (Harvard Business School Press) and now works as an independent consultant -- but on his own terms. He rides his motorcycle to client meetings, and he finds time most days to take a long bicycle ride in the hills above Silicon Valley.
"The ultimate question that is getting asked more and more," he said, "in a way that it wasn't being asked in 1999, is, What really matters?"

HEADLINE: Power Broker Has No Post, But Big Role 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 7 

 BODY:
There is no mutually agreed-upon term to describe the role George E. Norcross III plays in New Jersey politics, and most state residents barely know his name, but within the halls of the State House, he has recently emerged as one of the most powerful and most vilified figures in the state.
 Although he commands a powerful bloc of South Jersey labor leaders, municipal lawyers, elected officials and fund-raisers, Mr. Norcross bristles at the suggestions that he is a political boss or that his organization is a machine. And while he has at times described himself as an "activist," Mr. Norcross, a wealthy bank executive, moves in far more moneyed circles than most protesters or political outsiders do. 
 He holds no elected office or any official position within the Democratic Party, and has no college degree, yet Mr. Norcross has nonetheless played a pivotal role in deciding many of the most pressing issues facing state government. 
Members of Gov. James E. McGreevey's administration have blamed Mr. Norcross's allies in the Legislature for hobbling their plan to solve the state's projected $5 billion budget deficit, by blocking the governor's proposal to increase taxes on casinos. Some legislators have accused Mr. Norcross of orchestrating a series of critical newspaper articles that have imperiled the career of the highest-ranking Republican official in the state, John O. Bennett, co-president of the Senate, as part of a feud that began last year.
His allies, meanwhile, have used their key committee assignments in the State Senate and General Assembly to promote a broad political agenda -- some bills that would benefit their constituents in South Jersey, and others that seem specially tailored to boost Mr. Norcross's business ventures.
Mr. Norcross insists that he is simply an organizer, trying to insure that the oft-ignored taxpayers in South Jersey receive their fair share of resources.
"Finally, we have a seat at the table," he said in a recent interview.
But others say that Mr. Norcross is the inevitable evolution of the New Jersey political power broker in a state that has become wealthier, more suburban and less dependent on manufacturing.
"He combines the smoothness and outward style of a business leader with the wiles and savvy of an old-time political boss," said Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers. "Then he has a volcanic temper, which is the sheathed sword that makes many people afraid to cross him. It's a very formidable combination."
Mr. Norcross, 47, was raised in Pennsauken, N.J., the son of a politically active A.F.L.-C.I.O. regional president. He left Rutgers during his freshman year, founded an insurance brokerage firm and in 1981, at the age of 25, served as campaign finance chairman for Randy Primas, the first black mayor of Camden.
But Mr. Norcross was quick to internalize the political maxims of the Reagan era: if Democrats wanted to rebound and win back middle-class voters, they had to preach fiscal restraint and emphasize the concerns of suburbanites. While serving as Camden's Democratic County chairman from 1989 to 1995, and developing a stormy relationship with Gov. Jim Florio, a fellow Democrat, Mr. Norcross worked tirelessly to elect an assortment of county freeholders, state legislators and municipal officials.
By the time Mr. McGreevey was elected in 2001, Mr. Norcross was the undisputed political power in South Jersey, whose political organization has influence over hundreds of patronage jobs and millions of dollars in municipal contracts.
Last year, during the first months of Mr. McGreevey's term, Mr. Norcross was a welcome guest in the governor's office. Although he had briefly backed Senator Robert G. Torricelli's unsuccessful bid to seize the Democratic nomination for governor from Mr. McGreevey, Mr. Norcross had enough power within the Legislature that he could not be ignored.
He rallied legislators to kill Mr. McGreevey's plan for a new tax that would hit South Jersey residents who work in Philadelphia. Mr. Norcross helped shape a $175 million bailout package for Camden, which included $15 million for Cooper Hospital, where he serves on the board of directors. The state also agreed to commit $24 million for a sports arena in Pennsauken, where Mr. Norcross owns a minor league hockey team.
His high profile during the budget negotiations last June also became something of a political legend. With his shock of silver hair and crisp blue suits, Mr. Norcross was hard to miss as he made frequent forays into the governor's inner office, and his hard-knuckle bargaining led to news reports that he shoved Mr. Bennett during a disagreement about financing for the arena.
This year, Mr. Norcross's role has been less ostentatious, but just as pervasive. Mr. Norcross and his allies have forced the governor's economic team to reshape its budget plan. The Assembly majority leader, Joseph Roberts, who is Mr. Norcross's business partner, also proposed a bill that would allow optometrists to perform laser eye surgery. (Mr. Norcross and Mr. Roberts own a chain of optometry shops, but say they would not profit from the laser-surgery law because only 1 percent of the chain's business is in New Jersey.)
State Senator John Adler, a Democrat from Cherry Hill, said Mr. Norcross had also helped persuade the state government to lower tax rates and improve schools and the infrastructure in economically troubled South Jersey.
"I don't see him, at a state level, trying to dictate policy," said Mr. Adler, who has received financial backing from Mr. Norcross. "He wants Democrats to win so they can do good things for working families."
With recent polls showing Mr. McGreevey with weak approval ratings, some of the governor's advisers have urged him to distance himself from Mr. Norcross and from John Lynch, the powerful former state senator. Republicans dismiss any such talk as political posturing, and point to the fact that Commerce Bank, where Mr. Norcross is chairman and C.E.O. of the insurance division, made $3 million in commission on state bond work during the first year of the McGreevey administration. They have also challenged Mr. McGreevey to prove his political independence by rescinding the $24 million for the sports arena.
But Mr. Norcross said that he would donate the profits from his hockey team to charity.
Mr. McGreevey's advisers say that the arena plan will be judged on its own merits rather than any political symbolism, and insist that any talk of a feud is overblown.
"It's not a major rift or a calculated distancing," said Kathleen Ellis, the governor's communications director. "It's policy differences."
With the struggle over this year's budget about to enter its grueling final months, the relationship between Mr. McGreevey and his Democratic allies will be severely tested. Mr. Norcross has increased his influence during the past year, by helping Democrats win county executive races in Bergen and Essex Counties. His brother Donald is the Camden County Democratic chairman, and his brother Phil is partner in a law firm that recently opened an office down the block from the State House, and serves high-powered clients involved in several major policy disputes.
Mr. Bennett, who blames Mr. Norcross for inspiring a series of newspaper articles that accused his law firm of overbilling a client, predicted that Mr. Norcross's combative political tactics will eventually be his undoing.
"He wants to have absolute power," Mr. Bennett said. "And a lot of people, Republicans and Democrats, are uncomfortable with what he's willing to do to get it."
Mr. Norcross denies that he inspired the negative stories about Mr. Bennett, but concedes that his tenaciousness provides a convenient target for his political adversaries. In recent months, Mr. Norcross has tried to maintain a lower public profile, and he declined to be photographed for this article. But as a lifelong resident of South Jersey -- he lives with his wife and two children in Cherry Hill -- Mr. Norcross vowed to continue fighting for his home turf.
"I'm driven by success," he said. "And I'm passionate about the interests of South Jersey."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
North Korea's Neighbors Seek Crisis Role

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 8 

 BODY:
Three months after North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the United Nations Security Council will meet Wednesday to discuss the nation's nuclear program.
 On the surface, prospects look bleak for action by the 15-member Security Council. 
 North Korea has rejected United Nations authority over its nuclear program, and said on Sunday that any move by the Security Council would be "a prelude to war." On Monday, China declined to join the other four permanent Council members in drafting a condemnation of North Korea for its unregulated nuclear program. 
"We think intervention by the U.N. Security Council now cannot help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue," Liu Jianchao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said today in Beijing.
Even South Korea, smarting over the North's cancellation of economic talks for this week, has suggested that a meeting of countries in the region, not the United Nations, would be the best way to bring the North's nuclear program under control.
"We can resolve North Korea's nuclear issues without going through the official channel of the U.N.," Yoon Young Kwan, South Korea's minister of foreign affairs and trade, said Sunday on television here.
On Thursday, North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty becomes effective, making it the only nation among 188 signers to do so.
While there may be pessimism about the ability of the United Nations to rein in North Korea, there is growing optimism that China is now wielding influence over its neighbor.
Three months ago, North Korea seemed to be on the way to restarting a reprocessing plant that could produce enough plutonium to make one nuclear weapon a month. Studying the initial pace of actions, many analysts predicted that the North would use the distraction of the Iraq war to declare itself a nuclear weapons nation or even to conduct an underground bomb test. But reprocessing apparently has not started.
There has also been little in the way of provocative actions recently on the part of North Korea. The last major one occurred on March 2, when North Korean fighter jets intercepted an American reconnaissance plane and signaled it to land in North Korea. The signal was ignored.
Over the last six weeks, there has been a steady flow of high North Korean officials, military leaders and diplomats to Beijing. Separately, Japan's foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, was in Beijing on Monday, and his South Korean counterpart, Mr. Yoon, is to be there on Thursday. China, the source of most of North Korea's food and energy, is offering to be host to multilateral talks.
Compared with the similar 1993-94 North Korean nuclear crisis, when relations between China and South Korea were only two years old, South Korea is now vastly more important to China, probably China's third largest economic partner after the United States and Japan. With North Korea talking in apocalyptic terms of a new war on the Korean peninsula, China quietly sent a high-ranking Communist Party delegation to Pyongyang last month. It was part of a wider Chinese effort to restrain the North Koreans and to guide them to negotiations, said Scott Snyder, Korea representative for the Asia Foundation, a research group.
"The Chinese are looking at this through the lens of realpolitik," Mr. Snyder said, adding that he believed that China signaled its will last month by cutting off an oil pipeline to North Korea for three days.

SUPPORT URGED FOR COMPENSATION RULE AT G.E.

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, urged General Electric shareholders to approve a resolution requiring the company to give performance-based stock options to executives. The fund, known as Calpers, solicited votes for performance-based options. Stock options currently granted by G.E. provide windfalls to executives in good economic times and penalize them in bad times, Calpers said.

MEADWESTVACO WARNS OFLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED RESULTS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The paper and packaging company MeadWestvaco Corporation warned yesterday of lower first-quarter results because of economic weakness and higher energy costs, driving its stock price down more than 5 percent. MeadWestvaco, based in Stamford, Conn., said it expected to report a first-quarter net loss of 36 to 41 cents a share, including a charge of 2 cents a share related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. It said the results were hurt by higher costs of energy, maintenance and wood as well as the weak economy and "operating challenges" at some paperboard mills.

Of all the companies and countries clamoring for a piece of Iraq's reconstruction, one is virtually certain to be invited: the Philippines.
 No matter which companies ultimately win contracts from Washington to rebuild Iraq's roads, airports, hospitals or other structures, officials in Manila expect to supply thousands of Filipino laborers to them. "I'm confident that if they're looking for skilled workers, they'll come to us," said Patricia A. Sto. Tomas, the secretary of labor and employment. 
 Inexpensive, skilled labor is one of the most lucrative exports of the Philippines. Faced with record unemployment at home, where the average income is just over $1,000 a year, about seven million Filipinos work overseas. Whether they work as doctors, nurses, maids or nannies, the $7 billion they send home to relatives each year is one of the country's most important sources of hard currency.
Analysts and economists in Manila hope the country will soon be able to count on income earned in Iraq. About $2.5 billion of the Bush administration's $80 billion war budget has been allocated for rebuilding Iraq, a task that could cost as much as $100 billion. Last month, Washington awarded a $4.8 million contract to rebuild the port at Umm Qasr to Stevedoring Services of America, based in Seattle. And Bechtel, based in San Francisco, is said to be a front-runner for a contract to rehabilitate the country's vast oil industry.
The exclusion of any foreign bids has sparked protests from Britain, America's main ally in the war, and coincided with a determined bid by France and Germany for greater participation in the cleanup after a war they opposed from the start.
Smaller participants in the American-led invasion effort are, meanwhile, quietly positioning themselves for their share of the spoils. Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia, for example, hope that sending chemical-weapon specialists will entitle them to contracts. South Korea intends to send 700 medical and engineering workers to smooth a return by its big construction companies to a market they abandoned after the first Persian Gulf war.
The Philippines has yet to make an official offer, but President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo told local reporters last week that her government was prepared to send peacekeepers, doctors, nurses, engineers and construction workers.
Responding to concerns that joining the invasion effort might expose the Philippines to further reprisals by Muslim insurgents in the country's south, a spokesman for Mrs. Arroyo tried to highlight the economic advantages, saying those who joined were assured of getting "first crack at the development efforts."
In the previous gulf war, the Philippines sent medical teams to Saudi Arabia to treat the wounded. When the war was over, Filipinos poured back into Kuwait, first to help extinguish oil well fires, working for companies like Bechtel, Brown & Root and Blount. Afterward, they found jobs as domestic helpers, waiters and mechanics.
And not only in Kuwait. From just 500,000 before the 1991 gulf war, the number of Filipinos working in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Israel -- tripled by the time the first missiles flew into Iraq last month.
But as war grew imminent, Mrs. Sto. Tomas's department suspended travel by Filipino workers to the region and made plans to evacuate those still there.
Economists worried that if the war dragged on or expanded, it would not only reduce the number of jobs for Filipinos in the Middle East but also hurt the global economy and its demand for Filipino labor.
But Iraq is not Kuwait. Though the country is oil rich, Iraqis are poor and the number of Filipinos employed there was dwindling for years before the gulf war of 1991. Thousands of poor Iraqis will be looking for work when this war is over.
But where Filipinos may have the edge for companies rushing to rebuild the country is in their skills and education. Ninety-five percent of Filipinos can read, compared with only about 60 percent of Iraqis. And most Filipinos still learn English in school, a legacy of America's occupation of the country early in the last century.
The Philippines has already lent a helping hand in the war against terror beyond cracking down on terrorist groups at home and expelling Iraqi diplomats thought to be helping them. Imported Filipino laborers and engineers, many working for less than the American minimum wage, helped build the detention center holding Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Even if Philippine companies fail to win a single contract in Iraq, Filipinos are likely to find work there, analysts and officials say. "Filipino workers would benefit because American companies could hire them," said Edser Trinidad, a senior analyst at BNP Paribas Peregrine Securities in Manila.
With American troops fighting in the heart of Baghdad, recruitment agencies in Manila say they are already seeing the first, tentative inquiries from American companies, including some of the same ones that hired Filipinos to work in Kuwait more than a decade ago. Those employers that do not have contacts with a Philippine recruitment agency can go to the Department of Labor and Employment's Government Placement Branch, which is dedicated to finding them Philippine employees.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Push on Accounting Fraud 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
A new emphasis at the Justice Department on accounting and securities fraud cases is already producing indictments and will almost certainly lead over the next several months to a wave of additional cases, according to prosecutors, defense lawyers and independent legal experts.
 Nine months after President Bush ordered the formation of a federal task force to prosecute corporate fraud, the former chief executives of Enron and WorldCom, who have come to symbolize corporate corruption, have not been charged, and may never be. 
 But in other cases, federal prosecutors are moving aggressively to bring criminal charges for accounting gimmickry or securities fraud that in the past might not have been pursued.
Prosecutors and regulators were not willing to speculate about which companies might face criminal charges, or how many new cases might be brought. And they cautioned that securities cases, especially those where companies appear to have manipulated accounting rules to inflate their earnings, can be complicated and difficult to prove. 
But they broadly agree -- and criminal defense lawyers concur -- that the Justice Department's commitment to pursuing fraud is serious, not just a public relations effort.
"These have become the hot, sexy cases," said Christine A. Bruenn, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, a group of state and Canadian stock regulators that works with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with prosecutors. "I think a lot of people have changed their focus in termsof how seriously they're taking these cases."
Investigations that would once have been conducted solely by the S.E.C. now involve federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents from the start, officials said.
The commission -- which in the 1990's had a difficult time persuading prosecutors outside Manhattan, Brooklyn and San Francisco to follow up on its referrals of potential fraud cases -- is now working with prosecutors in offices across the country. When there are accusations of serious fraud at companies based in states where prosecutors lack experience in accounting investigations, the Justice Department is dispatching specialists from Washington to help them.
All this is producing faster results. When prosecutors are convinced that they have clear evidence of fraud -- as at HealthSouth, the operator of rehabilitation hospitals and clinics, or Symbol Technologies, a Long Island manufacturer of bar-code scanners -- they quickly pursue indictments of midlevel and senior managers to prod them to turn in top executives. 
Last month, for example, Robert Asti, a vice president at Symbol Technologies, pleaded guilty to helping inflate Symbol's sales and profit. In announcing the plea, prosecutors noted that the investigation into Symbol is continuing.
At the same time, the longer prison sentences provided by the Sarbanes-Oxley Law have become a strong incentive for lower-level managers to cooperate with prosecutors.
With the new priority given such cases, Ms. Bruenn said she expected many more criminal indictments in the next few years.
"My sense among regulators and prosecutors is that we're all rather surprised as to how much fraud is out there," she said.
Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University law school and a historian of the S.E.C., agreed.
"There's been a lot more activity," Mr. Seligman said. "You've seen it in the number of indictments. You've seen it in the focus on major cases. My impression is that you have a good deal of open cases going on where you're likely to see a good deal more."
Defense lawyers agree on the trend but say it may have unintended consequences, like discouraging qualified people from serving as executives or directors at public companies and even harming prospective economic growth by discouraging private companies from selling shares to the public. "Why would someone want to be a director and face all this potential exposure?" said Ira Lee Sorkin, a former federal prosecutor and director of the New York office of the S.E.C. who is now a white-collar defense lawyer at Carter Ledyard & Milburn.
But Mr. Seligman said he thought such fears were groundless. Prosecutors appear to be bringing cases where fraud has resulted in large losses for investors and they have clear evidence of criminal intent by executives, he said.
"You want the Justice Department prosecuting appropriate cases," he said. "So far, they've done a pretty effective job."
Mr. Sorkin also expressed concern that the new punishments in fraud cases are overly strict. "If a C.E.O. commits a willful fraud," he said, "he can get 25 years. If he commits manslaughter, he's going to get 15."
Seth T. Taube, who specializes in white-collar defense cases at McCarter & English, said that some investigations were being complicated by the early involvement of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents. 
Increasingly, he said, those officials were sitting in on so-called proffer sessions -- meetings with his clients to discuss what they know about potential fraud cases -- that in the past would have involved only investigators from the S.E.C. The increased threat of criminal prosecution makes it hard for him to advise his clients to cooperate with investigators, Mr. Taube said.
But Wayne Carlin, director of the S.E.C.'s Northeast regional office, said he thought the threat of prison time made suspects much more willing to cooperate with investigations.
"Proffer sessions at a U.S. attorney's office are a better way of extracting the truth," Mr. Carlin said. "The person coming in has an even more heightened sense of the stakes, and of the consequences."
The Justice Department's focus on these cases is in marked contrast to its attitude a few years ago. Over the years, prosecutors have been intimidated by complex fraud cases, especially those that involve accounting, said Leslie Caldwell, who is heading the Justice Department task force investigating Enron.
"It was sort of fear of the unknown: Oh, no! Accounting fraud, and I don't know anything about accounting fraud," Ms. Caldwell said.
But prosecutors soon discover that many of the new cases -- if not the Enron case -- are relatively straightforward, once they have stripped away the accounting jargon, she said. And as they become more comfortable with accounting and learn how to explain it to juries, they are more willing to bring cases.
"You do one, and you see it is just fraud, and I can do a fraud case," Ms. Caldwell said.
Ms. Bruenn said she hoped that the increased threat of prosecution might deter executives from breaking accounting rules. The rampant gimmickry and fraud during the late 90's market bubble raised questions about the effectiveness of the S.E.C.'s penalties, she said.
"I think that the civil proceedings are somewhat of a deterrent because they're so expensive to the company," she said. "But criminal prosecutions are the way to go."

Instead of leaving early fact-finding to the S.E.C., the Justice Department and F.B.I. are involved in cases from the beginning. Federal prosecutorsProsecutors are provided specialized assistance, and with increased prison time provided under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, they have more incentive to pursue cases. Prosecutors focus on indicting midlevel managers . . . . . . to get them to turn in top executives. (pg. C8)

HEADLINE: Budget Ax Threatens 3,200 School Workers 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER MEDINA 

 BODY:
The New York City Department of Education said yesterday that it planned to lay off 3,200 school employees, most of them part-time school aides. The plan is not likely to affect teachers or instructional aides, who are protected from layoffs under the teachers' contract.
 The department's announcement came just a day after the Bloomberg administration announced it intended to lay off 3,400 city employees in other departments and to close several firehouses. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to announce a more detailed plan next week, but numbers released yesterday show that the number of layoffs in the Education Department is more than double the number of positions being cut in any other city agency. 
 The cuts come as the mayor and the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, undertake a major overhaul of the education system. The city has already included the elimination of about 1,000 positions at the department's headquarters in the Tweed building and at the School Construction Authority.
School officials said yesterday that the 3,200 layoffs are the equivalent of 1,958 full-time positions. The paraprofessionals being laid off work in jobs like lunchroom supervisor and hall monitor.
The layoffs will save about $180 million, or about 3.5 percent of the department's budget for the coming fiscal year, education officials said. There are about 150,000 employees in the Department of Education, officials said. Mr. Bloomberg has said he needs to save about $600 million to help close the city's budget gap and has rejected most of the cost-cutting proposals from the city's unions. 
After the Education Department, the Sanitation Department faces the largest number of layoffs, 941, according to numbers released by the Bloomberg administration yesterday. Also scheduled to be laid off are 848 employees from the Administration for Children's Services, 382 from the Fire Department, 109 from services for the homeless, 463 from the Department of Correction, 97 in transportation and 69 in finance.
Layoff notices for the school employees are not expected to go out until late next month, so that the job reductions will coincide with the end of the school year. The cuts will be the biggest since 1991.
Any savings that unions can now find will not reverse the layoffs, city officials said, but could go toward a $1 billion contingency plan that Mr. Bloomberg must include in his executive budget next week. The contingency plan is needed in case Albany refuses to approve the commuter tax that Mr. Bloomberg is counting on to close the approximately $3.5 billion deficit in the fiscal year that begins July 1, said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor.
"The mayor gave the unions months to come up with potential savings and they never materialized," Mr. Skyler said, "and at this point he has no choice but to reduce the city's work force through layoffs."
In earlier rounds of budget cuts, the city had emphasized that classrooms would be spared. But as deficits continue to widen, such cuts seem more likely.
"The mayor has said from Day 1 that he will do everything he can to protect the classroom from budget cuts, but that is becoming more and more difficult," Mr. Skyler said. 
The layoff details came on the same day that Mr. Klein and Richard P. Mills, commissioner of the State Education Department, announced two programs to recruit new teachers and lure former teachers back. The city expects to need 11,000 fully licensed teachers for the next school year.
The recruitment efforts will focus on finding math, science and special education teachers for the weakest schools, Mr. Klein said.
"Even in these tight times, we need to get the best people into our classrooms," he said. 
Randi Weingarten, who leads the teachers' union, praised the recruitment effort but criticized the budget plans.
"The numbers we are hearing now are different than the numbers we heard even hours ago," Ms. Weingarten, who is also chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, said last night.
"This is part of our concern about how disrespectful they are with negotiations. Ultimately if you really respected your workers, you would make sure everyone knew where management was going with this," she said. "Now it feels very much like a game as opposed to a really bad situation."
Ms. Weingarten specifically questioned how the city could recruit teachers even as it moved forward with layoffs. In the last few years, several hundred aides have become classroom teachers in their schools, she said.
"This isn't sending a message that we want those teachers and that we value their work," she said. "We do not understand why the mayor has basically slapped our face."
Brian McLaughlin, president of the Central Labor Council, said in a statement that union leaders have worked in recent weeks to find ways to save money while keeping jobs, including pressing state legislators to pass the commuter tax.
"In this dire economy, we should not add more people to the list of unemployed," he said. "Now is a time to think creatively to come up with solutions, not just cut jobs and services."

HEADLINE: Pataki Asks Business Group To Postpone Backing Tax 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 8 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has asked a powerful group of New York City business leaders to postpone releasing an open letter in which they strongly support reinstating a commuter tax to help the city weather its financial crisis.
 The governor asked for more time and told leaders of the business association, the Partnership for New York City, that he would find other ways to provide the city about $1 billion in state aid, aides to the governor and members of the partnership said. 
On Friday, Mr. Pataki made the request after the co-chairmen of the organization, Henry R. Kravis and Jerry I. Speyer, told him they were considering publishing the letter, which was signed by dozens of city business executives, members of the group said. Mr. Pataki, who strongly opposes reinstating a tax on commuters, asked that the group not take a public position for at least three weeks. In the meantime, he said, he will propose alternatives to the tax. 
"I can confirm the governor had discussions with the partnership," Lisa Dewald Stoll, the governor's chief spokeswoman, said. "The governor has made his position known on the commuter tax and urged the partnership to reconsider the release of its letter."
Restoring a tax on commuters is the biggest component of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to close a $3.4 billion deficit in the fiscal year beginning July 1, but the idea has gotten a cool reception not only from Mr. Pataki but also from the Republicans who control the State Senate. And yesterday, elected officials from Long Island and Westchester County demonstrated against the plan at City Hall. They had what they said were 15,000 letters from suburban residents opposed to it.
Mr. Kravis and Mr. Speyer circulated a draft of the letter among members of the partnership last week. Dozens signed it, but dozens of others chose not to. Among those who oppose reinstating the tax are some of the city's largest employers, said members of the partnership who insisted on anonymity. "There was not unanimity," one member said.
The people who signed the letter did not express support for Mr. Bloomberg's proposal to tax commuters at the same rate as city residents, with a top rate of 2.7 percent. Instead they called for a revival of the old commuter tax at a level of 1 percent of one's income or less. The Legislature repealed that tax in 1999.
"We don't think it will cause great hardship or lead to significant job losses," the draft letter read, according to members who signed it. "As employers we represent most of those commuters who will be affected by this tax."
The letter also urged Mr. Pataki not to cut state aid for education. The governor's executive budget calls for a $1.2 billion reduction in state grants to local school districts. "We urge the state to restore aid to public education at last year's levels," the letter said. "Without those funds our monumental push for school reforms in jeopardized."
In the end, however, the two chairmen of the partnership decided to hold off. They sent an e-mail message to other members of the group, which was given to The New York Times by a member of the group. "We will respect the governor's request and hold off sending the letter for now, but we will monitor the progress of his efforts to help the city, leaving open the option to send the letter if we are not satisfied," the e-mail message said.
Mr. Speyer declined a request to be interviewed. Mr. Kravis did not return telephone calls from a reporter. The president and chief executive of the partnership, Kathryn S. Wylde, also declined to comment on the letter.
One member of the partnership, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many business leaders thought the City Council and the mayor have already done as much as they can to solve the city's fiscal crisis, raising property taxes 18.5 percent and cutting billions from the budget. They also fear that if the state does not help the city more, property taxes will go even higher.
"The time is now for the state to be more supportive," said the business leader, who signed the letter. "I think people feel the city has done more than its fair share at this point."
Aides to the governor would not disclose any details of what Mr. Pataki intends to propose to help the city in lieu of the commuter tax. But they said Mr. Pataki has no intention of allowing a new tax on commuters to pass in any form. He campaigned last fall on a promise not to reinstate such a tax and attacked his Democratic opponent, H. Carl McCall, for supporting the idea.
The letter suggests at least some of New York City's business leaders disagree with Mr. Pataki's argument that a commuter tax would drive businesses away. On Monday, Mr. Pataki said he had heard from many city business leaders who told him they would move their headquarters if the commuter tax was restored.
Even if Mr. Pataki were to change his stand, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who is also a Republican, is set against reinstating the tax. There are about 17 Republican senators who represent commuters in the city's suburbs. All oppose the idea, and it would be hard for Mr. Bruno to overrule their wishes.
"Our position on the commuter tax is unchanged," said John McArdle, a spokesman for Senator Bruno. "We along with the governor continue to oppose reinstating it."
Mayor Bloomberg has said that restoring the old commuter tax will not bring in enough money to balance the city's books. He is counting on Albany's passing his commuter tax plan, which would raise about $1 billion by extending the city's income tax to commuters but dropping the rates. The old tax, which cost most commuters between $1.10 and $1.25 a day, netted the city approximately $500 million a year.
Still, the mayor's aides said it was a welcome sign that Mr. Pataki had told business leaders he would present new proposals for helping the city. "We are pleased that our leaders in Albany are beginning to focus on the city's fiscal difficulties, and we will continue to press forward with our legislative agenda and urge them to support tax reform," said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor.

HEADLINE: The Budget No One Wants 

 BODY:
Less than a week before he unveils his executive budget plan to close New York's $3.5 billion budget gap, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is already cutting thousands of jobs and closing eight firehouses. New York City would be lucky indeed if that was the extent of the layoffs and lost services this year. But the mayor has rightly warned that more pain -- perhaps a great deal more -- will follow. 
 That is because the city's financial hole is deepening while the unions and Albany -- the partners that helped save the city in the financial crisis of the 1970's -- are so far not adequately answering Mr. Bloomberg's calls for help. Union leaders offered a plan that relied in part on manipulating pension funds to produce savings of $600 million while preserving jobs. The mayor declined. City Hall has said it wants workers to lengthen their 35-hour workweek and begin paying some of their health care costs. These concessions would be hard for city workers to swallow, but they would put city benefits more in line with the private sector. Most critically, they might help to preserve some of the 3,400 jobs that would be lost to layoffs in the next round of cuts. 
 There is no shortage of cold shoulders for New York in its time of need. But worst of all are those of Gov. George Pataki and lawmakers in Albany, who hold most of the "get out of crisis" cards. Saddled with their own fiscal mess, state leaders seem to have forgotten about the dire consequences for the state if New York City sinks. Mr. Pataki's proposed state budget would actually hurt the city by cutting $480 million from education and increasing local Medicaid costs. The mayor is still counting on a $1 billion commuter tax, which needs state approval, but Albany has treated that idea as dead on arrival. The governor and the Senate Republican majority should at least consider an alternative commuter tax offered by Gifford Miller, speaker of the City Council, which would share revenues with outside localities. Without an awakening in Albany, the city will probably have to find $1 billion more in cuts for jobs and services. City residents will have every right to call them Pataki layoffs.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has made it clear that he wants a second term, is nevertheless taking on political hot potatoes, including the firehouse closings. The savings, almost $11 million, may seem paltry. But right now, every little bit helps.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: DIPLOMACY; 
Chirac to Join German and Russian Leaders

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 8 

 BODY:
A meeting of the leaders of Russia and Germany planned for this weekend acquired a sudden new cast late today when President Jacques Chirac of France said he would attend the session, and suggested that the situation in postwar Iraq would top the agenda. 
 The announcement raised the prospect of another bitter split over Iraq among the three nations and the United States and Britain, this time centering on whether the United Nations should take the lead in governing and rebuilding the country once the war has ended. 
 The potential for rancor was underscored late today when the United Nations issued a cryptic denial of an earlier Kremlin announcement that Secretary General Kofi Annan would also meet with the leaders in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Saturday. 
Mr. Annan has struggled to maintain a semblance of unity during a crisis that has left the United Nations' oldest and most powerful members sharply divided over its role in settling global conflicts.
In remarks in Paris today, Mr. Chirac said the United Nations, "and it alone," should be responsible for administering Iraq's reconstruction and governance. "We are no longer in an era where one or two countries can control the fate of another country," Mr. Chirac said at a news conference in Paris after meeting with the United Nations' high commissioner for refugees. 
Both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany have also called for the United Nations to assume the lead role in rebuilding Iraq. 
"The sooner it happens, the better it will be for all the countries involved in this conflict," Mr. Putin said last Wednesday.
That sentiment appears at odds with the White House, which has signaled that the United States and Britain would assemble an interim government of Iraqi nationals to take control when the war ends, and that many further decisions would lie with the Iraqis themselves. 
At a meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain today in Northern Ireland, President Bush said the United Nations "will have a vital role" in the shaping of postwar Iraq. 
But he stopped short of giving the United Nations carte blanche over Iraq's future, limiting his explicit support for the organization to an advisory role in forming an interim government and in helping supply aid.
Before today's announcement that Mr. Chirac would fly to St. Petersburg on Friday, the meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Schroder appeared as much a routine and regular get-together of two close friends as a discussion on Iraq. 
Mr. Chirac's addition recasts the meeting as an effort to coordinate the three nations' effort to place Iraq in the hands of international stewards. In Paris last Friday, the foreign ministers of all three nations called for the United Nations to take an early role in running postwar Iraq and voiced concern about a humanitarian emergency. 
Mr. Putin met at the Kremlin on Monday with President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and Russian involvement in Iraq's reconstruction was a leading topic, a senior United States diplomat said.
In Moscow today, a United Nations official initially confirmed to news services that Mr. Annan would join the Russian and German leaders this weekend. But that announcement was later withdrawn without explanation by United Nations officials in New York, and the extent of Mr. Annan's travels this weekend were not clear.
In Paris today, Mr. Chirac delivered a thinly disguised attack on the White House's position that the two nations that fought to oust Saddam Hussein should take the lead in Iraq's revival. 
While saying he shared Mr. Bush's commitment to a "vital" role for the United Nations, Mr. Chirac added, "It is up to the United Nations -- and it alone -- to take on the political, economic, humanitarian and administrative reconstruction of Iraq."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS; 
2 Democrats Call for Scrutiny Of Bidding to Reconstruct Iraq

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8 

 BODY:
Two senior Democratic lawmakers asked today for an investigation into how the Bush administration is awarding contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq, with special attention to contracts already given to a subsidiary of Halliburton, the company once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.
 The lawmakers, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and John D. Dingell of Michigan, asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to examine the bidding process at the United States Agency for International Development, which will award at least $1.6 billion in contracts to rebuild Iraq, and at the Pentagon, which will award tens of millions of dollars of contracts. 
 No one in the White House was available to comment on the request.
A spokesman at the development agency said officials had briefed Congress on the contracts and "had answered each and every question in this regard." 
"We have followed the same expedited procurement procedures under federal law allowing us to limit the number of competing firms in order to shorten the decision time," said Jeffrey Grieco, the agency's deputy assistant administrator for public affairs. "These procedures have been used by the U.S. government in previous conflicts and are completely consistent with the federal acquisition rules." The administration has been accused of bias since it restricted the competition for the major contract to reconstruct Iraq to a handful of companies. The winner would then have a toehold in one of the most lucrative building programs in decades, a task expected to cost up to $100 billion. 
The administration has said that time constraints and the need for security clearances led it to restrict the bidding. The companies selected are among the most politically connected in the country and include the Bechtel Group, which has emerged as one of the top two contenders, the Louis Berger Group, Fluor and the Parsons Corporation.
The lawmakers wrote to David M. Walker, comptroller general of the accounting office, saying that "because the administration has released few, if any, details about these contracts, little is known about the authority to enter into the contracts, or whether proper procurement procedures were followed."
The lawmakers questioned the contracts awarded by the Pentagon without competitive bidding to Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton.
After noting problems with recent Brown & Root contracts -- including questionable cost controls for work in the Balkans and $2 million in fines to resolve claims of fraud for work at a military base -- the lawmakers asked why the administration had given it "a string of lucrative contracts over the last two years."
"Ties between the vice president and Halliburton have raised concerns about whether the company has received favorable treatment from the administration," the two lawmakers said in the letter.
Mr. Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 until 2000.
The method of awarding the postwar reconstruction contracts has angered allies, especially the British, who say that their companies have been cut out even though their service members are fighting alongside United States troops.
Experts have questioned whether the restricted bidding violates international trade rules, because the procurement agreement of the World Trade Organization requires an open and transparent bidding process.
The aid agency has awarded two of its eight contracts for postwar Iraq. Stevedoring Services of America was awarded a $4.8 million contract to operate the port of Umm Qasr. The International Resources Group won a $7.1 million contract to provide support for planning, monitoring, coordination, management and reporting on reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.
House Republican leaders said today that they might restore President Bush's ability to choose which agency supervises the reconstruction, a decision that could allow the Pentagon to take charge of an effort that would normally be handled by the State Department.
Last week, the House and Senate passed bills to pay for the war in Iraq that would require rebuilding money to be spent mostly by the State Department and other civilian agencies. The White House, which had asked for flexibility to choose which agency ran the rebuilding effort, and had indicated it preferred military control, had asked congressional leaders to rethink their position.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR; 
Excerpts From Remarks by Bush and Blair: 'Iraq Will Soon Be Liberated'

 BODY:
Following are the text of a statement on Iraq issued yesterday by President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain after their summit meeting in Northern Ireland, and excerpts from their joint news conference as transcribed by Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript is at nytimes.com/iraq.

STATEMENT ON IRAQ
 The future of Iraq belongs to the Iraqi people. After years of dictatorship, Iraq will soon be liberated. For the first time in decades, Iraqis will soon choose their own representative government. 
 Coalition military operations are progressing and will succeed. We will eliminate the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, deliver humanitarian aid, and secure the freedom of the Iraqi people. We will create an environment where Iraqis can determine their own fate democratically and peacefully.
We are grateful to our men and women in uniform, as well as to the brave troops of Australia and Poland, and to forces contributed by other members of the coalition. They have demonstrated enormous bravery and professionalism in the face of great danger. We mourn for the members of the armed forces who have sacrificed their lives, and extend our deepest sympathies to their families.
We also grieve for the loss of civilian life in Iraq. Coalition forces take great care to avoid civilian casualties. The Iraqi regime has done the opposite. It has deliberately put Iraqi civilians in harm's way, and used women and children as human shields. It has sent execution squads to kill Iraqis who choose freedom over fighting for a brutal regime. We condemn Iraqi regime forces' attacks in civilian clothing, false surrender and mistreatment of prisoners of war. These acts are an affront to all standards of human decency and international law.
We are taking every step possible to safeguard Muslim holy sites and other protected places in Iraq that are important to the religious and cultural heritage of Islam and of Iraq. We have no confidence that the Iraqi regime has done the same, and are deeply concerned by reports that it is deliberately endangering such sites and using them for military purposes.
The coalition is delivering food, medicine and other humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people. This flow will increase as more of Iraq's territory is liberated and United Nations specialized agencies and nongovernmental organizations are better able to operate. We welcome the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of Resolution 1472, which will allow shipments of humanitarian items to Iraq to resume under the oil-for-food program.
As we said at our March 16 meeting in the Azores, we will uphold our responsibility to help the people of Iraq build a nation that is whole, free and at peace with itself and its neighbors. We support the aspirations of all of Iraq's people for a united, representative government that upholds human rights and the rule of law as cornerstones of democracy. We reaffirm our commitment to protect Iraq's natural resources, as the patrimony of the people of Iraq, which should be usedonly for their benefit.
As the coalition proceeds with the reconstruction of Iraq, it will work with its allies, bilateral donors, and with the United Nations and other international institutions. The United Nations has a vital role to play in the reconstruction of Iraq. We welcome the efforts of U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations in providing immediate assistance to the people of Iraq. As we stated in the Azores, we plan to seek the adoption of new United Nations Security Council resolutions that would affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief and endorse an appropriate postconflict administration for Iraq. We welcome the appointment by the United Nations secretary general of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and coalition representatives. 
The day when Iraqis govern themselves must come quickly. As early as possible, we support the formation of an Iraqi interim authority, a transitional administration, run by Iraqis, until a permanent government is established by the people of Iraq. The interim authority will be broad-based and fully representative, with members from all Iraq's ethnic groups, regions and diaspora. The interim authority will be established first and foremost by the Iraqi people, with the help of the members of the coalition, and working with the secretary general of the United Nations. As coalition forces advance, civilian Iraqi leaders will emerge who can be part of such an interim authority. The interim authority will progressively assume more of the functions of government. It will provide a means for Iraqis to participate in the economic and political reconstruction of their country from the outset. 
Coalition forces will remain in Iraq as long as necessary to help the Iraqi people to build their own political institutions and reconstruct their country, but no longer. We look forward to welcoming a liberated Iraq to the international community of nations. We call upon our partners in the international community to join with us in ensuring a democratic and secure future for the Iraqi people.

NEWS CONFERENCE

Prime Minister Blair
Of course our discussions have naturally continued to focus upon Iraq, upon the continuing military campaign, where once again our forces have performed superbly, and I want to pay tribute to the U.S., U.K. and other coalition forces. In all parts of the country our power is strengthening, the regime is weakening, the Iraqi people are turning toward us. . . . 
On weapons of mass destruction, we know that the regime has them. We know that, as the regime collapses, we will be led to them. We pledged to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, and we will keep that commitment. 
On Saddam, his grip on power has been prized away. He has ruled by fear, but as the knowledge sinks in that we will get the job done, the people realize there's not going to be a repeat of 1991, there's not going to be a repeat of the past. The power of Saddam is ending. . . . 
As we said, our forces will not stay in Iraq a day longer than is necessary. We will take on the legal and moral obligations that will fall to us as the forces on the ground to stabilize the country, to keep basic services going, to protect civilian life. 
Then we will help Iraq move as swiftly as possible to an interim authority run by Iraqis, and that in turn is designed to pave the way for a truly representative government which respects human rights and the rule of law, which spends Iraq's wealth not on palaces and weapons of mass destruction, but on the well-being, prosperity of the people of Iraq. . . . 

President Bush
As this war has progressed, the world has witnessed the brutal desperation, the true character, of the Iraqi regime. The world is also witnessing the liberation and humanitarian aid our coalition is bringing to that country as a new day begins in Iraq. In fighting this war we're taking every precaution to protect innocent life. We're showing respect for the Iraqi people, respect for their culture. There will be difficult fighting ahead, yet the outcome is not in doubt. Iraq will be free. 
After the current regime is removed, our coalition will work to restore electricity and water supplies, medical care and other essential services in Iraq. We will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of Iraqis from both inside and outside the country. The interim authority will service until a permanent government can be chosen by the Iraqi people. 
The rebuilding of Iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community. We're committed to working with international institutions, including the United Nations, which will have a vital role to play in this task. This work when the war is finished will not be easy, but we're going to see it through. 
A free Iraq will be ruled by laws, not by a dictator. A free Iraq will be peaceful and not a friend of terrorists or a menace to its neighbors. A free Iraq will give up all its weapons of mass destruction. A free Iraq will set itself on the path to democracy. 
The end of Saddam's regime will also remove a source of violence and instability in the Middle East. Prime Minister Blair and I are determined to move toward our vision of broader peace in that region. We're committed to implementing the road map toward peace, to bring closer the day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace and stability. 
Peace in the Middle East will require overcoming deep divisions of history and religion, yet we know this is possible. It is happening in Northern Ireland. You're proving that old patterns of bitterness and violence, the habits of hatred and retribution, can be broken when one generation makes a choice to break those habits. 

Questions and Answers

Q. Mr. President, how reliable was the intelligence that put Saddam Hussein at the site of last night's attack? Did he survive? And given the incursions in Baghdad recently, is the war nearly over?

MR. BUSH -- You know, I don't know whether he survived. The only thing I know is he's losing power. I know that, because the Royal Marines in Basra worked so hard, the people of Basra are beginning to understand a couple of things. One, when we said we come and stay to achieve their liberty, we meant it; that in Basra, for example, the presence of the Royal Marines is providing enough comfort for people to begin to express their own opinions. They're beginning to realize freedom is real. . . .
The only thing I can tell you is that grip I used to describe that Saddam had around the throats of the Iraqi people are loosening. I can't tell you if all 10 fingers are off the throat, but finger by finger it's coming off. And the people are beginning to realize that. It's important for the Iraqi people to continue to hear this message: we will not stop until they are free. Saddam Hussein will be gone. It might have been yesterday. I don't know. But he'll be gone. They just need to know that. Because we're not leaving. And not only that. They need to hear the message that we're not leaving after he's gone until they are ready to run their own government. 
I hear a lot of talk here about how, you know, we're going to impose this leader or that leader. Forget it. From day one, we have said the Iraqi people are capable of running their own country. That's what we believe. The position of the United States of America is the Iraqis are plenty capable of running Iraq. And that's precisely what is going to happen. 

Q. -- Picking up if I could, just on that last point for both of you. Have you agreed whether the United Nations will have any role in selecting the interim Iraqi authority? Or will that be entirely for the coalition?

MR. BUSH -- Yes. I mean, when we say vital role for the United Nations, we mean vital role for the United Nations in all aspects of the issue, whether it be humanitarian aid or whether it be helping to stand up an interim authority. The Iraqi people will decide who's on the Iraqi -- the interim authority. The interim authority is a transition quasi-government until a real government shows up, until the conditions are right for the people to elect their own leadership.
And the United Nations will have a vital role. When we say vital role, that's precisely what we mean: that they will be involved along with the coalition in helping to stand up an interim authority. But the Iraqi people are responsible for who's on that authority. And Tony can describe what's happening in Basra. . . . 

MR. BLAIR -- . . . People are coming forward. People are talking about those who have got support within the local community. Iraq -- it's not just that it's right that Iraq is run by Iraqi people. They want the chance to run their own country. You know, they haven't wanted to be under the yoke of tyranny for all these decades. The reason you had this incredibly tyrannical, repressive security apparatus was in order to suppress the proper feelings of the people there.
Now, of course we're going to work with everyone. We'll work with the U.N. We'll work with everyone in order to bring this about. 
But if I can just make this point to everyone: The important thing is not to get into some battle about, you know, words of the precise role here or there. But let's all work together internationally -- the coalition forces, the international community together -- to do what we really should be doing, which is making sure that that will of the Iraqi people is properly expressed in institutions that in the end they own, not any outside power or authority. 
And I think if we keep that vision in our minds, then we'll get this right. And rather than having sort of, you know, endless diplomatic wrangles over it, let's all just agree that the basic things that the Iraqi people want is they want to have a country where they are able to exploit their own wealth for their own prosperity, where they have basic protection of human rights, and where they have a government genuinely representative of Iraqi people, of the full diversity of Iraqi people. 

Q. -- Mr. President, what exactly is the vital role for the U.N. that you both mentioned? How do you explain it? What is a vital role? And are we going to see the same U.N. debate over postwar Iraq that we saw before the war?

MR. BUSH -- Yeah, well, I view a vital role as an agent to help people live freely. That's a vital role. That means food. That means medicine. That means aid. That means a place where people can give their contributions. That means suggesting people for the I.A.E.A. That means being, you know, a party tothe progress being made in Iraq. That's what that means. And I want to thank Kofi Annan for naming a personal representative to the process yesterday. It is a positive step. . . .

MR. BLAIR -- Absolutely. And there is no reason whatever why we need to go back into the wrangles we had over, you know, the so-called second resolution.
If people keep in mind the key objective, which is the well-being of the Iraqi people -- you know, whatever is the past is the past, but this country is in the process of being liberated. If they keep in mind the well-being of the Iraqi people, then I think we all then share a responsibility to make that objective be fulfilled in terms of what the Iraqi people want, in terms of their democratic rights, in terms of their prosperity, in terms of their freedom. And with goodwill and common sense, I'm sure it can be done.

HEADLINE: India Pressed on Kashmir Attacks 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 7 

 BODY:
At first glance, the argument is seductive: if America can strike out at a suspected sponsor of terrorism and hugely destructive weapons thousands of miles away, why can't India hit out at one next door?
 As India sees it, its neighbor Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state that is backing anti-Indian terrorism in Kashmir. The latest provocation came last month, when 24 Hindus were massacred there. India wasted little time blaming Pakistan, which denied responsibility. 
 The two nations, which were carved from one, have been sparring over Kashmir since their founding more than a half century ago. Last year a series of terrorist attacks against India nearly prompted it to go to war against Pakistan.
The pressure to act had receded in the last few months, but with the most recent incident and with reports of militants massing in Pakistan and waiting to cross into India, it is growing again.
"There is actually a problem shaping up," said C. Raja Mohan, the strategic affairs editor of The Hindu, a national newspaper. "This time the government's under pressure to do something."
Last week, India's external affairs minister, Yaswant Sinha, said what had been on at least some Indian minds. In an interview with the Press Trust of India, Mr. Sinha said India had a "better case" for a pre-emptive strike against Pakistan than America did against Iraq.
American officials moved quickly to respond, with a State Department official saying any comparison between Iraq and Kashmir was "overwhelmed by the differences between them." Pakistan, in turn, warned that pre-emptive strikes would constitute a "major miscalculation" on India's part that would lead to "grave consequences." 
Few experts here think India will make a pre-emptive strike based on the American precedent. India has been increasingly critical of the United States action in Iraq, which would make it difficult to then turn around and emulate it. India's Parliament passed a resolution on Tuesday deploring the allied attack against Iraq. "Change of regime through military action is unacceptable," the resolution said, and it called for the quick withdrawal of coalition forces from Iraq. 
India also lacks the military superiority over Pakistan that the United States has over Iraq. 
That does not, however, mean that India will not act against Pakistan, diplomats and experts say, if there is another major attack in Kashmir or elsewhere in India. With each incident, one senior Western diplomat said, "the patience is wearing thinner." 
In a sign of their concern, President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain took time to approve a joint statement on the subcontinent at their Camp David summit meeting on Iraq on March 27. It urged a cease-fire and called for Pakistan to discourage militancy.
Military action has its own perils for India, experts say. Diplomats and Indian officials who have discussed the situation with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said he seemed to have a particularly acute sense of them. 
Airstrikes or special forces operations against militant training camps would probably prompt new camps to spring up, only better secured or hidden. A bigger thrust into Pakistan to "teach it a lesson," as some hawks advocate, could prompt a dangerous escalation, or even a humiliating defeat.
But India has few options, experts here say. 
"There really isn't a game plan, other than just hoping something like American pressure will work over time," said Kanti P. Bajpai, a professor of international politics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. "Nobody has any ideas."
Successive prime ministers, he noted, have tried just about every approach to Pakistan over the last decade, from a middle path of "talking about talks" to a concerted effort at cooperation, to the current cold war. When it comes to Kashmir, nothing has worked.
The Vajpayee government has tried talking to Pakistan, and not talking to it. It tried a huge military buildup. It has opened the door to international involvement in the standoff, something it long resisted, in the hope that American pressure on Pakistan would end cross-border terrorism. 
It has not, despite a pledge to the Americans by President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to end infiltration by militants into India. Indian officials cite intelligence reports that some 1,000 militants are concentrated along the Line of Control that divides Indian and Pakistan-held Kashmir, waiting to cross into India when the weather permits. About 3,000 more are believed to be in training camps in Pakistan-held Kashmir. 
In a sign that America and its allies recognize that efforts to put pressure General Musharraf have had limited success, the British foreign minister, Jack Straw, recently discussed the potential for escalating violence across the Line of Control with his Chinese counterpart in the hope that the Chinese could exert influence on Pakistan, a longtime ally.
"How to put pressure on Musharraf when we know Pakistan is aiding and abetting terrorism is very difficult," the senior Western diplomat said, particularly given Western countries' need for Pakistani cooperation in the war on terror.
The United States and Britain, meanwhile, would like India to do more, starting with talking to leaders in Kashmir who want more autonomy or secession. The central government has appointed a new intermediary for talks, but similar efforts in the past have failed.
Western nations are pushing India to talk to Pakistan as well, but India is not biting. The one possible opening was seen to be in Pakistan's providing trade concessions to India. That would have given Mr. Vajpayee a way to visit Islamabad in a multilateral economic forum that could lead to a political dialogue. 
But Indian officials say Pakistan negotiated in bad faith, and the trade talks soured last fall. For now, even economic cooperation between the estranged neighbors is at a standstill.

HEADLINE: Carnegie's Zankel Hall Joins the Competition for Audiences 

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

 BODY:
After four years of construction, including a year's delay prompted by the Sept. 11 attacks, the Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall is set to open in September. Last week the inaugural season's lavish programming was grandly announced.
 What this new underground hall should mean for Carnegie is clear enough, assuming good acoustics and proper insulation from subway rumbles. But what will its impact be on other New York performing institutions, especially those at Lincoln Center? 
 Carnegie is now a three-hall complex, with the main Isaac Stern Auditorium and the intimate Weill Recital Hall joined by this new, flexible, 644-seat space directly below Stern Auditorium. Starting in September, Carnegie can and will offer music for most every audience taste and size.
The most piquant aspect of Zankel's programming is its range and variety. That variety reflects what is newly popular in noncommercial music today: jazz, world music, frisky new music, some folk and country-rock. There will also be educational programs and spoken-word events, along with more traditional classical music too expansive for Weill but likely to profit from Zankel's intimacy.
But with Carnegie (via Zankel) entering into alternative programming in such a big way, and with its seemingly limitless resources in a time of economic uncertainty, what will this mean for familiar purveyors of such fare? Jane S. Moss, vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, suggested this week that the major negative impact may be on what she called "geographically challenged" institutions, places like the Brooklyn Academy of Music or the Miller Theater at Columbia University that might lose audiences to this new midtown eruption of venturesome programming.
One wonders about that. The Brooklyn Academy is so well established and offers such a range of interesting events that one doubts it will be severely threatened, although it could always benefit from a little shaking up. 
Ditto for Miller, which has its own sharply defined profile under George Steele's direction.
Which shifts the focus back to Carnegie's main midtown rival, Lincoln Center. The center's independent constituents -- the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera (for the nonce), the New York Philharmonic, et al. -- will probably be only slightly affected. Perhaps only the Chamber Music Society will be prompted to expand into more innovative repertory, although it has done some of that already.
As for productions by Lincoln Center Inc., the central entity that serves as a landlord and periodic programmer, the likely impact on the three-week Lincoln Center Festival and Ms. Moss's Mostly Mozart Festival, Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors and Midsummer Night Swing would seem nonexistent. Robert Harth, Carnegie's executive and artistic director, said last week that he had no plans, at least for now, to expand into the summer, thus effectively ceding that season to Lincoln Center.
The real threat would seem to be on Ms. Moss's regular-season Great Performers series, which makes use of Avery Fisher Hall, Alice Tully Hall and off-campus sites like the theater at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Over the years Ms. Moss has developed an effective strategy for countering the hegemony of Carnegie and its big-ticket prestige presentations like the Vienna Philharmonic. Stern Auditorium is widely perceived to be an acoustical jewel compared with Fisher Hall, which in any case is often unavailable to Ms. Moss, given the Philharmonic's prior claim.
The two halls can be heard differently, however: Fisher sounds warmly cleaner and clearer for many kinds of music, although it is a visual disaster (those onstage acoustical carbuncles) and a psychological one (its shoe-box length), too. But Carnegie has the cachet, no doubt about it.
To compete with that cachet, Ms. Moss has borrowed from BAM's playbook, or simply reflected the evolution of audience tastes, as Zankel is now doing. She has positioned Great Performers as the innovative alternative to Carnegie's staidness. But now, with Zankel, Carnegie doesn't look so staid anymore.
Ms. Moss put a positive face on her situation, arguing -- with considerable plausibility -- that the market for everyone is ample. But she has reason for optimism for more tangible reasons, too.
One, curiously, is that whatever Lincoln Center and the Philharmonic decide to do about Fisher Hall, it's likely to be closed fairly soon for two seasons. This will free Ms. Moss from some of the more conventional and slightly faded orchestral presentations she is now compelled to present.
What has really distinguished her alternative strategy has been theatrical extensions of typical concert fare: productions like Trisha Brown's choreographed Schubert's "Winterreise" earlier this season. Zankel Hall does not have fly or wing or backstage space; it's not, in any configuration, a real theater.
Ms. Moss has John Jay and occasionally the two theaters in the Fiorello H. La Guardia High School. Should the City Opera decamp downtown, she would have access to the New York State Theater, for better or worse. And as of the fall of 2004 she will have Jazz at Lincoln Center's spaces in the new AOL Time Warner building, especially the Frederick P. Rose Theater. Tuesday's fire seems not likely to delay the opening. 
That theater grew out of an effort by Nathan Leventhal, Lincoln Center's president for 17 years, to build a midsize theater with a full-size stage for Lincoln Center and its constituents.
Churlishly the constituents shot down a carefully planned theater on Broadway at 65th Street. Cleverly Mr. Leventhal and Gordon Davis of Jazz at Lincoln Center (and, briefly, Mr. Leventhal's successor as Lincoln Center president) simply shifted the idea down to Columbus Circle. The Rose Theater is pretty much identical to the one the constituents rejected and will be fully and frequently available for rental by Ms. Moss, the Lincoln Center Festival and constituents and outsiders who choose to make use of it.
In theory of course those outsiders could include Carnegie Hall. But no need to cry for Ms. Moss. One welcomes the advent of Zankel; it should perk up our concert life considerably. But mostly because of the real estate at her disposal and her inherent theatrical instincts, Ms. Moss and her Great Performers should continue to flourish.

THE FUTURE OF FREEDOM
Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad
By Fareed Zakaria
286 pages. W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
 The triumph of democracy in Central Europe after the collapse of the Soviet empire led to the fatuous assumption that democracy would succeed everywhere else. Many intellectuals brushed aside the advantages that Central Europe had that other regions lacked: high literacy rates, a long bourgeois tradition and exposure to the Western Enlightenment. 
 Thus policymakers were not prepared for elections that helped pave the way to mass killings in the Balkans, to new dictatorships in Central Asia and to chaos in Africa. As Fareed Zakaria explains in "The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad," elections are not necessarily synonymous with constitutional liberalism: "Democracy is flourishing; liberty is not." 
Mr. Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International, defines constitutional liberalism as the "bundle of freedoms" that include the rule of law, the rights of free speech and religion and the protection of minorities. Such freedoms, he writes, require the limitation of power, although democracy can sometimes mean the accumulation of it by an electorate that is little more than a mob. An example is his native India, where Hindu politicians pursue the "rhetoric of hatred," which has led to "the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands" simply because it appeals to so many anti-Muslim voters. 
Mr. Zakaria's complex argument is particularly relevant today, as the United States is at the apex of its power in the Middle East, facing the decision of whether to democratize Iraq quickly and whether to push for change elsewhere in the region.
He provides this cautionary note: "The Arab rulers of the Middle East are autocratic, corrupt and heavy-handed. But they are still more liberal, tolerant and pluralistic than what would likely replace them. Elections in many Arab countries would produce politicians who espouse views that are closer to Osama bin Laden's than those of Jordan's liberal monarch, King Abdullah." 
Nevertheless, elections in Iraq, particularly in the Shiite areas, might show the world that the United States is bent on the Iraqis' liberation rather than on their subjugation. Elections would also pressure the Shiite regime in neighboring Iran to liberalize. But it is the circumstances of each Middle Eastern country that should dictate how far and how fast we push for democratization, and not our ideological hubris.
Elections often constitute the culmination of liberalization rather than its beginning. The United States will surely be at its best in the Middle East when it promotes the general principles of a free society, rather than when it seeks to interpret those principles too narrowly and legalistically by demanding elections when it is dangerous to do so. In a post-Saddam Hussein Middle East, Mr. Zakaria implies, our truest allies will be patience and endurance. His book, whose target is zealotry and not democracy, could not have been published at a more appropriate time.
Democracy's mixed record in producing liberty is Mr. Zakaria's theme. He writes about Karl Lueger, the rabid anti-Semite who in 1895 was elected mayor of Vienna. The unelected Habsburg emperor, Franz Joseph I, refused to honor the election, an anti-democratic measure that furthered the cause of historic liberalism rather than impeded it. As the author shows, the rise of fascism in the first half of the 20th century was inextricable from the expansion of the democratic franchise: Hitler rose to power through a free and fair democratic election.
Because social and economic conditions in much of the non-Western world now approximate those of Europe between the wars, Mr. Zakaria is able to catalog a vast array of instances in which the electorate's will led to the retrenchment of liberty. In 1994 voters in Belarus overwhelmingly elected the extreme nationalist Aleksandr Lukashenko as their president. The recent crackdown on independent news media by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was sanctioned by the electorate in opinion polls. In 1998 Venezuelans elected as their president Hugo Chavez, the angry populist and cashiered army colonel who then eviscerated the legislature and the judiciary.
And while Americans and Israelis justly despise the misrule of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, the author points out that Mr. Arafat "is the only leader in the entire Arab world who has been chosen through reasonably free elections." 
"The Future of Freedom," however, is no polemic against elections. Rather, it is a calm antidote to the fervency of those who want to force elections down the throat of every society, no matter what its particular circumstances and historical experience. As any foreign correspondent knows, there are all kinds and gradations of dictators. Saddam Hussein cannot be compared to Gen. Pervez Musharraf, whose coup in Pakistan in 1999 led to an attempt at "radical political, social, educational and economic reform" that no elected politician would have dared. Nor can Lee Kuan Yew, who wrought an economic miracle in Singapore, be compared to another dictator, Robert Mugabe, whose thuggery and incompetency have brought Zimbabwe to the brink of famine and bankruptcy. Mr. Zakaria, far from extolling dictatorship, usefully reminds us of a complicated world that cannot be depicted as a Manichean divide between democratic and authoritarian.
"It should surely puzzle these scholars and intellectuals," Mr. Zakaria writes, "that the best-consolidated democracies in Latin America and East Asia -- Chile, South Korea and Taiwan -- were for a long while ruled by military juntas. . . . In almost every case the dictatorships opened the economy slowly and partially, but this process made government more and more liberal." 
Nor did our own democracy spring from completely exalted ground. Mr. Zakaria notes that Western liberty was born of naked struggles for power. The Vatican, though itself reactionary, furthered the cause of individual liberty by competing with the power of the state so that the state lost its monopoly on ideas. There was also the dumb luck of geography: Europe's many rivers, mountains and navigable bays allowed for the growth of feisty, independent countries, in contrast to the flatlands of Asia, easily overrun and thus friendly to despotism. Earned wealth also helped the West. The rise of a bourgeoisie and private businesses weakened the state's centralizing power.
The author nowhere denies moral will as a factor in liberty but writes that people of strong moral will exist in many places that are still not liberal, often because history, geography and economic conditions have not been propitious.
As for Iraq, Mesopotamia's flat geography, so friendly to conquest, as well as its ethnic splits and absence of public opinion (at least as we know it), would not make it seem fertile ground for democracy. Nevertheless, the nation's high level of education and relatively secular tradition should give us some cause for optimism. Who knows? Iraqis may turn out to be wise in the way of Eastern Europeans, who had experienced a similar despotism.

 HIGHLIGHTS

ECONOMY CITED IN CANCELLATION -- The highly regarded Stuttgart Ballet has canceled a four-performance engagement at City Center this month, attributing slow ticket sales to the war in Iraq's economic impact on the entertainment industry in New York. The company's appearance, scheduled for April 23 through April 26, was to have ended a five-week United States tour. "The ticket sales were slower than anticipated," said Jane Herman, senior vice president and director of dance for ICM Artists, the North American agent for the company. Its tour was described as otherwise unaffected by the war because many tickets elsewhere had been sold by subscription six months to a year in advance. "It is the lack of the subscription that has caused cancellation," Ms. Herman said. The tour began on March 17 in Orange County, Calif., and will now end on April 19, when the company performs in Midland, Mich. The Stuttgart Ballet, founded in 1961 by the renowned choreographer John Cranko, performs traditional and modern ballet under the artistic directorship of Reid Anderson. Refunds for City Center performances will be given at the point of purchase, and tickets bought over the telephone will automatically be credited.

HEALTH THREAT CITED IN CANCELLATION -- The BBC Scottish Symphony has canceled a six-city tour of China next month because of fears of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, known as SARS. The orchestra said the decision was made on the advice of the World Health Organization and other health officials after consultation with the BBC's chief medical officer. The touring party of 100 was to arrive in Beijing on May 21 and finish its tour on May 30 in Guangzhou.

THE IMPACT OF SPLAT! AND POW! -- How have cartoons influenced contemporary art? That is the question addressed by "Splat Boom Pow!," opening on Saturday at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. With works by emerging and established artists, including Mel Ramos (with "Captain Midnight," left), Takashi Murakami and Andy Warhol, this exhibition chronicles three generations of visual artists who have used the images and techniques of cartoons to examine issues like the war in Vietnam, race relations and poverty. "Splat Bam Pow!" remains through June 29 and will be seen in September at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Boston.

PROTESTERS DISRUPT CONCERT -- Students and other protesters shouting antiwar slogans disrupted a concert by Riccardo Muti and La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra on Monday night in Rome. The Rome daily La Repubblica reported that about 100 protesters burst into the auditorium as the concert was to begin while hundreds more stood outside with drums and loudspeakers, chanting slogans like "Stop the war, stop the war" and carrying banners reading "No peace -- no party." The concert began after Mr. Muti told the protesters, "The musicians you see here have been touring the world since 1996 in the name of peace." The interlopers sat on the floor, listened to the first part of the concert and left.

TOULOUSE-LAUTREC IN VIENNA -- The Leopold Museum in Vienna may be best known for housing the world's largest collection of paintings by Egon Schiele and great works by Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka. But beginning tomorrow, Toulouse-Lautrec will be its star attraction. Through Aug. 31, the museum will show 350 of his drawings and posters, above, depicting life in the Montmartre quarter of Paris at the end of the 19th century.

WILDE TRIAL TRANSCRIPT -- Undiscovered for more than a century, the original stenographic transcript of the 1895 libel trial involving Oscar Wilde is going on view at the British Library in London. The account of the events that sent Wilde to Reading prison was found in a bundle of papers lent to the library by an anonymous benefactor two and a half years ago. The BBC reported that historians never knew that the transcript existed. Until now, only heavily abbreviated accounts of the trial have been available, the BBC said. Wilde brought the libel suit against the Marquess of Queensberry, who was angry that his son was having an affair with Wilde and accused him of homosexuality. Evidence of Wilde's homosexuality was brought out at the trial.

TOOLS OF DIPLOMACY -- A Paul Revere engraving of the Boston Massacre of 1770, lush portraits by John Singleton Copley and the silver coffee pot from John and Abigail Adams's presidential silver service are among the items of early American art from the State Department collection that will go on view on Saturday at the Portland Art Museum in Portland, Ore. "Becoming a Nation: Americana From theDiplomatic Reception Rooms, U.S. Department of State," assembles more than 130 examples of decorative objects created by artists and artisans. After its national premiere in Portland, the exhibition is to travel for two years, stopping in Athens, Ga.; Fresno, Calif.; Palm Beach, Fla.; Cincinnati; Huntsville, Ala.; Sioux City, Iowa; and Portland, Me.

FOOTNOTES -- With 100 screenings, discussions and festivities, the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival begins today in Durham, N.C. The six-year-old event, running through Sunday, will show 65 films in competition. The opening night presentation will be the world premiere of "Seabiscuit." The festival's Career Award will go to Charles E. Guggenheim, the Academy Award-winning maker of films like "A Time for Justice" and "RFK Remembered," who died in October.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Cuts Worldwide Forecast To a 3.2% Expansion This Year 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
The world economy will grow 3.2 percent this year, hindered by concerns over war and terrorism that may also limit the pace of expansion in 2004 and beyond, the International Monetary Fund said today.
 The forecast contrasts with the 3.7 percent growth predicted in September. 
 The world economy grew 3 percent in 2002 and 2.3 percent a year earlier, the I.M.F. said in its World Economic Outlook, its most comprehensive look at global trends.
Increased oil prices before the United States-led war to topple Saddam Hussein contributed to the revision, as did fallout from a three-year decline in stock prices, the fund said. United States success in Iraq will not undo all the harm from the terrorist attacks 19 months ago on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
"Perceptions of the global security situation may not return to pre-Sept. 11 levels for decades to come, implying higher costs of insurance, weaker confidence, higher trade costs and a slower pace of global economic integration," Kenneth Rogoff, the fund's chief economist, said. He noted a "partial rollback in the peace dividend of the 1990's."
The fund urged central banks to consider further interest rate cuts to ensure growth. It said deflation might be a threat, especially in Japan, and central banks should let the public know what is an acceptable rate of increase in consumer prices.
Mr. Rogoff described this year's expected growth as tepid and said normal growth would resume "sometime during the first half of 2004."
Concerns about terrorism and war will cut global growth in coming years by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.75 percent a year from a normal 4 percent, Mr. Rogoff said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Some risks are more manageable than others. Can we design markets to change that?

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is an economics professor and dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. E-mail: hal@sims.berkeley.edu.

 BODY:
UNEMPLOYMENT is up. Housing sales are weakening. Oil prices continue to fluctuate, and the stock market remains volatile. There's no doubt we live in risky times, yet our tools for managing risk are limited.
 We can do something about the stock market: those with low tolerance for risk can put their money in investments with more stable returns. There are also ways to manage the risk from oil-price fluctuations: buy or sell oil futures to lock in a particular price. 
 But what about unemployment risk or housing price risk? There are financial markets that help us manage fluctuations in corporate profitability and commodity prices. But there are no markets to help manage risks from fluctuations in labor markets and housing markets, even though these have a much bigger impact on most peoples' financial security.
How could we design markets to help manage such risks?
This challenging problem is examined in Robert J. Shiller's book "The New Financial Order" (Princeton University Press, 2003).
Mr. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale, is well known for his previous book "Irrational Exuberance," which forecast the demise of the 1990's bull market. In his new book, Mr. Shiller turns to the role of financial institutions in managing risk.
Why is it that I can buy insurance against my house burning down, but not against my house price declining? One difficulty comes from what economists call moral hazard. Suppose I were able to buy "house price insurance." Once I had it, why should I bother to repaint, or fix that hole in the roof?
True, the peeling paint and leaky roof would lower the resale value -- but, hey, I'm insured, why should I care?
One solution to this sort of moral hazard is to base housing insurance on something outside a homeowner's control, like an index of house prices in that ZIP code. This way homeowners can be insured against fluctuations in local prices, but still have incentives to invest in keeping their own house marketable.
Such insurance has been offered, as an experiment, in certain neighborhoods in Chicago and Syracuse. Mr. Shiller, by the way, does not confine himself to ivory tower speculations. He has founded a company with his colleague, Allan Weiss, to offer tools to manage home price risk.
Similar ideas can be used in labor markets. One could sell financial securities linked to average compensation in various occupations. If you wanted to go to dental school, but were worried about the market for dentists when you graduated, you could buy "dentist income insurance," tied to average wages in this profession. Such insurance would protect you against the risk of labor market fluctuations, but still give you an incentive to work hard at your chosen occupation.
Moving from micro to macro risks, Mr. Shiller also offers novel ideas for markets in risks in a given country. Suppose you could buy or sell a security linked to a country's gross domestic product. Now you can buy shares only in stock issued by companies based in particular countries, but stock market growth is only loosely related to G.D.P. growth. Such "macro markets" could be an attractive way of managing risk and financing investment.
This year exports from Argentina are booming, driven by a cheap peso; perhaps this export growth will pull the country out of its three-year slump. Those who think so could buy shares of future G.D.P. in Argentina. Argentine businesses that produce exports could, in turn, sell shares tied to future G.D.P. to raise money for needed investments.
A particularly intriguing section of the book deals with risk sharing in Social Security programs. The current arrangement in most countries offers retirees monthly payments based on lifetime income, age at retirement and the inflation rate; these payments, in turn, come from a payroll tax on those still employed. Retirees get a fixed, inflation-adjusted payment, while all the risk from fluctuations in nominal income is borne by workers.
Suppose that, instead of receiving a fixed amount taken from workers' paychecks, Social Security recipients received a fixed share of those paychecks, where the share was determined by the fraction of the population that was retired. (This is now about 11 percent.)
The risk of fluctuations in nominal labor income would then be shared between workers and retirees. Those who preferred not to bear such risks, whether they were retired or working, could sell off some of that risk using the other markets Mr. Shiller describes.
These are intriguing ideas. They are only partly fleshed out in the book, but Mr. Shiller and his colleagues have investigated these ideas in greater depth in their academic work, some of which is available at www.newfinancialorder.com.
But would these markets really work? Housing equity insurance sounds feasible. Intergenerational risk sharing for Social Security also appears attractive; we would certainly be in a much better position today if the system had been set up in that manner. But Mr. Shiller's proposal faces the same problem all Social Security reforms face: How do we get from here to there?
Occupation insurance seems problematic. It's easy enough to decide the definition of a "dentist," but what, exactly is an "auto worker"? The Department of Labor has been trying to standardize occupational titles for a long time, but they change so rapidly that it's a losing battle. Think about trying to buy occupation insurance for "webmasters" a few years ago, or for "nanotechnician" a few years from now.
If such problems could be solved, occupation insurance would no doubt be a popular wedding present: "Good luck in your marriage to that economist, but here's some occupation insurance, just in case."
It is said that behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in-law. If so, there could be quite a large market for such securities.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Agency managers may look in vain for les bons temps at this year's conference in New Orleans.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE first management conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies to be held in New Orleans is shaping up as neither big nor easy, mostly because of a dearth of les bons temps.
 Amid war anxieties, the worst ad downturn in decades, and even weather woes, the attendance for the conference, which began yesterday afternoon, is being estimated at the lowest level ever. About 250 to 260 people are attending the 2003 Management Conference, as the 85th annual meeting of the association is formally called, compared with the 293 who came for the conference last year and the 450 people who attended during the boom year of 2000. 
 "We're still trying to figure out the most appropriate way to open the meeting, but we won't be playing 'Happy Days Are Here Again,' " said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association, which is based in New York. 
Those agency executives who do not let the economy or the war dissuade them from attending the conference, which continues through tomorrow, will hear presentations that are to be concentrated on two subjects -- yes, the economy and the war.
J. Walker Smith, president at Yankelovich, the research company, will describe the results of a survey of consumers and the economy conducted for the association, known as the Four A's. There will be an address by Mel Karmazin, president and chief operating officer at Viacom, the media giant whose revenue and profit are particularly reliant on advertising sales.
And three talking heads from the CBS News division of Viacom -- Ed Bradley, Bob Schieffer and Hannah Storm -- are scheduled to discuss Iraq and other topics in a panel moderated by Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News.
"Obviously, the war is impacting us, but to what degree we can't gauge yet," said Ken Kaess, president and chief executive at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, who is the 2002-3 chairman of the association. "From what we can see, most advertisers are staying the course."
Though less advertising was canceled or postponed at the start of the attack on Iraq than had been expected, $77 million in ad revenue was lost by American media in the first week of the war, according to estimates by CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that monitors the major media.
"If you look around, there are people succeeding in this environment," Mr. Kaess said in an interview before the conference began.
"The world is different now, and we'll have to adapt to it being different," he added. 
At a business session that opened the conference, Mr. Kaess was elected to a second term as chairman, serving through 2004. He agreed to stay on another year because the executive who was supposed to succeed him, James R. Heekin, the vice chairman for 2002-3, no longer has a job and was thus ineligible to serve. As part of a management shake-up in February at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, Mr. Heekin was dismissed as chairman and chief executive of the largest Interpublic unit, the McCann-Erickson World Group.
Ron Berger, chief executive and co-chief creative officer at Euro RSCG MVBMS Partners in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, was elected the 2003-4 vice chairman. That places him in line to succeed Mr. Kaess as chairman for 2004-5.
Though Mr. Kaess will be the first chairman to serve two consecutive years, he will not be the last. At the business session, the members of the Four A's also approved changes to the constitution and bylaws that will double the term of the chairman or chairwoman and the other top officers to two years, effective with the election for 2004-5.
"All of our chairmen found that one year was not enough to make progress on their agendas," Mr. Drake said. "By the time they get rolling, they get replaced."
Mr. Kaess said he would use the second year being added to his term to continue his focus on demonstrating the value of advertising on sales.
"The issue of the value of what we do is still important," Mr. Kaess said, particularly when "we say webring value to clients as brand builders and then we close our own brands." His reference was to the shuttering of agencies with familiar names like Ammirati & Puris, N. W. Ayer, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Lintas in recent rounds of consolidations.
Those closings are, needless to say, another reason there are usually fewer attendees at each management conference than the one before.

HEADLINE: S.& P. Cuts Ratings for Altria and Kraft 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The credit ratings of the Altria Group, along with those of its Philip Morris USA and Kraft Foods units, were lowered yesterday by Standard & Poor's, which cited increased risk of litigation for tobacco companies.
 Philip Morris has said it may seek bankruptcy protection unless a $12 billion deposit required for it to appeal a $10.1 billion judgment in Illinois is lowered. 
Philip Morris and the lawyer for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are scheduled to resume talks today. 
 Ratings on $23.3 billion in debt may be cut to a level below investment grade unless progress is seen in the request to lower the requirement, Standard & Poor's said. Judge Nicholas Byron of the Third Circuit in Illinois, who awarded the judgment and is hearing a Philip Morris request to reduce the deposit, indicated on Tuesday that the company might not have to post the entire amount.
"While Altria is a great company that enjoys incredible margins, it will be a constant target for litigation," said Marvin Roffman, president of Roffman Miller Associates, which manages $170 million and owns Altria shares. "It's something that will go on for a long time."
Corporate credit ratings on Altria and Philip Morris Capital were dropped two levels, to BBB+ from A, or three grades above junk bond status. The debt has been rated A since at least 1985. Kraft Foods was dropped to A- from A by Standard & Poor's.
Standard & Poor's raised concern that Philip Morris might seek bankruptcy protection when it said two weeks ago that the ratings might be reduced. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings lowered the credit ratings on the companies last week.
Altria gained 30 cents, to close at $30.30. Kraft, which trades separately, gained 4 cents, to $29.30.

HEADLINE: Proposal on Pension Conversion Attacked 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
Proposed regulations to govern the way companies change to a controversial type of pension plan were assailed yesterday both by workers and corporate officials at a hearing by the Treasury Department.
 Employees said the proposals would not prevent companies from reneging on pension promises and stripping workers of benefits they had been led to expect. 
 Company representatives found another fault, saying the rules failed to give employers enough flexibility to change their compensation practices as the economic climate changes. A number of companies, including R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holding, also said that if the regulations were adopted as written, pension-plan changes that they completed years ago would be illegal. 
The regulations under discussion try to address conversions of traditional pension plans to what are called cash-balance plans. Cash-balance pensions are hybrids that combine some features of pensions, which provide a defined benefit at retirement, with other features of 401(k) retirement plans. The rules were drafted after an outcry by older employees who said their benefits shrank drastically after their companies made such conversions.
In a traditional pension, workers build up the biggest part of their benefit shortly before they retire. Employees in cash-balance plans build their benefits at a steadier rate.
Kathy Cissna, director of pension benefits for R. J. Reynolds, testified that her company's pension plan would fall into a legal twilight zone under the new rules. The regulations would "push plan design into two limited categories," neither of which applies to the Reynolds design, she said. The company converted in 1993 to a type of hybrid that is not addressed by the proposed regulations.
Ms. Cissna said the rules would cause "extreme disruption" to many companies whose pension plans do not adhere to the standards, citing a study by the Watson Wyatt consulting firm that said about two-thirds of pension plans sponsored by the 100 largest American corporations would fail to comply. Watson Wyatt, which helps companies set up and change pension plans, also testified.
Representative George Miller, one of three legislators to speak on behalf of employees, called on the Treasury to scrap the regulations and replace them with rules that would permit employees going through conversions simply to calculate whether they would be best served by their companies' old plan or the new one, and choose one or the other. He cited a General Accounting Office finding that some workers could lose half their benefits in a cash-balance pension conversion.
The Treasury declined to comment on the testimony, which is to continue today. A spokeswoman said that the Treasury was "carefully considering" all public comments and would take them into account as it prepares the final rules. The department can either withdraw all or part of the rules, or revise and reissue them. If revisions are made, more public comment will then be solicited.
Even before the hearings began, the Bush administration took steps to defuse some of the tension over the rules. On Monday, it scrapped one part of the package, saying it would have undermined separate, existing pension rules that are designed to keep executives from turning pension plans into tax shelters. 
The Treasury said it would rewrite that measure in a way that did not conflict with existing practices. 
In addition, a separate regulation, requiring companies to notify employees clearly of pension-plan reductions, went into effect on Tuesday. In the past, some companies' communications were so impenetrable that the workers had no idea what was going on.
Cash-balance pensions captured the spotlight in 1999 after employees at I.B.M. discovered that a conversion by that company was reducing employees' benefits by tens of thousands of dollars in some cases. The harshest effects befell workers with the most seniority. An age-discrimination lawsuit followed, along with a political uproar.
The Internal Revenue Service, one of three agencies that regulate pension plans, has stopped approving cash-balance conversions while experts sort out the legal issues. The new regulations, issued in December, are the Bush administration's proposal to resolve the age-discrimination issue.

HEADLINE: Pataki Calls for Security Plan To Help Ease Canada Trade 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 9 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and Premier Ernie Eves of Ontario signed an agreement today urging their national governments to create a common North American security perimeter to guarantee the free flow of goods across the border.
 A common North American perimeter could assure that goods and people are checked before they come to North America or at entrance points in North America. That, Mr. Pataki said, would "enhance our security while at the same time allowing that we not build walls between Ontario and New York, and Canada and the United States." 
 Security between the countries, the world's largest trading partners, has been a topic of concern since measures adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks threatened to halt the normally steady movement of goods across the 5,500-mile border.
Each day $1.3 billion worth of goods move across the border, and Ontario Province and New York State share $16 billion in trade annually.
Canadian and United States officials have already introduced some programs to speed the movement of goods, including prescreening programs for companies that regularly ship goods across the border. New York has posted 100 additional police officers at the border to help inspect incoming goods, Mr. Pataki said. 
Canada has increased the number of officers at the border, and, after the war in Iraq began, started checking trucks as they leave the country. 
The two men also proposed using more high-tech devices at the border like magnetic resonance imaging systems that can scan entire trucks.
"Neither Ontario nor New York can afford the economic consequences of building a wall between our two great nations," said Mr. Eves, who has sought to distance himself from the government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien and its refusal to take a strong position on the Iraq war.
Recently, there have been concerns that Canada's lack of support for the war could hurt the countries' economic ties. Mr. Pataki said they would remain strong, despite some tensions. He mentioned the booing of a youth hockey team from the United States during a visit to Montreal.

HEADLINE: Energy Matters Return to Fore On Capitol Hill 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
Two years ago, with California suffering from rolling blackouts and oil prices sinking, energy policy was a centerpiece of the Bush administration's domestic agenda. Then the terror attacks intervened and momentum for a wide-ranging new energy program was lost.
 Now the House and Senate are again moving ahead on comprehensive energy measures that sponsors say are needed steps toward stability in the volatile oil and power industries. But critics say they are stuffed with special-interest aid and tax breaks for big energy companies and fail to recognize a changed energy and economic climate. One senior House Democratic aide said the House measure, with its focus on oil and gas production, was the equivalent of wearing 1970's fashions in the 21st century. 
 Backers dismiss the criticism as short-sighted and say new legislation is needed now. "I am not willing to wait for a crisis," said Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the House Energy Committee, one of four House panels involved in the bill. "We ought to have stable markets in energy so we can have stable markets in our economy as well." He estimated the measure could create 700,000 jobs.
Representative Nick J. Rahall II of West Virginia, the senior Democrat on the House Resources Committee, countered that the bills would benefit big business, not consumers. "There is little in the way of relief for Americans at the gas pump in this bill," Mr. Rahall said. "Adding insult to injury, the legislation would gouge them even further through a whole host of taxpayer subsidies to energy producers. This is misguided relief."
As the House prepares to adopt its version of the energy bill as early as Thursday, much of the attention will be focused on disputed high-profile issues like Arctic oil drilling, offshore exploration bans and gasoline additives. But the measure also includes $18.7 billion in tax breaks that opponents of the bill say are geared mainly to oil and gas companies and do little to promote conservation or development of new energy technologies.
"This is really a backward-looking energy bill," said Anna Aurilio, legislative director of the Public Interest Research Group.
Opponents object to numerous parts in the House bill. Among them is a provision that critics say amounts to a $2 billion subsidy for big utilities by allowing them to depreciate the cost of transmission systems more quickly. The critics object to other proposals they say would give two Western coal companies an advantage in mining federal lands, provide tax advantages for power plants that burn garbage, and jeopardize the health benefits of retired mine workers.
They also say relief from royalties for oil and gas drilling on federal land is outdated, because the proposals were drafted two years ago, when oil prices were expected to go as low as $21 a barrel. Today the price was $28.85.
"Most of the incentives were designed at a time when the prices were low and the low prices were used as justification," said John Buckley, chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee. "Now prices are high and the high prices are used as the justification."
Authors of the bill say that the tax benefits are half of what was proposed two years ago. And industry representatives said that the royalty relief was necessary to spur domestic production by making it economical to drill marginal wells and attract the capital necessary for costly exploration projects. Most of the breaks also expire within two to four years, preventing them from being abused, a top industry lobbyist said.
"If you look at the nature of the domestic industry, you would have to conclude that these things make sense," said the lobbyist, Lee Fuller, vice president for government relations at the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
Mr. Tauzin, noting some bipartisan support for the energy plan in committees, expects to draw significant Democratic votes for his measure, though Democrats are also pressing to offer major amendments to the bill, including one to revise a proposed restructuring of electricity regulation. In the Senate, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee was drawing up its own, similar bill in hopes of completing it by the end of the month.
The outlook for reconciling them is uncertain, because the House version would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling while Senate Republicans have indicated they would leave that explosive issue out of their bill. Last month senators rejected Arctic drilling as part of their budget. 
House Republicans plan to press ahead. "The Senate hasn't seen our best offer yet," Mr. Tauzin said.
Opponents of oil drilling are also fighting moves in both the House and Senate to allow the federal government to conduct an "inventory" of national energy resources, including under waters now off limits to exploration. Lawmakers from coastal states who oppose drilling are worried that the resource review could lead to exploratory drilling in protected areas and increase pressure to open them to production.
House Democrats, backed by the United Mine Workers of America, are also fighting a provision that they say could allow coal companies to escape responsibility for health benefits of future retirees by prepaying some of their health costs into a benefit fund.
Cecil E. Roberts, the union president, said it would be difficult to forecast future health costs, and he accused authors of the measure of trying to dismantle benefits for those "who worked hard all their lives to provide the nation's energy needs."
But a spokesman for Representative Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican who sponsored the measure, said that the intent was to give some flexibility to coal companies that have run into trouble selling some of their subsidiary operations because of the benefits issue. The spokesman added that the workers would be fully protected.

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The rumor bounced all over town last month: Diana Lam, the new deputy chancellor with the onerous job of overhauling instruction in New York City's 1,200 schools, had resigned.
 To all who asked, the Education Department denied that Ms. Lam was going anywhere -- yet her colleagues there were as intrigued by the rumor as people who had heard it on the street. Even they seemed not to know the mind of Ms. Lam, a career educator who has hopscotched from one troubled school system to the next and has left legions of critics in her wake. 
 Chancellor Joel I. Klein's choice of Ms. Lam as his deputy for teaching and learning struck some educators as unwise, because she had led only school systems -- Chelsea, Mass.; Dubuque, Iowa; San Antonio; Providence, R.I. -- that were tiny compared with New York's, with mixed results to boot. She had a reputation for pushing through major changes without building consensus, then leaving town when the protest grew deafening. So the rumors of her departure were not altogether shocking. 
Asked about them the other day, while her driver was taking her to a conference in Westchester County, Ms. Lam smiled and shrugged.
"I'm still here," she said in her wispy voice, a striking counterpart to her steely personality. "I mean, I just bought an apartment. I have no plans to leave."
And is she happy?
"Yeah, I am, I am," she said. "It's an adjustment. This position is very different than being superintendent."
Then she turned away, smile widening as she realized the car had reached its destination, and she could wriggle away from the subject: "Are we here already?" 
In the seven months since she came to New York from Providence, Ms. Lam, 55, has largely avoided the public eye, even while initiating some of the biggest changes the school system has seen in decades.
She has already caused a stir: many educators, community leaders and parents find her prickly and unconcerned with their opinions, as do federal and state education officials.
Ms. Lam has also come under attack for her choice of Month by Month Phonics, a little-known program with scant research backing it, to teach rudimentary reading skills, and Everyday Mathematics, which encourages untraditional -- some say bewildering -- methods of problem-solving.
Yet some who have watched Ms. Lam say she is smart and courageous, especially for quickly developing plans for a citywide reading and mathematics curriculum.
"She needs to be given credit for moving us in a sensible direction in a very short period of time," said Eva S. Moskowitz, chairwoman of the City Council's Education Committee and a vocal critic of the Education Department under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mr. Klein. "There were others who were here for years and years and couldn't manage to do that."
Or, as Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a Washington group that works as an advocate for poor children, put it: "Diana Lam is good for New York, because nicey-nice people never get anything done."
Ms. Lam is quite used to getting things done: as a 3-year-old in Lima, Peru, she said, she taught herself to read the newspapers that her father, a Chinese truck driver, brought home. Though she perfected English at an early age, her thick accent gives away her Latin American roots. Neither her father nor her mother, a Peruvian seamstress, was educated beyond elementary school. She debated social policy in the lunchroom of her Catholic school and won a scholarship to the College of St. Benedict in Minnesota, where she majored in sociology and aspired to be an economist.
She married a Minnesotan, Peter Plattes, and scrapped her dream of attending graduate school in Europe, staying in St. Cloud with him for a few years and teaching middle school. The couple taught children in a Peruvian mining camp in the early 70's, then moved to Boston, which Ms. Lam said she chose because its Roman Catholic cardinal had sent money to the school she attended in Lima.
Over 18 years, Ms. Lam rose from a bilingual teacher in Framingham to a zone superintendent in Boston, responsible for 23 schools and 10,000 students. Her husband, a high school teacher, became a stay-at-home father, caring for their children, Sasha and Tamara.
She had been superintendent of the beleaguered schools in Chelsea, Mass., for only two years when she quit in 1991 to run for mayor of Boston -- a gutsy move in a city whose leaders have virtually all been men of Irish or Italian descent. But her campaign ended three days after it began, when it was revealed that she had filed late tax returns.
Why did she veer into politics?
"It appealed to me because at that time, City Hall was not doing enough for education," Ms. Lam said.
She stirred more controversy in Dubuque, where she was superintendent for two years, and in San Antonio, where she was hired on a split vote by the school board and was forced out after four years, taking an $800,000 buyout.
In both San Antonio and Providence, where she spent three years, test scores generally rose during her tenure but were still low when she left. Her most strident enemies in both cities were the teachers' unions, which complained that she forced too much change too quickly and did not listen to them. Her relationship with Randi Weingarten, president of New York's teachers' union, is chilly.
In New York -- where the $250,000 salary that Ms. Lam negotiated makes her the highest-paid city employee besides Chancellor Klein, who earns the same amount -- Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Klein clearly want to keep Ms. Lam focused on instruction while they handle the politics. They rarely put her on the phone with reporters or have her speak at news conferences or hearings.
When she does appear in public, Ms. Lam's body language -- her arms are often crossed, her chin jutted out -- and brusque manner sometimes put people off.
"The beauty of this position is that as a deputy, Diana can stay totally focused on instructional change and let the chancellor and mayor's office deal with a lot of the other dynamics she had to deal with in past jobs," said Dennis M. Walcott, the deputy mayor in charge of education.
Others suspect that Ms. Lam's limited role is frustrating her.
"To be muzzled would not be very satisfying to her, because she seems like such a strong-minded person," one education official said.
Not that Ms. Lam's lack of spotlight has stopped people from tarring her. In particular, her choice of Month by Month Phonics has galled many experts, who say the program does not have nearly enough structure.
They also say that the overall reading curriculum -- which will provide each classroom with a library of several hundred books and require students to read and write on their own or in small groups -- is too challenging for New York's teachers, many of whom lack experience and grapple with constant behavior problems.
Ms. Lam has compromised by adding a second, more comprehensive phonics program developed by Voyager Expanded Learning, a Texas company. But she flatly rejects the criticism that teachers and students are not up for the overall curriculum she has chosen.
"How I have heard it as part of the debate is, 'Well, we are looking for teacher-proof materials,' " Ms. Lam said. "I don't believe in teacher-proof materials. If a teacher is not a critical thinker, how can we expect our kids to be critical thinkers?"
Ms. Lam said she took the job in New York because she relished challenges and change. Her son, 25 and perhaps weary of controversy, was more wary.
"My son, in his very abrupt way, says, 'If you're going to New York, it's O.K., but don't change things,' " she recalled, laughing. "It's painful on them, the ripple effect and how it impacts our life."
Some educators give Ms. Lam another six months to a year before she ships out of New York, either as the fall guy in a reform plan gone amok or because she will be restless. When asked if she would like to stay in her job over the long term, Ms. Lam was vague.
"It's certainly a theory that there are two kinds of tenure for school administrators -- those that jump-start the system, that do the kind of very difficult and labor-intensive work, and those other educational leaders that can then come and build upon the jump-start," she said. "I'm hoping that in New York we can do both."

HEADLINE: Audit Finds State Agency Mishandled Some Post-9/11 Grants 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The New York State agency overseeing a program of federal grants to businesses hurt by the World Trade Center attack paid too much or too little to several companies, a federal audit has found.
 The agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, made a small number of faulty payments, for relatively small sums, the audit found. But the agency paid millions of dollars to companies without getting details on how they had calculated their losses, a flaw that persisted despite a preliminary audit that flagged the problems. 
 Among the problems the audit found was the fact that the agency had failed to install appropriate administrative controls, including measures to ensure that businesses could not apply for and receive the same grant twice. 
The deficiencies in Empire State Development's procedures were detailed in a federal report released two weeks ago by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department was designated by Congress to oversee $2.7 billion in Community Development Block Grants to businesses and individuals in Lower Manhattan as part of the $21 billion in federal aid pledged to New York City after the 9/11 attack.
Overall, the audit report said, Empire State Development has disbursed the disaster-relief money quickly and in accordance with federal rules, and its financial system "is capable of safeguarding the funds." And the inspector general acknowledged that Empire State Development was under pressure to quickly plan and put in place a system to aid companies that were in danger of going out of business.
But the report notes that the state agency failed to put into effect several changes it had promised to make after a preliminary audit report released last May, including a requirement for grant applicants to provide details on how their economic losses were determined.
Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of Empire State Development, said yesterday that the agency believed the results of the audit showed a successful grant program had been put in place.
"There are always some findings in any audit," Mr. Gargano said. "We'll do whatever we have to do to address the issues that were outlined for improvement." He noted that both its initial procedures and the revised May regulations were approved by the Housing and Urban Development staff, and that any company submitting false estimates of its losses was subject to prosecution for fraud.
The audit focused on two of the largest 9/11-related programs overseen by the agency: the $481 million World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program and a $155 million Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant Program.
The Business Recovery and Small Firm Attraction programs are designed to compensate small companies -- defined as those with fewer than 500 employees -- that suffered physical damage, were shut or lost business after the attack on the trade center, or to attract companies to the area or keep them there.
By the middle of March, grants totaling $580 million had been approved under the two programs for more than 15,000 small companies. The audit raises significant questions about whether the money is going where it was intended, and makes clear that this is not the first time the questions have been raised.
Nearly a year ago, the inspector general warned Empire State Development that it should begin requiring companies to verify the losses they claimed after 9/11. As a result, the agency changed its application forms to include a request for details on losses.
But the audit found that more than half of the applications sampled -- including many turned in after the new forms were in use -- did not include details on how a company calculated its losses.
"As a result," the audit report said, "we cannot be assured that the Empire State Development Corporation is obtaining the details from applicants to support the amounts of their estimated economic losses."
The audit also found instances in which Empire State Development incorrectly calculated grants, most often resulting in an overpayment to companies. The inspector general estimated that in approving the first 10,000 grant applications, the agency made net overpayments of more than $1 million.

HEADLINE: FleetBoston, Rocked by Bad Loans, SeeksStability as a Consumer Bank 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Charles K. Gifford, chief executive of FleetBoston, is struggling to overcome his bank's past.
 Mr. Gifford, 60, has spent tens of millions of dollars since he took control at the end of 2001 trying to revive the long-neglected consumer business at Fleet, the nation's seventh-largest bank. He has hired 500 tellers and added 26 branches and 126 automated teller machines. Fleet's deposits are now rising at rates competitive with other big banks, which have been aggressively marketing their checking and savings accounts to consumers for some time. 
 But his progress has been overshadowed quarter after quarter by unexpected write-downs and losses in other businesses where he has been desperately trying to scale back. 
All told, the bank has taken more than $1 billion in charges related to losses in Argentina since the government defaulted on its debt in late 2001. Last quarter, Fleet had to bolster reserves against risky corporate loans and write off loans to bankrupt entities like Enron, United Airlines and a division of TXU, an energy services company.
Mr. Gifford said in a recent interview that the first-quarter results, to be announced on Monday, would be in line with estimates. But if he is unable to string together enough convincing signs of stability, analysts say, Mr. Gifford could wind up in the awkwardly familiar situation of having to look for a merger partner after his company has failed to produce the expected results. 
When Mr. Gifford was chief executive of BankBoston in the late 1990's, the company was stung by a series of losses in Latin America. He had spent 33 years at BankBoston, whose charter dates back to 1784, and insisted in 1999 that he felt no pressure to make a deal. But within weeks, he relented and agreed to a merger with Fleet Financial, a much scrappier institution with headquarters just across the street.
At the time of the merger, Fleet was led by Terrence Murray, who built the company from a tiny Rhode Island bank into one of the nation's largest financial institutions, through more than 50 bank mergers over two decades.
Defying skeptics who wondered if Mr. Murray would ever retire, Mr. Gifford succeeded him at the end of 2001. Whether Mr. Gifford will again defy skeptics is the question. Fleet's stock has fallen 24.6 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 17.8 percent decline in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Banks Index. 
"If Fleet continues to deliver results similar to last year, their ability to stay independent will be greatly reduced," said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Portland, Me.
With the economy still weak, many analysts are expecting Fleet, in line with other big banks, to lower its profit forecast for the year on Monday, from the $2.50 a share that the company predicted just three months ago.
"I do not see how they do $2.50 this year," said Nancy Bush, an independent analyst with NAB Research. "There's just not enough growth."
Mr. Gifford told analysts in August that if Fleet's results did not improve, he would reconsider his strategy. Many took that to mean he would consider a sale or merger.
The most likely candidate, bankers say, is another giant institution known for deal-making: Citigroup, whose chairman, Sanford I. Weill, met with Mr. Murray two years ago.
Still, in recent interviews, Mr. Gifford said he expected Fleet would go it alone. "It is not our intention to sell the company," he said.
In fact, Mr. Gifford predicted that once the economy recovers, Fleet would be making acquisitions, possibly in the consumer-banking business, where deposits have risen 10 percent in the last year.
"This is as uncertain an economic environment as I've ever seen," he said, adding that Fleet's stock would also have to strengthen before the company could do deals. Unlike Mr. Murray, who combined back offices of many banks to cut costs, Mr. Gifford says the new Fleet will also focus on revenue growth.
Terrence Laughlin, director of corporate strategy at the bank, said that it would probably look for acquisitions "in contiguous geographic areas," citing Fleet's purchase of Summit Bancorp of New Jersey in 2001. Fleet has lost some Summit customers by refusing to pay top rates on low-margin products like certificates of deposit, but has been selling more mutual funds and credit cards to these customers.
The overall weakness in the financial markets has dragged down competitors, as well as Fleet. Most big banks are still posting poor results from businesses tied to the capital markets, like lending or private equity investments. Those areas account for nearly half of Fleet's profits.
"It's a difficult environment for all banks," said Steven Wharton, a stock analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns Fleet shares.
Thomas Finucane, a banking analyst at State Street Research, said that only some of Fleet's problems are Mr. Gifford's doing.
On Mr. Gifford's watch, at the peak of the Internet boom, BankBoston acquired Robertson Stephens, an investment bank specializing in technology companies. But he could not have anticipated the problems in Argentina, Mr. Finucane said. The old Fleet, under Mr. Murray, expanded more rapidly in corporate lending than BankBoston did.
Fleet has been pulling back from these money-losing businesses. The bank closed Robertson Stephens, and reduced by 14 percent the amount of corporate loans on its books. It has cut its exposure to Argentina and private equity investments.
"Chad has done a decent job given the cards dealt him," said Mr. Finucane, using Mr. Gifford's nickname.
In a nod to the weak performance, Fleet said Mr. Gifford and other top executives would forgo bonuses for 2002. Mr. Gifford, who received a bonus of $2.25 million in 2001, still made a total of $1.27 million last year, in addition to getting option grants worth an estimated $1.2 million.
Some investors remain bitter over the bank's decision in 2001 to increase Mr. Murray's retirement package to an estimated $5.8 million annually from $2.7 million. Mr. Murray said the package was based on what chief executives at other large banks were offered at the time.
In his time as chief executive, Mr. Gifford has emphasized consumer banking, a bright spot for the industry in the last few years, though one some fear may be losing its bloom.
Fleet has had to overcome a poor reputation among consumers. A survey released three years ago by Consumer Reports gave Fleet the second-lowest overall rating. The magazine has not done a similar study since, although Fleet says other surveys show it registering a 30 percent improvement in its ratings.
As other banks are cutting costs, Fleet is spending heavily to improve its performance.
Last year, it announced plans to invest about $100 million over two years adding tellers and remodeling branches, among other improvements. It also wooed a top consumer strategist from Wells Fargo, Lynn Pike, to oversee its 1,500 branches.
Later this month, Fleet will unveil a $70 million advertising campaign focused, in part, on its personal financial services division.
There are some indications that Fleet's effort is paying off, with checking account sales up 4 percent last year and profits for the consumer businesses over all up 7 percent, adjusted to exclude one-time gains in 2001.
But some analysts are skeptical that Fleet can strengthen earnings quickly enough in this area, which accounts for an estimated 40 percent of its profits.
"They may be able to stop losing market share, but to grow very fast will be difficult," Mr. Wharton said. The bank already has a dominant share in many of the states in which it has branches, he said.
Mr. Finucane, speaking of Fleet's branches, said, "Their deposits are up, but so are every bank's."
In chasing consumer financial services, Mr. Gifford is copying a strategy successfully adopted by two other large banks -- Bank of America and First Union, now known as Wachovia.
Both banks turned to the consumer business a few years ago after stumbling, much as Fleet has, following big mergers, said H. Jay Sarles, a Fleet vice chairman. These banks' stocks have been among the industry's strongest performers.
Some analysts wonder if Fleet is simply too late to that strategy.
"Over the years the banking industry has gotten into trouble when everyone is chasing the business to be in," Mr. Cassidy said. "That is retail banking today. What happens when the pie stops expanding?"
Particularly noteworthy is the rapid growth in home equity lending at Fleet. Such loans rose 63 percent last year, but could lose their consumer appeal when interest rates rise. 
A stronger stock market could also cause people to return there, and shift investments away from savings and checking accounts.
If Fleet's deposit growth slows, Mr. Gifford said, he hopes he can entice customers to buy mutual funds or open brokerage accounts.
Despite the slump in the stock market, Fleet's Quick & Reilly division hired more brokers, ending last year with 890, compared with 600 just two years earlier.
Perhaps the most important wild card remains South America. Fleet's businesses in Argentina, Brazil and neighboring countries account for less than 5 percent of revenues. Fleet's business, which depends on government policy, worries investors, the bank's executives concede.
"Not only do we have the problems that hit all banks, but we have Latin America on top of it," said Mr. Murray, who is still on the board.
Ms. Bush, the independent research analyst, said of the Latin American investments: "That business, which dominated BankBoston's stock performance, has come to dominate Fleet's as well. It's a bottomless pit."
The Argentine Supreme Court ruled last month that it was unconstitutional for the government to force conversion of bank dollar deposits into pesos at a fixed rate, and that decision could make it more expensive for Fleet to pay its depositors.
The cost to Fleet could be $300 million, or possibly nothing, if the government agrees to assume the losses, analysts said. But Fleet's stock fell nearly 10 percent in the days after the decision, which reminded investors that Argentina's unstable political situation made the bank's losses there hard to predict.
Fleet's stock has since rebounded, and its shares are up 3 percent this year, partly on takeover speculation.
Oddly enough, some bankers said the uncertainty of Fleet's losses in the region could prove to be Mr. Gifford's best defense against an unwanted merger, since no acquirer would want to take on the risk.
"It's Chad's poison pill," one banker said.

HEADLINE: The PC Generation, Back to the Board 

BYLINE:  By By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
JUST two years ago, Michael Megalli, a 32-year-old marketing executive in Manhattan, seemed like a paragon of the digital generation. After spending all day on his office PC, he would spend his free time exploring the virtual worlds inside his computer at home.
 "There was a time when I was at the office for 12 hours and then I would go home, have dinner and then spend nine hours playing Age of Empires," he recalls, referring to a popular computer strategy game set in various historical civilizations. 
 But Mr. Megalli has hardly touched a computer game in months. After work and on weekends, he is more likely to be found playing a board game called Settlers of Catan with his wife and friends. 
He is not alone. What was once known as Generation X -- the first generation raised in the PC age -- was supposed to have left the anachronistic board game in the old-world dust of the 20th century. In the 1990's, playing board games was about as cool as carrying a Filofax.
But as the dot-com generation experiences the first pangs of middle age, board games are back. With budding families and increasing work commitments, many young adults now prefer to spend scarce free time with real people rather than in cyberspace.
"This is really a return to how people can be social rather than staring at a screen," Mr. Megalli said. "Even when you're playing against people on the Internet, the human factor, the social interaction, is really minimized. With work and family, it gets harder to see friends as you get older, and the games are a great way to get people together who otherwise have really busy lives."
The video game industry is hardly in trouble. Yet the Game Manufacturers Association, a trade group, estimates that sales of nonelectronic "hobby games," which do not include mass-market stalwarts like Monopoly and Scrabble, have more than tripled since 1994, from $720 million to roughly $2.6 billion. (Some of that increase is a result of the popularity of youth-oriented trading card games like Pokemon.) Instead of old standbys like Monopoly, the new generation of postcollegiate gamers is gravitating toward more complex games of exploration and trade with names like Settlers of Catan, Puerto Rico and Carcassone.
Mike Kilbert, a co-owner of a New York-based chain of hobby game stores called the Compleat Strategist, estimates that the average age of people buying board games at his stores has declined to the early 30's from the mid-40's in recent years. 
"A lot more people are college-educated now, especially women, and with that there is a desire to use some of that education outside of the office," he said. "People in their late 20's and 30's are coming in and asking for games that they can play with a group instead of alone on a machine."
Mr. Kilbert said that at least 90 percent of his customers were men, but that women seemed to be growing more comfortable with the newer generation of games, which often require players to cooperate and negotiate with one another. Some of the newly popular games can be played with only two people, but most generally require at least three players and can support up to perhaps six.
Many of the newly popular board games focus on competitive exploration and development rather than on overt conflict. In Settlers of Catan, for instance, players compete in building cities and roads to populate a virgin island but must exchange resources if they are to succeed, adding a level of diplomacy to the game. 
Francesca Basilico, 38, a children's clothing designer in Los Angeles, discovered Settlers of Catan in December during a holiday trip to New York.
"I have three kids, ranging from three to five, and so any games that we play at home are more geared to children," she said. "I liked the fact that when I was in New York we were able to play a game where you could spend time with your friends and where I actually had to think. It was for adults and was a bit higher level than Candyland, which is sort of what I'm used to."
Mr. Kilbert said that the new games were often designed to allow as many players as possible to remain in contention throughout the contest, perhaps reflecting a broader shift in the nation's culture.
"The mentality in the late 1950's and early 60's was that games should be played to the bloody death," said Mr. Kilbert,56, whose father founded the original Compleat Strategist store on East 33rd Street in Manhattan in 1973. "Scrabble has its aficionados, but it's the kind of game where one person can blow everyone else out of the water. In Monopoly, if you get the right properties and get hotels you will clobber everyone else. The people in their 30's today don't want that kind of game, they don't have that mentality. They want games where everyone can stay involved."
But the young adults in today's board game vanguard are thinking less about sociology than how physical games compare with their electronic counterparts.
Phil Potter, 30, a financial technology executive in New York, said that he enjoyed playing backgammon, bridge and occasionally chess on the Internet because a game can be completed in 10 or 15 minutes.
"But most of the really involved computer games can require 80, 100 hours to complete," he said. "I haven't really engaged in one of those for probably six months. When you're a kid and have endless time and no responsibilities, of course you play a lot of computer games. The great thing about strategic board games is they are a great opportunity to get people together and do something social."
Firm figures are not available, but Settlers of Catan, developed in Germany in the mid-1990's, may be the most successful of the new breed of board games. Robert T. Carty Jr., director of sales for Mayfair Games, a company based in Skokie, Ill., that is the game's English-language publisher, estimated that more than 10 million copies of the basic game and its expansion sets had been sold worldwide.
Mr. Carty declined to say how many copies have been sold in the United States but said that sales had risen by about 20 percent in each of the last few years. "All of the sales increases have been generated at the grass-roots level, which is people telling other people about it," he said.
At the moment, some of the renewed popularity of non-electronic games may even be rooted in economic conditions.
"In times of economic uncertainty, like now, we get a resurgence in people playing board games," said Rick F. Loomis, president of the Game Manufacturers Association. "When times get a little bit tight, people realize they can take out a game every Saturday night and play it instead of going out."
Most of the newer board games cost around $30, roughly the price of a new video game.
"Most people realize that they go buy a video game, they play it for a while and then it's done forever," said Mr. Loomis, who is also president of the game publisher Flying Buffalo. "With a board game you can play it for years. You can even put it in the closet for 10 years and then take it back out and play it. Video games get obsolete."
Paradoxically, perhaps, some of the new board games are themselves being translated into noncommercial Internet versions. They are even attracting the attention of video game companies. The video game company Capcom is developing an "official" Web version of Settlers of Catan and may soon try to shut down the unlicensed sites, Mr. Carty said.
But the online politics will not matter much to many of the young adults who are fueling the board game renaissance. Jonathan Fried, 35, a lawyer who invites friends to his home in Brooklyn for a game night every Tuesday, never seriously engaged in computer games. For him and some other members of his regular group, board gaming is essentially a return to earlier days.
"We played a lot of games all through junior high school," he recalled. "Then it stopped being cool. In high school you want to socialize, and the people who are playing these games in high school are not necessarily the people you want to be hanging out with. Either that or you are so insecure at that age that you don't think you can play games and be cool at the same time."
Lev J. Fruchter, 36, an old friend of Mr. Fried's who is now a Tuesday night regular, said that even after college, he had other things on his mind.
"We could have been playing games but we weren't because we were meeting people and getting drunk and staying out late and having real-world fun rather than simulation-imagination fun," he said. "Now you're at home and the kids are asleep upstairs and games are the perfect way to spend the evening."
Mr. Fruchter has two young daughters, and he plays a simplified version of the board game Carcassone with his 3-year-old.
Doesn't he want her to start learning about computers?
"Look at the world today," he said. "She is going to be spending enough time playing computer games. I am in no hurry to get her spending more time in front of the screen."

HEADLINE: It Adds Up (and Up, and Up) 

BYLINE:  By ROB FIXMER 

 BODY:
WHEN Jon Green was growing up in rural Massachusetts in the 1970's, his family's phone service consisted of a party line shared with several neighbors. A simple rabbit-ears antenna captured all of seven television channels.
 Today, like many middle-class Americans, Mr. Green and his wife, Stacie, carry cellphones, and their home in Maynard, Mass., has a land-line phone, cable television and a high-speed connection to the Internet, each offering an array of extra services. The connections they have come to consider necessities are discreet if not invisible. The tangible reminder is the stack of bills the Greens must pay each month. 
 When technology executives and marketers talk about the value of their products, they tend to focus on computer chips, which are 350 times more powerful today than they were 20 years ago and cost about a third as much. 
But it is not the cost of the machines that has most altered household budgets. Instead, all that cheap computing power embedded in scores of new gadgets and married to communications networks has resulted in a growing number of subscription services that most consumers cannot resist -- and continuing charges that they cannot escape.
 The party line phone service they had in 1974 probably cost Mr. Green's family about $19 a month, the equivalent of about $70 today when adjusted for inflation. Long-distance calls were thought of as expensive, infrequent luxuries. Watching television was free, and access to the Internet would not be generally available or billable for two decades. 
 Today the Greens pay more than $225 a month for services that enable them to watch television, make phone calls and communicate over the Internet. That is more than a threefold increase, in today's dollars, for communications and home entertainment.
 Research at Columbia University in the late 1990's suggests that like the Greens, most other American households have spent an increasing percentage of their disposable income over the last decade to link themselves to the outside world. Other research, done at Rutgers University, suggests that the appetite for such services has not reached its limit: American families are spending only about half as much as they say they would be willing to pay for technologies that would perfectly meet their needs. That is heartening news for the companies that are trying to convince consumers of the virtues of high-speed Internet connections or digital cable or satellite television services. 
 Not everyone, to be sure, is happy about that continuing evolution. Some consumers say they resent the addictive nature of such offerings.
 "They get you hooked, and then you can't let go," said Sari Boren, a designer of museum exhibits from Cambridge, Mass. "A big part of what bothers me about the monthly payment thing is that no matter which of these services you subscribe to, you know they're going to keep raising the rates."
 Of course, the mix of services differs from household to household. 
 Many families consider extensive cable television access or unlimited cellphone use to be a greater priority than access to the Internet. Music lovers might tend to spend more for subscriptions to online jukeboxes or satellite radio systems. Frequent business travelers are likely to spend more than others for access to mobile wireless Internet services.
 "I know a lot of people who pay over $100 just for cable TV," said Tyrone Chee, a 42-year-old senior hardware engineer for R.R. Donnelly & Sons, a Manhattan-based printing concern. "Television isn't that important to me. We just have basic cable."
 But that does not mean Mr. Chee is not paying in other ways for his family's mix of technologies. His outlay for various communications services at his home in Maplewood, N.J., is about $400 a month -- if his 15-year-old daughter stays within the allotted minutes on her cellphone plan. "Last month, I ended up with a $600 cellphone bill because one of us talked way too much," he said.
 While Mr. Chee described his daughter's cellphone bill as "clearly excessive," he added that for himself and his wife, Dana, "the cellphone is an absolute necessity."
 The notion of what constitutes a necessity varies from one household to another, but some services tend to become ingrained and all but indispensable. Both the telephone and television have achieved this status, with a presence in more than 90 percent of American households. While only 54 percent of homes have Internet access and about 56 percent subscribe to a wireless phone service, the Internet and the cellphone service are considered essential by many people.
 An analysis of government data by academic researchers over the last 25 years shows that from the 1920's through the 80's, the average household spent about 6 percent of its disposable income on "information and entertainment," a category embracing everything from newspapers and movies to telephone service, radios and television sets.
 In the 1990's that figure jumped to 8 percent. Today, "it looks like it's more than 10 percent," said John Carey, who teaches courses in new media at Columbia University's graduate school of business. Clearly, Mr. Carey said, the increase in consumer spending on information and entertainment coincided with widespread expansion of cable and satellite TV and with the rapid growth of the public Internet.
 "The so-called information age and information economy are reaching down to the household level," said Mr. Carey, who has tracked consumer spending on communications media since 1990.
 And the effects go far beyond the so-called early adopters, those people who are first to embrace a new form of technology. Gary Kemp, a trademark lawyer in Boston, described himself and his wife, Jayne, a book editor, as "techno-minimalists." Nonetheless, he said, "We pay about $140 for basic cable, low-level local and long-distance service for one land line, the cheapest possible cellphone plan, and a basic modem-based Internet connection," he said. "The sheer number of bills is driving me nuts."
 Mr. Kemp is resigned to the idea that he will probably have to add network services as his 3-year-old daughter grows up. "When Susanna's old enough to spend too much time either on the phone or the Internet, I'll probably get a package service," he said.
 But by the time his daughter is old enough to commandeer the family's phone or computer, there are sure to be many more network services vying to entice the Kemps into tacking another monthly payment or two onto the family budget.
 As for his idea of a consumer-friendly package of services, that turns out to be something many consumers say they want, said James E. Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University. But, he is quick to add, "there's a fundamental difference between what people say and what they do." 
 When AT&T bundled a number of services into one monthly bill, he said, consumers went into sticker shock and cut back their expenditures.
 "If you're getting pelted monthly by a lot of little bills, it's irritating, but you don't tend to realize how much all that adds up to," Professor Katz said. "Whereas when they get all those items in one bill, people get horrified at how much they're spending. They start looking for ways to make the total dollar amount go down."
 Mr. Katz said his research suggested that if subscription costs were billed discretely, American consumers would continue to pay more for new gadgets and ways to connect with each other.
 Certainly there will be no shortage of new subscription services from which to choose. Companies are already aggressively marketing satellite radio, mobile wireless Internet broadband and myriad new online services. Networks that connect hand-held devices to the Internet are beginning seem essential to business travelers. Cable and satellite operators continue to add new products like digital broadcasts, high-definition content and video on demand. Wireless phone companies, which are already promoting cellphones that can take and transmit photos, plan to introduce dozens of other new Internet-based products over the next five years.
 Many market analysts predict that the surging popularity of TiVo, the digital television recorder, will inspire new home video servers that capture signals from multiple Internet, cable and satellite networks and feed them to computers, televisions and other devices around the house.
 What all these emerging services have in common is a business model based on subscriptions that are billed monthly or yearly. What the most successful services will share is an appeal that will quickly evolve from intriguing to compelling to essential.
 "These things always start out as somewhat exotic luxuries," said Professor Katz. "But it's surprising how quickly, by historical standards, they come to be perceived as necessities." 
 For example, for the first 40 years of its existence, the telephone was considered something of a luxury, or perhaps a dispensable convenience, he said. But by the 1960's, welfare agencies throughout the United States were incorporating phone costs into their calculations of welfare benefits as an essential commodity, like heat and electricity.
 At his home in Massachusetts, Mr. Green, a 37-year-old computer-systems specialist, discovered how irresistible communication services can be when he was laid off last year. "I looked carefully to see if there was any way we could reduce the level of service and save money," he recalled. "Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any."
 Not without pain, anyway. He could have saved $65 a month by dropping the high-speed Internet service he gets over his phone line, but he said: "I'd have to be incredibly desperate before I gave up broadband. I don't even want to think about that."
 Similarly, Ms. Boren, the museum-exhibit designer, finds it "insane that I spend $46 a month for broadband when I'm online at home a total of about four hours a week." Yet, she said, "I would have to be facing extreme economic hardship before I would give it up. In fact, I would first cut out cable TV, even though I use cable multiple hours more than I use broadband."
 Ms. Boren, who is 38 and single, pays $128 a month for her combined cable television and cable modem services. Her personal line of resistance is the cellphone -- she has refused to get one, which she said made her "practically a social pariah."
 "But why should it?" she said. "It's not like I have a husband or kids that need to reach me all the time."
 Still, Ms. Boren acknowledged a limit to her resistance. "Twenty dollars is my breaking point," she said. "If I could find a plan for $20 a month, I would have a cellphone."
 Not surprisingly, research shows that price is an important factor in most consumer decisions about whether and when to subscribe to a new service. But research by Professor Katz suggests that the typical American household is nowhere near its limit -- that the average family would be willing to spend as much as $500 a month for the right combination of subscription services.
 "It isn't really all that much money given the value of the services," he said. "Consider that they get all the pleasures of fabulous sound, rich pictures, entertainment, multimillion-dollar films brought into their homes, highly individualized communications networks with which they can visit with their friends in an unlimited way any time. That takes the place of a lot of trips on the Concorde a generation ago, or, in generations before that, a trip on a luxury liner."
 "Network creep," as Professor Katz calls the proliferation of subscription services, has already had a significant impact on household budgets in the United States, he said, but because of the perceived value of the new services and because the phenomenon took place gradually over two prosperous decades, it has gone unnoticed by many consumers.
 Now that times are leaner, however, many households are re-evaluating monthly expenses and reassessing priorities. Some analysts are pessimistic about consumers' willingness to take on new services at a time of high unemployment and record consumer debt.
 Allan Tumolillo, the chief operating officer of Probe Research, a consulting firm in Cedar Knolls, N.J., that specializes in the telecommunications sector, said his biggest concern was consumer debt, which is now more than $1.7 trillion. Measured as a percentage of the nation's gross domestic product, that is the highest consumer debt level since the beginning of the Great Depression, according to government data.
 "This new-economy thing of subscribe to this, subscribe to that gets to be a lot of money," Mr. Tumolillo said. "You end up with some people paying $500 to $1,000 a month between their cable service, their cellphones, their phone lines, their long distance, their Internet service provider, two or three information services, music videos, what have you."
 Writing in an advisory for his clients in the telecommunications sector recently, Mr. Tumolillo suggested that baby boomers who are approaching retirement age during an economic downturn might change their habits.
 "Where will consumers put their dollars?" he wrote. "On services like D.S.L., cable modems, multiple cellular lines, I.S.P. accounts, online gaming, other subscriber-based services? Or will they shift spending toward more home improvement, toward health care, savings, paying off debt? This is extraordinarily difficult to predict."
 Ms. Boren suggested that perhaps the biggest cost of network creep was not in dollars but in the lost opportunities, amid the unrelenting buzz of a hyper-connected culture, to reflect quietly on the day's events or life in general. "The lack of a cellphone allows me to have unproductive moments," she said.
 In an ever more connected world, unproductive moments, not the hottest new service, could prove to be the ultimate luxury.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plan for Wall St. Firms Drops Provision for a Move 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Federal regulators have recommended that companies critical to the nation's financial system should try to resume operations within hours of a disaster or terrorist attack. The regulators did not require that Wall Street firms move their operations out of Manhattan, as many executives and city officials had feared.
 A white paper issued jointly Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve said financial firms involved in processing market transactions should establish separate backup operations to help prevent wide-scale disruption of financial markets. 
 Tuesday's report, and an earlier version, were issued for the first time after Sept. 11, when the terror attack on the World Trade Center disrupted financial transactions for days. 
Industry executives and city officials said yesterdaythat they were heartened that the federal agencies did not think it necessary that backup operations be a minimum distance from main offices. An earlier version suggested that backup sites be as much as 300 miles away. City officials had feared that such a requirement would encourage the flight of financial jobs from New York.
"It seemed to me to be a much better result for New York City than what they started with," said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. "The reality is that securities firms like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs already have backup facilities at their other offices."
Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the Securities Industry Association, said some Wall Street companies had resisted efforts by regulators to establish distance requirements for satellite offices.
"You had firms that had just invested millions of dollars in backup sites that were within 300 miles of New York," Mr. Kittell said. "They were afraid that there would be some heavy-handed requirement that they build it somewhere else."
As a result of a sluggish economy and the terrorist attack, the financial industry in New York City has lost 37,100 jobs over the past 25 months. City officials did not want the regulators to cause another exodus.
The federal agencies did recommend, however, that backup sites be in locations that did not use the same transportation network, telecommunications system or water as the main offices. Mr. Doctoroff said it was unclear whether that would preclude the Bank of New York's plan to move some operations to Brooklyn from Lower Manhattan, or Morgan Stanley's decision to move some offices to Westchester County. 
The agencies are also expected to issue recommendations concerning trading operations by the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers and financial services firms. Executives said they wondered whether those companies would be required to build backup operations elsewhere. The stock exchange announced earlier this week that it had decided against building a parallel trading operation in Westchester.
"Everyone is waiting for a second white paper to drop," Mr. Kittell said.

HEADLINE: Shift in Bonds Has States Rethinking Tobacco Plans 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
State governments from New York to Oregon are pulling back from their plans to borrow directly against future payments of tobacco settlements and are scrambling to find other ways to use the payments to ease their expanding financial problems.
 An Illinois judgment last month against Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, prompted investors to demand higher interest rates on bonds backed by the tobacco payments. 
 As a result, some states, like California, have delayed their plans to enter the tobacco bond market. Others, like New York, which saw tobacco borrowing as central to closing its budget gap, are finding other ways to borrow using the tobacco payments. In those cases, the states are paying less to borrow but are taking on more long-range risk. 
Only three months ago, governors saw the billions of dollars in payouts from the nation's cigarette makers as a magic elixir for various financial crises.
Turning the revenue from a 1998 settlement into immediate cash was accepted by Democrats and Republicans alike as a palatable alternative to less popular budget fixes, like tax increases or service cuts.
But Philip Morris's warning that it might forgo its next payment to the states next week and could face bankruptcy if it has to post a $12 billion bond to appeal the Illinois judgment, has taken the shine off the pot of tobacco gold. Even if the Philip Morris situation is resolved, the tobacco bonds are still tainted.
States are now coming up with new ways to tap a combined $206 billion in tobacco payments they are owed over 25 years.
"The risk of these bonds has obviously been raised," said Lee Dixon, director of the health policy tracking service at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "It is certainly chilling the states' actions. How long it stalls it, I really could not predict."
The states' responses run the gamut. Virginia canceled its $767 million tobacco bond sale April 1. California has put off its $2.3 billion issue scheduled for next week and paused to consider its options. Oregon and Missouri are turning to alternative bonds, freer of the tobacco taint. Colorado, Illinois, Indiana and Kansas are mulling their options.
And in New York, officials are still thrashing out exactly what to do. Even before the Philip Morris crisis, state leaders were bickering over how to structure a tobacco borrowing deal. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, wanted the Legislature to approve $4.2 billion in tobacco borrowing to help plug a nearly $12 billion gap in the $90 billion budget.
Mr. Pataki's plans have, however, veered off script, and he is insisting on a new deal that will not transfer the financial risk to investors, as he had intended, but will keep it squarely in the state's lap. It was the effort to shed that risk that originally made the so-called tobacco bonds so popular with New York and other states.
"What's the right choice?" asked Bill O'Keefe, head of municipal bonds at Morgan Stanley, echoing the states' quandary. "Do you wait until the market for tobacco bonds settles down and sell tobacco bonds that transfer the risk of nonpayment to the bondholders? Or do you go for lower interest costs and take the risk into the state?"
It is a question states are increasingly struggling with as they realize that the tobacco windfalls might be less reliable than they thought.
Since the 1998 settlement with 46 states (and earlier ones with Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas), many governors have dedicated a bulk of their tobacco cash for health care and research, smoking cessation or education, in line with the spirit of the settlement. 
States, however, are facing a combined deficit of $27 billion in 2003 and as much as $70 billion in 2004. 
So far, Mr. Dixon said, 17 states have used tobacco settlement revenue as a vehicle for borrowing, 6 of them to address revenue shortfalls.
But even as more states queued up to the enter the market, that market effectively closed soon after March 21, when Judge Nicholas Byron of Madison County Circuit Court in Illinois awarded a $10.1 billion judgment against Philip Morris and required the company to put up a $12 billion deposit by April 21 to appeal the verdict. Philip Morris, with the help of attorneys general from 37 states and territories, is trying to get that requirement lowered.
The company's credit rating, as well as that of its parent, Altria, has since been reduced. The ratings on about $18 billion of tobacco bonds have also been lowered, with yields on some trading in the secondary market now up to 7.8 percent, from 6.2 percent before the Illinois court decision. When the yields rise, so do the costs of borrowing to the states.
As a result, Oregon and Missouri have been forced to drop plans to sell tobacco bonds. Instead, the states plan this week to enter the bond market, but they would back the bonds with their general fund and use the annual tobacco settlement revenue indirectly to pay the principle and interest.
"They can take the money into the general fund and with their own internal accounting pay the principle and interest with the tobacco money," said Robert A. Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. "But for the investor, it is the general fund."
That new approach means that those two states, and others that follow, could save millions of dollars in interest over the next 20 to 30 years. But to get the lower rates, the states have to take on the risk, not unsubstantial, that the cigarette companies will fail to make payments.
On the plus side, the interest rate for those kinds of bonds is based on the state's credit rating, which is high for Oregon and Missouri. Thus,the new deal is less expensive for those states.
Jim Carder, director of Missouri's division of accounting, said the state expects to pay around 5 percent on its bonds, instead of 7 percent or more for the tobacco bonds. Mr. Carder said the idea to switch from tobacco was elementary. 
It was not so easy for New York to choose the path of Oregon or Missouri because New York's debt reform act of 2000 barred the issuance of state debt to pay operating costs and is something Mr. Pataki worked for years to achieve. State budget officials say the tobacco bonds do not qualify as state debt. 
Democratic opponents of Mr. Pataki's plan disagree, arguing that the tobacco money is a recurring revenue source and that to consider it off budget is a fiction or accounting gimmick.
Nonetheless, a deal appears to be moving forward. The Pataki administration has now zeroed in on a so-called hybrid alternative tobacco bond, unlike any other and perhaps a model for other states.
Under the plan, which would require legislative approval, New York would borrow $4.2 billion against the $10.4 billion in tobacco payments the state is due over the next 20 years, using part of the annual tobacco payments to cover the principle and interest on the bonds. 
But the bonds would include a backup source for debt service payments if the tobacco settlement payments evaporate. This would come in a separate appropriation each year from the state's general fund that would be set aside for the payment of the principle and interest. Should the tobacco money not materialize, this pot of money would be available.
Pataki administration officials do not believe the appropriation, which will not be included in the state's regular budget, would ever be spent. 
And while they admit a risk to the state remains, they also cite an advantage: the interest paid on the hybrid bonds will be about 4 or 5 percent, akin to what the state pays for the rest of its debt.
New York officials will most likely wait to sell the state's hybrid tobacco bonds until, as one budget analyst put it, the problems with the tobacco industry, "settle out." By then, the decision will probably be part of an overall budget solution for the state.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, It's South-Central No More 

BYLINE:  By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 9 

 BODY:
South-Central Los Angeles, the neighborhood that became infamous in recent years for riots, gang violence and poverty, is no more -- at least according to the Los Angeles City Council.
 The council voted unanimously today to rename this 16-square-mile district South Los Angeles as part of an effort to erase the image of South-Central as the scene of race riots in 1965 and 1992 and the setting for films featuring gangs and drug dealers like "Training Day," "Colors" and "Boyz 'n the Hood." 
 From now on South-Central will start disappearing from maps, and the area will be called South Los Angeles in city documents, correspondence, maps and community plans.
The South-Central neighborhood had long been predominantly black, but in recent years became more ethnically diverse as Hispanics, Aisans and whites moved in. 
Supporters of the name change said that while South-Central is defined on city maps as a 16-square-mile rectangle with two prongs at the south end, the name had become a racially charged shorthand applied to other areas of Los Angeles that have predominantly black populations.
Residents of solidly middle-class neighborhoods have long complained that they were being unfairly stigmatized and lobbied the city to get rid of the name.
"We believe this action will go a long way toward changing attitudes and how people view this community," Councilwoman Jan Perry, an author of the motion, said. "We still need more jobs, better schools, health care and recreational activities, but we hope this change will help communities discover their cultural and historical significance."
Although there was no organized opposition to the name change, some residents said that they were proud to be from South-Central and that they found the council's action offensive.
At the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenues in South-Central, the flash point of the 1992 riot, Evann Tavares, manager of Art's World Famous Chili Dogs, which was founded in 1939, said: "There's nothing wrong with being from the 'hood. You should be proud of your roots. It's nothing to be ashamed of."
Maria Mendoza, a 17-year-old student who was born in South-Central, said: "This is ridiculous. It's still going to be the same neighborhood with the same problems. Nothing will change."
Ms. Mendoza said that instead of "wasting time making silly motions to change names" the council "should work harder to reduce crime and create opportunities for poor people."
But some businesses in South-Central said the new name was a good idea. "I think the change will be very positive because a lot of people hear the name South-Central and they are afraid to patronize businesses here," Juan Vaca, manager of Auto Zone, an automobile-parts store built shortly after the riots, said. "Image is important when it comes to business, so being located in South L.A. versus South-Central L.A. certainly won't hurt us."
Rojellio Martinez sells oranges, peanuts and ice-cold coconuts on the corner where television cameras captured a gang of black men beating Reginald O. Denny, a white truck driver, during the riots 11 years ago after the acquittal of four police officers over the beating of Rodney G. King, the black motorist.
"It's great that they are trying to improve the image of this barrio," Mr. Martinez said in Spanish.
Supporters of the change said South-Central had derived its name from South-Central Avenue, which during the last century was the business and professional hub of the city's black residents. Over time, however, the black population shifted west toward Crenshaw Boulevard, and the area known as South-Central became increasingly Latino. Because of its inexpensive housing, it has been home to many new immigrants.
For several years now, many neighborhoods in Los Angeles and nearby cities have changed their names to distance themselves from areas with bad reputations. Sepulveda, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley, recently became Panorama City and North Hills. In Compton, a Los Angeles suburb infested with crime and gangs, the Crystal Park Hotel and Casino has marketed itself as being in Crystal City to attract tour groups.
"I think there's a lot to be said for renaming South-Central, a moniker that tends to stigmatize rather than uplift," Mark Ridley-Thomas, a California Assembly member and former city councilman representing the area, said. "The bottom line is that no one wants to be stigmatized."
The assemblyman said that many neighborhoods like Green Meadows, Chesterfield Square and Morningside Heights that were generically described as South-Central have their own identities and character that should be recognized.
One councilman who voted in favor of the name change said the move was cosmetic and would have no impact on the community. "It's meaningless and won't really change a thing," Councilman Nate Holden said. "What is really needed is a comprehensive program to address crime, unemployment, education and drug abuse."
Mr. Holden said that the ethnic makeup of South-Central and much of Los Angeles was shifting rapidly, as the number of Latinos and Asians in the city increases and the black population declines. This demographic shift, he said, will have profound consequences for the political process.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE RECOVERY; 
Relief Agencies Are Forced to Wait as Chaos Reigns

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

 BODY:
Lawlessness in Iraq is preventing international relief organizations from entering the country with emergency shipments of medicine, food and water, blankets and other supplies, relief officials said yesterday.
 The lack of security also has led the International Committee of the Red Cross to suspend its Iraqi relief program, the only one that has been operating in the country throughout the war. The organization suspended its program after Vatche Arslanian, a 48-year-old Canadian who was in charge of logistics for the Red Cross in Iraq, was killed in a crossfire in Baghdad on Tuesday. 
 "We're taking it day by day, but the situation must be stabilized," said Amanda Williamson, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Washington. "We know from long experience that there is often a vacuum when a war is ending and lawlessness can be a real factor with immediate consequences for the population." 
The death of Mr. Arslanian underlined the precariousness of any planning for relief work while fighting continues. Kenneth Bacon, president of Refugees International, said he wished that American military forces would concentrate on securing hospitals and food stores and not on pulling down statues of Saddam Hussein.
While American and British troops have handed out food parcels to Iraqi civilians and military doctors have bandaged their wounds, the full relief effort -- which some officials said would be the largest in years -- will be carried out by the United States civilian agencies led by the United States Agency for International Development, by agencies from the United Nations and other international and private relief groups.
By charter these organizations are unable to work under the authority of any military force, including the Pentagon's civilian team headed by a retired general, Jay Garner, which will initially administer the country. Instead, the international and private aid organizations will coordinate their activities with General Garner and the military to ensure that the relief programs are as effective as possible.
Aid organizations said they have been stockpiling supplies in neighboring countries and preparing staff in the weeks leading up to the war, but have had little idea what they will find when they get inside Iraq and begin assessing the condition of the water and sanitation system, the size of the food stocks and the state of the medical system.
"It is very very difficult to give a picture of the needs of the Iraqis," said Oliver Ulich, of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. "We know the generalities -- running out of medical supplies, of water -- but without a proper assessment we cannot make any predictions."
One of the few situations that is relatively clear is the amount of food that will be needed. The relief organizations will inherit the oil for food program begun by the United Nations in 1996 to offset health problems created by the sanctions program. The Iraqi government set up a nationwide food distribution system that relief experts hope will be in good enough shape to be reassembled.
"We know we will need to feed 27 million Iraqis at the beginning -- the largest operation in our history -- but we don't know how we will be able to revive the distribution system, what will be left, who will do it," said Jordan Day, spokesman for the United Nations World Food Program.
That effort will require 480,000 tons of food every month. It will also cost nearly $2 billion. The United States has already contributed more than 600,000 tons of grain and $200 million, but the agency said it needs an additional $1.3 billion.
Working with the United States Agency for International Development, the U.N. food program has begun buying and shipping enough food for the next four months. But at the start, the agency is counting local food stocks inside Iraq. Grain purchased from neighboring Syria and other countries in the region will be a stopgap while food from the United States begins to arrive.
The far more crucial problems are water and medical supplies.
Already, children are lining the highways from the southern port of Um Qasr to Basra, begging westerners to slow their cars and share their water. Mohammed Hussein, a 30-year-old barber in Basra, said yesterday that while he appreciated the defeat of the Saddam Hussein government, he was upset that it has not been replaced. "For three weeks, there is no water, no electricity," he said. "The British are kind to us but we need water."
The Hussein government did operate these delivery systems to ensure there was food and water throughout the country. That system, however meager, disappeared in the last days and until the American-led military force establishes order it will not be replaced.
At the same time, much of that water was filthy, delivered in rusty pipes with little concern for the health problems it caused. Roughly one in five of Iraq's young children are malnourished because of diseases caused by the water, said Mr. Day of the World Food Program.
The United Nations Development Program has warehouses in northern Iraq with $60 million worth of equipment and spare parts needed to repair the electrical system , which powered water and sanitation plants that were either destroyed or crippled in the fighting.
"Because we don't know nearly enough about the situation in south and central Iraq we can't say what will be needed when we finally are able to assess the damage," said William Orme, the spokesman for the U.N. program.
The Red Cross has already warned that hospitals are running out of supplies to treat the war wounded.

HEADLINE: Suit Accuses Toyota Of Bias in Lending 

 BODY:
A lawsuit was filed in San Francisco yesterday accusing the financing unit of Toyota Motor of discriminating against black and Hispanic car buyers in setting the interest rates on their dealer-arranged loans.
 The suit was filed in California Superior Court by a team of lawyers that includes Bill Lann Lee, who ran the Justice Department's civil rights division during the Clinton administration. 
He is now a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein in San Francisco. 
 In recent weeks, the legal team has quietly filed similar cases against the financing arm of Honda Motor and WFS Financial, the auto credit unit of Westcorp.
All the cases contend that the auto finance companies have allowed their dealers to discriminate against blacks and Hispanics by adding extra points -- called dealer markup -- to the interest rates that the finance companies established for borrowers based on credit histories. 
A result, the lawsuits say, is that blacks and Hispanics paid higher interest rates than whites with similar credit ratings.
The lawsuits, like similar cases filed in recent years against other auto dealers, ask the courts to bar the dealer markup practice and reimburse consumers for discriminatory practices in the past.
A Toyota representative said last night that the company was committed to fair lending and permitted its dealers to add no more than 3 points to their loans.
A spokesman for Honda declined to comment. WFS Financial did not respond to a phone call made to its corporate office last night.

HEADLINE: U.S. Left Out of Emissions Trading 

BYLINE:  By OTTO POHL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
During negotiations over the Kyoto Protocol, the United States preached the importance of market solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Few countries listened. 
 Now, with the Americans no longer at the table, the former free-market opposition has taken over the pulpit. Canada ratified the treaty in December, meaning the plan to reduce greenhouse gases is just one nation shy of becoming law in more than 100 countries. And the heart of the treaty is an emissions-trading plan that closely resembles what the United States originally proposed. 
 "When Bush pulled out in the cavalier way he did, he galvanized everyone around the world to make it work," said David Doniger, a former Kyoto treaty negotiator under President Bill Clinton and now policy director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The system is made in America, and the Americans aren't part of it."
Other countries see opportunity in America's retreat. 
"Now that the Americans are out, Europe can dominate the emissions trading market," says Steve Drummond, managing director of a greenhouse gas brokerage in London called CO2e.com. "It entitles the Europeans to write the rules for global trading."
And Europe has indeed been busy writing. Britain introduced the world's first organized trading system two years ago. Denmark has begun a smaller plan, and in December the European Union issued plans to begin full-scale trading in 2005. With Kyoto shaping a multibillion-dollar commodities exchange, companies are already trading emissions reductions, which are expected to become increasingly valuable as other companies enter the market.
The idea behind what are called cap-and-trade arrangements is to issue a limited number of pollution permits and then allow companies to buy and sell them. Whoever can reduce emissions cheaply can sell unused permits to others, making creative ideas for pollution reduction a profit opportunity. As overall reductions are realized, governments can slowly reduce the number of outstanding permits to keep both the price of permits and interest in further reductions high.
It is hard to quantify the benefit or loss to American businesses for not being part of the global market. Certainly, heavy polluters are better off because they do not have to buy pollution permits or invest in new technology. Companies that could achieve low-cost reductions, however, cannot realize the profits by making those reductions, and the market infrastructure of brokers and trading experience is developing abroad.
American multinational corporations are also forced to put in place two ways of accounting for carbon dioxide emissions, one for emissions inside the United States and one for emissions in nations that signed on to Kyoto. And with various proposals before Congress to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, companies contemplating equipment upgradings in their American plants are unsure what kind of regulatory environment they face.
So far, regulation is strictly self-imposed. Trading at the Chicago Climate Exchange, a market based on voluntary compliance, is set to begin in June. The chairman and chief executive of the exchange, Richard Sandor, says that even voluntary markets can allow the United States to be competitive internationally. "This will squarely put the U.S. in a very good position to lead efforts in developing market-based solutions to environmental problems," he said. "Carbon is only the beginning."
Outside experts are not as hopeful for voluntary measures. "Mandatory programs can force behavior from inefficient firms," says Thomas P. Lyon, a visiting fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington research center. "A voluntary program simply can't touch those."
One reason companies are involved with the climate exchange is to prepare for mandatory requirements they foresee. "It's an insurance policy," said Bruce Braine, vice president for strategic planning and analysis at American Electric Power, the nation's largest power generator and biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. "If you ultimately have mandatory requirements, then this gives us first-mover advantages."
So far, the right to emit an estimated 200 million tons of greenhouse gases has changed hands, and trading volumes are growing rapidly. According to Natsource, a large environmental gas brokerage firm, volumes last year matched the volume for the previous five years. Most of the volume is driven by the desire to get low prices on emissions reductions that companies expect will be valid under the Kyoto agreement. 
The right to emit the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon dioxide now sells for $3 to $8, said Jack D. Cogen, chief executive of Natsource. When Kyoto takes effect in those countries that have ratified it -- Russia, for one, is still to act -- that price is expected to rise sharply. Estimates for the size of the greenhouse gas market vary widely, but everyone agrees it will be a major commodities market. "Every time you burn fossil fuels you create carbon," Mr. Sandor of the climate exchange said. "This market could be as big as the energy market."
The Dutch government is now one of the largest buyers on the market. Canadian corporations, which had been buying large volumes of American emissions reductions in recent years, have scaled back since it became clear the American reductions would not be compliant with Kyoto.
Brokers are still waiting for precise Kyoto rules to be published, which will allow trading to develop similar to that for stocks and bonds. For now, each deal is based on an estimate about whether the reductions will comply. "It's like selling real estate," said Frank Joshua, managing director of Natsource Tullett (Europe) Ltd. 
Today at CO2e.com, a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald, just a few employees sit in offices next to Cantor's trading floor, where billions of dollars of bonds change hands daily. Mr. Drummond of CO2e.com looks forward to the day when his brokers join the brokers working the bond market a few feet from his desk. "The emissions market closely resembles the bond market," he said. "This is a serious business opportunity."
The idea of trading pollution credits first came up in a significant way in the Clean Air Act of 1990. It was intended to reduce pollutants responsible for acid rain and was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush. 
The Clean Air Act reduced dangerous pollutants like sulphur dioxide for a fraction of what it had cost before. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that for a cost of $1 billion, the legislation has saved the United States at least $50 billion in health costs alone.
By not putting in place similar legislation for greenhouse gases, critics fear, the United States allows other countries to gain experience and win business in the field. "All we're doing now is giving other countries a chance for remedial education," said Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, "and it will cost us in the end."

HEADLINE: Furniture Forecast: Thawing Prices 

BYLINE:  By LIZ SEYMOUR 

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C. 

 BODY:
SPIRITS were surprisingly good at the International Home Furnishings Market, the largest wholesale furniture expo in the world. Under budding dogwood trees, international news faded to a whisper. A headline in Furniture Today read "War Causes Rug Delays," and analysts reminded retailers and buyers that despite a three-year slump in furniture sales, housing starts and existing home sales were up and interest rates were down, traditionally good signs for the furniture industry. "We've got to get this war behind us so we can go out there and furnish those hundreds of thousands of new homes," Pat Norton, chairman of La-Z-Boy, said. 
 At the spring show, which ended yesterday, the war more often discussed was the price war raging between importers and domestic producers. Imports represented $14.2 billion of the industry's $44 billion sales in wholesale furniture in 2002, and China's furniture exports to the United States alone increased 37 percent between 2001 and 2002. 
 In a sign of increased attention to prices, Henrendon introduced a line of licensed Ralph Lauren furniture that will sell for slightly less than an existing Ralph Lauren Polo line. 
Other furniture being introduced was generally a little warmer, maybe even a little cozier, than in past years. "Consumers want to feel good in the only environment they can control right now," said Michelle Lamb, chairman of Marketing Directions, which forecasts colors and trends for the home furnishings industry. 
Designers delivered smaller pieces in upbeat colors and playful stripes and checks. Shades of red, from lipstick to chili powder, were everywhere; Mitchell Gold reported brisk sales in recent months of anything upholstered in red leather. A vibrant blue, somewhere between robin's egg and swimming pool, also appeared in many showrooms.
Demand for psychic comfort may be driving a resurgence of wing chairs, high-backed sofas and high-armed settees, which stood around showrooms like little upholstered isolation booths. Thayer Coggin introduced a streamlined wing chair, while Mitchell Gold went more traditional with Grace, a bright-red wing chair with a tall back. Chris Madden's new collection for Bassett included a curved and button-tufted wing chair in buttery leather. 
Other curvy pieces included Weiman's kidney-shape Infinity sofa; a two-piece sofa from La-Z-Boy; and a small armless sofa from Baker, which it paired with a curved mahogany table.
In many showrooms, "it's smaller or it's longer or it's taller, but it's not fatter and lower," said Larry Laslo, on hand to introduce his new collection for Directional.
Six months ago, concerns about the economy and the world situation were nearly drowned out by the hoopla surrounding big-name licensed furniture collections, among them Martha Stewart at Bernhardt, Jaclyn Smith at Largo and Humphrey Bogart at Thomasville. Early returns suggest that the Martha Stewart and Bogart collections are connecting well with consumers. "If you have something good and it's solid and branded right, people are going to buy no matter what," said Judy George, chief executive of the furniture chain Domain. 
The celebrity licensees at this market were of smaller caliber. Steve Tyrell, the Grammy-winning jazz musician, sang a few riffs to piped-in music as he led visitors around New Standards: the Steve Tyrell Collection, 72 pieces for Pennsylvania House. 
The wisdom of keeping celebrities away from the drafting board was demonstrated at La-Z-Boy, which showcased some ungainly recliners designed for a charity auction by members of the cast of "Friends."

HEADLINE: Success for Brazil Despite Naysayers 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, April 9 

 BODY:
As the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva passed its 100th day in office this week, the specters of economic calamity that his election had raised for foreign investors -- debt default, a sinking currency and economic mismanagement -- seemed to be just that, shadows.
 Mr. da Silva and his team could -- and did -- congratulate themselves that, because they committed themselves to a policy of tight money and painful spending cuts after taking office on Jan. 1, the economic signs are mainly pointing in positive directions. 
 The Brazilian currency, the real, has recovered from its swoon during the election. Government bonds are trading at their highest prices -- and lowest yields -- in years. The spreads between government bond rates here and in the United States, widely watched guages of investors' confidence in the government, are as narrow as they were a year ago, before the election. 
Still, analysts say, Brazil must be careful not to veer off the path to solid economic growth by postponing important reforms or permitting the real to become too strong. 
A strong currency cuts two ways. It makes imported goods cheaper for consumers, and it makes repayment of the government's extensive dollar debts easier. But it also makes Brazilian goods more expensive abroad. That could sap momentum from the boom in exports, which gave Brazil a $13.1 billion trade surplus last year and could help the country bring its current account, which also includes monetary flows, into balance this year.
Analysts said the government also needs to move quickly on important tax and pension programs while Mr. da Silva's approval rating remains high: recent polls put it at 64 percent, higher even than his 61 percent share of the vote in the runoff that gave him the presidency.
Speaking on Monday to the nation on television, Mr. da Silva acknowledged that he had "lost a few nights' sleep" over the "bitter medicine" that his government had applied economically since he became Brazil's first working-class president.
But he said the medicine, which included raising short-term interest rates to 26.5 percent for a time, freezing nearly $4 billion in public spending and aiming for a budget surplus equal to 4.25 percent of gross domestic product -- was already taking effect and had restored market confidence in the country.
"The world believes in Brazil again," Mr. da Silva said. "Now we must go forward cautiously, without exaggerated optimism and with our feet firmly on the ground, but sure that better days will come." 
Market analysts are looking at Mr. da Silva, a former lathe operator and union leader from a hardscrabble background, with fresh eyes, even those who predicted before the election that his government would soon default on the country's $250 billion debt.
"They've done much better than the pessimists predicted, including myself," said Maurice Goldstein at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "I don't think the finance team has made a serious mistake yet."
Others, who put more faith in the genuineness of the shift Mr. da Silva and the Workers' Party have made toward the political center, are now able to tell investors, "I told you so." 
When he last visited American and European investors in November, John Welch, the chief Latin America economist at West LB, said most of them "were very, very scared we'd have another Argentina on our hands in Brazil." But on the trip he just finished, investors were "reacting more and more positively to Brazil," he said.
"The best word to describe Lula's administration so far is 'constructive,' in all senses of the word," Mr. Welch said. "They are moving forward and they are trying to build a structure for growth."
Mr. da Silva has turned economic policy over to three market-minded advisers: the finance minister, Antonio Palocci; Luiz Furlan, a top executive at the Development, Trade and Industry Ministry; and Roberto Rodrigues, the agriculture minister, who came from Brazil's booming agribusiness sector.
But responsibility for other important industries has been given to politicians who have questioned privatization plans like those for the electric power and telecommunications companies, to the consternation of investors. And the national development bank, a longtime conduit for foreign capital, is under the control of politicians who have been hostile to foreign financial interests.
Mr. Palocci, a medical doctor who has led policymaking so far, warned Brazilians this week against "an excess of optimism."
"We cannot afford to neglect our agenda by thinking, for example, that we can ignore the tax and pension reforms," Mr. Palocci said in an interview with Valor Economico, a business daily. 
Mr. Furlan joined in, saying that "alarm bells would ring" in the export sector if the real were to rise above three to the dollar. Analysts, however, say the central bank is using the real's strength to reinforce its reserves, which fell about one-third last year, to $17 billion. The consensus forecast is for the real to level off at 3.20 to the dollar. 
"The thing is, this is not a 100-yard dash. It's a long race," said Mr. Goldstein. "The crucial question is whether they can keep it up -- whether they can deliver over the next six months to a year."

HEADLINE: Fears in Turkey That Its Cyprus Problem Is Alienating Europe 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, April 9 

 BODY:
Remarks by Turkey's president and prime minister provided fresh signs today of the frustration many Turkish leaders feel over the divided status of Cyprus and, more specifically, over the degree to which it may hamper Turkey's bid to join the European Union.
 President Ahmet Necdet Sezer lashed out at European Union officials for repeatedly suggesting that Turkey would never get into the union until negotiations to reunite the Turkish and Greek sectors of Cyprus succeeded. 
 Mr. Sezer said Turkey was weary and suspicious of "some circles using the Cyprus and northern Iraq issues as elements of threat and blackmail," according to a written statement released by his office. 
Mr. Sezer was referring not only to the widespread European conviction that Turkey is to blame for the continued division of Cyprus but also to statements by European leaders that if Turkish troops crossed the border into northern Iraq, Turkey's entry into the union could be doomed.
As Mr. Sezer made his comments, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece met in Belgrade, Serbia, to discuss the Balkans. It was their first face-to-face discussion since the collapse last month of Cyprus peace talks that were mediated by the United Nations.
"Both our governments have to push," Mr. Erdogan told reporters in Belgrade. "We are in favor of a continuation of negotiations."
Mr. Erdogan had announced last week that his government would be redoubling efforts for the reunification of Cyprus, but he did not provide any kind of detailed proposal. He did not do that today, either.
Rather, the comments by Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Sezer signaled a general and apparently growing distress among Turkish leaders with the way in which Turkey is perceived and treated as the country responsible for the situation in Cyprus, which has been partitioned since 1974. Turkish leaders clearly want to change that.
Next week, the Greek sector of Cyprus is scheduled to sign an accession treaty as one of 10 new countries joining the European Union in 2004. In the absence of a reunification agreement for Cyprus, the Turkish sector of the island would be left out of the union.
"It comes as no surprise that the Turkish side is squirming," said John Sitilides, executive director of the Western Policy Center, a Washington research and education group that analyzes American policy in southeastern Europe.
"Turks are just beginning to come to grips, again at the last minute, with Cyprus crossing the next-to-last threshold toward full E.U. membership while Turkey's own accession program seems to be at a standstill," Mr. Sitilides said.
Turkish officials have also seen their country's alliance with the United States badly strained by the war in Iraq, and many of them do not want Turkey to drift away from Western Europe at the same time.
But Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, emphasized again today that the Turkish sector would resist any plan that seemed to put it under the control of the Greek sector.
"We are in favor of a good partnership, but we will never give up our sovereignty and state," Mr. Denktash said in Lefkosa, Cyprus, according to the Turkish state-run news agency.
European Union officials have long complained about Turkey's record on human rights, especially its treatment of ethnic Kurds, and are watching closely for any movement by Turkish troops into the Kurdish region of Iraq.

HEADLINE: New Kenyan President Vows to Deliver on Economic Promises 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, April 9 

 BODY:
Kenya's president, Mwai Kibaki, in a speech marking his first 100 days in office, said today that he would put into effect the election pledges that won him the top job, answering critics who say he has not yet delivered.
 Promising to revamp east Africa's biggest economy, Mr. Kibaki's party, the National Rainbow Coalition, defeated the Kenya African National Union, which had ruled Kenya for nearly 40 years. Kenya's economic performance had lagged badly in recent years, dragged down by years of corruption and mismanagement under the country's former ruler, Daniel arap Moi. 
 Mr. Kibaki won the December election on a platform of free primary education, a new constitution, zero tolerance of corruption and the creation of 500,000 new jobs every year in a bid to revive an economy that grew by only 0.9 percent in 2002.
Opinion polls published in Kenyan newspapers on Tuesday showed that a majority of respondents said they believed the country was headed in the right direction. Many more Kenyans have cheered the start of free primary education. But Mr. Kibaki's critics say that he has not delivered on his promise of new jobs.
Internal power wrangles in Mr. Kibaki's coalition have also sown widespread public doubts that the party is sincere in implementing its election pledges.
"We have made promises and are in the process of keeping them," Mr. Kibaki said in a taped speech that isto be broadcast later on radio and television. "Where there are delays, these are sincere. We are not a government that makes promises it does not intend to keep."
Mr. Kibaki took credit for reforms already introduced by his administration, especially the start of free primary education. He said this had added 1.6 million new pupils to the national school system, bringing the total to 7.5 million.
He said that institutions that had been dogged by allegations of corruption during the Moi era, particularly the judiciary, were also being cleaned up.
Mr. Kibaki stressed that the greatest changes so far had been in public attitudes. "The most important transformation in Kenya over the last one hundred days has been in the minds and hearts of the Kenyan people," he said. "We have seen a renewal of their confidence in the future."
Mr. Kibaki said he had established an important precedent by allowing his cabinet ministers to work without undue interference. Most Kenyans had criticized Mr. Moi for overruling his ministers on key issues, undermining their authority.
On employment, Mr. Kibaki said 4,000 new jobs had been created so far under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which provides duty free access to the United States for a wide range of export products from 38 eligible African states.
Another 3,000 jobs had been created in the economy at large, Mr. Kibaki said. But that was a far cry from the 500,000 jobs he said he would create in his first year.
"Quite honestly, the promise for 500,000 jobs was a nice thought but totally unrealistic and unattainable in this economy for now," said Robert Shaw, a Nairobi businessman and columnist.
There was little prospect of widespread job creation in the immediate future, economic observers said. "So far there is no change on the ground, economic growth is hardly visible and people's purchasing power is still very low," said Manga Mugwe, chairman of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Cuba Confirms Sentencing Dozens of Pro-Democracy Dissidents 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: HAVANA, April 9 

 BODY:
Cuba confirmed today that dozens of dissidents who were arrested last month had been sentenced to prison terms of up to 28 years.
 In the first official statement on the trials of 78 opponents of President Fidel Castro rounded up since March 18, the Justice Ministry said the sentences ranged from 6 to 28 years. 
 The dissidents were convicted of "mercenary activities and other acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the Cuban state," said a ministry statement published on the front page of Granma, the Communist Party daily. 
After the largest wave of arrests in decades in Cuba, the authorities charged the dissidents with plotting with United States diplomats to subvert Cuba's government. Leading dissidents, democracy and rights activists and opposition journalists were arrested in their homes. The houses were searched by the police, who seized computers, typewriters, fax machines and books.
Many of the dissidents had attended meetings at the residence of the top United States diplomat in Havana, James Cason, who had increased support for the island's small but growing opposition movement, in line with the Bush administration's harder push for political change in Cuba.
A White House spokesman denounced the crackdown today.
"The president remains deeply troubled by the wave of repression and the long prison sentences handed down to Cuba's pro-democracy and human rights activists," said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
"The Castro regime's arrest, prosecution and sentencing of these brave and peaceful activists are repugnant reminders that the Castro regime remains a totalitarian blight in an otherwise peaceful and democratic hemisphere."
The toughest sentences were for independent journalists -- 28 were arrested -- and organizers of the Varela Project, a petition for democratic reforms that gathered more than 11,000 signatures last year.
The initiative's leader, Oswaldo Paya, who won the European Union's top human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, in December, was not arrested, but his organization, the first nationwide opposition network, was dismembered in the roundup.
Luis Enrique Ferrer, a local coordinator in the city of Las Tunas for the Varela Project, was sentenced to 28 years in prison, the stiffest sentence, the Cuban Human Rights Commission said.
Cuba's best-known dissident poet, writer and journalist, Raul Rivero, 57, and the economist Martha Beatriz Roque, the only woman put on trial, received 20-year sentences.
International rights groups said the sentences given after one-day trials by improvised courts, where undercover agents who had infiltrated the dissident groups were produced as witnesses, was a throwback to Stalin-era proceedings.
Amnesty International called the jailings appalling and "a giant step backwards for human rights" in Cuba.
The Castro government was undeterred by an outpouring of criticism from foreign governments and rights groups and insisted that the dissidents were a tool of its longtime ideological foe, the United States.
The wives of jailed dissidents said they had three days to appeal, but they were not hopeful the sentences could be changed. "These terms were dictated by President Castro," Mr. Rivero's wife, Blanca Reyes, said after hearing his sentence on Monday. "In Cuba there is only one voice. This is like a Roman circus."

PERSON: Dwight C. Johnson 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Fund-Raiser Who Bridges Racial Borders

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
A CLOSE friend of Dwight C. Johnson's told him recently that she finally gets him, how he manages to assemble people like George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and David N. Dinkins under one roof, as he did Monday night. He is the president of the Black Alumni of Pratt Institute, which raises money for low-income black and Latino students.
 "She says, 'Dwight, you make people want to be a part of what you're involved in, then you make them empty their pockets,' " recalls Mr. Johnson, a graphic designer, from a cramped apartment on Lexington Avenue near 31st Street that doubles as his office. 
 Then again, maybe the light sabers figure into the equation. More than 70 boxes of the Star Wars sabers were piled high in Mr. Johnson's apartment on the eve of the alumni group's 12th annual scholarship benefit Monday at the Waldorf-Astoria. There were so many sabers, donated for the 250 guests by the maker of the toy, Hasbro, that some were stacked in Mr. Johnson's bathtub.
At a time of challenges to affirmative action on college campuses, when the economic climate is frightful, Mr. Johnson has quietly built a reputation for crossing racial and economic borders to diversify his alma mater.
In Monday's slush and snow, Mr. Johnson, who is 53, raised $260,000 at the black-tie affair, in which James Earl Jones was the M.C. Brooke Astor, who is a major benefactor for the group, did not brave the weather, but Mr. Johnson lunched with her last month at the Four Seasons restaurant in honor of her 101st birthday. An annual award, which she presented at last year's benefit, is given in her name.
So how does Mr. Johnson do it? He's corralling people who tend not to be straphangers on the G train to Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, where Pratt, the private art and design school, has its main campus.
Mr. Johnson seems a bit taken aback. He says he merely writes a note or reaches out. "It seems they are waiting to be brought in," he says. He got in touch with Mr. Lucas, who was honored on Monday, through a Web site, then e-mailed his office.
"Everybody thought I was out of my mind," Mr. Johnson says. "I do it from the heart. If this was something for myself, I couldn't do it."
As Mr. Johnson tells it, he had his first meeting about five years ago with Mrs. Astor after she wrote him on blue Tiffany note paper, suggesting a meeting. He says she was on his group's mailing list. He took a bouquet of flowers to her office and asked her to read one of her poems. (He says Osborn Elliott, the chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City and former editor of Newsweek, had told him she wrote poetry, and that he would be wise to ask her to read one.) 
When Mrs. Astor finished, Mr. Johnson says he stood, applauding with two hearty bravos. She asked how much his group needed. He told her that $50,000 would be nice. Thus started the alumni group's endowment, now at $1 million.
On a recent day, Mr. Johnson's apartment is packed with 10 young volunteers, mostly Pratt students and graduates. They are labeling boxes of giveaways for the fund-raiser, confirming reservations, revising table listings on computers. Mr. Johnson goes to a back room that looks like an office. Up high, above a wall of closets, are two fluffy pillows. Mr. Johnson, who is single, sleeps on a Murphy bed.
He says he took a sabbatical two years ago from Pratt, where he is a full-time professor in the School of Art and Design, to start his own design and marketing business. He volunteers for the alumni group.
Trimly built with a light mustache, Mr. Johnson has a big gusty laugh and old-fashioned manners as he serves tea. He is dressed in a three-button Jil Sander suit and a blue shirt with gold cuff links.
He is relaxed even when a nerve-racking call comes in from the Waldorf, informing him that lunch will cost $50 a sandwich for the technical crew putting up the stage. He takes in the information, calmly, then says the crew will grab lunch outside the hotel. He hangs up, chuckling.
MR. JOHNSON grew up in Detroit, the son of a Chrysler factory worker. His mother worked as a secretary in a synagogue. "I can remember we were on public assistance and we always had to make do with what we had," he says. He says he was a quiet, shy youth, always drawing and making sculptures. He was desperate to attend Cass Technical High School, a revered institution in Detroit that was attended by Diana Ross, but failed its entrance exam on his first try.
"I'm not a multiple-choice person," Mr. Johnson says.
He says his mother found him a tutor through the synagogue where she worked, and he surreptitiously got a copy of the exam. As it turns out, he was tested on a different version of the exam. "I was scared to death." Still, he passed and went to Cass, then received a one-year scholarship to Pratt from Scholastic magazine.
He says he thinks of his own struggles when he is asked why he devotes his free time to the alumni group, which has supported more than 300 students. 
"These students are me," he says. "I know how hard it was for me to go to Pratt. I came up here with a scholarship and I did maintenance work in the evenings and sold women's shoes. I had to struggle. I'm willing to help others. It's my responsibility. It's our responsibility. And if I'm an example, let it be."

HEADLINE: Competing for Work in Postwar Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
The roster of United States companies that have received potentially lucrative contracts for work in the Iraq region continues to grow despite a demand this week by Democrats in Congress for an independent review of the process for awarding such deals.
 The most recent winners, for work that could total as much as $300 million, are the Fluor Corporation, based in Aliso Viejo, Calif.; Washington Group International, in Boise, Idaho; and the Parini Corporation, in Framingham, Mass. Last week, each company received a contract from the Army Corps of Engineers to provide up to $100 million worth of work to the military in the region. The tasks could include repairing roads and bridges, replacing damaged windows and doors and building barracks for military personnel. 
 According to unsuccessful bidders, the Raytheon Corporation in Lexington, Mass., and the Kellogg, Brown & Root unit of the Halliburton Corporation in Houston have received a $30 million contract from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to dismantle and neutralize any chemical or nuclear weapons found in the region. Neither Raytheon nor the agency would confirm any contract.
But there is still no word on who will win the grand prize in the current round of bidding: a wide-ranging $600 million reconstruction contract that will be awarded by the United States Agency for International Development. The contract will cover early work on rebuilding Iraq's essential infrastructure, including airports, roads, water and power systems, schools and hospitals. The agency previously said it had narrowed the bidders to two finalists and would announce a decision by the end of last week.
The Bechtel Group of San Francisco and Fluor have both been mentioned as finalists, although neither the companies nor the agency would confirm that status. But an executive of the Parsons Corporation in Pasadena, Calif., said that her company had not been eliminated from consideration.
And although Halliburton announced publicly last week that it had not bid to be the lead contractor on the work, other bidders say that Halliburton is named in procurement documents as an integral subcontractor in the Parsons bid. Neither company would confirm that arrangement, but Halliburton's latest public statement on the contract noted that the company remained "a potential subcontractor."
Last month, Halliburton received an open-ended contract from the government to extinguish oil well fires in southern Iraq, along with subcontractors Boots & Coots and Wild Well Control.
That contract was specifically cited in the Congressional request this week for an independent review of the procurement process by which as much as $25 billion could ultimately be awarded for reconstruction in Iraq.
On Tuesday, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and John D. Dingell of Michigan, both Democrats, asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to investigate whether Halliburton "has received special treatment from the administration over the past two years in the awarding of Defense Department contracts," including the oil fire contract.
They noted that Vice President Dick Cheney served as chief executive of Halliburton from 1995 until 2000 and is still eligible for some deferred compensation from the company. But they also cited numerous government investigations of Halliburton's work on previous government projects and its accounting for cost overruns on some of its long-term contracts.
The congressmen also asked the accounting office to conduct a more wide-ranging investigation of how the aid agency and the Pentagon have handled the bidding process so far. They specifically expressed concern about how specific companies were invited to submit bids without public notice, what information was provided to Congress about the process and whether the details of the bidding process were "properly kept secret." 
The aid agency has defended its procedures, saying that some degree of secrecy and selectivity was necessary because of the military situation in Iraq.
It is not clear whether the investigation will further delay the award of the pending reconstruction contract. The agency has already awarded two other small contracts for work in Iraq, a $4.8 million award to Stevedoring Services of America to operate the important port of Umm Qasr in southern Iraq, and a $7.1 million contract to the International Resources Group to provide coordination and monitoring services to the agency as it oversees the work in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Must What Goes Up Also Come Down? 

BYLINE:  By Solomon Volkov; Solomon Volkov is author of "St. Petersburg: A Cultural History."

 BODY:
It is almost certain that the toppling yesterday of Saddam Hussein's giant statue in the center of Baghdad will be considered in retrospect as one of the iconic images of the present war in Iraq. As I watched this scene unfolding on television, similar episodes from the not-so-distant yet already faintly hazy past, sprang to my mind.
 First, of course, there was the 1989 demolition of the Berlin Wall, which for years divided Germany into the socialist East and the capitalist West. Watching that evening unfold on TV, one could feel the almost palpable physical excitement as youthful drunks madly clawed and hammered away at the hated symbol of this enforced division. 
 Then, on an August night in 1991, another statue came down. This time it was a bronze of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the founderof the Soviet secret police, which had presided over central Moscow since 1958. One saw the same excitement but markedly less merriment, and the crowd looked more mature, even sober. They had thought ahead, going to the trouble of bringing along five cranes for the job. These people were exacting what felt like an intellectual revenge for the years of living in fear, of being able to talk candidly only with trusted friends -- and then only in a whisper. 
A parenthetical thought: lately, parallels have been drawn in the press between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the repressive Communists who ruled Russia. I think an important difference between the two regimes was revealed when the solidity of the comparative statues was tested. The Soviet one had to be dragged away with much effort, exertion, etc. And when it came down, it came down in one piece. In contrast, the Iraqi monument toppled quite easily. And when it did, it broke apart, leaving the hollow boots of the dictator on the pedestal. Of course, the statue's quick demise could be attributed to the superiority of American equipment and expertise, which seem to be in plentiful supply in Baghdad these days.
Compared to the events in Berlin and Moscow, the crashing of Mr. Hussein's statue was a much more modest affair. One got the feeling that the dancing, shirtless men didn't extend too far beyond the camera's eye. This is probably not such a bad thing, because big symbolic gestures, while immensely satisfying at the time, rarely live up to their promise. This is certainly true with regard to Germany, where almost 14 years after the fall of the wall, the economic and psychological division between East and West endures.
As for Russia, there is now persistent talk coming from Moscow's conservative mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, that the statue of Dzerzhinsky (which conveniently survived intact and has been living a quiet life in a Moscow park) should be returned to its former home -- a traffic island in front of the headquarters of the former K.G.B. and its successor, the Federal Security Services. The liberal intelligentsia, of course, vehemently objects to the resurrection. But with polls showing that more and more Russians are looking on the Soviet past with fondness, there is a distinct possibility that one day we will see the once-toppled monument back at the heart of Moscow, gazing imperiously at passers-by.
And if this happened, one question in particular would gnaw at me: is it possible that among those who restored the statue, there were also some who helped to bring it down?

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Sues 4 Countries, Saying They Owe City $100 Million 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Turning from a budget crisis to the troubled world of international diplomacy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city was suing four foreign governments that own Manhattan property for failure to pay real estate taxes.
 The suits seek more than $100 million in back taxes, interest and other charges from Turkey, the Philippines, India and Mongolia, claiming that for years they have used properties for housing or commercial enterprises that make them fully taxable. 
 City law stipulates that foreign governments are exempt from real estate taxes only on property used as missions or consulates. 
While Mayor Bloomberg has sought to foster warm relations with the United Nations because of its huge contribution to the city's economy and prestige, the legal actions announced yesterday make clear that City Hall will not pass up potential windfalls.
"Although we are proud to be the host of the United Nations, one thing we simply cannot afford is to be taken advantage of by our guests," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
Officials of the four governments either refused to comment or did not respond to telephone messages.
"Ask me about what is happening in northern Iraq, and I will have a response," said one Turkish diplomat at the United Nations. "Taxes are not my responsibility." 
Aides to the mayor said the lawsuits, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, follow months of discussions in which the city hoped to collect the back taxes without lawsuits.
They described the lawsuits as the first in which the city challenged the use of foreign government real estate for business or housing purposes.
The lawsuits seek the largest amount, $70 million, from Turkey, which the city claims is in arrears for more than 20 years of taxes on 821 United Nations Plaza, which it says is used for commercial purposes.
The complaint against the Philippines seeks $17.7 for use of a building at 556 Fifth Avenue from 1974 to 1996 by Philippine National Bank, Philippine Airlines and a restaurant.
The city is seeking $16.4 million from India for 235 East 43rd Street, which the city says was used for living quarters for people other than the head of India's mission or consulate. A similar claim is made against Mongolia for $2.1 million in taxes for a building at 6 East 77th Street.

HEADLINE: Jubilant V-I Day 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Like newly freed Parisians tossing flowers at Allied tanks; like newly freed Germans tearing down the Berlin Wall; like newly freed Russians pulling down the statue of the hated secret police chief in Dzerzhinsky Square, the newly freed Iraqis toppled the figure of their tyrant and ground their shoes into the face of Saddam Hussein. 
 All these pictures flow together in the farrago of freedom's victories over despotism in the past two generations. Just as video of human suffering understandably triggers demonstrations against any war, unforgettable images of the jubilation of enslaved people tasting liberty drive home the wisdom of just wars. 
 Even in the flush of triumph, doubts will be raised. Where are the supplies of germs and poison gas and plans for nukes to justify pre-emption? (Freed scientists will lead us to caches no inspectors could find.) What about remaining danger from Baathist torturers and war criminals forming pockets of resistance and plotting vengeance? (Their death wish is our command.) 
The most insulting question is this: Considering their Islamist religious schisms and tribal hatreds, their tradition of monarchy and obedience to dictatorial regimes, their turbulent "street" easily inflamed by demagogues -- how can any population of Arabs be entrusted with democracy?
The answer to that is the experiment on which Iraq is now embarked. Iraqis start with the advantages of being literate and extravagantly oil-rich, and most aren't fundamentalist.
If Iraqis are able to adopt a system of free enterprise and representative government, they will become the center of an arc of freedom from Turkey in the north to Israel in the south (with Lebanon freed from Syrian occupation, if France will liberate the state it created). Egypt, the largest Arab nation, could not long resist such a tidal wave of liberty.
A parade of former U.S. ambassadors to Arab nations pooh-poohs this vision, deriding the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz idealists as the four horsemen of hubris.
But consider one example of a big segment of Iraq's population that proved willing to ally itself wholeheartedly with the coalition, and showed under fire its eagerness to make sacrifices for its freedom.
Nobody came out of this war more nobly than the 3.5 million long-suffering Kurds of Iraq. After Gulf War I, we at first left them to the poison-gas savagery of Saddam, then expiated that sin by providing them air cover for the next decade. In that time, this ethnic group built a model state: a lively parliament, schools, hospitals, a thriving economy built on farming and a little smuggling on the side.
Their rival leaders, Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, realized that what they call "our friends to the north" -- the Turks -- suspected a plot to declare an independent Kurdistan, which might encourage Turkey's Kurdish minority to break away. 
Because the U.S. believed that we would get Turkey's cooperation against Saddam, we refused to arm the Kurds, even though they were under attack from terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda. Despite this, when we launched our invasion, the 70,000 Kurdish pesh merga troops volunteered to serve in the coalition under the command of our small airborne units in the north. The Kurds were and still are the only indigenous force fighting against Saddam's regime.
One tragic test of loyalty came last week when one of our aircraft mistakenly bombed a convoy carrying pesh merga to engage Saddam's troops. Nineteen Kurds died, with two of the Barzani clan wounded. A Barzani aide, Hoshyar Zabari, told me by cellphone afterward: "We do not blame anyone. This happens in war. We are fighting together for our freedom."
That's an ally. The Kurds have decided their cultural autonomy -- and their future safety -- lies not in independence but as part of Iraq's new confederation, with its capital Baghdad. "We will always retain our Kurdish identity, but we are Iraqis," emphasized Barham Salih, Mr. Talabani's prime minister.
My guess is that the urbane Mr. Talabani will serve in Iraq's national government, with the locally rooted Mr. Barzani in its regional capital in the north. They have learned how democracy works, and have earned a seat at the governing table. They also know, and will bear witness to their Iraqi compatriots in this great experiment, that the U.S. and Britain are freedom's best friends.

HEADLINE: A SATELLITE EMPIRE: THE DEAL; 
NewsCorp. Adds to Empire With Control of DirecTV

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Completing the final piece in Rupert Murdoch's global satellite empire, the News Corporation agreed yesterday to buy control of Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV satellite operation from General Motors in a deal valued at $6.6 billion.
 The deal will give Mr. Murdoch even more power in determining what programs are beamed to television sets across the United States and how much consumers pay for them. 
 With the addition of DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite operator with 11 million subscribers, the News Corporation will become one of only a few media companies in the nation, among them AOL Time Warner, that both create television programs and distribute them. The News Corporation owns the Fox Network and dozens of local affiliates as well as the increasingly powerful Fox News Channel and a clutch of heavily watched regional Fox Sports networks. 
Mr. Murdoch, the chairman and controlling shareholder of the News Corporation, is expected to start a pricing war with cable companies that could benefit consumers. His control of DirecTV will also give him substantial leverage to defend his programming business against pressure from a consolidating cable industry and, critics contend, possibly even squeeze his cable rivals by raising the prices they pay for his programs.
"We can help make satellite TV a viable competitor to cable," Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call last night. "More programming options, richer content and compelling new technologies will give satellite TV the best chance to break cable's hold on viewers."
The deal ends nearly three years of bidding wars, changing alliances and regulatory jockeying as Mr. Murdoch has sought to take over DirecTV in an effort to make the News Corporation the dominant television distributor in the world, with satellite operations serving more than 100 million households in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America.
"I've always felt for years that if you're in the content creation business, you must be somewhere in the distribution business to make sure you're not wasting your efforts and your money," Mr. Murdoch said on Fox News.
In 2001, Mr. Murdoch lost a bidding contest for control of Hughes to EchoStar Communications, the nation's second-largest satellite operator. That deal was rejected by regulators late last year after Mr. Murdoch waged a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign -- circulating a 123-page volume opposing the deal called "The Essential Guide to the EchoStar/DirecTV Deal" around Washington -- to block the agreement, giving him a second chance.
Of course, the News Corporation's deal for Hughes will also require the approval of regulators, including the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, and some consumer groups are already calling for this deal to be blocked as well. But unlike the deal with EchoStar, which would have combined the nation's two largest satellite television companies, legal experts suggest that the deal with the News Corporation will be approved because the company does not already compete in the satellite distribution business in the United States.
The News Corporation's offer for Hughes is significantly lower than the amount it offered in the 2001 bidding war -- a deal worth about $22.5 billion -- calling into question the decision by General Motors, which controlled Hughes, to accept EchoStar's offer when it knew the chances of that deal's being blocked were high. This time around, there was only one bidder.
Rick Wagoner Jr., chief exective of G.M., contended in a conference call yesterday that "the economic value is roughly the same" from this deal with the News Corporation, compared with its offer in 2001, but he declined to explain his math. A banker who worked on the transaction laughed when he heard of Mr. Wagoner's comments.
Under the terms of the deal, which must be approved by Hughes shareholders, the News Corporation would buy G.M.'s 19.9 percent stake in Hughes for $14 a share, or $3.8 billion. Of that amount, at least $3.1 billion would be paid in cash, with the rest in News Corporation publicly traded securities.
The company would then make a tender offer for 14.1 percent of the publicly traded Hughes shares for $14 a share in cash or News Corporation securities.
The price represents a 22 percent premium over Hughes's stock price, which closed yesterday at $11.48, down 2 cents, before the deal was formally announced. The shares, which trade as a G.M. tracking stock, edged up to $11.60 after hours. The News Corporation's American depository receipts ended regular trading down 66 cents, at $27.22. G.M. closed down 25 cents, at $34.48. 
G.M. is planning to use the cash it receives from the deal to reduce its debt and strengthen its balance sheet.
The News Corporation would end up controlling 34 percent of Hughes, while the General Motors Pension Trust, which is separate from G.M., would continue to own 21 percent and the public would own the remaining 45 percent. Hughes will eventually be folded into the Fox Entertainment Group.
It is unclear what the effect of the deal will be on consumers, but some are crying foul.
"Hold on to your wallet," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group that supported the EchoStar-Hughes deal. "Prices will go through the roof." 
Mr. Kimmelman said he was worried that the News Corporation would raise programming fees for cable operators by threatening to pull his networks off their systems, pushing cable prices for subscribers even higher.
"He has no incentive to price-compete against cable as long they pay a hefty fee for his programming," Mr. Kimmelman said.
The News Corporation disputes that contention and says that any price increases will have to be passed on to DirecTV as well, making higher programming prices less attractive.
"We have every intention of being a fair player," Mr. Murdoch said.
The News Corporation already owns satellite networks around the world, giving it considerably more influence when negotiating to buy satellite-receiving dishes, set-top boxes and other gear. That could enable DirecTV to substantially lower the average cost of acquiring each new customer, now estimated at more than $500 a household. 
Mr. Murdoch also expects to expand the DirecTV subscriber base by aggressively marketing the service through his Fox TV outlets. And he will be able to eliminate Hughes's middleman status and reap the revenue directly each time a DirecTV viewer watches one of the News Corporation's 20th Century Fox films on pay per view.
Mr. Murdoch is hoping to repeat the success he has had with British Sky Broadcasting with DirecTV. He has turned BSkyB into the largest pay television operator in Britain by offering exclusive programming, like soccer matches, and has led the field in offering interactive services, like different camera angles for sporting events. It also offers programmable video recorders like the popular TiVo service.
G.M. said that Mr. Murdoch would become chairman of Hughes and that Chase Carey, the News Corporation's former co-chief operating officer, would be president and chief executive. Eddy Hartenstein, senior executive vice president of Hughes, will be vice chairman of Hughes. 
An army of investment bankers and lawyers worked on the deal, many for more than three years. Indeed, half a dozen investment banks have worked on the transaction for little or no money because they are paid only after a deal is completed. Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as financial advisers to the News Corporation, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Hogan & Hartson and Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis provided legal advice.
Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns acted as financial advisers to G.M., and Jenner & Block; Kirkland & Ellis; and Richards, Layton & Finger provided legal advice.
Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial advisers to Hughes Electronics and Weil, Gotshal & Manges; Latham & Watkins; Wiley, Rein & Fielding; and Jones Day provided legal advice.

HEADLINE: Welfare Veto Is Overridden By Council 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN and NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
Over the veto of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the City Council passed legislation yesterday that would significantly soften the welfare-to-work policies that became New York City's trademark during the Giuliani administration.
 The legislation, which passed 46 to 5 yesterday, has long been on the wish list of advocates for the poor who say the work requirements in the city's welfare programs are too harsh, particularly in a weak economy. And the Council's ability to override Mayor Bloomberg's veto so easily suggests that he does not wield the same influence over the Council as his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who made overhaul of welfare a signature issue. 
 The broadly drawn legislation, first passed in February, would give almost everyone on the welfare rolls a right to at least some education and training -- something that is now largely at the discretion of the Human Resources Administration. The law would also greatly increase the number of hours of education that recipients could count toward federal and state work requirements. In the case of recipients approved for college programs, it could be as high as 35 hours a week. 
Mr. Bloomberg, who vetoed the bill on March 14, criticized the override yesterday. He said the bill would cost the city millions of dollars it could ill afford in the midst of a budget crisis, because it would lead to federal penalties tied to minimum work requirements. He vowed to challenge the law in court, meaning that it could be some time before the law takes effect.
"Their actions fly in the face of research, experience and common sense," Mr. Bloomberg said in astatement. "The requirement to work is an indispensable component of welfare reform. It ends the cycle of dependency, which ruins too many lives and creates self-sufficiency in its place." 
He said the Council had chosen "to turn back the clock on welfare reform, reviving a dated, discredited policy that we long ago learned was a failure."
The bill would seem to put the City Council on an ideological collision course with the Bush administration and Congress, which is expected to pass legislation this year tightening federal work requirements further. 
In 1996, after the federal government made historical changes to welfare laws, giving local governments more power over disbursing funds, the Giuliani administration started an aggressive policy of forcing able-bodied recipients to work for their checks. The results were stunning. In subsequent years, the rolls dropped by almost 800,000 people.
Many experts viewed New York's law as a success. Child poverty decreased, income of women who left the rolls increased, and even after the economy soured in 2000 the rolls continued to shrink.
Advocates of the poor, however, have long insisted that the work requirements could be punitive. Welfare recipients who were illiterate or just weeks short of finishing high school degrees were forced to sweep parks and pick up litter, instead of finishing training that would give them higher paying jobs, the advocates said.
They argued that the best chance for welfare recipients to stay employed and to be employed at a decent wage was more education and training.
"We've achieved a lot, but one of the weakest parts of the city's program remains the fact that most welfare recipients get very little preparation for the realities of the private sector economy," said Bill de Blasio, a Brooklyn councilman who was a prime sponsor of the bill.
Mr. de Blasio said he expected the new law to complement current policy. "Most people will continue to do the type of workfare and other programs that already exist," he said. "But some will show initiative to pursue training and education, and those who can find the funding to do that should have the right to do so."
The bill allows almost any recipient on the rolls to demand that some kind of education be part of a work plan, eliminating the administration's discretion. The bill also eliminates a 20-hour work requirement, the cornerstone of the current program, and instead allows an individualized mixture of work and education to equal 35 hours a week. Those seeking college degrees would also be allowed to count study time.
Citing its own academic experts and reports, the Bloomberg administration said that education and training worked best to improve the economic potential of recipients if they were in conjunction with concrete work requirements. "The concurrent model is the best approach to get people on the road to self-sufficiency," said Frank Sobrino, a Human Resources spokesman. "This is not mean-spirited or arbitrary -- it is what works."
Former officials of the Giuliani administration said the new law was reminiscent of days when welfare recipients would enroll in education classes but not attend them or ever enter the work force.
"If they aren't confrontational and actually implement it, there is significant risk that people won't work and we will see the welfare roles begin to climb again," said Mark Hoover, a deputy commissioner under Mr. Giuliani.
The bill contains measures meant to prevent such an outcome, including attendance requirements and a demand that recipients keep up at least a C average.
Those requirements, combined with the fact that the Council allocated no new money for the training and education it was permitting, led council members to predict that only a small percentage of those on the rolls would actually seek to take advantage of its provisions.
In addition to the work training bill, the Council also overrode Mr. Bloomberg's vetoes of three other bills. Two will provide women greater access to emergency contraceptives.
The third will require the city's schools chancellor to provide detailed quarterly reports on the status of all school construction projects, a sore subject with council members who have tried to track long-delayed projects and cost overruns. 
Legislators said the law would provide much-needed oversight. "The message is you can't take the public out of public education," said Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz, the chairwoman of the Education Committee.
But the welfare debate stirred the strongest emotions. An opponent of the bill, Councilwoman Madeline Provenzano of the Bronx, was booed by welfare advocates in the balcony of the Council chamber. Speaking into a microphone that suddenly stopped working, Ms. Provenzano, who is white, was heard to say, "You people need to get jobs, not be in school." She later insisted to reporters that she did not use the phrase "you people," which some of her colleagues said was racially insensitive.
She said, "I am sure that I did not say it. If it was interpreted that way, if someone thought they heard me say that, yes, I'm sorry. But I know I would never use that."
But Councilman Leroy Comrie, the deputy majority whip, who was sitting next to her, said that she did. Mr. Comrie, who is black, said he heard her say, "You people should be at work and not at City Hall." But he added that Ms. Provenzano, who as a single mother put herself through college while raising four children, was frustrated by the passage of the bill. "Madeline was having a bad day," he said. "I don't think she meant it racially."

HEADLINE: Pressure Building on State To Close City's Budget Gap 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
For weeks, budget experts, lawmakers and the state's fiscal monitor have been urging Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to get his fiscal house in order, warning that his proposed budget for the next fiscal year was too reliant on help from Albany that was never going to come through.
 But now, the criticism, and the call for ideas to assist the city in its climb out of a $3.4 billion budget hole, has begun to focus on Albany. In just the last week, some business leaders in the city drafted a letter to Gov. George E. Pataki urging him to consider imposing a commuter tax, the proposal at the heart of Mr. Bloomberg's budget plan. 
 City labor leaders have scurried to Albany to plead their case. And plans for demonstrations in the state capital -- street theater often reserved for the steps of City Hall -- are well under way. 
In many ways, the shift of the focus from New York to Albany is a return to familiar budget territory. But it also appears that some groups are beginning to cotton to what Mr. Bloomberg has been saying for weeks: that the city has done all that it can within its control to manage its fiscal crisis -- raising property taxes, cutting agencies and laying off workers. Others want to block more dire consequences, and see the state as the obvious mitigator.
Indeed, it is self-interest, rather than an affinity for Mr. Bloomberg, that is driving the process. Labor leaders are faced with layoffs -- more than 5,000, according to a recent announcement from City Hall. Schools and health care systems are facing drastic cuts in state aid, and business leaders are fretting that Albany's inaction will mean further local tax increases, driving business out of the city.
"I think people have figured out that the state can solve its budget problems by pushing them down to localities," said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a consortium of business leaders. 
Members of the partnership wrote the letter to the governor that strongly supported reinstating a commuter tax. The members had planned to publish the letter but refrained at Mr. Pataki's request. 
Many former pleas are morphing into angry demands. This week, the City Council came up with its own commuter tax proposal, and argued vehemently that New York should hold off on cutting services until Albany gives it more money.
And Mr. Bloomberg, whose usual budget discourse consists of saying over and over again how helpful he knows Albany will be, has subtly ratcheted up his own language, standing firm as the governor tried to get a large portion of security money working its way through Congress for New York's security costs. 
Yesterday, the mayor sent a letter to Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders stating, in blunt language, that draconian cuts would be the result of a failure to get a "mutually acceptable program of revenue and aid relief from Albany."
Mr. Bloomberg is expected to lay the onus on Albany once again in his budget address next week. 
"The city from Day 1 has been talking about how big the problem is," Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw said yesterday in an interview. "We did the labor part and the property tax part. The stuff that didn't need state action has been done. State help is the only part that is not done yet."
New York City is extremely limited in what it can do with its own budget. The only tax it can raise without legislative approval is the property tax -- which already was raised 18.5 percent -- and much of its expenditures are state or federally mandated. Even federal aid that is earmarked for the city goes through Albany, which often helps itself to some before the rest makes its way into local government coffers. 
What Mr. Bloomberg wants is for Albany to allow him to tax commuters at the same rates that city residents would pay, with a top rate of 2.7 percent. He also wants Mr. Pataki to abandon plans to cut more than $700 million in education aid to the city.
A protest against education cuts in Albany is planned for May 3.
Part of the stepped-up call for Albany's help stems from timing. Both the city and state are at the same time furiously trying to agree on budgets, and quickly, that close enormous gaps. The mayor sees his deadline as next week, when he gives his budget address. State leaders also see next week as crucial, hoping to make a deal before localities must bring their school budgets to a vote.
The state's two top legislative leaders are still matching up priorities on how to restore billions of dollars in cuts to education and health care the governor wants. 
"
If real progress is not made soon, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said, he is willing to work out a budget solely with Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. The governor is likely to veto that product and spark a fierce fight for override votes.
Yesterday, after an hourlong meeting with Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver, Mr. Pataki emerged with no budget progress to report but said he thought a budget needed to be in place by April 25. If it is not, he said, he will continue to run the state, using emergency bills.
The governor, asked about city aid, said he recognized the city's plight but that there were alternatives to tax increases, some of which he said he endorses, others not.
"Well, all of us, the Senate, the Assembly, and certainly myself understand that it is not just the state that has a fiscal problem, the city does, too," Mr. Pataki said. "And we are working to try to come up with ways to help the city deal with that fiscal problem. We are looking at ideas, some of which come from the city, some of which come from the Assembly, some of which come from the Senate, some of which come from me, some of which come from outside sources, to see how we can, without having the commuter tax, help the mayor." A memo from Pataki officials outlined some of the alternative proposals that have been floated as ways to help the city raise money, including a plan to transfer private bus operations to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- which is already in the city budget. Another idea was to extend the mortgage-recording tax to co-ops.
In recent weeks, labor leaders have increased their visits to Albany to press their case with lawmakers, arguing that cuts to the labor force, particularly in areas of public safety, would damage New York City, with economic ramifications for upstate.
"I have to avert these layoffs at my front door," said Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association. "I think it is a matter of people using all of their options now and not just concentrating on the city."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: COMBAT TECHNOLOGY; 
A War Like No Other Uses New 21st-Century Methods To Disable Enemy Forces

BYLINE:  By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. and THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
The march on Baghdad exemplifies 21st-century warfare, allied commanders and outside military experts say: swift, agile and decisive, employing overpowering technology to bring relentless violence to bear in many places at once.
 "The superior technology we now possess is, perhaps, the most obvious difference between the gulf war and the present conflict," Vice President Dick Cheney, who was the secretary of defense 12 years ago, said today. 
 In the 1991 Persian Gulf war, only one combat aircraft in five could drop a bomb on a target sighted by a laser; today they all can, Mr. Cheney said.
Only 9 percent of the weapons dropped in the 1991 war were precision-guided; for this war, air combat officials based in Saudi Arabia said today that a total of 15,000 precision-guided munitions and 7,500 unguided bombs had been dropped thus far. When added to more than 750 cruise missiles, the percentage of precision munitions used in the war is 68 percent. 
Then, a strike might happen two days after a reconnaissance plane photographed a target; now it sometimes happens in an instant.
Commanders, Mr. Cheney said, then used "maps, grease pencils and radio reports" to plot movements. Now, even in combat vehicles, they click with mouses and watch the war unfold on video displays.
But the most important element that technology offered the war's planners was an entirely new way of thinking about modern warfare.
Strikingly, top commanders appear to have vanquished the idea that generals always fight the last war. They took only small pieces from the lessons learned from wars as recent as the victory in Afghanistan, as celebrated as the first gulf war, as odious as Vietnam or as defining as World War II.
Air Marshal Brian K. Burridge, the commander of British forces in the American-led coalition, called this three-week campaign "something that military historians and academics will pore over in great detail for many years to come."
Even as senior Pentagon officials warned today that tough fighting lies ahead -- and the specter of unexpected chemical attack lingers -- they could not disguise their glee at the way things were playing out.
"It's not a matter for me to be vindicated," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today, crediting his generals for developing a plan that was criticized during the past few weeks by armchair generals -- and even by anonymous officials inside the military. "The outcome is in the process of speaking for itself."
The technological advantage at the heart of the American advance was not just a matter of smarter bombs and stronger armor, officials said, though these cannot be discounted -- nor can the training of the troops.
New surveillance methods -- whether using drones, spy planes, or satellites -- were used only by one side in this war, feeding round-the-clock intelligence back day and night, through smoke and sandstorms. And intelligence about the enemy and its leadership, though still imperfect, was impressive.
Dr. Stephen A. Cambone, recently confirmed by the Senate to a newly created post managing all Pentagon intelligence, said in an interview that the tight coupling of intelligence with an increasingly agile military has become more decisive than ever, on a par with traditional skills like artillery, close air support, urban warfare or airborne assault.
"It may be that it's a melding of the intelligence and the operational arts into a new mission area, not much different than suppression of enemy air defenses or air superiority or undersea warfare," Dr. Cambone said. "It is beginning to emerge as a new mission area in its own right."
The example that may stick best in the public's mind is the night raid to rescue Pfc. Jessica D. Lynch, a mission planned and carried out within hours of the tip that revealed her location.
American intelligence was also able on at least two occasions to suggest precise locations where President Saddam Hussein was believed to be in seclusion.
The tenacious guerrilla campaign in southern Iraq, though, appears to have surprised allied forces. Senior Pentagon officials said they were well aware that paramilitary units loyal to Mr. Hussein and his Baath Party were unlikely to fold quickly, but they assumed that these guerrillas would make their stand in Baghdad, not against the allies' rear echelon in the south.
Another big question remains, about why Iraqi forces have not used chemical weapons. A number of air attacks, Special Operations raids and psychologicial operations were intended to prevent the launching of unconventional weapons, and they might have succeeded in eroding command over these arsenals. But that is still unknown.
At the strategic level, the campaign was directed at the Iraqi government's ability to govern and the Iraqi army's will to fight -- not at reducing cities to rubble, smashing the economy or waging total war against the population, in the style of Gen. William T. Sherman in the Civil War.
The basic concept of the war plan, which Pentagon officials said was called 1003 Victor, differed radically from traditional military campaigns to capture a country or a capital. It required neither seizing and holding territory mile by mile, nor fighting block by block through city streets.
In the Pentagon, the war plan's mottos of "inside out" and "Baghdad first" captured its central ambition -- to take down the pillars of power as quickly and violently as possible.
The public's perception at the outset -- that the bombing of the regime's palaces and compounds in Baghdad fell short of what had been threatened -- may have missed the point.
The overwrought expression, "Shock and Awe," that some used to describe the initial air campaign was, in fact, taken from an obscure but far-reaching monograph published in 1996 by expert consultants working for the National Defense University in Washington.
Its authors described a theory of "rapid dominance" that they said would move beyond the accepted doctrine of the time, which merely called for the kind of overwhelming force that the generals of the first gulf war employed.
The new doctrine's goal, confounding the foe's will to resist, would require defeating and disarming enemy combat forces and, usually, taking territory by force, they said. But it also meant to move so swiftly and to control the situation so totally as to "control what the adversary perceives, understands and knows." And it all hinged on technologies that were just then emerging, they said.
As it turns out, the invasion of Iraq was remarkably different from the first gulf war, in which a much larger ground force was used after a 43-day bombardment to push Iraqi invaders back from Kuwait. In that war, United States casualties included 148 killed in combat, 151 killed outside of combat and 467 wounded.
So far in this war, the Pentagon said today, the total American losses have included 102 dead, 11 missing and 7 prisoners of war, with the British forces listing 30 killed.
The comparably swift victory over the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan offered one template for warfare in transformation, and was a battle laboratory for Predator reconaissance vehicles and showcased the skills of Special Forces working with local allies to call in withering air attacks. But the campaign in Iraq was substantially different.
While technology allowed the American military to leverage its power day and night and in all weather, the swift offensive that led today to downtown Baghdad required substantially more ground troops -- though not as many divisions as some officers had thought necessary. Today there are at least 125,000 coalition troops inside Iraq, and more are arriving every day.
The set-piece battles of this war, in which the Republican Guard's divisions were smashed and their remnants scattered in a few brief days, bore no resemblance to the collisions in Europe, Africa and Asia of World War II. As far as is known, no Iraqi tank destroyed an American tank; no allied warplane faced an opponent in a dogfight. In the brief strategic bombings this time, no city was reduced to rubble in the fashion of Dresden, Berlin or Hiroshima.
Instead, as Air Marshal Burridge said, "the tactics are armored raids and then exploit success, exploit opportunity. And it's very much a tactical battle."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ON THE CONTINENT; 
In Europe, a Mixed Reaction: Some Rejoice, but Others Balk

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 9 

 BODY:
As American forces seized the heart of Baghdad, some voices from European capitals were unwilling to declare victory, while others rejoiced. Some predicted an increase in terrorist activity, while others demanded an urgent initiative to make peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
 With fighting continuing and the fate of President Saddam Hussein still unclear, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain had this warning from London, "It's not over yet." 
 Asked in the House of Commons when the moment of victory might come, he replied, "I think we will know that moment when we see it." 
Mr. Blair explained that it was still "extremely difficult" to say which remnants of the Hussein goverrment remained and which of its representatives would surrender to American and British troops. Later today, however, Mr. Blair and his staff were said by a spokesman to be watching live television reports from Baghdad "and are delighted at what we see in the reaction of people on the ground."
But the need for caution was echoed by Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, who said: "The popular mood in Iraq can change quickly and very profoundly. I think we have to see how the people of Iraq react to one year of American occupation."
In Berlin, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a staunch opponent of the war, told reporters today: "There are welcome signs that the war in Iraq could be coming to an end. That is, of course, our hope. Every day earlier that the war ends is a better day."
Mr. Schroder emphasized the need for the Iraqi people to decide on their political and economic fate and for a central role for the United Nations in the rebuilding of the country.
"The important thing now is to make a political profit out of a probable and welcome victory," Mr. Schroder said. "Of course, that also means that the United Nations must play a central role in the process of bringing peace and stabilization that is now beginning."
His interior minister, Otto Schily, warned that Germany was under increased risk of attacks because of the war in Iraq and that Al Qaeda, the terrorist network, could be planning more operations.
At the Vatican, there were signs of relief that the war against Iraq might be coming to an end.
"Naturally we are all happy," said Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, one of the Vatican's most senior officials. "It could have gone badly and you could never predict what could have happened because with chemical weapons everything was possible." He added, "We thank the Lord, it seems that everything has gone well."
In Paris today, the foreign ministers of France and Britain, two countries on opposite sides of the European schism over whether to go to war, tried to look beyond the Iraq crisis, agreeing on the urgent need for a new diplomatic initiative to end the confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians.
Exchanging broad smiles and big compliments, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain and Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin of France focused on areas of common interest. Most notable was their agreement on the need to end the cycle of violence in the Middle East as the only way to bring stability to the world.
"Dominique was saying to me upstairs, and I agree with him, that the thing that has caused the greatest degree of anger in the Arab and Islamic world has not actually been Iraq, but it's been this profound sense of injustice felt by the Palestinians," Mr. Straw said.
Mr. Straw and Mr. de Villepin both emphasized the need for the United Nations to play a role in Iraq's reconstruction, although neither gave any indication that they agree on when or how that might happen. France opposes a postwar reconstruction for Iraq that is is determined by the United States.
Mr. Straw and Mr. de Villepin gave the impression today that they were dear old friends who had merely engaged in a lively debate. "Life would be very boring if friends always agreed," Mr. Straw said. "This is a grown-up relationship."
Some French politicians said today that now was the time for Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to mend fences with Washington. In a prepared statement, Jacques Barrot, the president of the center-right UMP party in the National Assembly, advised Mr. Chirac to "rejoice at the end of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, acknowledge the American and English courage, even if this might have been achieved by other means."
In Russia, another leader of the antiwar bloc, television news shows that had focused on setbacks in the allied campaign in Iraq, warning of brutal urban warfare to come and condemning American aggression, reported tonight that Iraqis cheered American troops in the center of Baghdad.
"There are too many questions," the international affairs commentator Maksim Yusin wrote in Thursday's Izvestia. "It's too hard to find answers to them. And there's no certainty that today's triumph won't result in even greater blood tomorrow, even more frightening wars. But about that later. Today isn't the time for unpleasant questions. Today Washington and London are rejoicing. They've won the war against Saddam."
Iraqi expatriate groups and European Muslims had a similar range of reaction. In one neighborhood of northern London, where there are Iraqi cafes and restaurants, small groups of Iraqis danced in the streets and waved Iraqi and American flags. Two dozen Iraqis were arrested after they broke into the Iraqi interests section in the Jordanian Embassy in London, removed pictures of Mr. Hussein and ripped them up on the street in celebration.
But at the Evry Courcouronnes mosque in a poor suburb of Paris, Khalil Merroun, the director, was not rejoicing. "I don't think they won the war, they erased the dictatorship, they ousted the dictator they themselves put there in the past," he said. "Just because the Iraqis hate Saddam doesn't mean they will accept the American nationalism the United States wants to impose on their country."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE VICE PRESIDENT; 
After Weeks of Criticism, Cheney Claims Vindication as Iraqis Hail Outcome of War

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
After weeks of criticism that he had underestimated the difficulty of toppling Saddam Hussein and overpromised in suggesting that American troops would be greeted in Iraq as liberators, Vice President Dick Cheney spoke publicly today for the first time since the start of the war, and in his understated way said: I told you so.
 The conclusion of the war "will mark one of the most extraordinary military campaigns ever conducted," Mr. Cheney told the American Society of Newspaper Editors conference in New Orleans this morning, while television screens were showing jubilant Iraqis pulling down statues of Mr. Hussein in Baghdad less than three weeks after the start of the American-led offensive. 
 "In the early days of the war, the plan was criticized by some retired military officers embedded in TV studios," Mr. Cheney said in a dig at cable pundits. "With every day and every advance by our coalition forces the wisdom of that plan becomes more apparent." 
Careful not to sound boastful, Mr. Cheney heaped praise on Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his top military commanders. But with the war seeming to be in its final stages, it appeared that the vice president's optimistic, even cocky prewar pronouncements and the policy advice behind them have been largely proved correct.
While he remains a polarizing figure in American politics and the personification to critics around the world of an oil-driven, trigger-happy foreign policy, Mr. Cheney is emerging from the war with no diminution in his status as President Bush's chief counselor. And he is sure to be an influential voice largely behind the scenes as the White House turns its attention to rebuilding Iraq and confronting North Korea, Iran and other nations it sees as threats.
Today, Mr. Cheney weighed in on how he wanted to see postwar Iraq put back together, making clear his disdain for giving the United Nations and through it, France, Germany and Russia, a pivotal role.
"The French and the Germans, in particular, did everything they could to prevent us from going forward and enforcing the U.N. Security Council resolutions," he said. 
Mr. Cheney implied that he would like those countries to stew awhile now that oil contracts and other lucrative rebuilding jobs are on the line. "Perhaps time will help in terms of improving their outlook," Mr. Cheney said, adding pointedly that perhaps France, Russia and Germany might start by providing humanitarian aid. 
Throughout the war, his aides said, Mr. Cheney has ignored or shrugged off the criticism that he had oversold the ease with which American and British forces would prevail. He showed little reaction, they said, to protests around the world in which he was portrayed as the instigator of a "blood for oil" war and was accused of using the conflict to benefit his former employer, Halliburton, the oil field services firm.
"We have no interest in the oil," he said today.
But the vice president also displayed a detailed knowledge of Iraq's oil fields and of planning for putting the country's reserves to use to pay for reconstruction and get Iraq back on its feet economically. He said Iraqi oil production could generate $20 billion a year for the Iraqi people, and that some outside investment in the country's oil fields could allow production of as much as three million barrels a day by the end of the year.
In his usual taciturn way, Mr. Cheney has spent the war concentrating on what he sees as his primary role, helping Mr. Bush sort out the competing institutional views brought to him by the sometimes opposing camps within his war council, especially those led by Mr. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
Although Mr. Cheney is typically viewed as a charter member of the hawkish neoconservatives on Mr. Bush's team and as temperamentally more inclined to support Mr. Rumsfeld's hard-line views than Mr. Powell's internationalism, his aides said he is less ideological than pragmatically focused on protecting the United States from terrorist threats.
"The president expects Rumsfeld and Powell to come with perspectives that reflect their responsibilities," said Mary Matalin, Mr. Cheney's former senior political counselor who is still an informal adviser. "The vice president's responsibility is to help the president sort through all that. He pushes the conversation along by asking pointed questions."
Mr. Cheney, Ms. Matalin said, has the leeway and the background to get involved in almost any issue, but usually weighs in only when it is really important, whether a key vote in Congress or mediating an internal Republican Party dispute or making the president's case one last time before attacking Iraq.
"He keeps his fingers in everything," Ms. Matalin said, "but he's utilized for trigger pulling when something hits the fan, from calling world regional leaders to a key senator." 
After Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Cheney all but disappeared for days or weeks at a time, secure at an undislosed location. During the last three weeks, Mr. Cheney has stuck more or less to his normal routine, riding his stationary bike at home early in the morning, receiving intelligence briefings, attending war council meetings and lunching once a week in private with Mr. Bush. He joined Mr. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon on Monday for the morning operational update and video teleconference with Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the theater commander. 
He watches coverage of the war on television in his office -- he is partial to Fox News and Brit Hume and sometimes leafs through a historical atlas given to him by his staff on Jan. 30 for his 62nd birthday, his aides say. He attends weekly lunches with Senate Republicans, where he says little -- "stay the course" was his only statement to them a few weeks ago, said someone at the meeting. He also receives many of them at his table, godfatherlike, for a word or a favor when the meal ends.
"He understands that government in our constitutional system is always very hard and very, very frustrating," said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who is an old friend. 
"He sees himself as a strategic planner, which fits the Bush style," Mr. Gingrich said. "And he sees himself as an implementer, dealing with key problems that are not getting solved."
Reflecting Mr. Cheney's reputation as far more than a typical funeral-attending vice president, his office has become a required stop for visiting foreign dignitaries. In the past few weeks, Mr. Cheney has met with top ministers from South Korea, Australia and Israel. "When our big shots come into town, we always try to have a meeting with the vice president," said one foreign diplomat in Washington.
Ever the laconic westerner, Mr. Cheney is typically the soul of discretion. But in answering questions today after his speech in New Orleans, he committed a rare gaffe by saying that the United States had scheduled a meeting for this Saturday near Nasiriya of Iraqi groups to begin planning for the interim civil authority. 
But his aides quickly put out word that Mr. Cheney had jumped the gun and that no date had been set for the meeting.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Version of Religion Initiative 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
A pared version of President Bush's religion-based initiative passed the Senate today by an overwhelming margin, but Republicans are already using other legislation to press the White House's agenda of expanding government grants to religious groups.
 The measure approved today began as an effort to allow churches, synagogues and other religious organizations to participate in taxpayer-financed programs for the poor. But it wound up as a bill that provides tax incentives to spur donations to all kinds of charitable groups, religious or not. 
 The measure passed by a vote of 95 to 5, an unusual show of bipartisanship in a Senate that has been sharply divided on most issues, including judicial nominations and tax cuts. When it was over, the chief sponsors, Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, seemed greatly relieved. 
"Praise the Lord and praise Congress," Senator Lieberman said.
Senator Santorum said, "Today is a great day for the armies of compassion." 
As passed by the Senate, the bill offers tax advantages intended to benefit soup kitchens, homeless shelters and other community groups. It would provide technical assistance to small groups, including black and Hispanic churches that need help competing for federal financing and would authorize $33 million to establish group maternity homes for young mothers.
The measure also provides an increase of $1.3 billion for a program that provides social service money, in the form of block grants, to the states. But the White House, while commending the Senate for passing the legislation, said today it would "strongly oppose" the block grant provision because it exceeds the president's budget request.
"America's charities face tough times, and we can do more to support their efforts," Mr. Bush said in a statement, adding, "I continue to urge Congress to take additional steps to end discrimination against faith-based organizations."
The bill now goes to the House. Passage there is likely, but it is also likely that House Republicans will strip out the block grant provision, a prospect that greatly irritated Senator Lieberman.
"I cannot understand why the administration would do such a divisive thing and undermine the harmony we achieved," he said.
Mr. Bush's religion-based initiative has been caught up in controversy from the moment he announced it, early in his presidency. The White House had hoped to use the bill passed today, called the Charity, Aid, Recovery and Empowerment Act, or CARE, as a vehicle to carry the initiative into law.
The original bill included language, sought by the White House, that offered explicit protections for groups with religious names or religious icons in their literature. Under this "equal treatment" provision, such groups would have been eligible to participate in federally financed programs to aid the poor.
But because federal civil rights law permits religious organizations to discriminate in hiring, Democrats argued that the legislation would allow the groups to discriminate using taxpayer money. After Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both Democrats, threatened to amend the bill and delay its passage, Mr. Santorum decided to strip out the equal-treatment language.
But House Republicans have already inserted a similar provision in a job-training bill. That effort has drawn sharp criticism from some Democrats, like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts. Mr. Frank also complained that the Bush administration is trying to achieve the changes through regulations, including those governing housing programs.
"The current law says if you take federal money you are under a heavy obligation not to discriminate," Mr. Frank said. "They want to turn it around and say if you take federal money you have a license to discriminate on religious grounds."
Mr. Santorum, meanwhile, vowed to insert the equal-treatment language into other measures, including the reauthorization of the 1996 welfare reform legislation.
"There are some who want to roll back the clock on religious freedoms," he said, "and I'm not going to be a part of that."
Despite the controversy, the bill passed today had especially broad support from charitable groups, who have suffered greatly with the downturn in the economy.
"This has been a terrible, tough fight," said Sharon M. Daly, vice president for social policy for Catholic Charities-U.S.A. While Ms. Daly said she was disappointed that the equal-treatment language was dropped, she added, "The bill is still worth fighting for."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums children under 12 and museum members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "MATTHEW BARNEY: THE CREMASTER CYCLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through June 11). The most anticipated show by any American artist to emerge in a decade or more. "Cremaster," Mr. Barney's nine-year, five-film project, here presented whole for the first time, is an inspired benchmark of ambition, scope and forthright provocation for art in the new century. I recall Elizabeth Murray's describing how Philip Guston's crazy late works gave her heart to do her own mature paintings. Mr. Barney hasbrought to the art world a new freedom to explore narrative. He has introduced a new repertory of materials, gooey, strange, malleable and synthetic, which nobody thought of as germane before. Never mind that the films and many (not all) of his related sculptures, installations and photographs are very beautiful. The show, an installation itself, brings them together. The earliest "Cremaster" sculptures are film props, cobbled into installations that don't jell. But the latest are better: twin steel towers framed in plastic, a suite of abstract sculptures derived from automobile chassis. Vaseline and plastic combine with cement and steel -- pink and gray, rough and smooth, hard and soft -- the materials sustaining a narrative of formal eloquence. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; $10 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

"BEALS, HERVEY AND HEWITT: WOMEN PIONEERS OF ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN PHOTOGRAPHY," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through July 13). Three women photographers, saluted for their successes in early-20th-century New York. The artistic oddball was Antoinette Bryant Hervey (1857-1945) who carried out an obsessive 40-year photographic documentation of the construction of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and produced an epic of great artistry as well as historical value. Greenwich Village was the stamping ground of Jessie Tarbox Beals (1870-1942), the best known of the three, who engagingly turned her lens on Village haunts, architecture and personalities. Mattie Edwards Hewitt (circa 1870-1956) did homes and gardens designed for the era's rich and famous, like Conde Nast and Margaret Bourke-White. Although this mix is a little forced, individually each woman is worth a salute. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

WENDY EWALD, "Secret Games," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, (718) 529-9700 (through June 8). For three decades, Ms. Ewald has been teaching and collaborating with children in some of the world's more remote and impoverished places, including the Kentucky Appalachians, the mountains of Columbia and villages in India, South Africa and the Netherlands. Ms. Ewald herself is a capable photojournalist, but the best parts of this retrospective are the photographs taken by children. Many are as beautiful, strange and heartbreaking as anything by Diane Arbus, Nan Goldin or other chroniclers of the rough poetry of real life. (A smaller show is at Scalo, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 334-9393, through May 10. It focuses on works produced by Ms. Ewald and her students in Morocco in 1995.) Museum hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 55+ (Ken Johnson).

* "MANET/VELAZQUEZ: THE FRENCH TASTE FOR SPANISH PAINTING," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 8). The Met has clearly called in every chip to make this show spectacular. The first rooms are a virtual survey of great Spanish painting of the 17th and 18th centuries; after that comes a virtual Manet retrospective, with some Degas and Courbet thrown in for good measure; then a virtual 19th-century American overview of the most gifted portraitists influenced by Spanish painting via Manet, Degas and Courbet: Eakins, Chase, Sargent and Whistler. The thesis of Spanish influence on French art is hardly new, but it is explored in such precise and fresh detail, discreetly, without pushing comparisons (in that respect it's not like "Matisse Picasso" at the Modern, notwithstanding the coincidental titled pairings) that you would have to be churlish not to leave edified and amazed. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "MATISSE PICASSO," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 33rd Street at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through May 19). If you're thinking of skipping it because of the crowds, that's not a good enough excuse. This is one for the ages: an eye-educating, often revelatory parlor game, with the fate of modern art as the stakes. The premise is a little dubious -- the two of them competing as if in stately isolation from everything else going on in art -- but the results look great. Choosing a winner is the sport of the event and the inevitable outcome of pitting titans mano a mano. Matisse comes out looking consistently good. To grasp 20th-century art, Picasso once said, "You ought to see side by side everything Matisse and I were doing." He was right about that. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Admission: $20; $15.50, students and 65+; under 16 with an adult, free. Reserved tickets: Ticketmaster, (212) 307-5577; or toll free, (866) 879-6662, with Ticketmaster surcharges (Kimmelman).

"ELIE NADELMAN: SCULPTOR OF MODERN LIFE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through July 20). Despite the clarion title, this exhibition is too monotonous, stiffly installed and short on drawings to do full justice to the erudite, polymorphous achievement of the Polish-born American sculptor Nadelman (1882-1946). Still, don't miss this opportunity to see his work in quantity, especially the streamlined wood figures from the 1920's and the small truculent plaster figurines, which were found in his studio after his death. Their suave economy, ineffable stillness, delicate gestures and seamless blend of historical and popular sources make them among the most complex, fully visual sculptures in Western art. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).

* "SCANNING: THE ABERRANT ARCHITECTURES OF DILLER & SCOFIDIO," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 1). This retrospective of the work of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, New York's brainiest architectural team, surveys 21 projects in a variety of mediums, including buildings, building additions, product designs, temporary museum installations, commercial interiors, public art and theater design. Aberrance is the last label I would slap on Diller & Scofidio, even in ironic jest. Their typical procedure is to slam opposite concepts together -- outside-inside, public-private, transparent-opaque -- and then explore the richly nuanced terrain that emerges from the overlap. Holding opposites together is a primary function of classical art, and Ms. Diller and Mr. Scofidio are classicists in this dialectical sense. The good, the true and the satirical are their stock in trade. Beauty slips in, too. "Scanning" is a show in which many New York architects will take pride as well as pleasure. Hours and admission: See above (Herbert Muschamp).

* "CHRISTIAN SCHAD AND THE NEUE SACHLICHKEIT," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through June 9). Schad's career effectively lasted only 15 years, from around 1915 to 1930, and for just two or three of those years was he doing what deserves to be remembered now. Not much time. But just enough. Schad at his mordant best precisely captured an anxious culture affected by war and the threat of it: his bloodless portraits in Vienna and Berlin suggest deep unease and foreboding beneath porcelain surfaces. They are explicitly unemotional, even when they are frankly erotic, as they frequently are. To the end, Schad remained aloof. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

"LUXURIOUS ESSENTIALS," Kaikodo, 164 East 64th Street, (212) 223-0121 (through April 28). This show is composed primarily of dozens of painted paper fans, representing a minor but flourishing medium in Chinese art. Such respected Ming and Qing period artists as Qiu Ying, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, Yun Shouping and Wang Yuanqi are represented in an art that is intimate, affordable and portable (Holland Cotter).

* AGNES MARTIN, "Five Decades," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through April 26). We're used to expecting nuances rather than revolutions in Ms. Martin's art. But this 10-painting capsule survey gives a sense of how varied she can be and has been. It also proves how right she is in referring to herself as an an Abstract Expressionist when everyone else has been calling her a Minimalist all these years. She's an engaged, passionate gestural painter with a classicist's emotional tact, a reticent Abstract Expressionist, the way Philip Guston was (Cotter).

* "WEAVING CHINA'S PAST: THE AMY S. CLAUGUE COLLECTION OF CHINESE TEXTILES," China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through June 7). This gallery has a sterling record in presenting small, fine-tuned scholarly shows and this one, imported from the Phoenix Art Museum, exactly fits the description. With precious examples of silk brocades, tapestries and embroideries, including Buddhist ritual pieces, dating from the Jin to Qing dynasty, it gives a vivid sense of the material past in a powerful imperial culture (Cotter).

Galleries: 57th Street

VIJA CELMINS, Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through May 31). Unlike the many painters and sculptors for whom printmaking is a more or less casual diversion, Ms. Celmins invests as much painstaking concentration in it as she does in her paintings. This selection from three decades includes misty etchings of spider webs, rippling waters made in lithography and wood engraving, mezzo-tinted starry night skies and lithographs of desert fields (Johnson).

LYNN DAVIS, "China," Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 750-7070 (through May 3). A photographer known for her spectacular pictures of icebergs and Egyptian pyramids, takes on China. Towering pagodas, a giant Buddha in a cave, ancient stairs partially submerged in sand, a beautiful minaret with a surface of intricate brickwork: these and other subjects are rendered in large, smooth black-and-white prints. Her relentless monumentalism can make you wonder whether Ms. Davis has a more intimate side (Johnson).

* BILL JENSEN, Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929 (through April 26). Where once it was biomorphic-bristly, Mr. Jensen's compositions seem to have mellowed over the years into softer, less defined forms, his surfaces more grounds for colors than for shapes. The forms in these latest works are really markings, sprawly scrawls and calligraphic gestures that play splashily over contrasting or close-valued grounds, sometimes to gorgeous effect. The star of the show is "Untitled (Ochre and Red)," in which a more definite form, that of a red partial cross, occupies the top half of a glowing field brushed thinly enough to show glints of red beneath it. Harking back to medieval and Byzantine sources, it is a mini-cathedral (Glueck).

Galleries: Chelsea

FERNANDO BERMEJO, "Lights," Generous Miracles, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-2858 (through May 13). The light box is popular with photographers but rarely used to illuminate hand-made pictures. Black-and-white paintings on paper mounted on light boxes by this Spanish artist suggest possibilities worth exploring. Lighted from behind, his small, brushy pastoral landscapes have a remarkable naturalistic luminosity and his surrealistic visions of trees growing from small boats have a dusky, melancholy poetry (Johnson).

"FLESH TONES: 100 YEARS OF THE NUDE," Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 989-7600 (through April 19). From Edward Steichen's blurry Pictorialism to Nan Goldin's diaristic intimism, this selection of photographs of people without clothes is wonderfully diverse. The Village Voice photography critic Vince Aletti selected the 79 images, and there may not be a bad one in the bunch. Neither is there anything so transgressive that parents need beware. Still, the nonchronological, salon-style installation cries out to be more illuminatingly sorted (Johnson).

CHEMA MADOZ, "Objects," Yossi Milo, 552 West 24th Street, (212) 414-0370 (through April 19). Mr. Madoz deals in modest surrealistic illusions, like a little puddle of water made to resemble a cartoon cloud raining tiny droplets. Or he transforms objects: a potted shrub blooms butterflies instead of blossoms and a spoon casts the shadow of a fork. The slickly produced prints border on the commercial, but the imagery is amusing nevertheless (Johnson).

KIRSTEN MOSHER, Ten in One Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 604-9660 (through April 19). Ms. Mosher, who is known for socially subversive public sculpture, here presents a series of playful small paintings that envision a futuristic mix of the pastoral and the post-apocalyptic. Made with colorful, busy, fine brushwork, it looks like faux-folk art by a promising grad student (Johnson).

* ELIZABETH MURRAY, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000 (through April 26). A life lived the way Ms. Murray paints would be nirvana. Her recent works are airy constructions in low relief: ad-hoc jigsaw puzzles of freewheeling shapes that lean, nuzzle and jostle each other to make unlikely harmonies of pungent color and abstract pattern. Compositional equilibrium, laboriously achieved but seemingly effortless, looks fleeting: there's always the sense that these improvisatory jumbles might break apart and out of their frames. Ms. Murray loves to paint. That's still the bottom line. It is useful to be reminded that there are still veterans like her, steeped in the medium, its difficulties and pleasures, who work so hard and make such beautiful art (Kimmelman).

ASHLEY PRINE, Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937 (through April 19). From a distance Ms. Prine's lusciously candy-colored paintings look like hazy, overly simplified abstractions of plants, animals and landscapes. Up close you find that off-register layers of translucent glazing gives the edges of her shapes alacy, fluttering quality. The effect is oddly erotic, like sexy lingerie under sensible outerwear (Johnson).

ALEXIS ROCKMAN, Gorney Bravin and Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through April 19). With the meticulous care of a popular science illustrator, Mr. Rockman continues to paint nature under stress. Each glossy, medium-size picture focuses on a particular ecosystem, with in most cases some kind of volcanic activity in the background. Deep sea creatures hover around glowing hyperthermal vents; insects flee a smoke-belching mountain; prairie animals seek subterranean shelter before a river of incandescent lava (Johnson).

GARY SCHNEIDER, Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, (through April 19). Mr. Schneider's latest parsing of the photographic process involves extended exposures, people who lie down rather than sit for their portraits, an overhead camera and light from a single pin-point source. Illuminated in a process that resembles drawing, or a gentle touching, the faces glimmer almost lividly beneath dustings of shadows. They could be coalminers getting off work, or lost souls brought back from the dead and freshly made up (Smith).

BEVERLY SEMMES, "In the O," Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8540 (through April 19). What can one say in the face of this largesse, which has charged undertones of feminist meaning as well as overtones of female underwear? The entire gallery is clad in hundreds of yards of tangerine-colored chiffon that Niagaras from ceiling to floor to form pools of delicate ruffles. Quirky red pottery vessels handmade by Ms. Semmes, stand around like exclamation points. A huge ovoid bathmat is put together entirely of flesh-colored Band-Aids. Ms. Semmes proves herself once again to be an engaging fantasist as well as a clever manipulator of architectural space (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

TONY BERLANT, "What You See Is Who You Are," Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through April 19). A spectacular 60-foot mural representing the four seasons is the main attraction here. This visually ravishing, bucolic landscape was made by Mr. Berlant's signature technique: with zillions of finishing nails that remain visible on the surface, he attaches countless cut-up pieces of preprinted and painted tin to wood panels, puzzling together a giant, vividly colorful picture that is as absorbing to study up close as from a distance. (Johnson).

MEG CRANSTON, "Magical Death," Leo Koenig, 249 Centre Street, (212) 334-9255 (through April 22). This California Conceptualist presents five life-size whole-figure portraits of herself as a pinata. The papier-mache effigies are molded from the artist's trim body, dressed in fashionable paper clothes and hung by ropes from the ceiling. As the pinata is a sacrificial object, to be beaten with a stick, the artist becomes a martyr; the idea is more interesting than the nondescriptly made mannequins that represent it (Johnson).

HEIDE FASNACHT, Kent, 67 Prince Street, (212) 966-4500 (through May 3). A sculptor known for her interest in explosions offers a bursting Champagne bottle and splashy puddles, both in cast blue resin, and a sneeze represented by perforations in paper. A big colored pencil drawing of a window glass washed by rain, made with crisp gray and blue hatchmarks, reveals on close inspection an absorbing, crystalline topography; from a distance it resolves into a magically luminous illusion of watery translucency (Johnson).

GEORGE McNEIL, "FE = Form/Energy," Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through May 3). McNeil, who died in 1995 an underrecognized member of the Abstract Expressionist generation, merged painterly abstraction and primitivistic symbolism with sensuous buoyancy. This small selection of works from four decades includes colorful, transcendentally exuberant landscapes and pictures of scary masklike faces embedded in luxuriantly scabrous surfaces (Johnson).

ALEXANDER VINOGRADOV AND VLADIMIR DUBOSSARSKY, "Our Best World," Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300 (though April 19). This young Russian duo presents 38 panels of a single endless painting. Wrapping around the gallery is a giddy confectionery parade of fashion models, pop stars, the artists themselves, their wives and friends, animals, candy and toys -- in settings that morph from Red Square in Moscow to a Disney-like pastoral landscape to New York City. Whether a satire or a loving embrace of Western popular culture, it is exhilarating (Johnson).

Other Galleries

DAVID HENDERSON, Kristen Frederickson, 149 Reade Street, TriBeCa, (212) 566-7787 (through April 19). Mr. Henderson works laminated plywood into smooth convex or concave shells animated by tension between the geometric and the organic. Looking at his sculptures you can almost hear the roar of industrial sanding machinery. You might also hear a more colorfully imaginative feminine side crying to get out from under the handsome masculine reserve (Johnson).

NAVJOT, Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096 (through April 19). This Indian artist is based in Bombay but has spent extensive time working with village artists. One result is the striking installation of figures of nude women and men carved from teakwood and painted a deep, rich blue. Inspired by both religious icons and tribal art, the tableau suggests the social and sexual tensions at work in a country where women are still subject to indiscriminate abuse (Cotter).

* "PEACE AND LINE," Ethan Cohen, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250, (through April 26). This is among the few New York dealers to consistently and persuasively present new art from China, often in group shows like this one, which includes calligraphy by the venerable painter C. C. Wang, now 97, done on pages of New York City telephone books; calligraphic paintings from 1986 by Wenda Gu; and experimental work by three young Chinese-based artists Pan Xinglei, Xing Fei and Zhou Hongxiang (Cotter).

ANN SPERRY, "30 Pieces/30 Years," Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205 (through June 26); "My Piano," Kraushaar, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 307-5730 (through April 12). Since the early 70's, Ms. Sperry has been bending, shaping and welding metal into metaphorically suggestive abstractions. The best works in her Hebrew Union retrospective have an industrial surrealism similar to, though not as surprising as, that of Donald Lipski. Her new assemblages at Kraushaar include cut-up parts of her old piano, a beloved but defunct family heirloom (Johnson).

EDWARD WESTON AND MARGRETHE MATHER, "A Passionate Collaboration," AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-2456 (through April 19). Although Mather (1886-1952), a photographer of considerable accomplishment, was important to the early life and career of Weston (1886-1958), she vanished into obscurity as his reputation advanced. This show calls attention to her achievements alongside Weston's during their 12-year relationship, which ended in 1925. Each taught and learned from the other; Mather helped turn Weston's work in a more experimental direction. By 1921 they had agreed to an equal partnership in which photographs were signed by both. This well-chosen show does make a case for her influence on Weston (and vice versa), and she deserves recognition for her endeavors. Her career, however, was not sustained enough to be compared with his; her impact on one of the 20th century's most influential photographers seems today a relatively small one (Glueck).

Last Chance

* "BRONZE AND GOLD IN ANCIENT CHINA," J. J. Lally, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380 (through tomorrow). Exhibitions here are always something to look forward to and this one is no exception. It opens with a gilt bronze plaque in the form of a vivacious phoenix. And this image, like almost everything on view -- including a superb lamp in the form of a gold-robed sentry and a set of extraordinary carved narrative titles -- was created to amuse, instruct or protect the dead, in a culture as fixated on the afterlife as our own is caught up in the here-and-now (Cotter).

* EDWIN DICKINSON, "Dreams and Realities," National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). Revered in his own lifetime, Dickinson (1891-1978) now haunts the margins of art-world consciousness. He was a painter and draftsman of extraordinary skill and subtlety, an artist's artist admired by traditionalists and the avant-garde alike. This fascinating exhibition centers on his monumentally gloomy "symbolical paintings," Surrealistic, old-masterish montages of figures and metaphorical objects. They still cast a spell, especially the hallucinatory unfinished masterpiece "Ruin at Daphne." But it is his less ambitious work, his quickly painted landscapes, his self-portraits and, above all, his exquisitely delicate drawings that feel most alive today. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

* "GENESIS: IDEAS OF ORIGIN IN AFRICAN SCULPTURE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3951 (through Sunday). This splendid show, installed in the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, examines African myths about the creation of the world, the foundations of kingship and the formation of the family as told in the art of more than a dozen sub-Saharan cultures. The images range from naturalistic figures to fantastic animals and culminate in a coup de theatre display of some 40 Bamana headdresses. The dynamic is one of ethical persuasion, physical and psychological healing and a holistic connection to the world through objects of irrepressible energy and beauty. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

PAT LIPSKY, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-9666 (through tomorrow) and L.I.C.K., 46-44 11th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (through April 17). This veteran abstractionist presents a series of deceptively plain-spoken canvases. Vertical columns divided at different heights push up and down like valves in a machine, while muted colors alternating warm and cool pulse in and out, setting up a polyrhythmic complexity. The compositions vaguely evoke keyboards, enhancing the feeling of Bach-like musicality (Johnson).

ADI NES, Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 W. 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1701 (through tomorrow). Pictures by this Israeli photographer are mostly of handsome young soldiers napping together, nursing wounded comrades,and celebrating victories. But all the scenes have been staged for the camera with actor-models to create a homoerotic dream of army life. In part, the results reflect Mr. Nes's own outsider status in Israel, as a child of Kurdish and Iranian immigrants, and a gay man (Cotter).

* YUN-FEI JI, "The Old One Hundred Names," Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, (212) 647-7778 (through tomorrow). On wide expanses of rice paper a Beijing-born New Yorker paints a rich mix of classical Chinese-style landscape and modern satire with extraordinary skill and novelistic imagination. Mountainous wilds are populated by doll-scale human, semi-human and nonhuman creatures rendered with delicate, linear brushwork: soldiers, politicians, grotesque old men and women, nubile girls, murderous thugs in masks or with animal heads, goats, pigs, cars and trucks -- evoking a catastrophic human comedy (Johnson).

HEADLINE: Power Company Stresses Its Commitment to Brazil 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, April 10 

 BODY:
"Nobody invests $4 billion to change their mind later," read the advertisements in leading Brazilian newspapers. The ads are meant to deliver a clear message from the AES Corporation to its customers, the markets and the government. 
 "We're absolutely here to stay," said Steven Clancy, president of Eletropaulo, Latin America's biggest power distributor and AES's main Brazilian unit. 
 That there should be any doubt about AES's commitment to Brazil may seem strange. The $4 billion that AES, based in Arlington, Va., has sunk into Brazil since 1996 makes it the largest private investor in the country's electric power industry. And AES gets a quarter of its worldwide revenue from Brazil, more than it gets from North America. 
But since January, when AES defaulted on part of the $1.2 billion it borrowed in 1998 from Brazil's national development bank to buy Eletropaulo, there has been mounting speculation that the company is preparing to leave the country.
AES says that is not so -- hence the ad campaign. 
But if the company were to depart, analysts say, it could lead to an exodus by other foreign utilities, especially now that the new left-leaning government appears to be favoring the public sector over private investors in the industry. 
Mr. Clancy said that for the moment he was concentrating on renegotiating AES's Brazilian debt with commercial banks, holders of the company's debentures, and BNDES, the state development bank. 
He must also strive to cut costs and improve a sagging cash flow, while keeping customers happy and persuading shareholders around the globe that the Brazilian operation is worth keeping. 
None of these tasks will be easy. AES lost $2.77 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002, mainly because of failed investments overseas, and it has sold off units scattered from California to the Middle East to raise cash and reduce the likelihood of any more defaults in Brazil.
Talks with BNDES over the company's obligations were already difficult last year; since the Workers' Party government was sworn in Jan. 1, they have all but stalled completely. The new administration named left-leaning executives with a nationalist penchant to run BNDES, and the bank has hardened its negotiating line, saying AES must repay all its creditors or hand Eletropaulo back to the state. 
"The only deal we'll do with AES is one in which they pay their debt," Darc Costa, the bank's No. 2 executive, said in a recent interview. "Either they pay cash or they pay in assets. But they have to pay." 
On a recent trip to Brasilia, the United States assistant secretary of commerce, William Lash, fired back, saying that AES could not pay because it was itself owed more than $300 million by local governments. 
But analysts said that hard words and brinkmanship on both sides could damage the negotiating atmosphere beyond repair. 
"I have a feeling it could be tough for AES to keep hold of Eletropaulo," said Armando Franco, energy analyst at Tendencias, a consulting firm based in Sao Paulo. "These negotiations are not going on in heaven. There are no angels on either side." 
According to one Eletropaulo executive, Mr. Clancy is adopting a more diplomatic approach in Brazil than AES representatives have in the past. Mr. Clancy arrived in Sao Paulo last September and formally took over as president in February.
"Previously, there was sometimes a 'Me Tarzan, you Cheetah' approach," said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But up a tree in Brazil, very often Cheetah turns out to be more agile than Tarzan." 
Mr. Clancy, striking a conciliatory tone, seemed confident that he could reach a deal with BNDES. "Whenever you're in negotiations with someone with whom you have a $1 billion debt and you're not paying, it's bound to be strained," he said. "There's no easy solution for either side. But I'm optimistic we could have something by the end of May." 
Mr. Clancy laid the blame for AES's default -- two missed payments totaling more than $400 million -- on "a perfect storm" of negative factors that have plunged nearly all of Brazil's privatized utilities into crises, and have transformed AES into "a poster child for the energy sector's woes." 
There is no doubt that the whole sector is hurting. Electricite de France had to inject $1 billion of fresh capital last year into Light, the debt-ridden power distributor in Rio de Janeiro. The PPL Corporation wrote off its entire $317 million investment in a controlling stake in Cemar, a Brazilian utility that filed for bankruptcy protection early this year. Enersis, the Latin American investment arm of Spain's Endesa, recently refinanced $2.3 billion of its debt because of the economic crises in Brazil and Argentina. 
"Nobody is in great shape," said Claudio Sales, head of the Brazilian Chamber of Investors in Electricity.
Mr. Sales said that all of Brazil's privatized utilities were suffering from three main problems. 
First, years of drought and a lack of investment culminated in a nationwide energy crisis in 2001. Facing blackouts and rationing, Brazilians slashed consumption by 20 percent or more, and demand has not rebounded.
Second is the fall in the value of the Brazilian currency, the real, which has fallen by almost 60 percent against the dollar since 1998, eroding the value of the utilities' assets while making their dollar-denominated debts harder to repay. 
Third, regulation of the industry appears to be in flux under the new government, which has publicly wondered whether Brazil may have become too dependent on foreign companies for its energy. 
Elected on promises to improve the lot of millions of poor Brazilians, the government so far has frowned on utilities' requests to raise prices, one way of replacing lost revenue.
This week, the mines and energy minister, Dilma Rousseff, said she was effectively altering the distributors' contracts, putting off for a year the reimbursements that they get for costs like exchange rate fluctuations. The decree could cost the sector $480 million to $650 million this year, analysts said. 
For Eletropaulo, these factors have added up to disaster. The 2001 power crisis cut its revenue by $450 million, and consumers used less power last year than in 2001 even though rationing had ended, leaving the company with a $260 million loss for the year. Ms. Rousseff's decree this week could cost it another $145 million, analysts said. 
With AES's $4 billion investment so far having returned only $310 million in profit, and Brazil's regulatory environment still unclear, AES's chief executive, Paul Hanrahan, said last fall that he would sink no more fresh money into the country. 
The departure of PPL, and of Reliant Energy before it, "make you wonder if there won't be others leaving soon," Mr. Clancy said then.
That is why all eyes here are on AES. 
"AES is definitely a barometer for the sector," Mr. Franco of Tendencias said this week. "If they have to hand the keys to Eletropaulo back to the government, there will be a line of other investors waiting to do the same, and the Brazilian state will end up with a herd of white elephants." 
That is basically what Brazil had before its privatization program began. Electricity rates were low, but only because the monolithic federal utility, Eletrobras, was subsidized with tax money.
Privatization was supposed to solve that problem, but the market-friendly former president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, managed to sell only part of the system in his eight-year tenure, mainly distribution companies; 80 percent of the country's generating capacity stayed in state hands, effectively stifling competition among the distributors. 
Now, instead of selling off more of the power industry to promote competition, the new government says it wants to take back more control of the market. 
Analysts said that Ms. Rousseff's decree this week was meant to divert cash from the private sector to strengthen the state-owned generating companies so that they can finance new capacity. 
But the Brazilian state is too short of cash to be able to afford renationalizing the energy industry, and analysts expect the government to eventually settle for a mix of state and private utilities. 
"They're there looking in the top hat for a rabbit," Mr. Franco said. "But I still hope they'll end up opting for the private way out."

HEADLINE: Nostalgia Abounds as the Concorde's End Is Set 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, April 10 

 BODY:
After 27 years of supersonic travel lofting rock stars, executives and the rest of the Champagne set across the Atlantic, British Airways and Air France said today that they would retire their fleets of Concordes this year.
 The announcement brings the end of an era when the delta-winged jet stood for the ascendancy of technology and economic hope. Today, hard-nosed executives vied for the lyrical edge in mourning its demise. 
 "Concorde changed the way people traveled," said Rod Eddington, British Airways' chief executive. "With its going, we must lose some of the romance from aviation." 
Air France's chairman, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, said: "Never has such a beautiful object been designed and built by man. This aircraft is not going to stop, because it continues to live on in the human imagination."
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, who has a history of tweaking British Airways, raised the possibility today that Virgin would take over its rival's castoffs. Since the announcement, "we have been flooded with calls from the public, including B.A. staff, asking us to see if we can keep Concorde flying," he said. "This might come to nothing, but I believe that every effort should be made to keep Concorde flying, as it is such an important symbol of British innovation."
If that unlikely effort fails, though, the Concorde is dead.
The airlines ascribed their decision to falling passenger demand and steadily increasing costs of maintaining the fleet. But in recent years, Concorde's status has been battered, first by safety fears after a crash outside Paris in 2000 that killed 113 people and then by the broader slowdown in air travel since the Sept. 11 attacks.
Successive years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, moreover, have further dented the mood of business confidence that once made Concorde an emblem of worldly success.
Airlines across Europe and the United States have been reporting steady declines in passenger numbers, especially on long-haul flights to and from America. In recent months, Air France's Concordes have regularly flown with 80 of the 100 seats empty, the airline said.
Sara John, a spokeswoman for British Airways, said the withdrawal of Concorde would be "permanent as of October this year" but did not say when the last flight would take off. British Airways said it would sell 1,000 discounted tickets costing up to $6,200 for round-trip Concorde flights until the end of August -- less than half of the top price of $13,500 that a round-trip ticket normally costs. Air France set May 31 as the date for its last scheduled Concorde flight.
With global economies slowing and stock markets falling, Concorde has come to stand as an emblem of high-rolling luxury at a time when many people are experiencing layoffs and declining fortunes. That, too, has inhibited the high-rolling business set.
"If you're laying people off and telling people in your business to tighten your belt, senior executives then find it inconsistent to go to the airport and get on Concorde rather than subsonic aircraft," Mr. Eddington of British Airways said.
But many who flew on it were nostalgic, recalling its particular blend of spartan seating, delicate canapes, noisy take-offs and ineffable speed.
"It was the best travel experience anyone could ever have," said Tyler Brule, founder of Wallpaper, a style magazine. "It gave you the ultimate luxury, which is time."
"It's not the most comfortable flight," he said, "but it was the most incredible feeling. You felt as though you were hurtling through the air in a missile."
British Airways and Air France insisted that the retirement of the planes was not related to the crash on July 25, 2000, when an Air France Concorde burst into flames on take-off and crashed close to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. After the disaster, the plane was grounded in Britain and France while safety modifications were made. Supersonic flights were reintroduced in November 2001.
"We have complete safety at Concorde, complete confidence in its ability to fly safely," Mr. Eddington said. "This is the end of a fantastic era in world aviation, but bringing forward Concorde's retirement is a prudent business decision at a time when we are having to make difficult decisions right across the airline."
Air France said: "This decision is motivated by deteriorating economic results observed over the past months and which accelerated since the beginning of the year."
Concorde has been flying in commercial service since January 1976. Its first test flight took place in 1969.
At that time the British-French Concorde was also part of the cold war competition between East and West, spurred by the first supersonic test flight in late 1968 by the Soviet Union's larger and faster Tupolev TU-144.
That plane crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973 and a later model crash-landed in 1978, ending Moscow's brief romance with supersonic passenger flight.
Since the British Airways Concordes went into service in 1976, the airline said, they have carried 2.5 million passengers -- not in the same great comfort as in the first-class cabin of a subsonic airliner but at great speed, crossing the Atlantic at 1,350 miles an hour at an altitude of up to 60,000 feet.
A routine crossing takes less than four hours and the fastest was just under three hours.
The airlines say 12 of the original 20 Concordes are still in service; British Airways has seven and Air France has five. The airplane was not a commercial success but stood as an emblem of prestige for British Airways and Air France and for the top-end travelers like celebrities and corporate bosses.
Its four fuel-guzzling engines made so much noise that Concorde could not be used on regular flights over populated areas and, carrying only 100 passengers, it was not as cost-effective as wide-aisle subsonic planes flying at slower speeds.
Not only that, the aging fleet seemed prone to alarms even with the modifications after the Paris crash. As recently as February, passengers were alarmed by a series of engine, rudder and nose-cone problems.
Air France said Concorde flights produced losses of around $50 million in the year ended March 31.
For all that, passengers judged that their time -- or their image -- was worth the price of the ticket.
"It really felt like you were a member of an extraordinary club, the last real travel club," Mr. Brule said. "Every time you flew there'd be at least 10 people you knew to say hello to, and there'd be another 10 who you recognized. You could have Madonna in the seat in front of you, John McEnroe behind you and Joan Collins diagonally opposite you. In the days before Sept. 11 there'd be at least three or four people up in the cockpit with a glass of Champagne."
Closing the service will cost British Airways $132 million, Mr. Eddington said. Mr. Spinetta of Air France said it would cost $65 million to retire the five Air France Concordes.

HEADLINE: Economy May Be Better Than You Think 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
PERHAPS the economy in 2003 will turn out to be a bit like the war in Iraq: a slow start that got the critics carping, followed by a surprisingly strong surge to the finish. 
 The stock market's reaction to all the good news from Iraq has been something less than impressive. This week the pros who trade stock index futures overnight generally expected rallies when the stock market opened, but were disappointed by the hesitance of real investors to bid up the prices of actual stocks. 
 There is plenty of pessimism about the economy. The Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives of large companies, reports that most of its members say their sales will increase over the next six months. But they are still pessimistic about the economy, and many plan cuts in employment. Page C7. 
What was most striking about that report was that nearly 80 percent of the executives say it is the consumer who scares them. Asked to name the "greatest economic challenge facing corporate America," few chose the strong dollar's damage to exports, or weak foreign demand or rising health insurance costs. But 27 percent cited "weak consumer demand," and 52 percent picked "consumer uncertainty" stemming from war and terrorism.
In fact, the economy has not been all that bad. Retail sales are growing at a tepid pace, but high gasoline prices get a good part of the blame for that. "The money that went to the gas station didn't go to Wal-Mart," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. With oil prices plunging, Wal-Mart could get it back.
Then there are the unemployment insurance statistics. The seasonally adjusted number shows that the number of recipients is up 5 percent since the end of January. But the actual numbers -- before seasonal adjustment -- show a 7 percent decline.
The seasonal adjustments assume that as the weather gets better, more people find jobs. That has happened, but not to the extent expected. You can blame the weather or war-induced pessimism. Or you can see evidence of an impending double-dip.
The probability is that it is not the double-dip. The plunge in oil prices will help the economy after the war, but growth will be slowed for a bit by the need for businesses to work off excess inventories acquired to provide security in case war or terrorism disrupted international trading routes. Then we will see if consumers are as worried as businesses think they are.
There is a fair chance that, with pessimism both here and in Europe so strong, the next round of economic statistics will be better than expected. Seasonal adjustments could exaggerate the recovery from the weather-depressed months of February and March, thus making the rebound look stronger than it is, but the relief rally that helped stocks as the war began could help the economy now.
The economy is not ready to boom, and the major surprise of the last three years remains just how slow the economy has been to respond to the Federal Reserve's stimulus after the bursting of the stock market bubble. The era of virtually free capital for favored companies, largely in technology and telecommunications, produced more overcapacity than anyone understood even in 2001.
The economy is going to have to get by without much contribution from those sectors, but there is reason to hope for an increase in spending by other businesses after the managers get over their fears that consumers are about to stop spending.
The stock market's war-relief rally peaked three weeks ago, and prices have bounced around since. But it is interesting that the worst performers since then have been the old bubblicious tech and telecom companies. Companies in other industries have done better. In that, the market may be making a good economic forecast.

HEADLINE: An Increase in Aircraft Orders Narrowed the U.S. Trade Deficit in February 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
The trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in February, the Commerce Department reported today, as aircraft exports surged and American companies spent less on imported equipment.
 The $40.3 billion deficit was nonetheless the third highest ever. Economists had expected a deficit of $42.0 billion. 
 The trade gap in goods and services compared with a revised $41.2 billion deficit in January and a record $44.9 billion imbalance in December.
Exports would have fallen without the 80 percent increase in aircraft sales, to $2.5 billion, as Boeing delivered 14 jetliners to foreign buyers in February compared with 9 a month earlier.
Consumer goods exports fell 7.2 percent in February, led by a drop in pharmaceutical shipments.
The European Commission today cut its first-half growth forecast, adding to suggestions that overseas demand for American-made goods might be slow to recover. Fewer exports may restrain a United States economy struggling to regain strength.
"It's hard for us to keep up much momentum in exports if the rest of the world isn't doing that well," said Carol Stone, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. "The U.S. is growing better than the rest of the world," she said, and that may fuel demand for imports and slow exports. Nomura economists had expected a February trade deficit of $40.5 billion. 
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that import prices rose in March for a fourth consecutive month, led by higher costs for natural gas, raw materials made from petroleum, and paper.
The index of import prices increased 0.5 percent after jumping by 1.7 percent in February. Excluding petroleum, the index increased 0.9 percent, the biggest gain since the government began keeping records in December 1988. In February, the nonpetroleum index rose 0.4 percent.
The Commerce Department report showed that exports rose 0.5 percent, to $82.4 billion in February, from $82 billion the previous month. Imports fell 0.4 percent, to $122.8 billion.
The decline in imports reflected less demand for computers, civilian aircraft and generators.

HEADLINE: No Boycott of Restaurants, But the French Still Object 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
There is no actual organized boy cott of French restaurants in New York City.
 That fact would seem to preclude the owners of French restaurants from assembling members of the news media to urge an end to the boycott. 
 But these are clever owners, members of a group that promotes tourism in the city. Dozens of them gathered yesterday at Le Cirque on Madison Avenue, and with the help of the equally clever men and women of the public relations industry, they managed to attract dozens of not-so-clever reporters and photographers. The event was titled "NYC Restaurants Unite to Oppose Boycott of French Restaurants." 
To be sure, French restaurants and their employees and suppliers are suffering, said Sylvain Fareri, the owner of La Metairie on West 10th Street, who did not attend the news conference. Mr. Fareri said his business was down 15 to 20 percent from the average for this time of year. But he added that while there may be some protest against French products from people angered by the French government's opposition to the war in Iraq, the problem for French restaurants in New York is the economy, stupide.
By way of example, he noted that at 2 p.m. last Friday, La Metairie had only one reservation on its books.
"If you open a new restaurant and you have a French name and no reputation behind you, people do not know you are American, maybe then you will feel a boycott," he said. "I see people looking at the menu outside, and I go stand outside, and they say, 'Oh, it's a French restaurant; let's move on.' Maybe that's a boycott. Or maybe they just want to eat Italian."
Lespinasse, the elegant restaurant in the St. Regis Hotel, announced yesterday that it would close this month, blaming a slow business climate. The announced closing did not really seem related to "any anti-French sentiment," said Tim Zagat, a creator of the restaurant guides that bear his name and a member of the executive committee of NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors' bureau. 
At the event at Le Cirque, which ended just before lunchtime, chefs and owners from the "21" Club, Vine, Tavern on the Green, La Caravelle and many other restaurants, along with Mr. Zagat, spoke out against the boycott (which the chefs and owners quickly conceded did not exist).
They surrounded a lectern, dozens of them in suits or white chef's jackets. The intention was to implore New Yorkers to dine out, but the setting did not befit begging. A chandelier with a dozen lamps hung above their heads. There were bronze carvings of helmets and swords on the walls, striped pastel curtains adorned with metallic stars, two mirrored fireplaces and paintings of monkeys in hunting coats mounting horses or picnicking in the park and falling deeply in love.
"We're calling on all visitors and New Yorkers alike to support an industry that does so much for the city," Mr. Zagat said. 
The speakers were asked to quantify the effect of the boycott they had described. Cristyne L. Nicholas, the chief executive of NYC & Company, spoke of reports from restaurant owners in her organization that reservations were down perhaps 5 to 15 percent. She later said in an interview, "There is no boycott; there were isolated incidents that were disturbing." Those incidents, she said, included the cancellation of reservations.
Jacques Capsouto of Capsouto Freres in TriBeCa said the city's blanket ban on smoking in restaurants, which took effect March 31; the war; and the unseasonably cold weather, among many other factors, had all hurt French restaurants.
The restaurateurs signed an enlarged copy of an advertisement summarizing their views, which they plan to print in periodicals owned by Manhattan Media, a publisher of community newspapers.
Ms. Nicholas said the group could not afford to buy advertisements in publications with greater circulation.
"There is such a thing as earned media," she said, using a term she defined as creating events deemed newsworthy enough to be covered by major news media.

PERSON: Joseph T. Farrell 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
He Put the Rage in Outrageous Ticket Prices

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
THE temptation is to accuse Joseph T. Farrell -- the predictably dapper chief executive of Broadway Inner Circle, the theater ticket service that brought us the indispensable $480 premium orchestra seat for "The Producers" -- of committing the Great White Way version of highway robbery. Must be the combination of silver hair, silver stubble, silver tie and silver tongue offset by that sunny out-of-season tan that arouse suspicion -- he just hopped off a flight from Florida, so jealousy is factoring into first impressions.
 But wait. Hear him out -- which requires tuning out the unmusical screech of car horns from the clogged-up thoroughfare outside his less than luxurious office at 690 Eighth Avenue, near 44th Street. This is definitely not a V.I.P.-approved space: nary a doorman or velvet rope in sight, not even a coffeemaker to take the edge off a damp day. Then again, Mr. Farrell, 49, insists that he himself is simply "a serial entrepreneur," and not, like the 20,000 high-rollers from 30 different nations in his client base, a genuine V.I.P. He just happens to know where they like to sit when the curtain goes up and whom they want to mingle with once the curtain goes down. 
 "I didn't create the V.I.P.," says Mr. Farrell, instinctively going on the defensive, but sweetly. "What I created is the situation where a V.I.P.'s money is going to the rightful recipient, the people who create and present the shows, not some scalper." The most he ever paid a scalper was $275 apiece for tickets to "The Lion King."
Proximity has its privileges. And its price. At Broadway Inner Circle, it is typically $240 per musical and $180 for what Mr. Farrell calls a straight play. Actual prices are printed on the Inner Circle ticket, which makes for smoother tax deductions for corporate clients. Scalpers don't offer this service, nor do they supply a concierge to escort clients to their seats even if, as captains of industry can do, the client forgets his tickets.
"Our client base is traditionally not the type of person who calls Ticketmaster or Telecharge and spends $100 on a seat; our client goes to scalpers and spends anywhere from three or four to seven hundred dollars for seats. So if you look at it that way, we're not converting $100 tickets to $240 tickets; we're converting $300, $400, $500 tickets to $240 tickets." Interesting math.
MR. FARRELL, who says he devotes 20 percent of his working life to nonprofit organizations like the St. Louis Sports Foundation in his hometown, swears there's even a smidgen of philanthropy lurking beneath the stratospheric price of the Inner Circle theater experience, a service born out of the stampede for prime "Producers" tickets in 2001 and now offered by a dozen Broadway productions. Union workers, he says, reap around 5 percent of a ticket's face value. "So every time we sell a $240 ticket, the union gets twice as much as it gets from a $100 ticket sold at a profit by scalpers."
The idea for Broadway Inner Circle sprang up when Mr. Farrell went to dinner with a group that included Rocco Landesman's wife, Debbie -- Mr. Landesman, another of the "Producers" producers, is president of the Jujamcyn theater chain. She told him her husband had a new play. "She was lamenting the fact that if the production isn't a hit, the producers lose millions, and if it is, vast sums of the profits go to these four guys over in Jersey scalping tickets."
It was a lightbulb moment for Mr. Farrell, who got his start in sales peddling Hallmark cards and whose past entrepreneurial ventures include the St. Louis Steamers soccer franchise, the Delaney's Restaurants chain and Allied Health Group, a Florida-based managed-care organization sold to Magellan in 1997. He suggested that the producers do what every shrewd sports owner does: offer a V.I.P. package. Mr. Farrell pioneered just this sort of thing back in St. Louis in 1987 when he created a "$500 uber-ticket" for a volleyball game between the American and Soviet Olympic squads. A few days after the dinner, he was asked to jump-start Inner Circle.
He was born in St. Louis, where his father was a sales engineer. After-school jobs were mandatory, and his psychology degree from the University of Missouri was self-financed. He lived in his hometown for 44 years before deciding it was no fun being landlocked and moved to Florida, but he retains an interest in a St. Louis blues club called Broadway Oyster Bar (coincidence, coincidence) for sentimental reasons. His favorite all-time play is "Glengarry Glen Ross." It's a self-directed j'accuse thing. 
Five years ago he and his wife, Kristen, and their four children, made Casey Key their home port. Their yellow house sits on stilts. The Gulf of Mexico doubles as their front yard. The tennis legend Martina Navratilova is their newest neighbor. Mr. Farrell travels often; those permanent squint lines are remnants of his mountain-climbing days (Cotopaxi in Ecuador and the Matterhorn top an impressive list of scaled peaks). His resume says he resides in Seat 3-C on American Airlines, and three or four days a week he is here tending to ticket sales. And expansion.
The bad news, for cheapskates, is that Broadway Inner Circle isn't just on Broadway anymore: the Los Angeles rendition of "The Producers" has joined, and London's West End is next. So the V.I.P., a species that does not appear endangered, drives the global theater economy? 
"Thank God." Thank God for V.I.P.s? "Well, at least I think so."

HEADLINE: McGreevey Meets Mayors, and Feels a Chill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, April 10 

 BODY:
A few weeks after James E. McGreevey was sworn in as governor in January 2002, he spoke before a group of New Jersey mayors in the State House and was greeted like a conquering hero.
 As the former mayor of Woodbridge, Mr. McGreevey was on a first-name basis with many people in the audience, and his familiarity with their policy concerns and willingness to propose bold and expensive solutions brought the new governor spontaneous outbursts of applause and congratulations. 
 Today, Mr. McGreevey once again spoke to the state's mayors, at their annual convention, but the lukewarm response he received was a striking indication of the strain that has developed between the governor and one of his key constituent groups during his 15 months in office. 
Mr. McGreevey was greeted by tepid applause as he took the stage more than an hour late and explained that his daughter had been ill. Audience members listened politely as he launched into his oft-repeated speech about the state's plans to curb suburban sprawl. Halfway through his remarks, after promising to renovate 200 municipal parks and build two new state parks, Mr. McGreevey paused for a moment, then departed from his written text.
"That was an applause line, by the way," the governor said. After a moment's silence, the audience clapped. 
The issue that has come between Mr. McGreevey and the mayors is the same problem causing him grief with unions, legislators, educators and nearly anyone with a voice in state government: New Jersey's budget deficit. For the second straight year, Mr. McGreevey is facing a mammoth budget gap and has vowed not to raise income or sales taxes. And for the second straight year, his deficit-reduction plan has included a freeze in the amount of aid the state doles out to municipalities.
Last year's freeze forced many New Jersey municipalities to choose between raising property taxes on homeowners or encouraging the kind of new development that would increase their tax bases. So to some in the audience at the New Jersey Conference of Mayors convention at the Trump Taj Mahal casino here, Mr. McGreevey's call for tighter controls on development sounded like a double dose of gloomy economic news.
"It's kind of a bitter pill to swallow," said Chuck Chiarello, mayor of Buena Vista Township in Atlantic County, a Democrat and a longtime supporter of Mr. McGreevey. "Suburban sprawl is one of those issues that everyone is concerned about. But everybody here has to take care of their own backyard, and people are getting a little worried."
Mr. McGreevey and his advisers have heard similar complaints from virtually every point on the state's political compass, and the governor's poll numbers have begun to worry a few political advisers. But Mr. McGreevey has said that governors nationwide have seen their approval ratings sag as the economic slowdown drags on, so he is determined to keep pushing the anti-sprawl agenda he campaigned on.
As he began his address to the mayors, Mr. McGreevey voiced concern for the economic pressures they are facing. "But despite these challenges, we are making progress in making our state a better and safer place to live," he said. Then Mr. McGreevey outlined his detailed proposal for a state plan to preserve open space by steering new development to targeted areas. 
After receiving polite applause at the end of his speech, Mr. McGreevey was ushered to his next engagement -- speaking to a tourism group upset by his plan to raise taxes on casinos -- and the mayors quietly left the room.
"I think he means well," said John Logan, a Republican who is the mayor of Vernon Township in Sussex County. "But he took office at a really bad time."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise a Bit as Investors' Attention Shifts to Profits

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Better-than-expected results by the Internet bellwether Yahoo buoyed technology stocks yesterday.
 The blue-chip Dow also rose slightly in light trading as investors turned to economic indicators and corporate results after anxiously trading on news about Iraq for months. The quarterly earnings season picks up next week, and many companies have warned that results will not meet estimates. 
 "There are some real questions out there that need to be answered about how fast earnings growth will be and is the economy slipping back into recession," said John Caldwell, chief equity strategist at the McDonald Financial Group. "We don't think it's that bad, or anything close, but the market's definitely worrying about that." 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.39 points, or 0.29 percent, to 8,221.33, after seesawing close to break-even for much of the session. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 8.87 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,365.61, based on the latest figures, after trading lower much of the day. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index added 5.59 points, or 0.65 percent, to 871.58.
Advancers edged out decliners by a ratio of about 10 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, and almost 8 to 7 on the Nasdaq. Volume was light, totaling 1.24 billion shares on the Big Board, and about the same on the Nasdaq.
The stocks of many retailers rose on investors' hopes the winding down of war in Iraq would buoy consumer sentiment. The S.& P. retailing index of 31 companies gained almost 2 percent, with all but two components rising.
Children's Place Retail Stores rose $2.19, or 20 percent, to $12.94. The company said sales at stores open at least a year fell sharply in March, but its shares surged as the results were much better than expected.
Banks also got a lift, with all but one member of the S.& P. banking index of 29 companies up. The index rose 1.6 percent. SunTrust Banks, a large Southeast regional bank holding company, said first-quarter net profit rose almost 8 percent, which beat expectations. Its shares jumped almost 7 percent, or $3.52, to $55.08.
Yahoo offered a bright note at the start of the earnings season and climbed $1.40, or 6 percent, to $24.27, after reporting late Wednesday that it had swung to a quarterly profit from a year-ago loss. The company also said full-year revenue would be at least 5 percent higher than forecast earlier, because of a rebound in advertising and growth in broadband services.
Shares of the Fox Entertainment Group, which holds the United States entertainment assets of the News Corporation, plunged to their lowest level in nearly six months. As analysts criticized News Corporation's plans to take over DirecTV, the No. 1 United States satellite television service.
The structure saddles Fox with an additional $4.5 billion of debt, and will force it to issue 74 million new shares to News Corporation as part of the transfer.
Fox shares fell 17 percent, or $4.65, to $22.60.
Hotels.com, an online hotel reservation site, rallied $10.20, or 19 percent, to $63.50. USA Interactive, the media group run by Barry Diller, said it would buy the remaining public stake in Hotels.com for about $1.1 billion. USA Interactive rose $1.59, or 6 percent, to $26.69.
Genentech declined $1.43, or 3.9 percent, to $34.99. Genentech said its first-quarter net profit rose 59 percent. But an analyst attributed the company's results to "reining in expenses, lower taxes and higher contract revenue."
IDEC Pharmaceuticals sank $2.35, or 6.9 percent, to $31.59. IDEC's fortunes are related to Genentech, which helps market its cancer drug Rituxan.
Treasury bond prices fell as stocks rose. The benchmark 10-year note dropped 9/32 , to a price of 99 15/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 3.95 percent from 3.90 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond declined 16/32 , to a price of 106 20/32 . Its yield rose to 4.94 percent from 4.90 percent.

HEADLINE: City Unemployment Rate Rose Again in February 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City climbed to 8.8 percent in February, from 8.6 percent in January, while dropping slightly in the suburbs and upstate, according to state figures released yesterday. Jobs in the city continued to decline in construction, manufacturing, the film industry and finance, and to increase in health services. 
 The data, from the New York State Department of Labor, showed that the statewide unemployment rate, when seasonally adjusted, fell to 6.1 percent in February, from 6.3 percent in January. Nationally, the jobless rate is 5.8 percent, up from 5.7 percent in January. 
 "What you're seeing is a continuation of the trend in unemployment," said Jim Brown, a labor market analyst for the labor department. "It's been rising, and it's probably going to continue to rise for a few months as the economy remains weak. And you're seeing a mixed to weakish job picture -- some seasonal growth but well below historic levels."
The city's unemployment rate, based on a monthly household survey, has been rising steadily since dipping to 5.2 percent in January 2001. The last time it was 8.8 percent was in November 1997.
Although the unadjusted data showed an increase of about 12,000 jobs in New York City in February, several economists said those numbers translated into a loss of 10,000 to 12,000 jobs when seasonally adjusted. Barbara Byrne Denham of The New York Stat, an economic newsletter, said that was the city's largest one-month decline since last July.

HEADLINE: Executives See Weak Economy Continuing 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Chief executives of large companies, perhaps the most accurate economic forecasters recently, expect the economy to remain weak over the next six months but do not foresee a new recession, according to a survey released yesterday.
 Only about one company out of 10 plans to increase employment in the United States in that period, according to the poll of 120 chief executives by the Business Roundtable, an association of leaders of large companies. The rest, some 90 percent of companies, are divided almost evenly between those that plan job cuts and those that expect to hold employment at current levels. 
 "We've got a pretty weak economy," said John T. Dillon, the chairman of the association and chief executive of International Paper. "We all feel great about the war. But we've got to have economic security as well as security for our homeland." 
Since the economy began weakening in 2000, chief executives have consistently made more pessimistic, and more accurate, predictions than Federal Reserve officials or Wall Street economists. 
The executives polled estimated that the economy would grow 2.2 percent this year. Wall Street economists and other private sector forecasters predict growth of 2.4 percent for 2003, down from their forecast of 3.5 percent a year earlier, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter that surveys them each month.
With oil prices having fallen significantly in recent weeks and American forces having taken control of Baghdad, few remain concerned about a new recession. Only 2 percent of executives said the economy would not grow at all this year, and none forecast a contraction, according to the Business Roundtable.
The most recent recession began in March 2001, and the economy began growing again late in 2001.
The number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance fell last week to 405,000 from 443,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The four-week moving average of new claims, which many economists consider a more reliable indicator than the week-to-week data, fell to its lowest level in more than a month.
Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., called the drop an encouraging sign, noting that jobless claims were often the labor market's signal to change directions. But, he added, "it is impossible to know at this point if this week's decline is anything more than noise."
The poll of chief executives was conducted last week, before the Iraqi government began collapsing, and about half of the executives called consumer uncertainty about the war the greatest economic challenge facing corporate America. Still, Mr. Dillon said he did not think that the evidence of military success in Iraq would be a turning point for the economy.
"I think there will be a short-term improvement as inventories are rebuilt," he said. "Inventories have been held at very, very low levels because of all of the uncertainty in the world. But frankly, the fundamentals we're talking about here are largely not war related."
Businesses are using less than 80 percent of their capacity, Mr. Dillon said, and they will not begin investing in new equipment or hiring more workers until demand increases. Many companies are still suffering through the overhang of the 1990's boom.
In the survey, 27 percent of executives said they planned to cut their capital spending over the next six months and 55 percent said they would make no change. Eighteen percent expected to increase it.
A sharp decline in capital spending -- business investment in new factories, equipment and technology -- has hampered the economy since 2000.
Slightly more than half of executives forecast an increase in their own sales in the next six months, but as a group the executives seemed less hopeful than when they were polled in December. Then, 71 percent said they thought that sales would increase over the next year.
Speaking to reporters, Mr. Dillon called on Congress to pass President Bush's tax-cut proposal, saying it would lift consumer demand and stock prices.
Many senators, including some Republicans, are worried that the proposal is too costly, and while economists are divided on the long-term benefits of the plan, few consider it likely to help the economy significantly this year.
About 50 members of the Business Roundtable, all chief executives, met with Mr. Bush at the White House yesterday afternoon to discuss strategies for helping the economy.

HEADLINE: A Gilded Age of Sumptuous Dining Comes to a Close in the St. Regis Hotel 

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Lespinasse, the airy, gilded four-star restaurant in the St. Regis Hotel that was for 12 years the preserve of European and corporate royalty, celebrities and commoners able to afford its sumptuousness announced yesterday that it would close April 19.
 The owners, citing a dearth of profits, said the restaurant's Old World elegance -- which has been likened to that of an exquisite chateau -- had been unable to sustain it during "the current economic and world political climate," according to a statement. 
 It is unusual for a four-star restaurant to close without having lost a star, and the announcement follows by seven months the closing of another Manhattan institution, the Russian Tea Room, the domain of caviar and blini on West 57th Street. 
The closing would reduce to five the number of Manhattan restaurants given a four-star rating by The New York Times. (The others are Bouley, Daniel, Alain Ducasse, Jean Georges and Le Bernardin.) 
Lespinasse (pronounced less peen AHSS), at 2 East 55th Street in the hotel on Fifth Avenue, has a staff of 32, including a kitchen crew of 12. It stopped serving lunch last week.
"We carried it as long as we could," said Guenter H. Richter, managing director of the St. Regis. "Any reopening will be determined by the pace of the economic recovery." 
Some in the food trade viewed the closing as a seismic blow to the city's high-end restaurant business. The industry has been hit hard by a winter of lashing snowstorms and security alerts that kept tourists and business people at bay. 
And in recent weeks, round-the-clock war bulletins have left diners dialing for take-out while clutching their cable remotes. (There was no indication that anti-French sentiment related to the war had anything to do with the closing.)
Tim Zagat, founder of the restaurant guide, said he was not shocked at the announcement of Lespinasse's closing. "The food was very, very good," he said, "but the decor was a bit too ornate, and the furnishings were outdated and heavy." 
While Mr. Richter said he viewed the closing as temporary, he added that the announcement was not a sympathy ploy presaging a miraculous rebirth, since the St. Regis has given formal notice to the workers' union, the New York Hotel Trades Council. Its employees have been informed of the closing, "and we have no intention of changing our mind," he said. The union confirmed that it had received the notice.
Some who have worked there said the restaurant has never made a profit. Mr. Richter declined to comment, but explained that "it was not created to be a restaurant where we expected a high return -- our hotel required a restaurant of that caliber." 
In flusher times its corporate owner, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide of White Plains, might have been able to sustain the losses. "But our occupancy has experienced a dip in a quarter that is never busy," Mr. Richter said. Meals will still be available at the Astor Court restaurant in the lobby and the King Cole Bar. 
The restaurant took its name from the hostess of a Paris salon that drew philosophers, nobles and diplomats. At Lespinasse, visitors luxuriated in the hushed, timeless universe of its pale beige and gold antique decor and were cosseted by a wait staff whose approach was inaudible, thanks to the custom-made rose carpet. The room's five towering floral centerpieces were updated weekly. 
The chef Gray Kunz, a Singapore-born Swiss, became the restaurant's genius-in-residence from 1991 to 1998, and critics swooned over his Asian-accented French cuisine. 
Critics also praised the prize-winning wine list, which balanced young wines with an abundance of rare vintages and was reprinted throughout the evening as wines sold out. 
After the departure of Mr. Kunz in 1998, the toque passed to Christian Delouvrier, formerly of Les Celebrites in the Essex House. Mr. Delouvrier gave more emphasis to classical French themes, while showcasing the culinary traditions of southwest France. 
"Of course I feel sad," Mr. Delouvrier said yesterday. "I want to thank all of the loyal customers, and all of the employees who work with me, for their support." 
Mr. Delouvrier said he was considering several employment options, but his first task would be editing an autobiography adorned with recipes, "Mastering Simplicity: A Life in the Kitchen," due from John Wiley & Sons in the fall. It will trace the roots of his cuisine from Gascony to Paris and New York.

HEADLINE: Philosophies Clash on Commuter Tax 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 10 

 BODY:
At the crux of the conflict between City Hall and Albany over whether to tax New York City commuters is a difference in mind-set: the governor sees the issue in political terms while the mayor views it as a matter of practical survival, even if that bucks political reality. 
 The governor, George E. Pataki, ran against a commuter tax when he was re-elected in November and, in addition to winning more votes in New York City than any other Republican in the last half-century, he dominated the downstate suburbs with nearly 60 percent of the vote. 
 He also used the issue in a series of effective television ads to hammer his Democratic opponent, H. Carl McCall, who said, on video, that he favored a reinstatement of the tax because no one had ever complained about it. Reversing course now would force Mr. Pataki to break a prime campaign promise. 
The death of the old commuter tax (at 0.45 percent) was barely noted in 1999, when a strong economy fueled record surpluses in the city and the state. Repealing the $1.10-to-$1.25-a-day levy on commuters did not seem like such a bad idea at the time.
Indeed, the topic was thought to be so uncontroversial that Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, shepherded its demise in part to help some of the suburban lawmakers in his party, despite the fact that it drained $500 million a year from the city treasury, some for his own district in Lower Manhattan.
But the times have changed; the economy is sputtering. Unemployment is high, with little evidence of improvement on the horizon. The new attitude in the suburbs is one that state lawmakers of both parties describe with one word: anxiety.
Suburban voters are facing double-digit property tax increases and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority fare increase that raised the price of commuter rail tickets by 25 percent, made tolls 50 cents higher at some bridges and tunnels and raised the basic costs of subway rides. Many suburbanites who work on Wall Street have seen their incomes plunge in recent months and are in no mood to help the city. A commuter tax would simply be a piling-on.
"If New York City were in a financial bind by itself, perhaps there would be a great willingness to help," said an aide to a leading Republican senator. "But the state is also in a financial bind, and we need to make sacrifices together. It is not as if those commuters are not getting hit already or are getting a free ride on the back of the city."
The governor spoke against the commuter tax again today, at an appearance in New York City, saying it would cost the city "thousands of jobs." But even if he wavers later, the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and about 17 Republican senators who represent commuters in the city's suburbs are all lined up against it.
Despite these hard-boiled political realities, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is studiously pushing the issue at every turn, borrowing from his successful strategy in a fight for control of the city's schools. In that case, the governor agreed with him. Today, the mayor said he believed that Albany's leadership triumvirate -- Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno -- would not let him down, though he appeared mildly critical of Mr. Pataki's blunt antitax stance.
"I think you have to separate out the politics of how do you adjust tax rates up when needed from the easy political move of reducing tax rates when you don't need them," Mr. Bloomberg said when asked about the pros and cons of taxes.
The mayor wants to raise about $1 billion by extending the city's income tax to commuters but dropping the rates to a maximum of 2.7 percent. His pitch is simple: He believes that he has already taken harsh action, by raising property taxes 18.5 percent, laying off 600 workers and announcing plans to lay off 5,000 more while also facing a $90-million-a-year bill for increased counterterrorism costs in the New York Police Department.
As with his manner on policy and fiscal matters, Mr. Bloomberg often seems to believe that being right on the merits is good enough and views the politics involved as mosquitolike distractions that others ought to ignore.
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg have criticized Albany for what they view as a lack of alternatives for city fiscal relief, spawning a round of bitter remarks between the staffs of the mayor and governor over who has better ideas.
But some Albany lawmakers said it was City Hall that offered no alternatives. They ask whether Mr. Bloomberg has a tin ear for the complexities of Albany politics, and thereby the state, or has a strategy that is not immediately obvious.
The mayor is not posturing, his aides said, but plainly making his case on the merits: If the city falters, the state will too. To underestimate his understanding of Albany politics would be a mistake, they said.
"Tax reform is a fair way to spread the burden of supporting essential city services to those who benefit from them," said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor. "The mayor is well aware that until the budget is done, nothing is off the table and recent history bears that out."
Albany's politics are like a funhouse mirror at times, so the outcome could still spin out in a variety of ways, perhaps as a variation of the mayor's proposal. It remains to be seen if Mr. Bloomberg's single-mindedness will be effective.
But given recent signs at the State Capitol, it appears that he has made no progress to date, as pressure builds in Albany and City Hall to pass budgets to resolve huge gaps.
As Mr. Bruno said after a meeting this week with the governor and Mr. Silver, "The commuter tax is not going to happen."
As if that was not clear enough, he added: "I have been saying for six months that it is not doable, not going to happen and nothing's changed. And there are other alternatives. All people have to do is look at other alternatives and be creative and be imaginative and stop being just, you know, single-minded."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: SOUTHEAST ASIA; 
In Far East of Many Muslims, Press Is Anti-U.S. but Hardly Pro-Jihad

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, April 10 

 BODY:
"Heartening," one Filipino columnist wrote today after watching scenes of cheering Iraqis on television. But, he added, "it's still an unjust war."
 Baghdad seemed farther away than ever, and more puzzling, in Southeast Asia, a region whose Muslims had opposed the war in dutiful but somewhat uncertain solidarity with their Arab brothers. 
 The press in Islamic Indonesia and Malaysia has been almost uniformly critical and often derisive about the war. The tone has been the same in the Philippines, a Roman Catholic nation with close American ties and a significant Muslim minority. 
But the opposition has had a half-hearted, been-there ring to it, lacking the intensity and the calls for jihad that accompanied America's attack on Afghanistan more than a year ago and that still run through the Arab media in the Middle East.
When Garin Nugroho, a leading Indonesian film director, wanted to show his opposition to the war, he announced that he would refrain from drinking Coca-Cola -- for a day.
The press in the region seems to feel less obligation now to stand in solidarity with Islamic brothers in the Middle East and a bit more leeway to offer a glimpse of the other side of the argument. The tone is striking in a region where Al Qaeda has found refuge and is seeking recruits.
"It's a challenge for the media to remain balanced in their reports of the war," said Ulil Abshar-Abdalla of the Liberal Islam Network in a radio discussion of press coverage.
In an attempt to present the American, Arab and Asian perspectives on the war, the private Indonesian station Metro TV, in its daily program "Iraq Under Attack," is showing images from CNN, Al Jazeera and Cable News Asia.
"Even in so-called Islamic media, the tendency has largely been toward not portraying this war as a religious one," said Atmakusumah Astraatmadja, chairman of Indonesia's independent Press Council. "Iraqis have been fleeing to Indonesia for years, and refugees usually flee countries with oppressive policies."
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said, are "related to the survival of Americans decades ahead, while we can only think of planning for tomorrow." He added: "I don't quite like the arguments, but they have their own reasons, not just to hit at suggested terrorists."
In Malaysia, where the press is firmly under the thumb of the government, opposition to the war has been modulated by pragmatism. Public figures are quoted warning that anti-Americanism and boycotts can be politically and economically damaging.
"Malaysians have been urged not to vent their anger by boycotting American brands as the action would make a dent in our economy," said the minister of youth and sports, Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, quoted in The Star, an English-language daily.
Public protests have been carefully appropriated by the Malaysian government for maximum political gain as it looks toward parliamentary elections in the coming year. The point is made repeatedly that the criticisms are antiwar rather than anti-American.
At the same time, any attempt at protest by opposition parties is squelched -- particularly calls for Muslim solidarity by the Islamic party known as PAS.
"The war is not a war between Christians and Muslims," said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. "There is no crusade. Many Christians including Pope John Paul and other Christian leaders opposed the attack on Iraq. But we fear, eventually, the targets are Muslim countries."
Dr. Mahathir, who was transformed from gadfly to ally when he gave America full backing in its war on terror, has begun to annoy the United States again with repeated barbs about Iraq.
Washington threatened diplomatic and economic reprisals last month after he called Americans cowards and bullies and said: "Maybe after Iraq, Iran; and after Iran, probably Syria or Libya." No leader could be sure he would not be next, he said.
The small government-owned afternoon daily, Malay Mail, has been particularly harsh, with headlines like "When Will This Parody End?" "High Noon for Cowboy Bush," and "Israel the Real Winner."
In the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the columnist Rina Jimenez-David described the cheering crowds in Baghdad and wrote, "The images are heartening indeed." But she added, "While 'regime change,' one of the stated reasons for the campaign, is a near certainty by now, that still doesn't make this unjust war a just one."
The Philippines is the most pro-American nation in Asia, and polls there show that most people support the war. But this is also the country with some of the most unfettered media anywhere. Columnists and editorial writers have indulged themselves in paroxysms of anti-American wit.
"When the allied forces are done leveling Iraq to the ground, will the world let them off with an 'Oops, sorry. At least we made sure there were no weapons of mass destruction?' " Jenny Manuel and Gai Olivares, regular columnists in The Daily Tribune, wrote last week.
"Americans have this hero complex," they wrote. "They're the Great Liberator! You'll see it in their movies; they always come in with their superior technology and save the world, whether it's from aliens, mammoth asteroids or giant spiders."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: A MILITARY TOWN; 
War Strains Germans at American Base

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: ALAMOGORDO, N.M., April 10 

 BODY:
Vera Kieren, a teacher at the Deutsche Schule here, said it happened when her husband told a convenience store cashier recently that their daughter did not drink Coca-Cola. 
 "The cashier said, 'But she does live in this country, doesn't she?' " said Ms. Kieren, who moved to Alamogordo with her family three years ago from Baden-Baden, in southwestern Germany. 
 "It's been a bit tense for us with the issues in Iraq." Ms. Kieren said, surprised at the implication that any right-thinking parents in the United States would have their child drinking Coca-Coca. 
Perhaps some friction was inevitable. Since 1992, the German Air Force has conducted pilot training operations at nearby Holloman Air Force Base, drawn by the clear azure skies and sparsely populated expanses that American pilots have trained in for decades. As those operations have grown, this city has seen its German population balloon to 2,000, or nearly 1 in 15 residents.
But when the German government began to oppose the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, many American-born residents here began to re-evaluate their feelings about their new neighbors. 
"I have a son in the Navy, so I'd like to see the Germans more involved," said Richard Zierlein, owner of the Fix-It Center, an appliance repair store. "We have a substantial number of people from our community deployed in Iraq, so I'm sure many people feel the same way."
Others in Alamogordo have opposed the German military presence here ever since training operations were shifted to Holloman in 1992 when George Air Force Base in California closed. Now those residents have found a new issue to latch on to. 
"The German war position is another darn annoying factor about them being here," said Robert Jones, 73, a rancher and former president of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association. "I do not like the possibility that German aircraft could crash on my land, setting off fires and killing my cattle." 
Such sentiment has not kept Germany from steadily reinforcing its military and cultural presence in Alamogordo, a city best known for its proximity to the site of the first atomic bomb explosion but one that already had historical connections with Germany. 
Hundreds of German prisoners of war were interned here in World War II. After the war, German scientists were taken to nearby White Sands to develop rocket-launching technology in a clandestine program code-named Operation Paperclip.
"Past and present, the German community has blended right in with the rest of the people," said Mayor Donald Carroll. 
In recent years, the German community has created its own multidenominational church, the Johanneskirche. The private Deutsche Schule, or German school, has 180 students in grades 1 through 10. 
There is a German aisle in the local Lowe's supermarket, carrying products like Feinkost herring fillets, Ritter chocolates and Panni Spaeztle, home-style egg noodles. 
And the Germans of Alamogordo have many supporters. "We make the distinction between the Germans here and the political ones over in Germany," said Ed Carr, executive director of the Economic Development Council for Otero County, of which Alamogordo is the seat. 
Germans inject a substantial amount of money into the local economy. They spend nearly $1 million a month in and around Alamogordo, and their government invested $140 million in improvements at the Holloman base. They have pumped new life into the real estate market -- many lease sprawling ranch-style homes -- and they spend money outside Alamogordo as well, on tourist excursions to escape temperatures that soar above 100 degrees.
"If you want to know something about the United States, ask our German neighbors," Brig. Gen. Bill Lake, a former commander of the 49th Fighter Wing, which is based at Holloman, said in a recent issue of Airman magazine. "They take the time to enjoy themselves."
Still, what was once was viewed as a plum assignment, with a 50 percent pay increase for overseas duty and a housing allowance, has become relatively less sought after. An uncertain economic outlook in Germany and reductions in its air force have resulted in fewer applicants for German military jobs abroad, a German officer said.
"Many people are not willing to leave Germany because they're not sure their old jobs will be there when they return," said the officer, Capt. Marc Probst, a spokesman for the German air defense school, a separate operation about an hour's drive south of Alamogordo at Fort Bliss, Tex. "They are afraid to get caught out of the loop."
Each year, the Germans invite about 4,000 people from Alamogordo for an Oktoberfest celebration on the base, replete with beer, live oompah bands and bus transportation to prevent drunken driving incidents. 
Even so, Heinz Hinterleitner, the principal of the Deutsche Schule, said in an interview: "It's an awkward situation, because the soldiers left on the base here are the Germans. The Americans are gone because of the war."

HEADLINE: House Endorses Oil Drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
House members endorsed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge tonight as they considered a wide-ranging energy measure that seeks to spur domestic energy production and provides tax incentives to oil and power companies.
 Siding with the Bush administration on one of its top energy initiatives, the House defeated on a 228-to-197 vote an effort to strip the drilling plan from the measure. Lawmakers did support limiting development to a 2,000-acre "footprint" in the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the refuge on the North Slope of Alaska. 
 The Senate, which is developing its own energy measure, rejected the drilling plan in a crucial budget vote last month and Republican leaders there say they do not intend to return to the issue in their energy proposal. But House advocates of drilling said they hoped to persuade the Senate to reverse that position. 
Sponsors of the bill said that the nation needed to tap more of its own energy resources to decrease its reliance on imported oil and that the Alaskan drilling would help stimulate the economy and was supported by the Native Americans in the area.
"The Eskimos that live there want this drilling," said Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska. "We can do this safely."
Opponents of the drilling, who include Democrats and moderate Republicans, said the refuge was a national resource that needed protecting. They said the drilling vote was particularly wrong-headed given that lawmakers defeated an increase in auto gas mileage standards that its authors said would save more oil than the refuge could produce.
"What right do we have as human beings and what sense does it make as a nation to open a pristine area to drilling when we are not willing to take basic steps toward conservation?" asked Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York. 
Returning to a sweeping energy policy that stalled last year, Republican authors of the bill defeated several efforts to alter the measure, which touches on all aspects of national energy production and use.It is an outgrowth of an energy plan drafted in the early months of the Bush administration under the supervision of a task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.
"It advances a balanced approach to energy production and use by accomplishing and encouraging a responsible, diverse mix of energy sources and options," said Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the Energy Committee.
Critics said the measure was full of "industry goodies" while giving short shrift to energy conservation and undercutting some important environmental restrictions. The bill provides $18.7 billion in a wide array of tax breaks, many of them for oil and gas companies, besides opening the refuge to oil exploration. 
"It is a bad bill," said Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Energy Committee.
The supporters of the bill showed their strength in an early vote by soundly defeating on a 268-to-162 vote a proposal to require a 5 percent reduction in automotive fuel use by 2010, which its sponsors said equated roughly to an average standard of 30 miles per gallon. 
Opponents of the auto mileage standard proposal said it could harm the economy by forcing automakers to cut production of popular sport utility vehicles and increase the risk of car crash injuries in the smaller cars that would meet the standards.
"Bringing smaller cars in results in more deaths on the highway," said Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, the state that is home to much of the auto industry.
The House also defeated a proposal by Mr. Dingell to rewrite electricity rules in the measure. Democrats say the proposal could put consumers at risk of price swings and complained that the bill does not address the sort of market manipulation regulators say contributed to the energy crisis in California and the West two years ago.
"It has virtually no protections against fraud," Mr. Dingell said.
Backers of the measure say the changes in the electricity market will make utilities more competitive. 
Though opponents said the measure does not do enough to promote conservation and development of new energy sources, it does grant tax credits for solar and wind power and encourages homeowners to make energy-efficient improvements.
Authors said that the measure recognized that the transition to new types of power would take years and that oil, gas and coal would remain the main fuels for the near future.
The bill grants oil and gas companies tax breaks to encourage production from marginal wells and those in deep offshore waters, allocates millions of dollars for the development of new coal technology, eliminates a tax on diesel fuel for trains and barges and allows utilities to more quickly write off the cost of new transmission systems.

HEADLINE: Plan to Alter A Yardstick For Pensions 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Corporations would find billions of dollars of pension shortfalls eliminated overnight under a proposal being prepared to address a longstanding issue in pension accounting.
 The proposed legislation, being drafted by a Democrat and a Republican who sponsored changes in retirement laws in 2001, would create a permanent replacement for the 30-year bond in certain pension calculations. An interim measure, allowing companies to use a more favorable rate, is set to expire at the end of the year. 
 The proposal, embraced by the nation's biggest corporations, would use a rate that is tied to high-rated corporate bonds and that is higher than both the interim measure and the rate that companies have traditionally used to measure their pension obligations. The higher rate, known as the discount rate, makes obligations to retirees look smaller, at least on paper. 
Because companies are required to keep their pensions funded at certain levels, smaller obligations will shrink their mandatory contributions, even though nothing else has changed.
America's companies, large and small, had a total pension shortfall of about $300 billion at the end of 2002, according to the government agency that insures pensions. That was by far the largest total deficit in the history of that agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and it has aroused concerns about the health of the pension system. The worst deficits are found among a relatively small number of companies, in sectors like the auto and airline industries and deregulated public utilities.
Many big companies, most notably General Motors, have said they must make billions of dollars of contributions to their plans in the next few years to comply with funding requirements. Company pension plans have weakened in the last three years as stocks and interest rates have plummeted.
Companies received some temporary accounting relief at the beginning of 2002, but will show an immediate weakening if that measure expires at the end of this year with no new rate.
Large companies have lobbied hard for relief. Actuaries say that for every percentage point rise in the rate, pension liabilities appear 10 to 15 percent smaller. The new proposal would raise the rate by about eight-tenths of a percentage point, based on the market environment at the end of last year. Under the old calculation pegged to the 30-year bond, companies would have used a rate of 5.84 percent, versus 6.67 percent under the interim measure. If the new proposal had been in place at the end of the year, the rate would have been 7.42 percent.
For General Motors, to use one very large example, the proposed rate would have reduced liabilities by about $7 billion. G.M.'s level of pension funding would have been 91 percent instead of 75 percent. The funding level of a pension plan determines whether a company must make contributions. Other companies have smaller pension funds than G.M., but their liabilities would also look smaller. 
Congressional aides said they expected the proposal to be included in a broader retirement savings package to be introduced today by Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. The two sponsored legislation two years ago that allowed workers to make larger contributions to their retirement savings plans and eliminated some pension rules. 
Though companies have made forceful arguments for the proposed change in pension accounting, the change would not necessarily help all companies, or help employees, over the long run. For companies with severe pension deficits and weak finances over all, the change could cover up the weakness longer.
That may not matter if market conditions improve and pension funds recover by themselves. But if unfavorable conditions persist, the accounting change would conceal fatal illnesses at some pension funds, which would ultimately fail.
Pension plans are insured by the government, but only up to specific limits, as the pilots of US Airways recently discovered when their benefits were reduced.
In addition, when a pension fund is taken over by the government, the cost is borne by other companies that sponsor pension plans and pay insurance premiums. As the pension agency's deficit grows, so does the likelihood that it will raise its premiums, causing companies that have kept their pension funds robust to subsidize those that have failed to do so.
The pension agency has questioned the approach Congress is contemplating, saying it blurs together issues that should be kept separate: the nuts and bolts of pension accounting and the question of whether companies are setting aside enough. The suspension of the 30-year bond in 2001 caused a reassessment of pension accounting and has prompted some academics to call for a more thorough review of how pension values are measured. 
"We must first find an accurate measure of pension liabilities," Steven A. Kandarian, the agency's executive director, told the Senate Finance Committee this month. "Once pension liabilities are accurately measured, appropriate funding rules can be addressed."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Market for Priciest Apartments Declines

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The Manhattan real estate market, in a reversal of former patterns, is finding strength in more modest apartments and weakness at its most expensive end, according to a market survey of condominium and co-op apartments.
 The survey, the Insignia Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, reported that overall apartment prices were stable or fell only slightly last year, despite a recession, fears of terrorism and a volatile stock market. The average price remained more than double that of a decade ago. 
 The number of sales recorded by the survey last year were up sharply from 2001 and the second highest on record. That was partly because of the aftershocks of the World Trade Center attack, which stalled sales in the last quarter of 2001 and led to a surge in sales in the first half of last year. A period of softening sales and prices followed. 
But the most significant growth, according to the survey, occurred in the market for studios and one-bed-rooms. Sales of one-bedroom apartments increased 32 percent, to 3,305 from 2,497, the second-highest yearly sales total on record. Sales of studio apartments increased 11 percent, to 1,275 from 1,149. 
In contrast, the sales of apartments with at least four bedrooms fell 13 percent last year, to 118 from 135, and were 35 percent below the 181 sales recorded in 2000.
Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, who prepared the report for Douglas Elliman, said that within the overall averages, there were some significant changes.
He said the lowest mortgage rates in 40 years had stimulated sales and led to higher prices in more modest studio, one-bedroom and smaller two-bedroom apartments, while having a limited effect on larger and more expensive homes.
"We are seeing a bottom-up real estate recovery, with smaller apartments being the first to respond to lower mortgage rates," he said. Buyers of lower-priced apartments are more likely to finance most of the purchase price, he said, and are more sensitive to interest rates. 
"The market is very hot because of interest rates," said Joanne Kennedy, a principal of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, a Manhattan real estate agency. She said one of her brokers recently worked with a young couple renting a $2,950 one-bedroom apartment. They discovered that they could buy a $445,000 one-bedroom apartment they loved in the West 60's, put 30 percent down and cut monthly housing costs to $2,420, and get a tax deduction on top of that. "The first-time buyer has a great opportunity," she said.
In 2002, the median price for one-bedroom co-ops rose by 7 percent to $343,000, while prices of studios rose by 2 percent to $299,000. Co-ops make up about three-quarters of all sales of studios and nearly two-thirds of all sales of one-bedrooms. The median price for a condominium studio was $280,000 and for a one-bedroom was $429,000, both down slightly from 2001.
Condominiums tend to cost more than co-ops because the maintenance costs are less, the rules are not as strict as those for co-ops and there are fewer purchase restrictions.
The weakness in the market for the most expensive apartments can be seen most starkly on the Upper East Side. The Douglas Elliman survey recorded only 36 sales of co-ops with four or more bedrooms last year, compared with an average of 89 a year during the previous decade. Prices for those apartments fell by $295 per square foot last year, or 21 percent, to an average of $1,092 per square foot, or about $3.3 million for a 3,000-square-foot apartment. 
With that softness, the neighborhood lost another distinction. The report showed that prices for Upper West Side cooperatives of all sizes approached the level of those on the Upper East Side in 2002, $617 per square foot, compared with $619 per square foot. Two years earlier, prices on the Upper East Side were 8 percent, or $42 a square foot, higher than those across town.
In TriBeCa and SoHo, where apartments tend to be the largest and prices the highest, average condominium prices rose last year. Half the condominiums sold cost more than $1.5 million, an increase of 11 percent from 2001 prices and 20 percent from 2000. But even so, prices for the largest apartments, with three or more bedrooms, dropped significantly in 2002. The price for a typical three-bedroom fell 17 percent, to $1.87 million.
The new survey confirms the sense of many brokers that the market has gone from being a sellers' market to a balanced one, with neither buyers nor sellers having a strong advantage. 
They see the market at a turning point, but no one is sure which way it will turn. Rising mortgage interest rates could drive prices down, Mr. Miller said, but a postwar economic upturn could lead some hesitant buyers to make a commitment. 
"There are a lot of people and a lot of money on the sidelines," he said.

HEADLINE: In Jersey City, a New Assessment of a Diner's Value: Priceless 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, April 10 

 BODY:
To make way for downtown traffic, city leaders decided last year to seek the demolition of the Flamingo diner, one of the last mom-and-pop businesses in its booming financial district. But the plans opened up a new lane of traffic -- a parade of protesters who beat a path to City Hall.
 Today, after months of hearing a growing clamor from the Flamingo's supporters, Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham announced that he would spare the wrecking ball and allow the 24-hour diner to stay where it has spent the last 35 years, rather than razing it for a street widening. 
 The mayor made his announcement at the Flamingo, in the midst of the lunchtime crowd, with some of the customers and longtime employees crying tears of relief. The owner, Andy Diakos, a Greek immigrantwho was dressed in his everyday cook's uniform -- a white shirt and pants -- hugged Mr. Cunningham.
"I've listened to the people," the mayor said. "God bless the Flamingo, and may she fly forever."
Mr. Cunningham said he was swayed by the 10,000 signatures gathered on a petition to save the diner, the crowds of hundreds who showed up at several City Council meetings to protest the closing, and the calls he received from many patrons, especially elderly customers who said the Flamingo was one of the few 24-hour places where they could still get an affordable meal.
Instead of tearing down the building, at the corner of Montgomery and Greene Streets, the city will now make Greene Street one-way during rush hour, the mayor said.
The city had offered Mr. Diakos more than $1 million for the diner and the four-story, red-brick Victorian-style building in which is situated. 
Using the city's power of eminent domain, officials said they needed to tear down the building to accommodate the increased traffic created by a new office building under construction by the securities firm Goldman Sachs, which is expected to employ 6,000 people.
But Mr. Diakos said he was not interested in the money, but only wanted to keep running the diner, where he works six or seven days a week alongside several relatives.
City officials were not counting on the determination of his three daughters, who were raised working in the restaurant alongside their parents and aunts and uncles. The young women hired a real estate lawyer, and mobilized the Flamingo's loyal customers to call on the council during meetings.
"All my father ever wanted to do was to continue running the Flamingo," one of the daughters, Kalliope Diakos, 30, said today as she stood next to the mayor. "I am happy that the city has not turned its back on my father and my family."
Ms. Diakos, who works in sales and marketing for HBO, graduated from the London School of Economics, she said. Her sisters, Joanna, 28, and Maria, 27, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. 
"It's because of his hard work that we could do that," Kalliope said.
Mr. Cunningham, who is running for the State Senate in the June 3 primary, and has said he will seek re-election as mayor, said he had not spoken to Goldman Sachs about his decision. 
"I'm pretty sure Goldman Sachs would have preferred the building to go down," Mayor Cunningham said. "But I've checked their voting address, and they don't vote in Jersey City."

HEADLINE: Day to Day, but Making a Living; 
Immigrant Laborers' Wages Top Minimum, Study Finds

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
You've seen them or men like them: Gonzalo Javier and eight others standing on the sidewalk in front of a paint store in Woodside, Queens, waiting for a contractor to drive up and offer them a day's work. 
 But how many paint stores and how many Gonzalo Javiers are there around New York City? 
 In the first attempt to survey the informal system that provides workers for painting, landscaping, construction and housekeeping jobs, a study has found that 6,000 to 8,000 day laborers regularly congregate at 57 places in the metropolitan area. The study, which surveyed 290 day laborers last summer, also found that they earn, on average, $9.37 an hour in the spring and summer and $7.61 an hour during the slower winter months. 
"These folks are in demand," said Prof. Edwin Melendez, one of the study's two authors and director of the Community Development Research Center at New School University. "There are job opportunities out there, and American natives are not fulfilling the demand for a lot of this employment." 
Gonzalo Javier is, in fact, a typical day laborer. He is an illegal immigrant from Colombia. In the survey, three-quarters of the laborers acknowledged that they were illegal immigrants, and more than 90 percent came from Latin America (roughly one-third from Mexico, one-third from Central America and one-third from South America).
Mr. Javier is working to send money to his wife and two children, now 5 and 7. "I am able to send them money every week, so I have a lot to be thankful for," he said recently, his eyes growing moist at the thought of not seeing his family in four years. "Sometimes I ask myself whether the sacrifice is worth it, but the economic situation is so bad back in Colombia that I have to stay."
The survey found that day laborers say they send, on average, $3,600 back to their families each year.
Woodside, where Mr. Javier waits for work, is one of the larger day laborer sites, the survey discovered. It stretches for a dozen blocks along Roosevelt Avenue, where as many as 300 immigrants gather for jobs that pay $8 to $12 an hour.
Other sites are smaller, like the corner of Hooper and Lee Streets in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where about 20 women -- Hispanics, Haitians and Eastern Europeans -- go each morning hoping to land housekeeping jobs that pay $6 to $7 an hour. 
Professor Melendez, who teaches urban policy, detailed some of the difficulties day laborers face. "They take risks when they go to work with people they haven't met before," he said. "Sometimes they're abused in terms of not getting paid or getting pushed around by contractors."
But in some of its most surprising findings, the survey found that many day laborers earned considerably more than the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, and that many said they liked the life they had chosen. 
Jose Carmona, a Peruvian who has been a day laborer for nine years, echoed the summer survey's findings last week as he waited on Roosevelt Avenue. "In my opinion," he said, "you can make more money here than if you work in a factory or a supermarket. If I work in those places, I wouldn't earn enough to send money to Peru." 
Some days Mr. Carmona earns $80 as a painter's helper, other days $120 as a master painter. If a contractor or homeowner picks him to work only three days in a week, he will probably earn more than $300 with no taxes withheld, far more than the $206, before taxes, that many immigrants earn in full-time minimum-wage jobs.
The survey found that monthly mean earnings for day laborers were $855 last May, with some workers saying they earn more than $1,500 in a good month. Fourteen percent of the laborers said they earned $7 or less an hour, 63 percent said they earned $7 to $10 an hour, and 23 percent made more than $10 an hour.
Mr. Carmona lives with his wife and three children just a few blocks from his day laborer site, and he sends $150 a month to his mother in Peru. "I don't feel exploited," he said. "It's a happy life. I get to see my kids a lot."
Manuel A., 57, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who declined to give his last name, said the life of a day laborer was not always so sweet. "A lot of the times the people don't pay you," he said, standing with 40 other immigrants on a recent frigid morning at the corner of Gramatan and Sidney Avenues in Mount Vernon, in Westchester County. "At the end of the day, they'll say, 'We don't have any money,' or 'We'll come back and pay you another day.' And when they come back another day to pick up workers, they hide from you."
Fifty percent of the day laborers surveyed said they had not been paid one or more times, and 60 percent said that at times they had been paid less than the agreed-upon wages. 
To identify the places where day laborers wait for work, the study's authors asked for information from community groups, immigrant advocacy groups, churches and experts on immigration. In addition, when they found day laborers, they asked what other sites they used. The authors acknowledge that they may not have discovered every site in the metropolitan area and that new sites are always popping up.
To conduct the survey, 11 bilingual graduate students from the New School randomly chose 290 day laborers from 29 of the 57 sites for one-hour interviews, and the day laborers were paid $20 each for their time. A Ford Foundation grant helped finance the study.
While the survey found many places around the city and suburbs where day laborers congregate, even in affluent suburbs like Roslyn Heights on Long Island and Mamaroneck, in Westchester, this does not mean that the laborers are always welcomed. In 2000, two Mexican immigrants in Farmingville, on Long Island, were promised work but were instead taken to a basement and beaten. Other towns have been more welcoming. Glen Cove and Freeport, both in Nassau County, and Mount Kisco in Westchester provide indoor centers where the laborers can wait for contractors while sheltered from the elements. 
"Communities generally feel ambivalence," said Nadia Marin-Molina, executive director of the Workplace Project, an immigrant advocacy group in Hempstead, on Long Island. "There are people who accept day laborers as part of the work force, and there are people who feel hostile about seeing immigrants in their communities." 
The vast majority of day laborers are men. Only 5 percent of those surveyed were women, but that figure was still higher than the number surveyed by a similar survey, taken in 1999 in Los Angeles, which included no female day laborers. The Los Angeles study was conducted by Abel Valenzuela Jr., director of the Center for the Study of Urban Poverty at U.C.L.A., who was co-author of the New York study. 
Most day laborers have not made it a career -- 45 percent of those surveyed in New York said they had been day laborers for less than a year, and only 16 percent said they had been at it four years or longer. 
They may not have many job options. One-third of the day laborers said they did not seek permanent jobs because they lacked legal papers, and one-third said that the reason was inadequate English. 
But they do fill a need. One contractor in New Rochelle, N.Y., who uses day laborers, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: "These guys are great. They work hard. A lot of white boys don't want to work hard. They drink, they smoke pot, they give you a hard time."

HEADLINE: Planning the 9/11 Memorial 

 BODY:
Yesterday, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation introduced a 13-member jury to judge an international competition for the design of a memorial to the victims of 9/11. The memorial that will eventually be built at ground zero is the part of the downtown renovation closest to the heart of most New Yorkers. By any measure, the jury is a balanced, distinguished collection of individuals, including Maya Lin and Vartan Gregorian, as well as architects, art historians and a representative of the families of 9/11 victims. 
 The timetable for the memorial competition is ambitious. The development corporation hopes to announce a winning design in the fall of this year. But there is another value to consider besides speed, and that is public participation. The review process that led to the selection of Daniel Libeskind's plan for the World Trade Center site allowed many opportunities for the public to express opinions at nearly every stage along the way. In fact, one of the most striking things about that process was the way it evolved from a nearly inchoate set of ideas about how to proceed into a dialogue among architects, officials and the public that greatly enlarged the public's franchise in urban planning. 
 The corporation and its memorial design jury will need to keep that example in mind over the next few months. Insiders in the process say that one of the corporation's major concerns is trying to protect the integrity of its jury, to keep it from being unduly influenced by public opinion. But if the past year of architectural deliberations proved anything, it proved that the public is fully capable of expressing opinions on these matters in a way that enriches the discussion without compromising the end result. The jury must do its work unhampered. But without full and formal participation by the public, that work will never seem complete.

Braving War and SARS to Meet in Vegas

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
I coughed on the flight out, though I was trying as hard as I could to make it one of those nonchalant "just a cold -- don't even know where Hong Kong is" coughs. No need to quarantine the plane, really. The gentleman in the aisle seat looked me over, not quite convinced. 
 Once in SARS-wary Las Vegas, my cabdriver, Jethro Parker, told me the whole convention might need to be quarantined if so many as one Asian visitor fell sick. 
 Remarkably, almost 90,000 of us made it out here for the annual National Association of Broadcasters convention. That's down from 115,000 attendees a few years back, but still a respectable number when you consider that the once carefree act of travel now entails defying a recession, the threat of terrorism, an ongoing war and, of course, the mysterious respiratory disease called SARS. One prominent network television executive was spotted wearing a mask on the flight out.
Las Vegas, much like Orlando, Fla., the other iconic American destination built on the promise that planeloads of tourists and conventioneers would be flown in, is especially vulnerable to today's travel-related anxieties. The loss of one locally based carrier, National, led a Wall Street analyst who covers casino stocks to question whether enough planes were landing here each day to fill the city's more than 125,000 hotel rooms. And the suspension of some flights by Japan Airlines and Singapore Airlines has led to concerns that casinos' best customers, Asian high rollers, may stay away.
Still, for all the concern, this week's broadcasting convention has been a heartening tribute to the resilience of commerce. European exhibitors seemed especially nonchalant about traveling in this age of serial anxieties. "We are a little more laid back about these things, I suppose, having become accustomed to the threat of the I.R.A.," said Ben Moore, a London-based salesman at BT Broadcast Services' elaborate booth, which included a makeshift pub. "You have to evaluate these risks statistically." Rosalia D'Aprano, who was promoting a digital and satellite telecommunications exhibition that is to take place in Venice in October, said the risks of being hit by terrorism while traveling had to be put in perspective: "You are more likely to be run over by a car at home, especially back in Italy the way people drive."

New Gigs For the Wizard Of Baghdad

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
IF New York political leaders are as shrewd as they want us to believe they are, they will lose no time in tracking down Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf and signing him to a personal services contract. Gov. George E. Pataki, in particular, could use him as a tonic for approval ratings that have begun to look a bit wan.
 In case his name does not leap off the page, Mr. Sahhaf is the Iraqi information minister -- or he was until he disappeared midweek along with other leading functionaries of the Saddam Hussein regime. 
True to the spirit of the ruling Baath Party, Mr. Sahhaf toed a Marxist line in this war. Only his muse was Chico Marx, who said in "Duck Soup" to a woman he was conning, "Who you gonna believe -- me or your own eyes?"
Those American tanks rolling into the Iraqi capital? Figments of the imagination, the minister insisted. American soldiers? "The infidels are committing suicide by the hundreds on the gates of Baghdad." On and on he went, spinning enough material to keep "Saturday Night Live" going for five years.
O.K., the man has a slight credibility problem. Nobody's perfect.
But you have to give him major points for bravado and fierce loyalty. They are virtues that if channeled properly, could serve some New Yorkers well in these difficult days.
There is ample American precedent for taking an enemy, making him a friend and putting him to work. This is hardly rocket science. Come to think of it, what better example than that embodiment of rocket science, Wernher von Braun?
Dr. von Braun, who died in 1977, was the brains behind the United States space program in the 1950's and 60's. But before that, in Germany, he threw in with the Nazis and designed the V-2 rockets that Hitler fired at London during World War II.
Well, bygones have a way of becoming bygones.
Is Mr. Sahhaf any less worthy? New York politicians might think about it.
Governor Pataki, for example, has not shaken off a consensus that he tried to pull a fast one this month with federal antiterrorism money intended for New York City. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had done the heavy lifting in Washington. At the last minute, the governor loped in, demanding a changed formula that would have given him, not the mayor, the upper hand in spending the cash.
Even some of his fellow Republicans called it an unseemly money grab. Mr. Pataki had no choice but to retreat.
Imagine what Mr. Sahhaf could have done for him. The Iraqi would have looked reporters in the eye and scoffed: What money grab? This is a pioneering form of revenue sharing. Oh, and that 50-cent increase in the mass transit fare approved by the Pataki-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority? That's a service enhancement.
Who knows? He might have gotten three or four people to buy it. You can't blame a fellow for trying, especially if he speaks with conviction.
MR. BLOOMBERG, too, could use a man of such special talent. One often-heard knock on the mayor is that he isn't tough enough in his dealings with President Bush and Mr. Pataki, fellow Republicans both. Mr. Sahhaf would have no qualms about slapping them around.
Do you think that a man who referred to American and British leaders as "louts," "blood-sucking bastards," "animals" and "stooges" is about to let a governor, or a president, scare him? No way. A mild-mannered mayor needs an attack dog like that.
If New York government doesn't work out for Mr. Sahhaf, there are always business opportunities.
He could go to work flacking for the Yankees pitcher David Wells, who is himself given to playing fast and loose with the facts. Mr. Wells would do well to have a kindred spirit handling his publicity.
The Rangers could hire Mr. Sahhaf to assure hockey fans that their failure to make the playoffs for six straight years is the core of a clever rebuilding strategy. (That is, unless those other habitual losers, the basketball-playing Knicks, land him first.)
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Tyco tycoon and a symbol of corporate greed, could send forth Mr. Sahhaf to tell the world that his outlandish spending was a crafty plan to stimulate the economy. Surely "Urban Cowboy," the Broadway musical that has received some of the most dreadful reviews in years, could also benefit from the Iraqi's deft touch. 
And if Mr. Sahhaf can't make it in New York -- not everyone does -- there is always that midnight train to Georgia. There just might be a spot for him at the Augusta National Golf Club.

HEADLINE: GOLF; 
Sodden Lot Will Be Site of Protests Tomorrow

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: AUGUSTA, Ga., April 10 

 BODY:
With the proper historical marker, it could pass for just another small Civil War battleground. Then again, cleared of trees, grassy and unoccupied, the five-acre lot half a mile from the main entrance to Augusta National Golf Club would also make a good picnic ground.
 Saturday, it will probably be something in between. An estimated 900 demonstrators and 125 sheriff's deputies and state troopers will be corralled on this nondescript, fenced-in parcel for the only official protests scheduled during the Masters. They will be joined, unofficially, by thousands of red fire ants that plague the tract: just kick up some dirt; they are itching to march, too. 
 After a new city ordinance regulating protest demonstrations, two court challenges and some limited backroom negotiating, this is where Augusta will play host to the eight groups that filed formal requests for one-day protests, including Martha Burk and the National Council of Women's Organizations, Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and a splinter group of the Ku Klux Klan. Each plans a demonstration, in some manner, that deals with the men-only membership of Augusta National Golf Club.
And who owns this drab lot, sitting down in a hollow, across the road and not quite within site of the famed golf course? Augusta National bought it last year. That's right, the club is host for its own protesters.
If all goes as planned, not since Augusta somehow evaded General William Tecumseh Sherman's combustible advance from Atlanta to Savannah will the city have so artfully bypassed a firestorm.
"We'll let 'em do it, get it over with and then go home," Lt. Johnny Whittle of the Richmond County Sheriff's Department said as he sat in his cruiser on the edge of the protest site today. "Hopefully, everybody will be happy and have fun. Well, I guess everybody won't be happy. But we'll treat them right, anyhow."
The local sheriff's deputies will serve a central role Saturday, using their cruisers as pickets, of sorts, among the picketers. They will be lined up bumper to bumper to create physical barriers, partitioning the various groups and establishing penned-in areas. Demonstrators will not be allowed to move from group to group.
Richmond County will have 57 deputies and their cruisers in the lot. Adjacent Columbia County said it would send 40 deputies. The Georgia State Police will send 20 troopers.
"We have a Plan A and a Plan B and a Plan C," said Lieutenant Whittle, who also said there would be a bus and a van to transport anyone who violated the protest guidelines to the Richmond County Jail. "But we don't want to have to do that."
The police do not expect everyone who filed for a permit to appear Saturday, but among those they do expect are representatives of the Brotherhood Organization of New Destiny, a group of religious conservatives who have frequently been critical of Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. And the police have heard from a group called Golfers for a Real Cause, as well as a demonstrator who wants to demonstrate in support of the war in Iraq and another group called People Against Ridiculous Protests.
Todd Manzi, an unemployed advertising executive from Florida, has been in Augusta all week trying to draw attention to the two Web sites he created in the hope of discrediting Burk's credentials to speak on behalf of American women in the Augusta National debate. Manzi will protest Saturday, and he has also rented a parking lot next to the site to sell some anti-Burk paraphernalia.
Today, Manzi was alone in the five-acre lot wearing a yellow rain slicker while holding an umbrella and standing next to a placard critical of Burk's cause. Most people in passing cars, who have to peer down into the lot, appeared more confused than curious. But occasionally, some drivers would beep their horns and Manzi would wave his umbrella in salute.
The lot, unmowed and turned muddy by several days of rain, is not much of a setting for the climactic event after 10 months of national debate over Augusta National's membership policies.
The lot is several feet below the grade of Washington Road, the busy highway that passes by the club and its famed Magnolia Lane, slightly less than half a mile away. Burk has called it a pit, but that is an exaggeration. There is, however, no sidewalk leading to the lot.
Asked how it would be decided which groups would congregate where on Saturday, or if they would have their choice of spots within the five acres, Lieutenant Whittle smiled and said, "First come first served."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Hospital's Debt Rating Reduced 

BYLINE:  By Alison Leigh Cowan (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
A bond-rating firm lowered its assessment of Mount Sinai-N.Y.U. Health System's bonds yesterday, putting them below investment grade for the first time since Mount Sinai Hospital and NYU Hospitals Center merged in 1998. The firm, Fitch Ratings, said that the "decline in financial performance of the system and the significant challenges faced by the system, primarily Mount Sinai Hospital" prompted the lowering of its rating to BB+ from BBB-. 
The outlook on the bonds was also revised from negative (when it was classified investment grade) to stable. Last week, Mount Sinai reported losing $72 million last year and said it may lose at least that much this year. The hospital's spokesman was not available for comment last night.

HEADLINE: Airlines Fear the Loneliness Will Persist 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The nation's airlines, which blamed the war in Iraq for a plunge in business that forced the layoffs of more than 10,000 employees and the elimination of dozens of flights, are not expecting the postwar era to be much brighter.
 The weak economy, continued fears over terrorism and the complicating factor of the mysterious illness SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, are likely to offset any increase in travel that could be expected once it is clear that the conflict in Iraq has subsided, industry officials and analysts said yesterday. 
 "We are not planning or counting on any bounce back," said Douglas A. Hacker, executive vice president of United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation and the No. 2 carrier behind American Airlines.
E. Han Kim, professor of finance at the University of Michigan Business School, explained the predicament for airlines. "Everything being equal, I would say, yes, the airlines would come back, but everything is not equal," he said. "SARS is hurting some airlines just as much as the war and, unfortunately, you can't bomb SARS." 
Indeed, Mr. Hacker said in an interview yesterday that SARS, which had its first outbreaks in Asia and is highly contagious, was having the same effect on United's Pacific routes as the war was having on its traffic across the Atlantic. "What it looks like is kind of a continuation of war" on Pacific travel, Mr. Hacker said. The complexities involving overseas travel have made it difficult for any airline to plan for the next few months, United included, he added.
"In this kind of environment, you can't have a forecast," Mr. Hacker said. "Our crystal ball remains pretty cloudy. We're kind of getting used to that. Our main theme is, 'Let's work against a pretty ugly scenario.' "
Even under more normal conditions, this time of year has typically been one of the most sluggish travel periods. While traffic usually increases slightly during the weeks around Easter and Passover, it is generally slow until the middle of May, when colleges end classes for the year and family vacations begin.
This year, officials at airlines, rental car companies and other travel businesses say advance reservations for later in the spring and summer are relatively weak. Travelers have delayed booking their trips even longer than usual. So, even with the war appearing to be close to conclusion, airlines can expect that travel will be soft for the next six weeks, and possibly longer, said Sandy Rederer, an aviation consultant in Arlington, Va.
"My guess is that we remain semi-mired for some time," Mr. Rederer said. "There will be a lag before people get over the deferral of travel that was delayed before the war." 
John Heimlich, an economist with the Air Transport Association, a trade group, agreed that the short-term outlook was gloomy. Fare discounts can be expected to draw some passengers back, he said, but at a cost. "I think what we'll see in the next several weeks is that volumes will start to improve at much lower fares per mile."
In reality, the last thing the industry would want, politically, would be a strong rebound in travel. Airlines have been lobbying for a $3 billion relief package that would include assistance for more than 10,000 workers who have been furloughed since the start of the war, on top of 100,000 who have lost their jobs since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The House and Senate have passed slightly different measures that have been folded into legislation financing the war; that legislation is now being considered by a conference committee of the two bodies.
The White House, however, has called the package too generous, and the potential bailout has prompted debate over whether the war was to blame for the airlines' problems or whether they stem from business decisions.
"That's the business they're in, and war is part of the risk," said Kevin Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel departments and business travelers.
Mr. Mitchell argued in testimony before Congress that the airlines did not warrant help unless they took steps to limit executives' salaries and imposed other streamlining measures. Lately, a number of airline executives have taken salary reductions, after cutting the pay of employees in the wake of the war.
On Wednesday, the air transport association released figures showing that the war had caused the steepest drops in travel this year, though it said that SARS was having an effect as well.
For the week ended Sunday, the group cited a year-over-year 17.4 percent decline in overall travel, including domestic and international routes. Domestic travel fell 14 percent during the week, while the Asia-Pacific region was off more than 25 percent. During the week of March 23, there was a 10 percent decline for overall travel.
Mr. Heimlich said the declines were even more significant given that traffic had risen in the first couple of months of 2003, although from mediocre levels in 2002.
Robert Mann Jr., an aviation consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y., said SARS was having a substantial effect. "We've seen disruptions of service that even exceed the reduction in schedules due to the economy and the conflict in the Middle East," he said.
Mr. Mann said he was particularly concerned about the effect of the respiratory illness on United, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, well before the war began, and provides service to Asia. The other major United States carrier to do so is Northwest Airlines.
He and other analysts have expressed concern that the drop in travel could be another obstacle in United's bankruptcy revamping. "For United, it's, 'Gosh what else? Will it be the locusts next?' " Mr. Mann said.
That is overstating United's predicament, Mr. Hacker said. "We are more optimistic about the more rapid return of domestic bookings and revenue than we are internationally," he said.

Helping to Keep New York Busy
 Wall Street is quiet on the weekends but not nearly as quiet as film production has been in New York since 9/11. One of the few indie productions not to take the Toronto route lately is "Rick," a nonmusical adaptation of Verdi's 1851 opera "Rigoletto" transposed to the canyons of Lower Manhattan. 
 "Rick" is being made by ContentFilm, a New York-based production and distribution company that has already filmed Sigourney Weaver's "Guys" and the Sundance hit "Party Monster" in the city. The picture is being shot with Sony's 24F video system to keep costs down, and to allow the production to remain in New York rather than heading off to a more forgiving economic climate. 
A recent Saturday visit to the set found Bill Pullman, who plays the imperious, abrasive businessman who is the film's title character, folded into a tiny corner office in an Exchange Place insurance company. There was barely enough room in the cozy, wood-paneled cubbyhole to accommodate Rick's overflowing desk, not to mention the imposing actor, the camera crew and a dense flock of overhead lights put into place by the cinematographer, Lisa Rinzler ("Pollock"). 
Just to make it interesting, the set was shaken every few minutes by subway trains, rumbling through what sounded like the office next door. "Rick" will be the first feature directed by Curtiss Clayton, a film editor whose many credits in the independent film community include "Drugstore Cowboy" (1989), "To Die For" (1995) and "Buffalo '66" (1998). 
The sequence being shot involved a young job seeker (played by the comedian Sandra Oh) forced to submit to an interview with the casually sadistic, hermetically self-involved Rick. When he didn't cut her off, the subway did. But Ms. Oh gallantly pushed on, and with each take Mr. Pullman sank deeper into his character, finding more implicit menace and sheer strangeness built into each line. 
" 'Rick' is a story about a man who reaps what he sows,"' said Ms. Oh, "and my character, Michelle, is unwittingly the Oracle at Delphi. Rick and his co-workers treat her quite cruelly, and Michelle just gets mad."
Ms. Oh added, enigmatically: "She colors his life in a certain way, and then various events, some really tragic, happen to the character of Rick. Things come back to him." 
The screenplay for "Rick" is by Daniel Handler (a novelist better known under the pseudonym he adapts for his children's books, Lemony Snicket). It is a contemporary version of Verdi's opera about the deformed jester whose mockery of his master's victims brings on a curse that leads to tragedy for himself and his daughter.
"It starts off on a farcical tone and gets progressively heavier until the ending is really quite severe," Mr. Clayton said. "So the tone is very tricky. Rick is brought around to see the tragedy he has made for himself, but he doesn't really have any stronger self-awareness at the end than he does at the beginning." 
Mr. Pullman said: " 'Rick' is its own piece, but yet it is this curious reflection on the cave wall of 'Rigoletto.' And 'Rigoletto' was an adaptation of a previous play by Victor Hugo. To me it's always a surprise how modern 'Rigoletto' is because of the ambiguities: Rigoletto is a jester, he's compromised, but he's also charismatic and interesting. The daughter is the victim, but she's also making her own trouble." The role of Rick/Rigoletto's daughter is being played by Anges Bruckner of "Murder by Numbers." 
Of his screenwriter, Mr. Handler, Mr. Pullman said: "I haven't met him yet. He has a dark sensibility, but a way of turning the darkness into a different aspect. Like he says in the Lemony Snicket books, 'This is a sad story, so if you don't like sad stories, don't read this one.' With 'Rick,' it sounds sad, but it's also kind of engaging."

Schwarzenegger Sequel
Can 10,000 Arnold Schwarzenegger fans be wrong? 
Well, maybe. Some of them must have paid good money to see "End of Days." But as of Tuesday, 10,606 of them had signed a petition posted on the Web site thearnoldfans.com, urging Warner Brothers to move ahead with John Milius's "King Conan," the long planned and long deferred sequel to Mr. Schwarzenegger's "Conan the Barbarian," which Mr. Milius ("The Wind and the Lion," "Big Wednesday") wrote and directed in 1982. (Conan fans do not consider Richard Fleischer's 1984 "Conan the Destroyer," which also starred Mr. Schwarzenegger, worthy to be mentioned in the same breath with Mr. Milius's epic work.)
"I've got to have Milius back," said Randy Jennings, who has operated TheArnoldFans.com with Rene de Jong since 1998. " 'Conan' was my favorite movie of Arnold's when I was growing up, even more than 'Terminator 2.' "
The hesitation, both on the part of Warner Brothers, which owns the sequel rights, and Paradox Entertainment, a Swedish company that owns the rights to the barbarian character created by Robert E. Howard, appears to stem from a basic business quandary: would it be more profitable to continue the series with the middle-aged Mr. Schwarzenegger (he is now 55) or find a younger face and bulging physique to replace him? 
Mr. Milius's script is an action- packed but movingly elegiac study of the aging Conan, who is forced against his anarchist nature to become the ruler of a remote corner of an emerging empire. While battle scenes abound, written in Mr. Milius's chiseled, Hemingwayesque style, the tone is finally somber and reflective, as in one of John Ford's late westerns. The script also gives Conan a son, who is taken away from him and raised by an evil emperor, a role that would seem perfect for a younger star who could draw in the kids. 
"It didn't take long at all for the 10,000 signatures to appear," Mr. Jennings said. "We just put it up four months ago. Which is amazing, since it usually takes something political to reach these kinds of numbers."

Ahead of Cannes
Six weeks before its May 14 opening, the Cannes Film Festival has announced two titles that will be shown in the festival's prestigious Official Selection program. The opening night film with be "Fanfan la Tulipe," a remake of a much beloved 18th-century adventure novel filmed by Christian-Jaques in 1952. The remake stars Vincent Perez and Penelope Cruz and is directed by Luc Besson protege Gerard Krawczyk. 
The next day, May 15, will bring the premiere of the Wachowski brothers' "Matrix Reloaded," on the same day it opens commercially in the United States.

HEADLINE: Crackdown in Cuba 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 10 

 BODY:
The Cuban government's recent crackdown has left some 80 dissidents with lengthy prison terms and American and European diplomats wondering why President Fidel Castro would jeopardize delicate but vital commercial relationships to put down a peaceful movement of librarians, journalists and democratic activists. 
 Although the dissident groups were all relatively small and entirely peaceful, the Cuban authorities virtually eliminated them with prison sentences of 20 years and more, which have been internationally condemned as unjust and excessive. The result has been an alienation of once-friendly governments and a hardening of resolve among longtime critics of Mr. Castro's government. 
 In the United States Congress, where a movement to ease travel and trade restrictions had gained momentum, lawmakers voted 414 to 0 for a resolution that called upon the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to condemn the arrests and trials. In Europe, where Mr. Castro has always enjoyed a warmer reception than in the United States, longtime observers expressed doubts that any nations there would increase trade, investment or aid anytime soon.
Mr. Castro's willingness to jeopardize relations indicated to some diplomats and analysts that the island's growing dissident movement posed a greater threat than imagined, especially at a time when the economy is virtually moribund. Given the high and rising profile of the dissidents, the government may have thought it was time to assert control.
"Clearly Castro and some others in the Cuban government saw this political opposition that was emerging as a real threat," said Daniel Erikson, director of the Cuba program at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. "Cuba made the decision that taking care of the problem of internal political order was more important than potential economic gains."
The crackdown came after a series of what the Cuban government saw as provocations by James Cason, the chief of the United States Interests Section in Havana, whom Mr. Castro called a "bully with diplomatic immunity." Since arriving in Havana, Mr. Cason has actively courted the opposition, inviting them to his residence to meet with visitors and even allowing a group of independent journalists to use his home for an ethics seminar.
Some analysts and Cuban officials suspected the increasingly public support for the opposition many have been part of a strategy by hard-liners in the Bush administration to provoke a crisis to close off any possibility of improving relations.
"These arrests are a message to the U.S. that Cuba will not permit the U.S. to actively and publicly build the opposition in Cuba," said Geoff Thale of the Washington Office on Latin America. 
The Cuban government's insistence that people like Raul Rivero, the dean of the island's independent journalists, or Hector Palacios, a pro-democracy reformer, merit double-digit prison terms hints at a prisoner swap as another motive for the crackdown. Five Cubans are currently in United States jails on espionage charges. 
But as with many events in Cuba, there is a domestic message, too. 
The economy offers dwindling chances for people to resolve life's daily hardships. By portraying itself as the target of foreign subversion and defender of the homeland, the government may be trying to prepare for unrest if there is further economic deterioration.
"The government has gauged the mood and things may be getting a bit stifling," said Lisandro Perez, director of Florida International University's Cuban Research Institute. "They may have less tolerance because things might get jumpy again."
Diplomats here and abroad advocate caution in how Washington responds, saying that national and economic interests argue for not cutting off all relations or contacts. They point out that the United States' trade embargo against Cuba has been Mr. Castro's best excuse for his country's economic woes and strongest justification for staying in power.
"Painting Castro as the bad guy could very well lead to the triumph of the hard-liners in the Cuba debate," said Brian Alexander of the Cuba Policy Foundation, a Washington group that advocates lifting the embargo. "That would be counterproductive, because everybody knew Castro had it in him to do this."

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Weak Market Gives Merger Better Chance 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
The News Corporation's takeover of DirecTV would give Rupert Murdoch control of the two main satellite television operators in Latin America and a virtual monopoly in Brazil, the region's largest market.
 But analysts say the meager pickings from pay television across the region may help clear many of the potential regulatory objections. 
 Mr. Murdoch's offer to pay $6.6 billion for a 34 percent controlling stake in Hughes Electronics, DirecTV's parent, would effectively give him control of 95 percent of the Brazilian satellite television market. 
Although DirecTV Latin America said the deal did not provide for its fusion with Sky Latin America, which is owned by the News Corporation, it indicated that it would not be opposed to such a combination.
The companies' competitors and media analysts were taking a regional merger for granted.
"Together, Sky and DirecTV in Brazil would have a 95 percent share of the market, a huge concentration of power," said Paulo Roberto Hisse de Castro, partner and director of marketing and new business at TecSat, the direct-to-home operator with the remaining 5 percent.
Brazil's antitrust organization, CADE, and its telecommunications watchdog, Anatel, said they would scrutinize the merger, but officials at the agencies declined to give any further details.
With much of the continent in the economic doldrums, pay television has not produced good returns for either group across Latin America. Last month, DirecTV Latin America filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States after a loss of $202 million in Brazil alone in 2002. Sky Brasil lost $386 million in that year, analysts said.
But a merger would undoubtedly give Mr. Murdoch a near unassailable lead across a region where people watch a lot of television.
An estimated 10 million satellite dishes are installed across Brazil. So far, they have been used to improve reception of the channels of the country's seven broadcasters.
"It doesn't take a genius to figure out that it wouldn't be that difficult to get those people to migrate to pay TV," said Antonio Rosa, partner at Dainet, a Sao Paulo-based media consultant. "But they won't do it charging what they have been charging so far."
With a broad choice of public channels, many Brazilians consider pay television a luxury. Monthly bills from Sky, DirecTV and their cable competitors average about $30, nearly half the minimum monthly wage.
Sky finished last year with 1.6 million subscribers, 0.5 percent up from a year earlier, while DirecTV lost 1.7 percent, closing the year with 1.58 million subscribers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
None of the usual bromides, as an industry conference hears tough talk about tough times.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
THE tough talk heard here yesterday at the 2003 Management Conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies evoked Cher's command to Nicolas Cage in "Moonstruck" after she slapped him: "Snap out of it!"
 The self-congratulatory bromides typical of speeches at the annual meetings of trade organizations were notably absent, at least for the opening general session of the conference. Speaker after speaker offered refreshingly frank advice on confronting the challenges faced by Madison Avenue as it struggles to emerge from its worst downturn in decades. 
 "This is a new world we're living in, a new world we have to respond to," said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, a research company in Atlanta. This world, he said, has been transformed by "an undercurrent of anxiety" among consumers "that's really the new normalcy in the marketplace." 
"We're going to recover from the uncertainties about the war and the economy," he added, but "in different ways than you might expect." 
"There's a new set of values among consumers," Mr. Smith said, citing the results of a survey conducted last week by Yankelovich that confirmed "an intense craving for comfort and connection." That is considerably at odds with the shopping-and-spending mentality encouraged for so long by so many agencies on behalf of their marketer clients.
When survey respondents were asked what they would do more often when the war with Iraq ends and the economy improves, Mr. Smith said, they listed saving money, spending time with family, taking family vacations and renovating the home. He contrasted those replies with what they said they would do less often: invest in the stock market, work overtime, travel by airplane, watch television and buy luxury products.
Another trend Mr. Smith warned about was what he called "the socialization of marketing resistance" -- a pushback against what consumers deem to be aggressive hucksterism, which may prevent them from ever again perceiving advertising as "an invited guest."
As an example, Mr. Smith asked how many people in the audience of more than 200 advertising professionals had never used answering machines to screen calls from telemarketers. The answer was: no one.
If "we are going to be uninvited guests in people's homes," said another speaker, Roy M. Spence Jr., president of GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, then "we must prove what we have to offer is of value."
That can be achieved, said Mr. Spence, whose clients include Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Southwest Airlines, the Air Force and Wal-Mart Stores, if agencies demonstrate to consumers that brands have "a purpose beyond making money, and because they have a purpose beyond making money, they make money."
For instance, "we got Southwest out of the airline business and into the freedom business," Mr. Spence said. "Wal-Mart lets all people buy the same things as rich people buy. Krispy Kreme, and I'm a franchisee, is in the 'magic moment' business, and the U.S. Air Force is in the winning business."
"Clients are crying out for leadership from us," Mr. Spence said. "When we don't provide that leadership, they're going to find it someplace else."
One client who spoke, Bill Lamar, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for the United States operations of the McDonald's Corporation, outlined what his troubled company was seeking from agencies to help restore its leadership in the fast-food field.
"What is particularly troublesome for you and me as marketers is that our only boss, the American consumer, is becoming more and more difficult to excite, persuade and reach," Mr. Lamar said. "We need to motivate customers to visit us more often and be brand loyal, and as a result make us be more profitable."
If "the traditional methods of marketing are losing their power to change customer behavior," he added, "we are challenging ourselves and our agencies to seek new, innovative ways to reach consumers."
Among them: placements of the McDonald's logos and products in the popular Sims online game; signing sponsorship deals with sports like basketball and stock-car racing to reach the younger male consumers whom McDonald's has identified as "key customers," Mr. Lamar said, along with children and women, particularly mothers; and forming an alliance with the Intel Corporation to offer wireless Internet access at McDonald's restaurants.
"Some of our best prospects are staring at a computer screen instead of a television screen," Mr. Lamar explained. McDonald's will also increase its online advertising, he said.
Ken Kaess, the president and chief executive of one of the biggest McDonald's agencies, DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom, agreed that agencies "need to convince clients that we can make a difference" rather than repeating to each other "the frightening realities of the recession or the current economics of our industry."
"Sitting around licking our wounds isn't going to get us anywhere," said Mr. Kaess, who is also the 2002-4 chairman of the association. "Taking some clear-eyed initiative will."
"Now is the time to seize the moment and demonstrate to clients that we are a valuable partner in the survival and success of their brands," he added, "to establish once and for all that agencies provide something marketers can't get anyplace else."
The conference, the 85th annual meeting of the association, known as the Four A's, is scheduled to continue at the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans hotel through today.

HEADLINE: Tax Cut Deal Is Set Back, but House and Senate Republicans Resume Talks 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
A deal struck by House and Senate negotiators on Wednesday to postpone a decision on how large a tax cut to allow unraveled today after a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian that would have limited the reduction this year to less than half of what President Bush requested.
 The negotiators, all Republicans, worked all day today and into tonight searching for a new way to keep most of the tax cut plan alive. 
 The latest permutation would set different tax levels for the House and Senate. Ultimately, if there is to be a cut, the House and Senate will have to agree on a single figure. But this agreement would put off that decision until later in the year when an actual tax bill is under consideration. 
The problem for the negotiators was clear: Because four Republican senators have broken party ranks, there is not a majority in the Senate for any tax cut larger than $350 billion over 10 years. That is well below the $726 billion Mr. Bush wants and less than the $550 billion or so that would satisfy most of the White House demands and allow the president to claim a political victory.
Since they do not have the votes in the Senate now, the negotiators' goal seems to be to try to delay the final decision to give the president and Republican leaders more time to swing crucial votes.
The fight is not over an actual tax reduction. It is over a budget plan, called a budget resolution, that is not a law but establishes a limit on the size of a tax cut that, under arcane rules, is not subject to a filibuster in the Senate. That would mean that tax legislation the Senate will consider later in the year would need only 50 votes to be approved and not the 60 that would otherwise be necessary.
Last month, the House approved the full $726 billion cut the president requested. The Senate approved only $350 billion, an amount that would probably preclude the White House proposal from eliminating the income tax on most stock dividends.
Negotiators are hoping that at least two Republican senators who oppose a larger tax cut will vote for the budget deal simply to allow a budget to pass, a situation that the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, said would "kick the can down the road."
The deal reached on Wednesday also set separate tax levels for the House and the Senate. Late in the day, the Senate parliamentarian, Alan S. Frumin, said the particulars of the deal violated Senate rules. But senators said tonight he had given the new agreement his blessing.
It would initially make any tax cut over $350 billion subject to a challenge in the Senate that would require 60 votes to overcome. But under the arrangement, the 60-vote majority would not be necessary if a tax cut in a House-Senate conference agreement exceeded $350 billion.
At the White Housethis afternoon, Mr. Bush met with corporate executives about his tax plan. His press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush believed that a tax cut as close as possible to the one he proposed was "the best package to create the most economic growth."

HEADLINE: Conquest And Neglect 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Credit where credit is due: the hawks were right to say that a whiff of precision-guided grapeshot would lead to the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime. But even skeptics about this war expected a military victory. ("Of course we'll win on the battlefield, probably with ease" was the opening line of my start-of-the-war column.) Instead, we worried -- and continue to worry -- about what would follow. As another skeptic, Michael Kinsley of Slate, wrote yesterday: "I do hope to be proven wrong. But it hasn't happened yet."
 Why worry? I won't pretend to have any insights into what is going on in the minds of the Iraqi people. But there is a pattern to the Bush administration's way of doing business that does not bode well for the future -- a pattern of conquest followed by malign neglect. 
 One has to admit that the Bush people are very good at conquest, military and political. They focus all their attention on an issue; they pull out all the stops; they don't worry about breaking the rules. This technique brought them victory in the Florida recount battle, the passage of the 2001 tax cut, the fall of Kabul, victory in the midterm elections, and the fall of Baghdad.
But after the triumph, when it comes time to take care of what they've won, their attention wanders, and things go to pot.
The most obvious example is Afghanistan, the land the Bush administration forgot. Most of the country is back under the control of fundamentalist warlords; unpaid soldiers and policemen are deserting in droves. (Remember that the Bush administration forgot to include any Afghan aid in its latest budget.)
President Hamid Karzai's brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, told an Associated Press reporter: "It is like I am seeing the same movie twice and no one is trying to fix the problem. What was promised to Afghans with the collapse of the Taliban was a new life of hope and change. But what was delivered? Nothing. Everyone is back in business."
The same pattern can be seen on the economic front. President Bush won a great triumph in 2001 when he pushed through a huge tax cut -- claiming that his plan was just the medicine to cure the economy's ills. What has happened since?
The answer is that things have gradually fallen apart. There was one quarter of good growth, early in 2002 -- and there were cries of triumph over the policy's success. After that, however, things went steadily wrong. Growth was too slow to create jobs: at the end of 2002, after a year of "recovery," fewer people were working than at the end of 2001. 
And in the last two months the situation has deteriorated rapidly. In February and March the U.S. economy lost 465,000 jobs, bringing the total job loss since the recession officially began in March 2001 to more than two million.
At this point the employment decline has been bigger, and has gone on longer, than the slump that took place during the first Bush administration. And there's no sign of an upturn: new claims for unemployment insurance are still running well above the level that would signal an improving labor market. 
Some hope that the economy will turn around of its own accord -- that consumers and businesses, relieved that the war has gone well, will begin spending freely. But hope is not a plan. What is the plan?
The answer seems to be that there is no plan for the economy. Instead, the White House is fixated on achieving another political triumph -- the elimination of taxes on dividends -- that has little or no relevance to our current economic troubles.
I could demonstrate this irrelevance by going through an economic analysis, but here's a telling political clue: USA Today reports that faced with concerns in Congress about budget deficits, the administration has indicated that it is willing to consider a phase-in of its dividend plan.
That is, it's willing to forgo immediate tax cuts -- the one piece of its proposal that might actually help the economy now -- in order to be able to pass its long-run proposal intact, and hence claim total victory.
The scary thing is that this slash-and-burn approach to governing may continue to work for Mr. Bush's people because the initial triumphs get all the headlines. Unfortunately, the rest of the world has to live in the wreckage they leave behind.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: RECONSTRUCTION; 
Details Given On Contract Halliburton Was Awarded

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
The Pentagon contract given without competition to a Halliburton subsidiary to fight oil well fires in Iraq is worth as much as $7 billion over two years, according to a letter from the Army Corps of Engineers that was released today.
 The contract also allows Kellogg Brown & Root, the Halliburton subsidiary, to earn as much as 7 percent profit. That could amount to $490 million. 
 The corps released these new details in a letter to Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and one of the two senior lawmakers who asked the General Accounting Office to investigate how the Bush administration is awarding contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq. 
The reconstruction effort could cost up to $100 billion and become one of the most lucrative building programs in decades.
The contract to Kellogg Brown & Root was cited in the lawmakers' request to the G.A.O., the investigative arm of Congress. Mr. Waxman and Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, asked that special attention be paid to "allegations that Halliburton has received special treatment from the administration." 
Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 until 2000. When he left the company to run for vice president, Mr. Cheney received over $30 million in compensation, Mr. Waxman said. 
Since the attacks of Sept. 11, Kellogg Brown & Root has won significant additional business from the federal government and the Pentagon. It has built cells for detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and is the exclusive logistics supplier for the Navy and the Army, providing services like cooking, construction, power generation and fuel transportation. 
Since the war with Iraq began, Mr. Cheney has been repeatedly questioned about his ties to his old employer and the oil industry.
But the administration said that these contracts and all other contracts to rebuild Iraq were awarded without any comment from Mr. Cheney or anyone else in the White House.
"The White House has no role in selecting individual contractors," said Michael Anton, spokesman for the National Security Council.
Lt. Gen. Robert B. Flowers, the commander of the Corps of Engineers, wrote in his letter that Kellogg Brown & Root was chosen because it was the only contractor considered capable of developing what he called "complex, classified contingency plans" and then to carry them out "on extremely short notice."
"No other contractor could satisfy mission requirements in the time available," General Flowers wrote.
He also said that the Defense Department could not follow public procedures for awarding the contract, including a public notice, because the war plans and the need to fight oil fires in Iraq were then classified information. In the future, however, General Flowers promised "ample opportunity for competition" to restore Iraq's oil infrastructure.
The most sought-after contract will be awarded by the United States Agency for International Development and will cover the initial work to rebuild Iraq's roads, water and power systems, schools and hospitals. Bidding was restricted to five American companies for the same reasons that Kellogg Brown & Root won its contract without any competition: the need for speed and for security clearances.
But government contract experts say that those needs have been exaggerated and that they may be violations of international trade agreements as well as federal rules.
Mr. Waxman responded to the letter from General Flowers with several new questions.
While accepting that the administration may have had valid reasons for giving the two-year contract to Kellogg Brown & Root for emergency work during the war, Mr. Waxman wrote, "It is harder to understand, however, what the rationale would be for a sole-source contract that has a multiyear duration and a multibillion-dollar price tag."
He asked General Flowers in a letter today how the Army determined the cost of the work to be done by Kellogg Brown & Root and when the Army would replace the current contract with one up for competition.

HEADLINE: Optimism Up; Retail Sales Also Increase 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In the first encouraging news about the American economy in weeks, two reports released yesterday showed that consumers are not only spending more money, but that they are also somewhat more confident about the future.
 Retail sales, which slid 1.3 percent in February, rose 2.1 percent in March, the Commerce Department said. 
 The gain, which was much higher than the consensus estimates of economists, was the largest monthly advance since October 2001. Leading up to the report, economists were projecting that retail sales would increase 0.6 percent in March. 
Still, analysts noted that March's sales gains were not distributed widely. Almost all of the increase was a result of a sharp jump in auto sales and a huge weather-related increase in the sale of building materials. Excluding those two items, retail sales rose 0.2 percent.
Sales at department stores, which account for about 6 percent of total retail sales, fell in March, the Commerce Department said.
That news was consistent with reports on Thursday from most big chains like J. C. Penny and Target, which showed that sales slumped in March. 
In a separate report that provided an early snapshot of what consumers might be doing this month, the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment jumped to a reading of 83.2 from a nine-year low of 77.6 in March. 
Analysts said the improved mood of consumers stemmed from the successes in the war in Iraq as well as a sharp decline in energy prices. 
"Consumers are starting to feel the impact of lower energy prices, which is good news," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "But the key will be when the labor market starts to improve. And my guess is that is a second-half story."
Nevertheless, Mr. Berner said he was inclined to raise his first-quarter growth forecast a bit, to around 1.7 percent from 1 percent.
"We have had a month or so with a lot of numbers coming in worse than expected, cranking up the feeling that consumers might be retrenching or that we might be on the verge of a double-dip recession," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services. "The retail sales figures suggest the trajectory of consumer spending is positive, and is enough to keep the economy growing."
In another report yesterday, the Labor Department said that prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers rose 1.5 percent in March, as energy prices surged in the run-up to the war in Iraq. The so-called core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.7 percent.
With so much slack in the economy, the increase in producer prices is not a cause for alarm, analysts said. Indeed, the sight of rising prices indicates the economy is on the mend.

HEADLINE: Warning to North Korea on Nuclear Arms 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, April 11 

 BODY:
A top Russian diplomat said today that a nuclear-armed North Korea was against Russian national interests and that the Kremlin would re-evaluate its opposition to international penalties should the North Koreans develop nuclear weapons. 
 The statements, by Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov, who was the Kremlin's emissary to North Korea during a diplomatic mission in January, amounted to a warning to North Korea that patience was ebbing in one of the few nations that has offered it sympathy during a five-month nuclear crisis with the United States. 
 North Korea has said it will regard international penalties as an act of war, a position Russia has previously endorsed even as it has tried informally to mediate the nuclear dispute. 
But in an interview with the Interfax news service, Mr. Losyukov said Russia would continue to oppose international penalties against North Korea's nuclear program only "as long as our North Korean colleagues maintain common sense." 
Should North Korea begin producing weapons, he said, "Russia will have to seriously consider its position, as the appearance of nuclear weapons in North Korea and the possibility of using them close to our borders goes categorically against Russia's national interests." 
"If the issue in North Korea becomes one of nuclear weapons development or, worse, of the possibility of using them, this presents us with a very serious choice." 
Mr. Losyukov's comments reflected not only growing Russian concern over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, but perhaps concern that the United States' and Britain's apparent triumph in the war in Iraq might embolden the White House to consider military action against North Korea. 
Since the United States confronted the North Koreans last autumn with evidence that they were secretly conducting a nuclear weapons program in defiance of the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, North Korea has abrogated the treaty and restarted a reactor capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. 
North Korea's leaders have insisted that only direct talks with the United States can persuade them to abandon their program, but the White House has argued just as adamantly that the nuclear program is an international problem requiring global pressure and multilateral talks. 
The United States has said it has no plans to attack North Korea and that it believes that the standoff over its nuclear program can be resolved in talks. But it also has taken a number of actions, such as airing a recent proposal to move American troops in South Korea out of range of North Korean artillery, which the North has denounced as preparations for war. 
The Bush administration's top arms proliferation official, Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton, said this week that rogue states like North Korea should take a lesson from the events in Iraq. 
Mr. Losyukov said Russia feared that a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula would affect Russian territory and endanger Russian citizens living along the short border it shares with North Korea. 
The Russian government, he said, is studying ways to shield towns along the border from the effects of a nuclear battle. "We are obliged to consider preventive means to safeguard our interests, and -- why hide this? -- to protect our population," he said. "The government has given orders to this effect to the proper authorities." 
Russia has tried to maintain friendly relations with North Korea, its ally during the cold war, even as it has sought to broaden ties with South Korea. In Seoul on Thursday, the Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said North Korea might well ignore United Nations condemnation of its nuclear program. 
Today, the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's nuclear-fuel company, Tenex, opened an office in Seoul. The company supplies nearly a third of the fuel needed for South Korean nuclear reactors.

HEADLINE: Nigerian Elections Seen as Test for Civilian Rule 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, April 11 

 BODY:
Nigerians are trying to do what they have never managed before: move from one democratically elected civilian government to another, while keeping the nation's generals in their barracks.
 Whether they can do that, beginning Saturday with elections for the legislature, is a crucial test for Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, with 120 million people. The voting is also being watched closely by other Africans, for whom free and fair elections are rare. 
 As the world's sixth largest oil producer, Nigeria's political stability is of considerable import to the United States. Since moving to civilian rule in 1999, Nigeria has been showered with American military and economic aid, as well as nearly $9 billion in direct investment. 
The balloting on Saturday is a relatively low-stakes affair for seats in Nigeria's two-house legislature. The real battle occurs the following Saturday, with the presidential race and gubernatorial contests in Nigeria's 36 states. 
Still, the initial voting will be a barometer of Nigeria's fledgling experiment with democracy. "If the process is bungled on that day, it will be very, very tragic," said Festus Okoye, chairman of Transition Monitoring Group, an umbrella organization of election monitors. "The litmus test is that first election."
Certainly, Nigerians are not lacking in passion for the exercise. Nearly 61 million have qualified to vote; about 7 million more have been expunged from voter rolls, most of them for fraud, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission.
No fewer than 30 political parties are in the running -- an astonishing number compared with the 3 parties allowed in 1999, when 15 years of military rule ended.
Already, in the weeks before the elections, there have been widespread logistical snags and violence. The Electoral Commission, accused initially of doing the bidding of the governing People's Democratic Party, has been widely criticized for botching the voter registration process. Pro-democracy watchdog groups have raised concerns about whether Nigerians will believe that the elections are fair.
"I don't think they have faith, but they intend to take part anyway," said Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, a longtime democracy advocate. "If you don't take part, you may regret it."
On the eve of election day, an untold number of Nigerians, Dr. Ransome-Kuti among them, still had no idea whether they would be able to vote. Voter cards did not arrive on time in many places. And even as an ambitious electronic database of registered voters has been created to root out fraud, many Nigerians still had no idea whether their names were on the list, and if not, how they could challenge their exclusion. Domestic and international monitoring groups say the voters list was not properly displayed. The Electoral Commission has denied the charge.
As for the voter cards, the commission's secretary, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said that some had been distributed and that the rest would be available on election day. Those who had not yet obtained theirs will still be allowed to vote, he said, so long as their names are on the voter list.
With a legacy of military coups, rigged elections and communal clashes since independence from British rule in 1960, civilian-run elections are a novelty here. Indeed, such an exercise has not been tried since 1983, when the results were annulled by a military coup. In a rich instance of Nigerian political poetry, the man who led that coup, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, is among the leading candidates for president this time.
For his part, the Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, brimmed with confidence about Saturday's litmus test. "I believe that all is ready and all is right," he said in an interview this week in in the capital, Abuja, dismissing criticism as "misplaced and wrong."
Mr. Obasanjo, a retired general seeking his second term in office, described the challenge before him as twofold. The first is to prevent the "debacles," as he put it, that had plagued every other civilian-to-civilian transition of power. Second, was to banish what he regarded as a widespread superstition about elections that take place in the third year of a decade. He was referring to the coup in 1983 and the annulment, by another military ruler, of elections in 1993. "For me, it is a challenge to kill that superstition," the president said.
International analysts have not been so hopeful. Last week, a report conducted by two American groups, the Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute, the Democratic Party's international arm, warned of deficiencies that "could irreparably harm public faith in the country's democratic process." 
Likewise, a report by Human Rights Watch detailed a string of political assassinations and clashes between supporters of rival politicians, concluding that political violence "poses a serious threat to the legitimacy" of the polls. 
There was no stanching the violence this week. In Nigeria's oil-producing Delta State, where political violence had for a time driven out foreign oil companies, ethnic militias renewed their vows to wreak havoc on election day to prevent people from voting.
Also on Thursday, according to a Reuters report, two women were gunned down in the incumbent governor's convoy in Kwara State.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Investor Caution on Earnings Reports Sends Shares Down

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors took a cautious approach yesterday ahead of next week's rush of earnings reports, sending stocks lower for the third time in four sessions. Mixed economic and earnings news contributed to the caution. 
 "The market is nervous that in the near term, with earnings coming out in the next couple of weeks, it will be a bumpy ride," said Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at UBS Warburg. 
 The market's major gauges all finished lower and posted weekly losses as well. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 17.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 8,203.41. In four sessions, the Dow along with the other leading indexes has had just one gain, rising 23.39 points on Thursday. For the week, the Dow lost 0.9 percent. 
The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,358.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.28 points, or 0.4 percent, to 868.30. For the week, the Nasdaq lost 1.8 percent and the S.& P. gave up 1.2 percent. 
Investors are paying close attention to the economy and first-quarter earnings results, the bulk of which will be released during the next two weeks. Analysts say investors are less concerned about the war with Iraq now that the success of the American-led forces seems assured. 
Analysts expect the next few weeks to bring choppy trading but no steep drops as investors already anticipate that earnings will be weak. 
"There are concerns about earnings, because oil prices were high and consumer spending was generally pretty weak" in the first three months of 2003, said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for the PNC Financial Services Group in Philadelphia. "But we're braced, at this point, for a fairly soft earnings season, and it's not going to be dismal." 
The economic news yesterday was mixed, adding to the market's lackluster tone.
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 2.1 percent in March, much better than the 0.6 percent rise economists predicted and an improvement from the 1.3 percent drop in February. Much of the strength came from automobile sales, getting a lift from positive financing and other incentives.
And consumer sentiment improved more than expected recently, according to the University of Michigan's midmonth survey. The report on consumer sentiment for April showed an increase to 83.2 from 77.6 in March, well above expectations for a smaller increase, to 78.0. 
On the downside, the Labor Department reported wholesale prices jumped 1.5 percent last month because of a surge in energy costs leading up to the war. The increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures costs before they reach consumers, was much bigger than the modest 0.3 percent advance economists had forecast. 
Earnings news was also varied. 
Baker Hughes fell 59 cents, to $29.80, after warning of lower-than-anticipated profits. But Juniper Networks rose 68 cents, to $9.09, after beating first-quarter earnings estimates by a penny a share. 
Auto stocks showed some gains after the retail sales report. General Motors rose 33 cents, to $34.83. 
But some retailers fell for a second day, adding to losses from Thursday when many of them reported disappointing sales for March. Wal-Mart fell $1.60, to $52.98. 
The increases in retail sales and consumer sentiment drove bond prices lower. The 10-year Treasury note fell 9/32 , to a price of 99 6/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.98 percent from 3.95 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 8/32 , to 106 12/32 . The bond's yield rose to 4.95 percent from 4.94 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Taxes Driving Some Elderly From Their Homes 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

DATELINE: HARVARD, Mass. 

 BODY:
St. John Lane, a rural road here lined with colonial-style houses, is named after the family of Shirley St. John's husband. But soon, there will be no more St. Johns in Harvard. Mrs. St. John, 62, a widow, will move, no longer able to afford the rising property tax.
 "It's sad," Mrs. St. John said in the modest Cape Cod that she and her husband, Paul St. John, built 41 years ago as newlyweds. "Paul and I put our souls into the house." 
 The two-bedroom house in Harvard, a town of 1,200 people about 30 miles northwest of Boston, was assessed at $173,000 in 1996 and $289,000 this year, and the property tax bill grew to $3,500 from $2,200. With an income of only $12,000 a year from Social Security and a pension, Mrs. St. John needed help. Luckily for her, her town offered some: a program that allows elderly people to work $500 off each property tax bill. 
Mrs. St. John's task was entering computer data for 75 hours last fall. But this year, Mrs. St. John is giving up. She is afraid of depleting her savings, so she has decided to sell the house this year and move to Iowa, where she was born.
Soaring prices have brought greater values to homes throughout the Northeast. At the same time, states have begun to reassess property more often, so taxes are reflecting the actual value of homes. This has created large, sometimes unbearable, tax burdens for many longtime homeowners like Mrs. St. John.
Several towns in the Northeast have been looking for creative ways to make property taxes less onerous. At least three towns have adopted programs like Harvard's, allowing older people to work off part of their taxes. Some towns have increased tax exemptions for the elderly. Others have allowed older people to postpone paying part of their taxes until they sell their property.
But many other cities, facing diminishing aid from state governments, say they cannot afford such programs. State aid to towns has decreased as much as 30 percent since 2001, according to the National Association of Towns and Townships.
In better times, towns could lower tax rates when houses rose in value and still have enough revenue. In recent years, though, tax rates have remained relatively constant in many Northeastern towns while budget demands have not.
"For the older people, their homes are rising in values, but their income is not rising," said Amy Crews Cutts, an economist for Freddie Mac, a federally chartered company that is one of the main buyers on the nation's secondary mortgage market. "But you cannot eat your house."
The problem of fast-rising property taxes has been especially acute in the Northeast, one of the two hottest real estate markets in the nation, said economists who study housing. The other strong market is in California, but that state's Proposition 13 strictly limits increases in property taxes.
Nicholas P. Retsinas, the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said, "Our study finds a large number of elderly people who pay over half of their income on housing-related costs, even though they have paid off the loans on their homes." 
Those costs are mainly property taxes and maintenance. Mr. Retsinas said about two million Americans, old and young, were in this situation, but the average person was white, retired and living in the Northeast.
The average house price has risen by 76.5 percent in New England since 1995, the highest increase in the nation, according to Freddie Mac. The Pacific region, including California, Oregon and Washington, is second, with a 64.1 percent increase. The national average is 49.1 percent.
The assessed value of the house owned by Donald Dextradeur, 74, and his wife, Josephine, 76, in Branford, Conn., on Long Island Sound, jumped to $380,000 last fall from $200,000 in 1995. The property tax bill will be $5,100 this year, a 22 percent increase from 2002. The Dextradeurs, who say they receive $18,000 annually in Social Security and other retirement income, have pleaded with the town tax appeals board to freeze their property tax at the 2002 level.
"I worked hard for this house," said Mrs. Dextradeur, who was a nurse and said she sometimes worked double shifts before she retired at 67. "Now I think I should be able to enjoy the house and stay here until the end."
Officials of the Town of Harvard say the town values its elderly residents. But Harvard's budget allowed only 12 families to pay part of their taxes by working. The future does not look rosy, said Evan Katz, the town's finance director. In January, more than halfway into the fiscal year, the State Legislature cut $215,000 from its aid to Harvard, and the state is expected to reduce aid 10 percent more in the next fiscal year.
Harvard's spending, on the other hand, has grown, Mr. Katz said. The state, for instance, used to pay for special education. Now the town pays.
Older residents here are angry at the state and federal governments, which they say are too quick to spend.
"It all trickles down and falls into our laps," Jeanne Traphagan, 66, said.
Mrs. St. John has struggled to pay her tax bills by taking odd jobs, like running a flavored-ice machine by the town's pond in the summer and collecting tickets at basketball games in the winter. Moving to Iowa will be a relief financially, but it will hard emotionally.
"My husband and I put on the wallpaper," Mrs. St. John said, trying to hold back tears. She met Mr. St. John when they were in the Navy and moved East with him when they were discharged.
"We designed the cupboards; he made the coffee table; we built the whole place."
A few towns with bigger cash cushions are doing more to help the elderly. In Cumberland, R.I., a town of 30,000 near Boston, for instance, residents older than 72 are allowed to pay property taxes at the 2002 level and pay the excess when their houses change ownership.
Narragansett, R.I., where housing prices have soared because of an influx of people from New York and Boston looking for summer houses, has granted exemptions of up to $1,500 to people 65 or older with incomes less than $30,000 a year.
Some tax experts applaud the efforts to provide tax relief but warn against following California. That state's Proposition 13, passed in 1978, limits property tax increases to 2 percent until the property changes hands. Scholars say the measure has lowered California's ranking in educational spending per student. California consistently ranked in the top 10 before Proposition 13 passed. It ranked 27 in 2000, according to the Department of Education.
Options exist for the elderly who want to remain in their homes. One is a reverse mortgage. The bank pays the borrower a certain amount of money periodically, and the borrower pays the bank back when the property is sold. But many older people are reluctant to encumber their houses, said Ms. Cutts, the economist at Freddie Mac.
Mrs. Dextradeur said: "I went through the Depression as a child. I saw my parents struggle. I cannot afford more loans, and I am not going to take out a loan unless it's absolutely necessary."

HEADLINE: Cuba Executes 3 Who Tried to Reach U.S. in a Hijacking 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 11 

 BODY:
After a swift and secret trial, the Cuban authorities executed at dawn today three men who hijacked a ferry last week in a failed effort to reach the United States, a Cuban government statement said. 
 Four other men who used a gun and knives to help commandeer the boat were given life sentences, the statement said. 
 Although the death penalty has been infrequently applied in Cuba, the three faced a firing squad after having been convicted of what the statement called a "very grave acts of terrorism." 
The executions came at the end of a week in which some 78 nonviolent dissidents received prison terms ranging up to 28 years for conspiring with American diplomats against the government. 
The Cuban authorities, who said there had been seven hijackings in the last seven months, have long been critical of American policies that they say encourage illegal immigration. Human rights advocates, diplomats and American lawmakers condemned the executions as excessively harsh and questioned the motivation of the Cuban government. 
"This is excessive in the extreme and raises the question as to whether or not this is altogether rational," said Wayne S. Smith, once the top United States diplomat in Havana. "It just goes too far. There is no rational, sensible explanation."
Today's executions were believed to be the first in two years, said Curt Goering, senior deputy executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. He said in a statement that the men had "almost certainly" been denied due process.
"These executions, combined with the harsh sentences handed down last week to a number of recently arrested dissidents, is contributing to a climate of repression that hasn't existed in Cuba since the 1960's," Mr. Goering said.
The sister of Jorge Luis Martinez Isaac, one of the executed hijackers, said their mother had no idea he would face the firing squad today.
"The news they gave her today was, 'Your son is dead,' " the sister, Yordanis Montoya, said in Miami, where she lives.
"When she learned he had been shot, she raced to the cemetery," she said. "When she got there, she said, 'Down with Fidel,' and the police chased her away." 
The executions came a day after the Cuban authorities said they had foiled a hijacking attempt on the Isle of Youth. According to Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, several men who assaulted a soldier and stole his assault rifle were arrested last night near the airport. 
The hijackings have angered Cuban officials, who feel that American policy not only encourages illegal immigration but also is lenient on those who come here by force. United States officials this week repeated that American courts would prosecute anyone involved in a hijacking. 
The Cuban authorities have been indignant, however, over the release on bail of several men who hijacked a plane to Miami last month.
Some political analysts had wondered if the authorities had sought the harsh sentences to deter any further hijackings, which could scare off already jittery tourists. Caribbean tourism in general has been down since the outbreak of the Iraq war, and Cuba's economy is heavily dependent on foreign visitors.
"They are executing people who hijack a boat," Mr. Smith said. "Will that reassure Americans who think it is safe to go to Cuba?"
The Cuban authorities see the hijackings as related to a series of provocations by the Bush administration and its conservative allies in Miami, according to an official statement in Granma. There is little doubt, Cuba analysts said, that the executions will only harden the government's critics.
The death sentences also infuriated those who, like Rep. Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, had been advocating a dialogue with Cuba. "This about ends that discussion," Mr. Rangel said in a telephone interview. "I don't know how far they are going to go, but they know how to support their enemies and get rid of their friends."

HEADLINE: Workweek Woes 

BYLINE:  By John de Graaf; John de Graaf, co-author of "Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic," is national coordinator of Take Back Your Time Day.

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
Last week was the 70th anniversary of a momentous yet forgotten event in American history. On April 6, 1933, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill that would have made the standard work week 30 hours. Anything more would be overtime. 
 The bill passed by the Senate was an effort to reduce a national unemployment rate that stood at 25 percent. It had strong support from labor and religious leaders who argued that working people needed time for family, education, recreation and spirituality as much as they needed higher wages. But the bill failed in the House. The Fair Labor Standards Act, passed five years later, gave Americans a statutory 40-hour workweek. 
 Yet today, in an era when American productivity is several times what it was then, most Americans find it hard to get all their work done in 40 hours. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are without work, even as many others are working mandatory overtime or far longer than they would if they had a real choice in the matter.
According to the International Labor Organization, Americans now work 1,978 hours annually, a full 350 hours -- nine weeks -- more than Western Europeans. The average American actually worked 199 hours more in 2000 than he or she did in 1973, a period during which worker productivity per hour nearly doubled.
What happened? In effect, the United States as a society took all of its increases in labor productivity in the form of money and stuff instead of time. Of course, we didn't all get the money; the very poor earn even less in real terms than they did then, and the largest share of the increase went to the richest Americans.
The harmful effects of working more hours are being felt in many areas of society. Stress is a leading cause of heart disease and weakened immune systems. Consumption of fast foods and lack of time for exercise has led to an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Many parents complain that they do not have enough time to spend with their children, much less become involved in their community. Worker productivity declines during the latter part of long work shifts.
By contrast, over the past 30 years, Europeans have made a different choice -- to live simpler, more balanced lives and work fewer hours. The average Norwegian, for instance, works 29 percent less than the average American -- 14 weeks per year -- yet his average income is only 16 percent less. Western Europeans average five to six weeks of paid vacation a year; we average two.
Work and consumption are not necessarily bad. But producing and consuming can become the focus of a person's life -- at the expense of other values.
Americans should reflect on those values. Later this year, on Oct. 24, will be the first Take Back Your Time Day, the goal of which is to encourage Americans to lead more balanced lives. The date falls nine weeks before the end of the year, nine weeks being how much more, on average, Americans work each year than Western Europeans. Perhaps this day will help American workers realize that, in the end, there's no present like the time.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: POSTWAR FINANCING; 
Help Is Tied To Approval By the U.N.

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
Administration officials are turning to a gathering of the world's financial ministers to help pay for the rebuilding of Iraq. But they are discovering that without a stamp of approval from the United Nations, they are fighting an uphill battle.
 While the pleas for aid have been greeted positively, the administration is running into a familiar problem. Foreign institutions and foreign governments say they may need approval from the United Nations Security Council before they give or lend money to Iraq while it is under military occupation. 
 James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, said the organization was ready to help postwar Iraq but was authorized to work only with "recognized governments."
"It is very clear that we are limited in terms of the provision of funding to deal with recognized governments, and that is a decision for the United Nations to take in principle," he said.
Mr. Wolfensohn added that he would need approval from the members of the World Bank, of which the United States is the largest shareholder. Also at issue are United Nations penalties against Iraq that have yet to be lifted and could inhibit travel and work in the country.
High on the administration's agenda this weekend is winning support for debt relief for Iraq from some of the countries gathered here for the annual spring meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Some of Iraq's biggest debts are to France and Russia, the two nations that helped sink the second United Nations Security Council resolution sought by the administration before invading Iraq.
This weekend President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany are meeting in St. Petersburg with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to discuss postwar Iraq. All three leaders have called for the United Nations to assume the lead role in rebuilding Iraq.
Horst Kohler, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at a news conference on Thursday that he would not speculate on what role the United Nations might play. But he said the fund would be willing to help in Iraq, if his board approves such action. It would include a fact-finding mission, a detailed assessment of Iraq's economic situation and its financial institutions, and offers to provide technical assistance.
"All who are responsible should think how, in the most rapid manner, there is a system in place which helps the Iraqi people," Mr. Kohler said.
Although Iraq is not on the official agenda, it is the unofficial theme of the whole weekend.
John Snow, the treasury secretary, will be the administration's point man, seeking debt relief for Iraq with his colleagues from the Group of 7 (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan) as well as Russia, which is the eighth country attending the meeting.
Experts at the World Bank and the monetary fund pointed out that Iraq is anything but a poor country. With the world's second-largest oil resources, the country had been one of the Middle East's early economic successes until Saddam Hussein started using its resources to pay for an ever-growing military.
Iraqi oil could revive the economy, but only after wells and infrastructure are repaired and modernized. Several financial experts said the military powers occupying Iraq could use oil revenue to fulfill their obligation under the Geneva Conventions to help Iraq's citizens.
Already, the war has had a noticeable effect on the global economy, not only weakening growth but taking attention and resources from the effort to fight global poverty.
The World Bank's initial estimate of the war's impact on the global gross domestic product is a loss of $75 billion to $100 billion. That sum is similar to the economic aftershock felt after the Sept. 11 attacks.
The International Monetary Fund released its World Economic Outlook on Wednesday. Over all, the report said the damage from the war was largely contained. But fund officials refused to predict whether there would be a rapid rebound.
"There is no question that there has been some collateral damage to the global economy from the uncertainties surrounding the long run-up to the war in Iraq, not to mention the war itself," said Kenneth Rogoff, director of research at the fund. "The uncertainty has impacted consumer confidence, business confidence, oil prices and financial markets."
Unlike the administration, which is awarding major contracts to American firms without an assessment of Iraq, the World Bank and the monetary fund have said they would need to send teams of experts into the country before deciding how to help.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
The Catch-22 Of Iraq Contracts

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
For some of the reconstruction work in and around Iraq, the United States Army Corps of Engineers confidentially awarded a one-year contract worth up to $100 million on April 1 to the Perini Corporation, which had revenue of barely $1 billion last year. The agency released a brief statement about the award on April 4, but Perini did not receive clearance to issue its own statement about the significant chunk of business until April 8. By then, its stock had climbed more than 40 percent.
 The incident reflects a troubling situation for all the publicly traded companies trying to win a share in the Iraqi reconstruction effort. In the post-Enron environment, regulators are pressing companies to comply scrupulously with laws requiring them to be forthcoming with investors about significant business developments. The contracts, though, have been handled with such secrecy that many executives say they are wary of talking about their company's role for fear of alienating the agencies and thus losing out on the most ambitious reconstruction effort since the Marshall Plan in Europe after World War II. 
 Perini's sharp stock movement provides the most vivid example, but other companies have had their stocks buffeted by speculation on the contracts as well. 
In February, the United States Agency for International Development privately asked a handful of companies to bid on a much larger contract for Iraq, worth at least $600 million. By Feb. 24, news of the bid request had leaked out, and the Kellogg Brown & Root unit of Halliburton was widely identified as a contender. Not until March 31, when its shares slipped after Newsweek reported that it had lost the bid, did Halliburton disclose that it had never been a bidder for the contract but remained a "potential subcontractor."
The Washington Group International did promptly confirm that it was a bidder on that contract, which had helped bolster its share price, but it later concluded that it was out of the running. Anxious about keeping the market informed but wary of upsetting the agency, one official said he spent hours trying to reach someone at the agency who could confirm that his company was no longer in contention. By the time he got his answer, he said, the information had already begun to appear in news reports, attributed to unnamed sources.
The tension between demands for disclosure in the marketplace and expectations of secrecy in the bidding process is "a dangerous game," said Michael J. Herschman, a co-founder of Transparency International, a nonprofit group that promotes business and government accountability. 
"You can't speak out of both sides of your mouth -- it's a double standard, and it's unacceptable," added Mr. Herschman, the president of Decision Strategies, a corporate integrity consulting firm owned by the SPX Corporation, and a former deputy auditor general for the Agency for International Development.
Robert Bond, president of Perini, said his company was required to submit its press release to the Corps of Engineers for review before it was issued. According to the agency, the statement was submitted in late afternoon on Monday, the 7th, and approved the following day.
Halliburton generally does not comment on government contracts, according to Wendy Hall, a company spokeswoman. It did so in this case "to clarify inaccurate media reports," specifically the Newsweek report attributing the information about Halliburton to Timothy Beans, an A.I.D. official. She had not addressed the inaccuracies earlier, she said, because "we rarely comment on the process until it is complete."
Ellen Yount, director of the agency's press office, said her agency was barred by federal acquisition rules from commenting about bidding procedures while they were under way, which made it difficult to respond to the Washington Group's query.
The agency's rules do not prohibit companies from "making their own public statements," she added, though companies may feel constrained by unwritten rules and traditions. "The Iraq contracts have been a very charged process, and we're already looking at what worked and what didn't, asking what we could have done better."
Contracts from the Corps of Engineers require press releases to be submitted 45 days in advance -- a requirement that is impractical and one that is frequently waived, the agency says. "We only look at the press releases for factual accuracy about the contract," said Joan Kibler, a public affairs officer for the agency. "But we are definitely going to take a look at how we handle this. It's not a questionthat has been raised before."
Lawmakers have also begun to question whether the secrecy about the Iraqi contracts is justified by the need for speed and the pressures of war, as the agencies say. On Thursday, a bill with bipartisan backing was introduced in the Senate calling for greater competition and less secrecy on the bids, and two Democrats in the House of Representatives have asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether the bidding has been properly handled and whether Halliburton has received any special treatment because of its ties to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chief executive there from 1995 until 2000.
Steven L. Schooner, who directs the Government Procurement Law Center at the George Washington University Law School, is among the legal experts who believe that the bidding should be more open. "It is very difficult to make the case that these contracts needed to be treated as classified," Professor Schooner said. "The government has made this far more difficult than it needed to be by choosing to act in secret."
Publicly traded companies are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to make full, timely disclosure of important developments and to ensure that information is not provided selectively to some investors and not to others. These obligations have been codified in the S.E.C.'s Regulation FD and reinforced by the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation adopted last summer after the corporate scandals that have cost investors billions of dollars and left more than a dozen corporate executives facing prosecution.
But in Washington, the kind of selective disclosure banned on Wall Street is simply called "leaking," and it is as common as paper clips.
"I don't think the aid agency people are aware that what they see as the usual bureaucratic process can pose extraordinary difficulties for public companies," said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor and frequent S.E.C. adviser. 
"There is no secret that is known to 30 bureaucrats," Professor Coffee added. "As soon as it's known that broadly, nothing is more foreseeable than that this information will leak and affect the market. And you leave the company hamstrung, with this information reaching the market and them not allowed to disclose anything about it."
The Iraqi contracts have been a case in point. As news reports proliferated, several public companies cited as potential bidders -- the Washington Group and Fluor, for example -- immediately confirmed that they had submitted bids, but said that they felt constrained from saying more. Some seemed to believe that the agency required silence; all clearly indicated that they believed silence was expected of them.
Normally, such silence is safe, securities lawyers say. A company is typically better off saying nothing than saying something misleading or incomplete, Professor Coffee said. "But when, as now, there is so much demand for information from investors and analysts that it may tempt you to leak it out," he added.
Roger J. Magnuson, a corporate law specialist at Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis, said the problem "is not just that the government can be leaky, but also that it can be very slow."
"It's one thing if we're talking about holding back for 48 or 72 hours," Mr. Magnuson added. "But when weeks go by, as they have here, you have real problems." 
The aid contract, by far the juiciest plum to come up for bid so far, was originally expected to be announced by mid-March. But target dates have slipped repeatedly.
Such delays, in an environment of such intense speculation and market volatility, "can create this terribly attractive nuisance for insiders, who may trade on this information," Mr. Magnuson said. He added, "The people at these agencies, in their myopia, could miss the subtleties of these disclosure obligations and fail to appreciate -- like Mr. Magoo -- the difficulties they are creating for others." 
Corporate officers should be forceful with agencies if they forsee that such rumors could affect their stock prices, Mr. Herschman said. 
"When they find themselves in these situations, they're just going to have to push back, to say, 'Whatever your policy is, our policy is that this information should get to the public as quickly as possible,' " he said. "And if the agency is going to go to someone else because I demanded transparency, well, then I'm really going to raise a ruckus."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: RELIEF; 
Aid Groups Urging Military to Protect Essential Services

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, April 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's plan to pour large amounts of food and medical supplies into Iraq quickly appeared in danger of breaking down today as aid agencies took the unusual step of appealing to the military for help.
 In an urgent appeal from its Geneva headquarters, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on American troops to protect hospitals and water supplies in Baghdad. The agency, which usually refrains from asking for military assistance, said that to comply with the obligations of an occupying power the United States must direct its military to stop the looting of essential public utilities. 
 The medical system in the capital had "virtually collapsed," the committee said in its statement. Of the 40 hospitals in the city, 39 had been looted or closed. 
The Red Cross, the only international relief organization functioning in Baghdad this week, said its aid workers were able to venture outside their offices for only a limited time today.
Workers from other experienced aid organizations were not prepared to cross into Iraq because the situation there was considered so dangerous.
In neighboring Kuwait and Jordan, nearly 50 specialists assembled by the United States Agency for International Development to help with emergency aid were left stranded with little to do. In a hotel lobby here, some of the specialists who have been waiting to go into Iraq for several weeks watched with embarrassment as images of the deteriorating hospital conditions in Baghdad flickered on television screens.
Medical supplies and food that were supposed to go into Iraq immediately after the military made its way to Baghdad remain stacked in warehouses in both Kuwait and Jordan. Fleets of trucks to transport the supplies stood idle. 
The man designated by the United State to run Iraq temporarily, Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, who is retired, set foot in the country for the first time today on his new assignment, but went only as far as Umm Qasr. It was not safe for him to go further north to Basra, the second-biggest city in Iraq, his aides said.
The poor security was summarized at a briefing of the Humanitarian Operations Center in Kuwait, where the American military works with nongovernmental organizations to coordinate their efforts in Iraq.
On Thursday, the military gave three categories of security in Iraq: permissive, uncertain and hostile. Only a small southern sector of the map as far as the town of Zubayr, on the outskirts of Basra, was marked as safe enough for aid workers. The situation remained unchanged today, officials said.
Much of the immediate assistance planned by USAID for Iraq is to be delivered by major American nongovernmental organizations such as CARE, the International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps and Save the Children. But security was so poor that none of the agencies was operating in Iraq outside of Umm Qasr, the town just over the border from Kuwait, a senior USAID official said.
In another sign of conditions in Iraq, USAID said a World Health Organization stock of medical supplies for treating 10,000 people for three months was stolen soon after the American military unit left it at a hospital in a city on the way to Baghdad.
"We are not giving any more kits to the military just so they can be looted," the official said. About 100 more similar sets of supplies had been prepared for Iraq in neighboring countries but were currently being held back, the official said.
In a press briefing today, spokesman Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said that he had been told by the head of USAID, Andrew S.Natsios, that there was not a widespread aid crisis in Iraq. There were "pockets" of problems, Mr. Fleischer added. But, he said, President Bush viewed the aid effort as a "key part of the mission."
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld gave a less grim picture of the situation in Baghdad at a Pentagon press briefing today. "There is no question but there is a hospital that was looted," he said, adding that the Baath Party put its headquarters in hospitals all over the country.
He said the American military was working to stop the looting, which he called the "untidy" outcome of people feeling the first taste of freedom.
Peter Bell of the American aid agency Care, which receives funds from the United States government for its work in Iraq, joined the ICRC in appealing to the American military to protect the hospitals. A senior worker for the agency visited Baghdad this week, but only for a security assessment, he said.
Meeting in St. Petersburg today, the leaders of Russia, Germany and France noted that the Geneva Convention binds American and British forces to protect Iraqi civilians and ensure their humane treatment until order is restored.
Administration officials have said frequently that they had wanted to quickly demonstrate their good faith by assisting the Iraqi people in the immediate aftermath of the war. These officials knew, they said, that in most circumstances aid deliveries had more to do with winning the support of a suspicious population than alleviating a chronic need.
But with the uncertain security situation in Baghdad, there was concern that it would be hard to harness the support of the people there. "I think they are going to find it hard to put the cap back," said Kenneth Bacon, the president of Refugees International.
Mr. Bacon said the Bush administration had little choice but to instruct the military to create some kind of order. In particular, he said, the military should create zones of security around hospitals and water points.
The top official of the Red Cross in Baghdad, Roland Huguenin-Benjamin, called the situation there "anarchy."
At the 650-bed Medical City, Red Cross workers found few people. "Operating theaters are no longer functioning. There are no more instruments, in any case," a spokeswoman, Nada Doumani, said. Most staff members had stayed at home to protect their own property from looters. 
Al Kindi Hospital was attacked by armed looters on Thursday and stripped of everything from beds to medical equipment to drugs, Red Cross officials said. Today, the hospital was empty, Ms. Doumani said.
In Basra, the International Committee for the Red Cross said it had appealed to the British to impose a curfew as a way of halting looting.
The agency, which has been in Iraq during the past decade, was able to help British soldiers in Basra to find civil servants, many of whom were in hiding, so that they could resume essential services, Mr. Kuhn said. "We linked the British with the remaining water engineers; we knew the water engineers, they didn't," he said.
Similarly, the Red Cross found electrical, sewage and medical personnel and urged them to return to their stations. "We're tying to find some police," Mr. Kuhn said.
At the Humanitarian Operations Center, a spokesman said more than 100 aid missions had been dispatched into Iraq since the center was set up. But the spokesman, Maj. Chris Hughes, said that most of the missions were to assess security and that most of the aid that had been sent over the border was provided by Kuwait.

Cathay Pacific and Singapore Air Cut Back on Asian Service Because of Deadly Virus

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 12 

 BODY:
Two of Asia's biggest air carriers, Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines, announced deep cutbacks in service today because passengers have been scared off by the emergence of a virulent respiratory disease in the region.
 Cathay Pacific, the main carrier based here, said that it would operate 37 percent fewer flights than it had previously planned. Singapore Airlines said it would cut 19.7 percent of its flights. Both airlines said their reductions in service would last through the end of May; in each case the figures include the more modest reductions in service announced in the last two weeks. 
 Cathay Pacific's board also issued a strongly worded warning today that its financial results for the first half of 2003 would be materially affected by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and by the war in Iraq. The company cited a "sudden and unexpected collapse in passenger demand," but said that its cargo business was still strong. 
David Turnbull, Cathay Pacific's chief executive and deputy chairman, told employees this week that the combination of war and disease "has annihilated our passenger bookings." He added, "Cathay Pacific has now entered its most dangerous time in terms of its commercial future in the 26 years I have been involved with the company." 
Neither carrier announced large-scale layoffs today. Singapore Airlines said it was dismissing 206 trainees who were preparing to become pilots but had not begun flight training. Cathay Pacific said it was urging its staff to volunteer for unpaid vacations if at all possible. 
Rosita Ng, a Cathay Pacific spokeswoman, said the company was examining staffing daily to see how it matched customer demand. 
Airlines in southeastern Asia have not responded to the steep plunge in demand here with fare discounts. Enzio von Pfeil, chief executive of Commercial Economics Asia, a Hong Kong consulting firm, said that canceling flights was their only option, because the problem was a lack of public confidence in flying, regardless of fares. 
"It has been quite clear they're not going to cut the prices," Mr. von Pfeil said. " So they're going to cut the costs instead." 
Until a few weeks ago, Cathay Pacific had been one of the industry's few recent financial success stories. On March 5, it announced that its profits had risen sixfold in 2002, to $510 million, as Asia's booming economies generated plenty of passenger and cargo traffic while the airline steadily reduced costs, including driving a hard bargain with its pilots on pay. 
But that was before consumer fears, corporate bans on travel in the region and, most recently, government travel restrictions shredded demand. Cathay Pacific canceled all its flights to and from Malaysia on Thursday, after officials there barred almost all holders of Hong Kong and Chinese passports from entering the country indefinitely because of SARS fears. 
Singapore moved to limit entry by foreign workers from SARS-affected areas this week, and nurses are at the airports screening arriving passengers. Cathay Pacific cut back heavily today on its roster of flights between Hong Kong and Singapore. Singapore Airlines did the same, and halted all service to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in mainland China, where the virus was first observed by doctors over the winter. 
Singapore Airlines also canceled service to San Francisco by way of Hong Kong, where by far the most SARS cases have been found; flights will be added to San Francisco by way of South Korea instead. 
The cutbacks in service are particularly a blow to Hong Kong, which owes its existence to a considerable extent to its role as a transportation hub. Shanghai and Inchon, South Korea, were already positioning themselves as alternative air hubs to rival Hong Kong before SARS hit the scene. 
Hong Kong's pre-eminence as an air cargo center is also indirectly threatened by the cutbacks, because the majority of air shipments move in the holds of passenger aircraft. 
Air travel to China is withering. DragonAir, an affiliate of Cathay Pacific that flies between Hong Kong and the mainland, scrapped nearly half its flights earlier this week. The State Department renewed its warning to Americans today against traveling in China because of SARS. 
Another blow to the air passenger market here came on Thursday night, when the Hong Kong Department of Health asked everyone who had flown on seven Lufthansa flights from March 30 to April 5 to seek immediate medical advice, because a SARS-infected man from Hong Kong was aboard.

HEADLINE: Advocates of Arctic Drilling Buoyed as House Passes Bill 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
The House passed a broad energy measure today, and advocates of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge said it would open the way to negotiations with a reluctant Senate over allowing new energy exploration in Alaska.
 Celebrating the adoption of a bill that aggressively promotes new domestic energy production through tax breaks for industry and other incentives, House authors of the plan say they intend to propose "innovative" ways to begin drilling in the refuge in an effort to lure senators who narrowly rejected the idea last month. Before approving the measure, House members on Thursday defeated an effort to strip the drilling authority from the bill. 
 "We may find the right formula," said Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Energy Committee, expressing hope for completing action on a final bill this summer. "We just might convince people." 
President Bush, who began the push for a new energy policy two years ago, praised the House action as a "major step forward in the effort to secure our nation's energy future" and called for prompt Senate action. The White House did indicate some concern about the size of the $18.7 billion tax incentive package.
Forty Democrats joined majority Republicans in passing the energy package that critics said was tilted too heavily toward energy production and overly generous with taxpayer subsidies to oil and gas companies. The final vote was 247 to 175, with 157 Democrats, 17 Republicans and one independent opposing it.
Several efforts to alter the measure -- including a proposed 5 percent increase in automotive fuel efficiency, tighter electricity regulation and a proposal to drop many of the gas and oil company incentives -- were rejected.
"The legislation repeals important electricity regulations and does virtually nothing to minimize oil consumption while offering billions in handouts and tax breaks for some of the wealthiest and most-polluting companies in the world," said Joan Claybrook, president of the Public Citizen advocacy group.
Representatives of various power industries praised the bill. "We applaud the House leadership for crafting solutions that will protect and build America's energy and economic infrastructure," said Diemer True, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
Authors of the measure portrayed the bill as a needed economic stimulus and said it was balanced between production and conservation with incentives for alternative power sources and fuel-efficient appliances. Mr. Tauzin said the reductions in power demand resulting from the bill would negate the need for 130 new power plants.
"America's energy future is brighter because of this bill," said Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, chairman of an energy subcommittee that was instrumental in drafting the bill he called the most comprehensive energy proposal adopted by the House in 50 years.
He and others said that crafting of gas mileage standards was a job best left to transportation professionals and that the measure took a major step toward cutting gasoline consumption by providing $1.7 billion for the administration's hydrogen fuels initiative, including development of a hydrogen-powered car.
Appearing with House leaders after the vote, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the administration wanted to have such a vehicle ready for the mass market by 2020. "We are going to have the ability to dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil at the same time that we dramatically reduce our emissions into the environment," he said.
The Senate is now developing its energy plan in committee, with the idea of bringing it to the floor next month. The Arctic oil drilling plan looms as a major sticking point since it is intensely opposed by many conservation groups and moderate Senate Republicans have said they will not support it. 
Last month's vote in the Senate against including the drilling proposal in the budget was 52 to 48 and drilling opponents hailed the fact that it was eliminated from the final budget adopted by Congress today. Mr. Tauzin indicated he would press the refuge issue.
"An ANWR stand-alone vote is one thing," he said, referring to the Senate budget provision. "ANWR as part of a major energy advance for the country and packaged differently with new environmental protections may be a different vote."

HEADLINE: Senate Vote Could Sharply Reduce Bush Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
With Vice President Dick Cheney casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, Congress approved a $2.2 trillion budget plan today that would make room for a tax cut this year but possibly limit it to less than half the size President Bush proposed.
 The turning point -- one of the rare occasions when the outcome of important legislation turned on a single speech -- came when Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee and a politician with a reputation for keeping his word, promised on the Senate floor that he would not permit, under any circumstances, a law this year that would reduce taxes by more than $350 billion over 10 years. 
 That pledge won the votes of two recalcitrant Republicans who had promised in writing to oppose any tax cut of more than $350 billion. The switch produced the 50-to-50 tie, allowing Mr. Cheney to break it. 
President Bush has sought tax reductions totaling $726 billion. Shortly before 3 this morning, the House voted, 216 to 211, to approve a budget blueprint that would permit a tax cut of $550 billion -- an amount, White House officials said, that would allow Mr. Bush to accomplish most of his program and claim a political victory. Today's vote means that Mr. Bush is in position to win approval from a closely divided Congress of the second major tax cut of his administration, this one occurring during a time of looming budget deficits.
A $350 billion tax cut, the largest the Senate would agree to, would probably preclude a central element of Mr. Bush's plan: the elimination of income taxes on most stock dividends.
After the Senate vote, the White House issued a statement in Mr. Bush's name that said, "I look forward to working with the full Congress to provide the tax relief necessary to grow our economy and create jobs."
Because of the president's popularity in the glow of his triumph in Iraq -- and some parliamentary sleight of hand Republican Congressional leaders performed overnight -- the House position at first seemed likely to be the dominant one when actual tax legislation is considered by Congress later in the year. 
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, complained after the House vote that the deal Republican leaders had made -- a $550 billion tax cut limit in the House, a $350 billion limit in the Senate but $550 billion when a final version of tax legislation is prepared by a House-Senate conference committee -- was "a recipe for getting rolled."
But four Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, stood fast against Mr. Bush and were prepared to vote against the deal their leaders struck. 
In the House early this morning, 216 Republicans voted for the budget plan, while 7 Republicans, 203 Democrats and 1 independent opposed it. 
The budget plan, called a budget resolution, merely sets limits on spending and revenue but does not deal with specifics and does not carry the force of law. It does, however, establish the maximum amount of tax cuts that will be protected from filibuster when tax legislation is before the Senate.
Because almost all Democrats oppose any tax cut at all, the Republican defections would have caused the entire budget resolution to be defeated, and that would probably have meant no tax cut whatsoever.
Mr. Grassley, the most influential senator on tax matters, turned matters around in midafternoon. In a dramatic speech, he told the Senate that he personally supported the president's position, a $726 billion tax cut, but that his pledge to hold the tax cut to $350 billion was the only way to win a majority for a budget plan.
"This isn't about the president," Mr. Grassley proclaimed. "It isn't about the House. It isn't about the Senate. It's about doing our job. It's about doing the people's business."
After Mr. Grassley's speech, Mr. Voinovich walked across the Senate floor, shook Mr. Grassley's hand and then, grinning broadly, threw his arm around his shoulder.
Ms. Snowe said: "I trust the word of chairman Grassley today. I happen to believe in the power of a senator's word and believe that Washington would be a better place if we could have more leaders like Senator Grassley, whose word is his bond."
About two hours after the speech, the Senate cast its 50-to-50 vote for the budget resolution, with Mr. Voinovich and Ms. Snowe in favor.
Senator Zell Miller of Georgia was the only Democrat voting for it. Mr. McCain and Mr. Chafee were the only Republicans voting against it.
Republican leaders in the House were blindsided by the development in the Senate and were seething. 
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader, said he had "blood coming from my tongue, having bitten it several times over the last couple of hours."
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, said: "The secret agreement that was supposedly reached by Senator Grassley and Senator Snowe violates the spirit of this budget compromise. With all due respect to Senator Grassley, he is ultimately irrelevant because our agreement was made with the Senate leadership, and they have the power to keep it."
The Republican leaders in the House cannot be counted out from pursuing a larger tax cut. They enforce strict discipline in their ranks, and could well come up with a maneuver as the year wears on to outflank Mr. Grassley and the Senate. They certainly will not relent to the smaller tax cut favored in the Senate without a fierce fight.
But at least as of tonight, the intractability of the Republican defectors in the Senate and Mr. Grassley's formidable reputation for straight-talking seemed to mean that Mr. Bush and Republican leaders in Congress have an uphill fight if they hope to get a tax reduction larger than $350 billion.
Mr. Grassley opened his speech by borrowing from a famous address by one of his political heroes, Senator Barry Goldwater. "Let me remind you," Mr. Grassley declared, "that tax policy at the expense of no budget resolution is a vice. Moderation in tax policy in pursuit of a budget resolution is a virtue."
The budget plan shows a deficit of $385 billion in the fiscal year 2004, which begins Oct. 1, the largest deficit ever in dollar terms. It projects the deficit to decline annually until the budget is balanced in 2012.
Fiscal experts agree that these calculations are unrealistic. The resolution includes no money for keeping troops in Iraq after Sept. 30 and no money for postwar reconstruction. It also envisions spending limits lower than Mr. Bush proposed, so low in fact that they would not cover the same level of services the government is providing this year.
The plan also shows military budgets after 2008 that are clearly much lower than the president or the Defense Department sees as adequate.
But spending limits in Congressional budget plans are written to be changed as the years go by.
Republicans held that the budget blueprint was the right medicine for an ailing economy.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, chairman of the Budget Committee, said the resolution "encourages growing the economy,""will help us win the war on terrorism," would finance domestic security and prescription drug coverage under Medicare and "maintains spending discipline."
Democrats said it was irresponsible to allow a tax cut at a time of rising deficits, unknown obligations abroad and the impending retirement of the boomer generation.
"It is radical, reckless, dangerous and extreme," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the budget committee.

To the Editor:
 Media accounts offering the jubilation of Iraqis as proof of the correctness of America's invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein hold up the wrong piece of evidence to convince those who opposed the war. 
 No one in the antiwar movement believed that Saddam Hussein was anything but despotic. 
The proof that we need to see includes these steps: restoration of civil order by Iraqis; distribution of relief aid; acknowledgment of the human suffering that military intervention caused; and an assurance that revenues from oil production will go to the Iraqi people. 
These steps would also include an end to rhetoric that vaunts American will and might; cooperation between the State and Defense Departments over reconstruction policy in Iraq; attention turned to the national economic and civil liberties fallout from post-Sept. 11 policies; international cooperation and respectful relations with the United Nations; and investment in genuine homeland security.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: PAYING FOR THE WAR; 
Conferees Bargain Over $80 Billion Plan to Finance War and Its Aftermath

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators neared completion tonight of an $80 billion bill to pay for the war in Iraq, giving President Bush much of the flexibility he sought in rebuilding that nation. The bill also offers extra unemployment insurance for workers in the airline industry.
 Leaders of the two chambers were unable to resolve a disagreement over a number of special items demanded by the Senate, but in late-night talks, the Senate dropped many of its requests, officials said. The House and the Senate planned final approval on the war bill on Saturday, seeking to send it to the president before legislators leave for a two-week recess. 
 The measure includes $2.9 billion to assist airlines that have suffered since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the onset of war. But lawmakers from states with concentrations of airline workers said the government needed to consider the tens of thousands of employees who have lost their jobs in the slowdown. The committee voted to extend unemployment insurance to such workers by 26 weeks, hoping that Mr. Bush, who has said the assistance is excessive, will not veto it because it is part of the war bill. The benefits, which will go to about 200,000 workers, would cost roughly $275 million.
There was little discord in the joint conference committee over the $63 billion that will pay for the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and related military needs. Members of the two parties in the House and Senate agreed that the White House had requested fartoo much flexibility in spending most of that money, and cut the amount the Pentagon can spend on its own from $60 billion to $15.7 billion. They also voted to require the Pentagon to notify Congress within five days once it decides how to spend the money.
Republicans on the committee were reluctant to impose the notification requirement, but yielded to Democratic arguments that doing otherwise would abrogate their constitutional responsibility to oversee federal spending.
But members unanimously agreed to allow the administration wide latitude in determining which federal agencies spend $2.47 billion for relief and reconstruction in Iraq. Last week, the Senate approved language prohibiting the Department of Defense from using the money, reflecting concerns that the Pentagon did not have enough experience in distributing food and rebuilding a national economy.
That language was strongly opposed by the Bush administration, which lobbied House and Senate members for the ability to distribute the money as it saw fit. Administration officials argued that the military could not be cut out of the rebuilding as long as security in Iraq remained shaky, and members of each chamber agreed to include the Defense Department in the five agencies that could administer the money.
The conference overrode the administration's objections and insisted that the money be spent according to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which allows Congress full oversight into how the reconstruction is conducted. 
The comity on the conference committee quickly evaporated, however, whenever the subject turned to the pet projects inserted in the bill by members of the Senate. When Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, argued in favor of spending $3.3 million to repair a dam near his house in Waterbury, House members said they had kept such projects out of their bill, and expected senators to do the same.

HEADLINE: Divided Economic Advice and the Lure of Politics 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Wall Street has almost always greeted suggestions of broad new tax cuts with happy cries. Yet at two recent meetings to discuss its tax cut proposals, the White House left out the chief economists from about half the nation's top financial firms.
 What happened? 
 This time around, support for the proposed tax cuts is far from universal on Wall Street. Growing deficits and the war in Iraq have made some economists uncertain about the economy's need for long-term policy changes and about the government's ability to foot the bill. And the White House, according to some economists, is not exactly seeking out dissenting views. 
"I think they only call people who agree with them," said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist of Morgan Stanley, who opposes cutting dividend taxes now and was not invited to the meetings. "These meetings are not forums for debate. These meetings are a highly politicized effort for the White House to get people on their side." 
President Bush's current budget, which asks for $726 billion in tax cuts and would begin to transform the tax code, has left Wall Street's foremost economic experts divided. Though the experts can agree on some important assumptions of the White House proposals -- for example, that ending taxes on some dividends will help investors to allot financial capital more efficiently -- other aspects have taken them into well-worn debates about how the economy behaves.
It was not always so. The huge tax changes of 1986 achieved almost unanimously favorable reviews, and the tax cuts of 2001 struck many forecasters as well timed and affordable. 
Most of the economists' differences on the current proposals depend on theory and evidence, but some suggest that political views have also come into play -- a potential worry for clients who pay for the economists' advice.
The White House held two meetings for economists and market strategists, on Jan. 21 and April 2. The chief economists of J. P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Bear Stearns attended. The chief economists of Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup were not invited.
Some lukewarm assessments of the Bush administration's proposals among the second group may have had something to do with the slight. 
"Dividend tax reform is a wonderful thing that I really support 100 percent as a means to improve the efficiency of capital allocation," Mr. Roach said. "I am for it, but we just can't afford it."
Mr. Roach said he would prefer an economic stimulus for the short term to a long-term plan that implied years of deficits. He said he was not surprised that the White House had not called, and he added that he might not have attended, anyway. "I do not think it's appropriate for someone in my position to be politicized," he said.
Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said the meetings had been intended to include a variety of people from Wall Street and academia. She added, "I can't say why any single individual wouldn't be included."
Ethan S. Harris could, however. "The Bush administration has counseled with economists at various times," said Mr. Harris, the chief economist of Lehman Brothers. "Basically 90 percent of the people are kind of preaching to the choir, and maybe they have one or two middle-of-the-road people. They really don't seem to want to hear opposing views."
Indeed, the White House might not have been looking for basic advice. "The administration had already made its proposals, so this was not a brainstorming session in which the administration was looking for ideas with which to formulate a package," said John Lipsky, chief economist of J. P. Morgan Chase, who attended the Jan. 21 meeting. "It was more to explain what they had done and why, and to give us a chance to ask questions."
In the past, presidents' meetings with outside economists have rarely been highly publicized or especially large; most conferences have been private and with a select group of frequent advisers. The closest predecessor to Mr. Bush's sessions was in September 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford invited 28 economists to share ideas about the economy. But that group was diverse, containing conservatives and liberals of note.
More recently, in April 1989, the first President Bush met with about 10 outside economists and executives at Camp David. The group included three former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, all of whom had served under Republican presidents. Also attending were M. Kathryn Eickhoff, who had run economic policy in President Ronald Reagan's budget office, and Arthur B. Laffer, who advocated tax cuts that supposedly paid for themselves. In addition, Jude Wanniski, a private economist, and Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the United States Chamber of Commerce, were present. At the time, both were known as adherents of supply-side philosophy.
Ms. Buchan agreed that none of the 28 experts invited to the White House this year had emerged saying, for example, that the plan to end taxes on some dividends was a bad idea. When asked if she attributed that uniform lack of criticism to luck or coincidence, she laughed and said, "It's just good policy."
Yet several well-known economists from Wall Street -- even those who supported previous tax cuts by Republican administrations -- have publicly disagreed with the Bush administration's proposals.
"In the past, there have been tax cuts that Wall Street was very much behind," said William C. Dudley, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, who is a Democrat. "I thought the tax reform of 1986 was great." Along with the fall of communism, Mr. Dudley said, "it was the single greatest achievement of the Reagan administration."
Mr. Dudley says he also likes some of the Bush administration's current plan. "If you think the economy's very weak, as we do, you'd be inclined to think it needs fiscal stimulus," he said. "There's not much dispute about the acceleration of the 2001 tax cuts. Accelerating them does provide quite a bit of fiscal stimulus, and it's not too expensive."
But Mr. Dudley expressed misgivings about the need to cut taxes on dividends now. To begin with, he said, it is unclear how much the cut would help the stock market. He said it was also unclear whether any increased wealth would end up in the hands of those inclined to spend it. And, finally, he said, the tax cuts would surely raise interest rates by deepening the government's deficits.
Peter Hooper, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, also noticed a difference. "Everyone could agree on the first tax cut," Mr. Hooper said. "You even had the Fed chairman out there supporting it, because we were looking at a very different picture for the fiscal prospects. We were looking at widening surpluses, and the possibility of running out of government debt. Now the picture looks very different."
With higher deficits, some experts have argued, the government must borrow more money that could otherwise stay in the private sector. The government's demand for financing would drive up interest rates, hampering spending by consumers and businesses.
"The supporters of the Bush programs, and supply-siders in general, would believe that those effects are small, and it's nothing to worry about," Mr. Harris said. "I think the bulk of economists believe that it's a serious issue."
"There's very good evidence that deficits do push up long-term interest rates," he continued. "They don't do it immediately. It's not apparent now, because it's such a feeble economy."
Naysayers have contended that there is no link between deficits and interest rates. They point to the fact that long-term rates have remained at historical lows in the last two years, even as the government's fiscal balance for 2001 to 2010 has swung from $5.6 trillion in the black to $482 billion in the red.
But Mr. Harris took issue: "That's a silly argument, frankly, though you do see it. I've seen it on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal, people making that argument."
He added: "The biggest drivers of interest rates are inflation, and recession or recovery. But deficits come in third place on the list."
Mr. Dudley concurred. "I think everybody sort of agrees that there is an effect," he said. "What we're arguing about is magnitude."
Well, not quite everybody.
"I've been stunned at the confusion on Wall Street about the huge value of this tax cut," said David Malpass, chief economist of Bear Stearns, who attended the White House conference on Jan. 21. "The mystery to me is why this theory of a connection between interest rates and the budget deficit persists."
Mr. Malpass estimated that the tax cut for dividends would add up to $2 trillion to stock market wealth. Compared with that, he said, "the interest rate effects of $30 billion per year are immaterial," citing the approximate cost of the tax cut. 
Others have contended that the cuts would, in fact, stimulate the economy in the short term.
One could argue, Mr. Lipsky said, that in addition to their long-run benefits to the efficiency of capital markets, the cuts "will in the short run tend to boost stock values, which will boost household confidence and business confidence."
Mr. Lipsky also said the idea of temporary tax cuts, supported by some economists as an alternative to the president's plan, was a dead end.
"Folks who learned their economics in the 1960's probably thought or learned that countercyclical measures should be temporary in nature," he said. "Those who experienced the stagflation of the 1970's, and the apparent failure of the temporary measures to produce the expected result, have come to believe the opposite."
That view, however, did not completely describe the crew at the White House in January.
"I actually think that some temporary tax cuts would have beneficial effects," said Richard B. Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, who attended the meeting on Jan. 21 and might fit the middle-of-the-road role Mr. Harris suggested.
Mr. Berner, who said he had long supported eliminating taxes on dividends but not necessarily the rest of the president's package, suggested a temporary cut in payroll taxes as an economic stimulus. "You're going to get more bang for the buck with tax cuts aimed at people who are more likely to spend them," he said. 
Mr. Lipsky said he thought those who oppose making the cuts now were mixing political leanings with their economic analysis.
"Surely, you could make a case that says, 'Good idea, but not the highest priority,' " he said. "That part purely is political. How are you going to set those priorities?"
He added that the question of whether the government can afford the cuts "bridges the political and the technical." When considering what the government can afford, he said, spending measures must be considered as well, and doing so "veers you squarely into the politics."
Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said some degree of politicization was inevitable. "We are all only human," Mr. Soss said. "One of the tricks of this trade is to be aware of your prejudices and to reveal them, so that your audience can be aware of that filter. These are analytical prejudices as well as political."
Such prejudices exist, he said, because so many questions in economics do not have exact answers. For example, he added, no one really knows whether private saving will always replace saving drawn down by the government. "This is an open question, and it influences all sorts of judgments one might make about the efficacy of fiscal policy," he said. "I happen to be a big believer in fiscal policy, but 'believer' is a key word there."

 THE FUTURE
OF FREEDOM
Illiberal Democracy
at Home and Abroad.
By Fareed Zakaria.
286 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
 "IT is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is going on among us," the great French liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville declared in "Democracy in America," published in 1835. It was, he continued, an "irresistible revolution, which has advanced for centuries in spite of every obstacle and which is still advancing in the midst of the ruins it has caused." Tocqueville had visited the United States, seen the future and decided that it worked. Today he stands vindicated. Something like 62 percent of the world's countries are now democracies.
To be sure, Tocqueville was not blind to the defects and potential hazards of American democracy. Political parties were "an inherent evil of free governments." The press was prone to gratuitous muckraking. The electorate tended to vote mediocrities into high office. Above all, there was the danger of the "tyranny of the majority." But that risk, he believed, was held in check by the vitality of some distinctively American institutions that tended to preserve individual freedom: the decentralization of government, the power of the courts, the strength of associational life and the vigor of the country's churches. 
The big question was whether similar safeguards would operate in Europe when democracy made its inevitable advance there. By the time he published "The Old Regime and the Revolution" in 1856, Tocqueville had grown deeply pessimistic. In France, despite several attempts, it had proved impossible to introduce democracy without an intolerable diminution of freedom. The aristocracy and the church -- against which the revolutionaries of 1789 had directed their energies -- had, he argued, been bastions of liberty. Once these had been swept away there was nothing to check the twin processes of centralization and social leveling, which Tocqueville had come to see as the sinister confederates of the democratic revolution. Under French democracy, bureaucracy and equality trumped liberty. The result was a new Napoleonic despotism.
In his brave and ambitious book, Fareed Zakaria has updated Tocqueville. "The Future of Freedom" is brave because its central conclusion -- that liberty is threatened by an excess of democracy -- is deeply unfashionable and easily misrepresented. ("So, Mr. Zakaria, you say that America needs less democracy. Doesn't that make you some kind of fascist?") It is ambitious because Zakaria seeks to apply the Tocquevillian critique not just to modern America but to the whole world. 
In some ways, the book is a magazine article that just grew. In 1997 Zakaria -- now the editor of Newsweek International -- published a brilliant article in Foreign Affairs entitled "The Rise of Illiberal Democracy." His argument was that the "wave" of democracy that had swept the world in the 1980's and 1990's had a shadow side. Many of the new democracies -- Russia under Yeltsin and Putin, Venezuela under Chavez -- are routinely," as he puts it in "The Future of Freedom," "ignoring constitutional limits on their power and depriving their citizens of basic rights." Just holding elections did not make them free. 
He develops this point further in the book by adding some background history: why England prospered under aristocratic rather than democratic institutions, why democracy failed in interwar Germany. He also draws on the extensive literature on the relationship between democracy and economic growth, buying -- perhaps rather uncritically -- the deterministic argument that democratic institutions are likely to succeed only in countries with per capita income of more than $6,000. Many poor countries that democratized prematurely in the era of decolonization, the argument goes, ended up lapsing into dictatorship and deeper poverty. Conversely, it is no coincidence that "the best-consolidated democracies in Latin America and East Asia -- Chile, South Korea and Taiwan -- were for a long while ruled by military juntas." The moral of the story is simple: first get rich (thereby acquiring a middle class, civil society and the rule of law), then democratize. Memo to the Arab world: getting rich on rents from natural resources doesn't count.
There are a few oddities here. It will strike some readers as surprising that an Indian-born author should have such harsh words to say about his own country's democracy and such kind words to say about the benign despotism of Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, to say nothing of Gen. Pervez Musharraf's less than benign rule in Pakistan. Still, the range of Zakaria's knowledge is impressive. His chapter on the failure of democracy in the Arab world is superb. And I could not agree more that whenever the United States intervenes to overthrow "rogue regimes," at least "a five-year period of transition . . . should precede national multiparty elections." (Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that his call for a "serious, long-term project of nation-building" in Iraq will be heeded.) 
Which brings us to the short time horizon of American politics, one of a number of weaknesses Zakaria detects in the biggest of the Western democracies. Is the United States imperceptibly becoming an illiberal -- or at least a dysfunctional -- democracy? The argument is that the Madisonian system of republican government, which Tocqueville so admired, has been hollowed out in the name of "more democracy": "America is increasingly embracing a simple-minded populism that values popularity and openness as the key measures of legitimacy. . . . The result is a deep imbalance in the American system, more democracy but less liberty."
Since the 1960's, as Zakaria shows, legislatures, parties and other administrative agencies have sought to make their workings more transparent and responsive to the popular will. Yet the unintended consequence of this "democratization of democracy" is that all these institutions have become prey to the activities of professional lobbyists. Open committee meetings in Congress; primary elections to select delegates to national political conventions; changes to the system of campaign funding; the rise of referendums in state and municipal politics -- together, these well-intentioned innovations have tended to debase the political process. 
Nor has the process of "overdemocratization" been confined to the realm of politics. In finance, the law and even religion, the power of the masses has grown at the expense of the elites who once ruled the United States. Tocqueville based his confidence in American democracy on the existence of a professional "aristocracy" dividing its time between private work and public service. Zakaria convincingly shows how deregulation has undermined the old American elites, enslaving C.E.O.'s, law partners and evangelical ministers alike to the tyranny of the mass market. Our best hope, he concludes, is to delegate more power to impartial experts, insulated from the democratic fray. Today's independent central banks provide a possible template. Zakaria would like to see a chunk of federal fiscal policy handed to an equivalent of the Federal Reserve -- an autonomous I.R.S. that sets rather than merely collects taxes.
A book so wide in its scope is bound to have its flaws. Zakaria follows Mancur Olson and others in embracing a cartoon version of British political development that Herbert Butterfield long ago dismissed as the "Whig interpretation of history." There is also a strangely sketchy quality to Zakaria's political thought. After all, the aristocratic critique of democracy was not Tocqueville's invention. It is one of the central notions of classical political philosophy and history. In Book 3 of his Histories, for example, Herodotus set out the case against democracy in terms remarkably similar to Zakaria's:
"In a democracy, malpractices are bound to occur . . . corrupt dealings in government services lead . . . to close personal associations, the men responsible for them putting their heads together and mutually supporting one another. And so it goes on, until somebody or other comes forward as the people's champion and breaks up the cliques which are out for their own interests. This wins him the admiration of the mob, and as a result he soon finds himself entrusted with absolute power." 
Zakaria's critics will doubtless denounce him for looking backward. Indeed he is -- but not just to the 1950's, or even the 1850's. This is a book that looks back as far as 450 B.C. 
Whether, in our hyperdemocratic age, there is a market for such a classical defense of aristocratic rule must be doubtful. (Indeed, it would rather undermine Zakaria's own thesis if "The Future of Freedom" were to be a runaway best seller.) Yet it deserves a wide readership. Those who fear that while seeking to impose its will on far-flung countries the American republic may unwittingly follow Rome down the path to imperial perdition will read it with a mixture of admiration and unease.

 MOST of us trust doctors. I suppose we don't have much choice. We trust them to be wise and kind and shrewd; we believe in the myth of a calming bedside manner, even if we don't expect to encounter the real thing. So when a doctor turns writer, we expect his work to have a special kind of insight, a quiet sensitivity, to provide a diagnosis of not only our physical ills but our moral ones too. We remember the generosity of Chekhov, not the cruel economy of Schnitzler. Certainly the news that a writer is also a physician is enough to get our attention -- an unfair advantage, perhaps, for what might seem an unfair conjunction of talents.
Nevertheless, I wish that the publishers of the Australian-born John Murray's first book had made rather less of his medical training. The stories gathered in "A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies" are presented as underwritten by the author's experience working in public health at both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in a range of political hot spots, from Central Asia to the Horn of Africa. Murray, who now lives in Iowa, has written that he chose fiction as a way to get "closer to the truth" of such experiences, and his publisher's decision to stress his career off the page seems meant to pique our interest in what's on it. And maybe to disarm us as well.
This collection relies on a wide range of settings to make up for the limitations of its individual stories, moving from the Himalayan mountaintop of "Blue" to the Florida Keys of "All the Rivers in the World" and on to the Central Africa of "Watson and the Shark." Few of the stories are content with a single location, and most of them, for reasons the book's biographical note fails to explain, revolve around doctors of Indian ancestry or origin.
The opening story is a good example, though it differs from most in that it has both a happy ending and a female protagonist. "The Hill Station" begins with a lecture in Bombay given by Elizabeth Dinakar, who has "made a modest name for herself in the infectious diarrheas." "This is your enemy," she tells a gathering of Indian doctors, pointing to a blow-up of cholera bacteria "the size of cars." Then she faints. It will take a few pages to learn why, but in the meantime Murray has introduced us to what turn out to be the norms of his fictional world.
When Elizabeth comes to, she finds herself outside under a mango tree, surrounded by a group of Indian doctors hovering "like benevolent uncles." She does not think herself "worthy of the attention." The men look like uncles because she herself "looked Indian," the product of a diaspora that has blown her parents from their subcontinental childhoods to her own native New Jersey. Yet this is her first trip to her parents' homeland, and she finds that she's less Indian than she thought. In fact, the place makes her feel "completely foreign . . . in a profound way that she did not quite understand." That's a hallmark of Murray's work. Most of the characters in this curiously denationalized book seem if not quite displaced then somehow askew. There aren't any exiles among them, but there are a lot of immigrants and a few expatriates. None of them, as it happens, are Australian.
As for Elizabeth's sense that she's not "worthy of the attention," well, Murray's physicians as a group make few personal claims on the world -- or on other people. They remain disengaged from their own emotions; they can heal themselves least of all. In a couple of stories, that makes them into rather formulaically flawed and unreliable narrators. Elizabeth's own internal disconnections strike me as owing a bit too much to the title character in Michael Ondaatje's "Anil's Ghost," as does her return to an ancestral land. And the story's conclusion has a slick trickery that elides some of the complexities of her character.
But Murray's stories provide other pleasures, like his fine ear for Indian English speech and above all his vivid sense of detail: the almost reportorial eye with which he defines a slum hospital, with an IV bag hanging from a hook "screwed into one of the bamboo tent supports," or the way he captures the look of a burst bag of rice, the grains "brilliant white against the wet road." In fact, Murray has a gift for the precise description of everything that can be seen or heard, tasted, smelled or felt. "Watson and the Shark" shows a doctor trying to patch up refugees at a mission hospital, "assailed . . . by the warm reek of gut contents" and holding off from jabbing a patient with morphine "because I guessed he was splinting the wound with his own muscles and didn't want him to relax for fear of starting a major bleed." A mountain climber in the creepy story called "Blue" feels "hundreds of little icy flutters against his cheeks" and hears the "soft metallic click of the valve to the oxygen cylinder." His mouth tastes "of warm rubber."
Where Murray stumbles is in the brick-by-brick construction of narrative. Most of the eight stories here are long ones, and yet they're so full of drama they often feel cramped, like a room that's too small for its furniture. Some of Murray's characters are so solidly conceived they seem almost independent of the story that contains them; you believe in them, but they have no necessary relation to this particular fate, this particular sequence of actions. And sometimes it feels as if Murray has simply imposed a conclusion on both characters and story. The book's strongest selections left me wishing he had let them kick out into expansive life -- had tried to find out whether, inside their slender forms, a novel might be waiting.
I say that even though the book's two longest stories are its weakest. In both the title story and the concluding one, "Acts of Memory, Wisdom of Man," Murray uses a fascination with bugs to signal a first-person narrator's distance from his own emotions. This isn't the first time entomology has been employed in such a way. (Remember Brian Kiteley's "Still Life With Insects"?) Murray is sharp on the obsessions of these amateur naturalists, and yet his reliance on the idea seems heavy-handed. Both stories contain a crucial childhood scene from which everything about the narrator is schematically understood to flow. And in both the author seems to be trying on a voice, struggling into a fussily made costume that doesn't quite fit.
In the title story, a surgeon in late middle age remembers his childhood fascination with his grandfather's collection of "brilliantly colored insects . . . turquoise, mother-of-pearl and burnt orange." "My world, New York City, was gray and brown. I grew up looking at oily concrete, cast-iron railings and slabs of fatty corned beef on flaking white bread." But in fact he has also grown up looking at those butterflies, and the passage's central claim falls apart, a fissure not in the character so much as in the writing itself.
Still, one has to admire Murray's range, his willingness to experiment. In some ways, he can be a very attractive writer -- above all, in the understated modesty of his authorial presence. This book does without the claim to a weary knowledge of the ways of the world that one might have expected from someone of Murray's experience. "Watson and the Shark" in particular seems utterly convincing in its first-person account of doctors caught on the edge of genocide, too aware of their own confused motives to see themselves as heroic.
John Murray tends to succumb too obviously to the desire to stir his reader's emotions, and one could say that as a writer he's still in his residency. But, like the best doctors, on its best pages "A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies" does indeed earn our trust.

 COSMOPOLIS
By Don DeLillo.
209 pp. New York:
Scribner. $25.
 Though Don DeLillo gives his characters names, he might as well just assign them serial numbers. The barely corporeal cerebral entities that populate the pages of "Cosmopolis," a novel about the alleged insanity of Nasdaq-era hypercapitalism, aren't so much people as walking topic headings. When two or more of them gather to converse -- about linguistics, economics, time or any of the hundred other frosty postdoctoral preoccupations that the author awards them in place of souls -- the sounds they produce are so monotonous that it's not only hard to tell who's speaking, it's a mystery why they're even bothering. 
Consider the following dialogue, which reads like an unholy collaboration between Harold Pinter and Robby the Robot. Speaker 1: "There's a common surface, an affinity between market movements and the natural world." Speaker 2: "An aesthetics of interaction." Speaker 1: "Yes. But in this case I'm beginning to doubt I'll ever find it." Speaker 2: "Doubt. What is doubt? You don't believe in doubt. You've told me this. Computer power eliminates doubt. All doubt rises from past experience. But the past is disappearing. We used to know the past but not the future. This is changing. We need a new theory of time."
And on they drone, like Palm Pilots with lips.
This style does create an effect and have a point, but it's an old effect and an ancient point, of approximately the same vintage as Plexiglas coffee tables, "2001: A Space Odyssey" and Yale University faculty fondue parties. For going on 50 years now, educated Europeans and Americans have been satirizing unbridled materialism, rampant dehumanization and the like consistently and pretty much en masse (though perhaps not to much effect in the real world). This particular nightmare vision of sleek despair and medium cool existential aimlessness has been smelling stale for quite a while now, as riddled with trite conventions and canned attitudes as late medieval chivalric poetry.
The man referred to above as Speaker 1 is Eric Packer, a superrich currency trader who sets out one day in a high-tech white stretch limo equipped with oodles of Get Smart thingamabobs, from multiple pop-up video screens to a tiny bathroom, on a book-length trip across midtown Manhattan. The tone is hyperbolic deadpan. Though Packer has made a hugely leveraged bet on the behavior of the Japanese yen (a bet that, if it goes wrong, will bankrupt him and destabilize banks around the world), he appears to be most concerned with getting a haircut at his favorite barbershop. This touch is supposed to establish his eerie poise and impossibly coldblooded self-containment -- traits he shares with nearly every character he meets along the way.
He meets a lot of them, receiving them in rotation in his limo as it inches west across the wasteland: a socialite wife whom he barely seems to know; a female aide-de-camp out on a jog, whose self-mortifying exertions stir his lust; a doctor who palpates his prostate gland even as he takes a meeting in the back seat; and an icy, Bond-girl mistress whose 21st-century ideas of foreplay include things like licking chilled vodka off his genitals and jolting him unconscious with a stun gun. Not one of these supporting figures is anything but an agenda with a face, meant to embody some tired thesis about desensitization or compulsion. The fix is in, and the fix is all there is.
The result is a totalitarian reading experience that clicks by without surprise or spontaneity, a numbing abacus calculation in prose that makes the staccato operas of Philip Glass sound like Walt Whitman poems by comparison. Here is one character musing on the sight of electronic Times Square stock market displays: "Never mind the speed that makes it hard to follow what passes before the eye. The speed is the point. Never mind the urgent and endless replenishment, the way data dissolves at one end of the series just as it takes shape at the other. This is the point, the thrust, the future. We are not witnessing the flow of information so much as pure spectacle, or information made sacred, ritually unreadable." 
Our world has been transistorized to a fare-thee-well -- now tell us something we don't know. DeLillo refuses. His is a fossilized academic futurism. It's as though he had gone into permanent seclusion in 1968 or so following 
a New Wave film festival and has gathered all of his subsequent experiences via the reading of essays on poststructuralism and the viewing of remote-control security cameras trained on major urban landmarks. The Manhattan whose buzzing, poisonous vitality inspires the book's title and supplies its stage sets seems oddly underdeveloped and poorly seen. White stretch limousines, for example, conjure up prom nights in Omaha for me, not mornings on Wall Street. Or is the image a joke, faintly skewed for effect? It's hard to tell.
Most of the time DeLillo the black humorist labors for his laughs. In one long set piece a mob of youthful anarchists dressed ominously in Lycra bodysuits and armed with hundreds of live rats riots in Times Square to protest globalism, offering Packer a convenient chance to opine on the novel's major themes while watching them play out around his car. It's a fortunate day, in life or literature, when the crowds on the street explicitly enact, complete with appropriate costumes, printed slogans and antic performance pieces, the very same issues a person woke up pondering and has been discoursing about all morning, yet that's what happens to Packer. Lucky break.
DeLillo's favorite trick here is to enliven humdrum snapshots of ordinary cityscapes by tacking on captions attesting to their mystique: "Steam came venting from a manhole through a tall blue stack, the most common sight, he thought, but beautiful now, carrying the strangeness, the indecipherability of a thing seen new, steam heaving from the urban earth, nearly apparitional." There are detours into outright slapstick, too -- a hallmark of DeLillo's aging brand of high-low postmodern satire. ("No ideas but in gags" might be its motto.) A "pastry assassin" famous for squashing pies into the arrogant kissers of world leaders ambushes Packer along his route and then launches into a tirade whose broken English wouldn't pass muster on the average sitcom and conjures up Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons: "I am three years waiting for this. Fresh baked only. I pass up president of the United States to make this strike. I creme him any time. You are major statement, I tell you this. Very hard to zero in." This pie assault presages a graver attack that DeLillo set in motion much earlier. Some readers will grow impatient for it many pages before it comes to pass.
Beware the novel of ideas, particularly when the ideas come first and all the novel stuff (like the story) comes second. "Cosmopolis" is an intellectual turkey shoot, sending up a succession of fat targets just in time for its author to aim and fire the rounds he loaded before he started writing. When a presidential motorcade materializes to hamper Packer's odyssey, we know we're about to be treated to an essay on the illusion of political power in an age of borderless international commerce. DeLillo doesn't go in for that old saw about characters taking on livesof their own and situations springing up by themselves -- he sticks to his plan like a sergeant with a megaphone drilling raw recruits. 
It's one long march.

 THE EXTRAVAGANT UNIVERSE
Exploding Stars, Dark Energy,
and the Accelerating Cosmos.
By Robert P. Kirshner.
Illustrated. 282 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press. $29.95.
 IN 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is not at rest. By measuring the speed and distance of various galaxies, he established that all but a few are receding from us and that their "recessional velocities," the speeds at which they are moving away, increase steadily with distance. His surprising conclusion, accepted by scientists ever since, is that the universe is expanding. 
Until Hubble published his findings, most astronomers had thought the universe was static, unchanging. Not many years earlier, in fact, Albert Einstein noted that his equation for general relativity would lead to a contracting universe and inserted an artificial term, called the "cosmological constant," into his formula to counteract the force of gravity and yield a static universe. After 1929, Einstein abandoned his fabrication, calling it his worst blunder.
This term has been widely regarded as "theoretical poison ivy" by mainstream cosmologists until recently, Robert P. Kirshner writes in "The Extravagant Universe." But in the past few years, using ever more sophisticated telescopes and other instruments, astronomers have begun to perceive that the universe is not just expanding; its expansion is speeding up, seemingly unrestrained by gravitational attractions among the galaxies. Some kind of antigravity seems to be at work in the universe. Suddenly one hears cosmologists -- scientists who seek to explain the whole universe -- talking again about Einstein's cosmological constant as one way to account for the apparent acceleration. 
Kirshner gives a detailed, opinionated account of how these extremely difficult measurements -- made by observations of exploding stars, or supernovas -- became possible in the last 25 years. He has been observing these rare celestial convulsions ever since he was a Caltech graduate student in the early 1970's. Now, as head of the optical and infrared division at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, he leads an international team of scientists chasing supernovas.
Supernovas have the great advantage of being extremely bright celestial objects, often emitting as much light during their first several weeks of existence as an entire galaxy does normally. Thus they can be examined even when they occur at tremendous distances. And one category of them, called Type Ia supernovas, which are the nuclear explosions of white-dwarf stars, seem to have nearly the same intrinsic brightness no matter where or when they occur. Thus astronomers can use these as "standard candles" -- a kind of cosmic yardstick -- to measure the expansion of the universe at both large and small distances. If you know the intrinsic brightness of such a supernova, then its apparent brightness as seen in a telescope tells you its distance from Earth fairly precisely.
Accurately gauging the distances to faraway galaxies has always been the most problematical part of making such measurements. In determining the apparent brightnesses of Type Ia supernovas over a wide range of distances, Kirshner's team, and a competing group from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory led by Saul Perlmutter, noticed during the late 90's that the really distant ones, located about a third of the way across the visible universe, seemed substantially dimmer than anticipated. On the surface, these observations indicate that the galaxies in which they lie are farther away than predicted by the uniform "Hubble expansion" and thus have been receding faster. They suggest that a cosmic acceleration is occurring. If cosmic expansion had been slowing down because of gravity, as was widely expected, these galaxies would have been nearer and their supernovas would appear brighter. 
But these measurements are fraught with uncertainties; subtle errors creep in and must be weeded out. Kirshner explains in exhaustive detail how these ambiguities have been resolved so that meaningful results can be extracted from messy data. That is one of the principal strengths of his book. He takes readers inside the control rooms of large telescopes around the Pacific Basin and reveals the harried life of a leading astronomer. We even glimpse the politics of jockeying to use the Hubble Space Telescope. 
Kirshner reminds us that despite the all-encompassing "theories of everything" being promoted today, cosmology is ultimately based on observations and experiments. Unlike many other recent books on the topic, "The Extravagant Universe" is the gripping story of how two competing groups of scientists came to make, and finally believe, the surprising measurements on which a radical new view of the universe depends. And it is not the simple, elegant picture that certain theorists would have us think. Instead, to help accommodate the evidence that has recently been accumulating, we require ordinary, garden-variety matter; at least three kinds of dark, invisible matter; and two types of a mysterious entity inhabiting empty space called "dark energy," which powered the birth of the universe in the Big Bang and now drives cosmic acceleration. "You would be unwise to believe such a baroque mixture, which seems to violate common sense," Kirshner cautions. "The universe is wilder than we ordinarily dare to imagine." 
I ONLY wish he had written his book more carefully for a broader audience of general readers, who need this kind of exposure to the messy but rewarding process of scientific research. Instead, Kirshner seems to be addressing his colleagues and other scientists already familiar with such concepts as inflationary theories, cold dark matter and vacuum energy. He can occasionally write in a lively, accessible style, using revealing anecdotes and analogies, but even some of these miss their mark. And he repeatedly falls into astrophysical jargon and scientific notation. His book could have benefited from a strong editor. 
Despite these difficulties, "The Extravagant Universe" is an excellent book for readers with some literacy in science. It is an evocative reminder that cosmology, too, is now a true observational, experimental science, securely grounded in the messy practical realities of making measurements.

 TERROR AND LIBERALISM
By Paul Berman.
214 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $21.
 IN the final chapter of his book "A Tale of Two Utopias" (1996), Paul Berman laid out the rival historical claims of Francis Fukuyama and Andre Glucksmann, big thinkers with very different notions of what the cold war's end would bring. Fukuyama, the optimistic American, looked forward, in his famous thesis about "the end of history," to the slow, sure spread of liberal democracy. Glucksmann, a Frenchman and chastened ex-Maoist, saw dark, even monstrous possibilities ahead in the likely reaction to the free world's triumph. Berman himself split the difference: "Since I am a critic and not a philosopher, I see no reason not to say that both messages seem true enough." 
Though more of a gloomy Glucksmannite these days -- who isn't? -- Berman has not given up on the idea of a globe-sweeping democratic revolution. What has changed, as his new book attests, is his frame of mind. No longer content to sit back and watch the world-historical drama unfold on its own, he has exchanged his critic's pen -- employed with distinction over the years in the pages of this review and at magazines like The New Yorker, The New Republic and Dissent (where he sits on the editorial board) -- for the more personal, engaged style of an advocate. 
In the raging debate over what to do about Islamism and Iraq, Berman has been that rarest of creatures, a banner-waving liberal interventionist, eager to see the United States stand, as he writes here, "for the freedom of others." "Terror and Liberalism" is his manifesto -- an eloquent, strangely quixotic, frustratingly uneven effort to chart a course between right-wing "realists," with their cold calculations of national interest, and left-wing "anti-imperialists," who recoil at their country's every international move. Neoconservatives occupy a similar ideological terrain, but, as Berman himself notes, his approach is too "drippy" for membership in that camp. Call his position Wolfowitz for lefties, or (to borrow an apt Woody Allen quip) a severe case of Dissentary. 
Berman is reluctant to describe the present crisis as a "clash of civilizations." Samuel Huntington (who popularized the phrase) may have been prescient when he noticed, a decade ago, that "bloody borders" marked every point of contact between Muslim and non-Muslim peoples, but Islam itself,in Berman's view, explains only part of the problem. The Middle East's tyrants, terrorists and raving ayatollahs owe their nastiest qualities less to their own traditions, he believes, than to ours. They are, in a word, totalitarians. 
Though hardly alone since Sept. 11 in making this claim, Berman is one of the few commentators who haven't used the label simply as an epithet. He wants us to see Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein -- not to mention such affiliated villains as the Taliban, Hezbollah and Hamas -- in a new light, as heirs to a mode of thought handed down by the Bolsheviks, fascists and Nazis, and anticipated in the words and deeds of Saint-Just, Dostoyevsky's Ivan Karamazov and an assortment of bomb-throwing anarchists. Left or right, Berman argues, liberalism's sworn foes have always shared the same ideal -- "submission," "the one, instead of the many," "the total state, the total doctrine, the total movement" -- and, upon encountering intransigent reality, have always brought in their wake the same bloody result: "a cult of death." 
Does the totalitarian shoe fit? Berman makes a compelling case, particularly with regard to the Islamists, who have obligingly practiced the "politics of slaughter" everywhere they have appeared. From Khomeini's "human wave" attacks in the Iran-Iraq war, to the devastation wrought by the Algerian and Sudanese civil wars, to the suicide missions of "holy martyrs" in the Middle East, the United States and elsewhere, the toll in human lives has been in the millions -- mass death on a scale that would have made Hitler or Stalin proud. As for doctrine, Berman offers a long, subtle exegesis of the work of Sayyid Qutb (1906-66), the chief ideologist of the Islamist movement. Qutb emerges as a thinker of sinister depths, convinced that the modern West, and those Muslim societies influenced by it, suffer from a "hideous schizophrenia," brought on by the separation of civil and religious authority. Qutb's solution to the anomie and alienation? Jihad by an Islamic "vanguard" to restore what should never have been sundered. 
Against this ominous backdrop, Berman rightly cheers the American rout of the Taliban, seeing it as a promising start to the sort of idealistic, antitotalitarian war that he hopes Washington will continue to wage. In Afghanistan, he writes, "the scenes of victory were plainly scenes of liberation" -- women flocking to schools, men shedding their "hated beards," movies and music back in the public square -- and the country found itself with a leader who was neither a warlord nor a mullah but, wonder of wonders, a "man with 
democratic aspirations." For this, and against a chorus of liberal critics, Berman gives due credit to President Bush, but he worries (with good reason) about the limits of the administration's plans for securing Afghanistan's fragile achievement. Looking ahead, he takes Bush to task for failing to make democracy the centerpiece of his case for what Berman matter-of-factly calls "the next stage of the war, in Iraq." 
That war is now a fact, of course, as Berman recognized it might be while writing his book. The great virtue of his account is to lay bare just what sort of evil the United States has chosen to confront. As he shows, Baath ideology is a noxious totalitarian brew -- a mix of mystical pan-Arabism, Soviet-style economic and political principles, and violent anti-Semitism, with a cult of the leader thrown in for good measure. Nor can anyone doubt Saddam Hussein's character. His rule in Iraq has been, as Berman observes, "irrational, paranoid, murderous, grandiose and demagogic," replete with serial atrocities and aggressions. 
Still, Berman's treatment of the Iraq question is disappointing. Part of the problem is simply a failure to address this hottest of hot-button issues in anything like the necessary detail. "Terror and Liberalism" was conceived, as Berman tells us, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, and it reflects that origin, focusing intently -- and effectively -- on the nature of the Islamist threat. To this rich analysis, Berman has appended a few relatively brief sections dealing with Saddam Hussein and Baathism. They feel like an afterthought. 
Berman devotes little attention to the wide-ranging debate about Iraq that absorbed so much ink and air time in the months leading up to the conflict. Indeed, though he concluded that war was justified, he rejects, with a wave of his hand, the primary arguments advanced for it. The grounds offered by President Bush, he writes, "looked dishonest"; they were "either unconvincing (the argument that Saddam was conspiring with Al Qaeda) or convincing but less than supremely urgent (the problem of Saddam's weapons program)." Instead, for Berman, the real rationale for "going after Saddam" was "Wilsonian, in a militant version." As he wrote in Slate after completing his book: "If disarmament is the goal, there is no reason we shouldn't keep up a pressure short of invasion. I would favor an invasion for a larger purpose, though, which is this: to begin a rollback of the several tendencies and political movements that add up to Muslim totalitarianism."
In this peculiar point of view there is something at once admirable and perverse. Berman undoubtedly stands on the side of the angels when he decries the foreign policy cynics of both parties. The United States can and should do far more to spark liberalization and democratic reform abroad, for reasons not just of high principle but of self-interest. He is right, too, to insist that the need for such a campaign is nowhere clearer than in our relations with the sundry despotisms of the Islamic world. 
But the wish to bring liberty to Baghdad -- or Tehran or Riyadh -- is not, in itself, reason enough to take up arms. As any card-carrying member of the American left might be expected to know, war is an ugly business, an answer only to the gravest of threats. Berman saw no such threat in Iraq. He advocated toppling Saddam Hussein not to destroy his fearsome weapons but, more grandly, to repudiate his vicious regime. This sort of idealistic posturing may save Berman from being branded a Bushie, but it makes him seem unserious, even reckless. Much as we might detest totalitarian dragons, we gird ourselves to slay them, as the president has argued, only when they're on the loose and breathing deadly fire.

DATELINE: Old Westbury, N.Y. 

 BODY:
SEAN BOYLE has started college three times. The first time was right out of high school, nearly a decade ago, when he enrolled at Eugene Lang College in New York City. He had been a solid student in high school but dropped out of college just weeks into his first semester to pursue acting. The second time was about a year later, after giving up on the theater. This time, he worked as a temp and attended Nassau Community College on Long Island. That lasted a semester, until the company he was working for offered him a full-time job. He bolted again.
 The third time, after changing jobs, he decided he really did need a college degree. Now a payroll administrator at a property management company, he leaves work at 5:15 two afternoons a week, wolfs down a sandwich in his car and dashes for a 6:10 class at the State University of New York at Old Westbury. He is 27 and this time intends to graduate. 
 "For quite a while, college didn't seem important to me," says Mr. Boyle, sitting in Old Westbury's cafeteria in a white button-down shirt, dark suit and tie, surrounded by younger students in sweat pants and jeans. "I saw it as vocational training and I had a job and my career was advancing. Then I realized what a liability not having a degree was. Also, I realized that I had internalized feelings of inferiority. These days, most people have college degrees."
More people may have degrees, but like Mr. Boyle, many take circuitous routes -- and many years -- to get them. To the consternation of educators, politicians and tuition-paying parents, a student's path through college -- once a quick, smooth ride on an open freeway -- is now more like stop-and-go rush-hour traffic on the Long Island Expressway.
Once the norm, a four-year bachelor's degree is no longer typical. Students now spend on average five to six years steeped in Socrates and child psychology courses before accumulating enough credits for a diploma. Of the students who entered college in 1995 planning to earn a bachelor's degree, only 37 percent succeeded within four years (33 percent from the institution they enrolled in as freshmen), and 63 percent within six years (55 percent from the first institution), according to a study issued in December by the United States Department of Education.
The prolonged student tenure has prompted both outrage and concern. Some government officials see a waste of taxpayer money when slowpoke students attend state-supported universities and receive federal and state aid. Others see the graduation rates as a failure of colleges to do their job properly, or blame students for being undisciplined and taking up slots better occupied by fresh-faced, motivated freshmen.
"The longer people are enrolled, the more it costs, and if students have to borrow, it drives up their debt load," says Sally L. Stroup, head of the office of postsecondary education at the Department of Education, which has been soliciting recommendations on what role the federal government can play in spurring students to graduate sooner. 
Faced with budget cuts and swelling classrooms, state governments as well as colleges from Minnesota to Texas have been testing various ideas to hasten graduation. In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has called for withholding a third of a student's aid until graduation. At the University of Florida at Gainesville, a tracking system tells what courses a student needs to complete a major and flags those who are falling behind. A growing number of universities are also guaranteeing that required courses will be available so students can graduate on time. In the fall, Pace University in New York begins the "Pace Promise" program, pledging to add sections or open closed courses for eligible students who are shut out. Similarly, SUNY at Fredonia will pay the tuition of students in its "Fredonia in Four" program if they can't get needed courses.
THE strongest predictor that a student will graduate is academic preparation, especially the level of math completed in high school, according to Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst at the Department of Education. "Finishing a course beyond the level of algebra II -- for example, trigonometry or precalculus -- more than doubles the odds that a student who enters postsecondary education will complete a bachelor's degree," he wrote in a 1999 report on college-completion patterns.
Selective universities like Yale and Harvard have little problem getting their freshmen out in four years (88 and 84 percent, respectively). They admit academically prepared students who have the best graduation prospects, and most students attend full time, live on campus and work limited hours -- all factors that raise the likelihood of completing college.
But for colleges like SUNY at Old Westbury, which is filled with students who do not meet this profile, ensuring that students graduate -- and graduate more quickly -- is a challenge. Like marathon runners who reach the finish line hours after the winners have raced through and the cheering crowds have gone home, many students limp on for years. 
Founded in 1965 for nontraditional students, Old Westbury enrolls students who tend to have the lowest graduation rates: disadvantaged students, many of them black and Hispanic, with poor academic backgrounds. Pushing down their prospects still further, many live off campus and hold full-time jobs.
In 2001, Old Westbury had one of the most diverse student bodies in the State University of New York system and also the lowest graduation rate: only 18 percent of freshmen who entered in 1997 graduated four years later. Only 24 percent of those entering in 1995 succeeded in six years. Five percent were still working on degrees; 71 percent had either transferred to another college or dropped out. 
SUNY officials are pressing all the campuses to raise graduation rates -- among the four research universities, six-year rates in 2001 ranged from 52 percent at Stony Brook to 77 percent at Binghamton. But they have left it to each campus to work out the methods.
"What I'm seeing across the university is pretty innovative programs," says Robert L. King, SUNY's chancellor, "particularly in student advising, getting students lined up with the right majors and courses, getting support for students who need to enhance their study skills or need help in science or math or whatever. 
"But remember, this all starts with what the demographics are of the students you're admitting. If you are the Ivy League, and you are admitting only the top 5 or 10 percent in terms of performance, your graduation and retention rates are higher. The economics of families who come to public universities are such that they may need to work more. The age of students is also a factor; some are married and have other obligations."
At Old Westbury, a critical first step was to attract stronger students, in part by becoming more selective and shrinking the number of freshmen, from 460 to 280. (SUNY has made up for the lost revenue.) It has also introduced financial incentives -- merit scholarships and free rooms in its residence halls to top students. 
The president of Old Westbury, Calvin O. Butts III, insists its mission has not changed. "If a rabbi or a chemistry teacher or a Boy Scout leader recommends someone who has strong motivation but does not have 800 or 1000 on their SAT's, we will still take them," he says. "We are just getting the diverse students out there who have achieved well."
The university is also trying a new "first-year experience" program that teaches study skills and time management and offers field trips, dances and other events designed to make commuter students feel part of a community, and thus more engaged in class. Most students are now matched with faculty advisers their first year rather than after they choose a major. 
"You want students to bond with faculty immediately," Mary Marquez Bell, vice president for enrollment, says, adding that professors have to play a central role if the college is to keep students on track.
Dr. Butts expects all this to contribute to higher graduation rates. Already, the proportion of students returning after freshman year has jumped, to 71 percent this year from 56 percent four years ago. But there is still more to do. Facing a tight budget this spring, the college canceled 24 courses, leaving students to scramble to fill holes in their schedules. Some ended up taking fewer credits than they planned, which will delay graduation. 
Anastasia Yokom, 24, lost a course in Eastern religions. Ms. Yokom, who hopes to become a teacher, transferred to Old Westbury in January from a community college, where it took her seven semesters to graduate. Studying does not come easily, so she had taken less than a full load. "I work my butt off, and I still don't make it," she says. As for losing the course this term, she adds: "If it takes a little bit longer, I don't have a problem. I just don't want to be here until I'm 40."
Ahmed Rodriguez, 27, is in his sixth year at Old Westbury, thanks to academic and financial problems combined with a full platter of extracurricular activities and a double major. He earned A's his freshman year but then took on responsibility as student government president and worked long hours in two clothing stores. He kept running out of time on tests. Not surprisingly, his grades suffered.
He sought help with his test-taking problems, cut back on activities and outside work and took a semester off. "I didn't want to not take courses, but that's what I had to do," he says. Now he is earning a 3.5 average and looking forward to graduating in May with majors in American studies and media and communications.
While educators believe that students who graduate on time will be better off, Mr. Rodriguez says he does not understand the hurry, with so much to cram in. No one dictates how long it should take to marry or buy a house. Why should college be stuffed into a particular time frame?
"The college experience is the best time of your life," he says. "It is not good to rush out of school. Everyone I know who graduated wishes they were back in school."

HEADLINE: Where Race Matters 

BYLINE:  By Jodi Wilgoren; Jodi Wilgoren is the Midwest bureau chief for The Times.

DATELINE: Ann Arbor, Mich. 

 BODY:
Every day before his lecture "Introduction to Constitutional Law," Prof. Richard Primus conducts a ritual that Hollywood might call "Socratic method meets social engineering." In an office tucked off the law library stacks, he takes out two piles of index cards adorned with the face-book pictures of his 91 first-year students. Like a blackjack dealer in a casino, he shuffles the piles, which are split by sex, then deals out 10 cards from each, the first step in compiling the list of students to be called on during class.
 "I've got three black students out of 20, which is plenty," Professor Primus said one recent morning, now the coach adjusting his lineup. Surveying the selected men, he sighed and sent the top three back to the pile: one had been grilled the day before, another already had four hash marks, indicating the number of times he had been picked, and the third belonged to Richard Hoeg, a white man known throughout campus for his conservative views. "Mr. Hoeg talks every day," Professor Primus explained. "Sometimes he has good things to say, but I don't need to call on him." 
 Once he had 20 viable cards, the young professor turned to the more delicate process of sequencing, starting with the women's pile. Given the persistent pattern of men speaking more often in classrooms, he tries to pick women two of the first three times he calls on students. 
"I want to make sure the conversation in the first few minutes includes some women," he said. "I won't call on three men in a row. It's just too much." The first man in the deck sits too close to the first woman, so he shuffled again. "I want to move the conversation around the room," he said, swapping Kristin Cleary, who sits to the professor's right, for Umbreen Bhatti across the room. Then he picked a man who sits toward the back, then a woman down front. He stopped for a demographic check: two of the first four on the roster were minority women. He was set. 
This is one of the untold tiny ways that affirmative action comes to life on the campus of the University of Michigan Law School, a quadrangle of Gothic buildings that seems to have been borrowed from Yale. 
In defending its race-based admissions policies at the Supreme Court on April 1, administrators at the law school argued that diversity was crucial to its educational goals and that having a critical mass of minorities was essential to achieving diversity. Unlike the undergraduate admissions office, whose policy is also being challenged in court, the law school does not have an explicit system of awarding extra points to minority applicants, but black and Hispanic students are admitted with lower grades and test scores, on average, than their white and Asian counterparts. Relying on a section of Justice Lewis Powell's opinion in the 1978 Bakke case, the administrators contend that without such steps, the campus would be de facto segregated, denying opportunity not only to minority applicants but everyone involved.
But what is educational diversity? What is critical mass? How does affirmative action work when it leaves the admissions office and enters the classroom, the dining hall, the dorm?
At the Michigan law school, the impact of the admissions policies is at once obvious and invisible, threaded through the fabric of campus life. 
Affirmative action makes it virtually impossible to walk into a lecture hall without seeing a black face. Yet those few black faces -- 21 of the 346 current first-year students are African-American, five of them men -- are almost always huddled together in the hallways, the snack bars, the library and even in many classrooms. Class discussions, whether organic or painstakingly structured, range across a spectrum of experience, not only when the topic is an obvious hot button like cultural conflicts in negotiation but also when it involves a seemingly mundane issue like financial institutions. While many white students are grateful for the different perspectives, particularly from the few poor or working-class African-Americans, some blacks find this role an unfair burden. 
Affirmative action as a policy is a constant hum in the background of all campus chatter, often avoided in mixed racial company out of a sense of fatigue, though inevitably on the front burner because of the Supreme Court case, with briefs being circulated for student signatures and buses organized for those who want to march in Washington. Students of all races, and many of their professors, seem dubious about the constitutionality of Michigan's approach, though they are all but unanimous in saying that they do not want the school to lose its carefully constructed mix. 
"It's universal: in 'Constitutional Law,' when you get to the race issue, everyone shuts up," said Sarah Sterken, a third-year student whose dorm-room walls are decorated with posters of Africa, where she spent last semester. "I can't imagine going to school with all white people here. The snobbery would go up 100 million times. Maybe you'd get more debate on the affirmative action issue, but nobody would be very well informed."
Ms. Sterken, a white woman from the small town of Holland, Mich., says her closest friends here are a black woman -- with whom she has never discussed racial issues -- and a Hispanic woman from South Texas. She also enjoys arguing with an archconservative Russian immigrant and was recently grateful that a French woman interrupted her in a law journal meeting for poking fun at a professor whose writing betrayed that English was not his native language. "I don't think affirmative action is the best way to go under the law, but I think it's the only way to go," Ms. Sterken said. "I've never heard so many diverse views. I've never had my mouth so gaping open."
WALK into Room 100 of Hutchins Hall, the law school's largest auditorium, and portraits of four old white men stare back. Floyd R. Mechem, Tappan law professor, presented by the class of 1899. Harry B. Hutchins, former dean and university president, 1901. The Hon. Thomas M. Cooley, 1859-1884. A fourth, captionless, has a similar long gray beard.
At 8:45 a.m. on a Tuesday, the dawn of "Civil Procedure," there are five black students among the 68 sitting at the curved wooden tables around the lectern or dozing in theater-style red upholstered chairs. A smattering of South and East Asians break up the white majority plugging in laptops and opening casebooks.
The pattern is confirmed in seven other classes in the 9 o'clock hour. Each room has four or five blacks, more women than men, among the 80 or so students, often sitting together. The only exception is "International Business Transactions," an elective taught by an Asian woman that attracts foreign students from the master of laws program; of 51 students in Room 132 that Tuesday, 29 were white.
It is a different story downstairs, where the "basement groups" dominate a long hallway leading from the lockers adorned with bumper stickers -- "Enough Is Enough: Vote Libertarian," "Ralph Nader for President," "Will Litigate for Food" -- to the greasy snack bar. The basement groups are an alphabet soup of special interests forming the law school's rainbow coalition. Though there are other student organizations -- the A.C.L.U. chapter, the Armed Forces Association, the American Constitutional Society for Law and Policy -- with propaganda on the hallway bulletin boards, it is the black and Latino and Asian students who gather in their basement offices on tattered couches between classes. 
Here in the cramped corner devoted to the Black Law Students Alliance, everyone has a story of being stigmatized, of being presumed less qualified, of being looked to as an advocate for some particular perspective. It is their retreat and, frankly, they would rather not discuss affirmative action. They may be beneficiaries but they are hardly ardent advocates. 
"What is this critical mass we're trying to obtain?" asked Ronald Falls, a first-year law student from San Diego who graduated from the historically black Morehouse College. "Critical mass in terms of us having a community? Critical mass in terms of contributing to the classroom? This whole term of critical mass begs the question of quota."
Several students said that affirmative action was a joke, since a number of the admitted black students are from wealthy families and attended private schools; they suggested that economic diversity might be a better goal. But Isa Kasoga, a second-year student from Lansing who also did his undergraduate work at Michigan, said the debate should not be about diversity at all but "about merit, about who deserves, who should have."
"I'm not here to enhance any white kid's education," Mr. Kasoga said, bringing the university's legal argument down to a personal level. "I don't give a damn how their education turns out. I'm here to get a J.D. and get a better life for my family and my community."
But for others, some educational benefit may seep through.
Ryan Houseal, a third-year student who grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and attended City College, pointed to a discussion in his "Financial Institutions" class about why some people lack access to banks -- people like his mother, who had neither a high school diploma nor bank account.
"One of the students, a white student, raised her hand and said, 'I was in New York over the summer, and I took a bus through Harlem, and I saw banks everywhere,"' Mr. Houseal recalled. "I said, 'Why don't you get off the bus? Or, God forbid, take an apartment in Harlem.'
"I was the only person of color in that class. If I hadn't been there, it would have gone unsaid."
Mr. Falls shook his head. "That gets old, though," he said. 
Mr. Houseal, who is editor of the Michigan Journal of Race and Law, thought about transferring after his first year because of such loneliness. He decided to stay mainly because Michigan would lead to a better future -- like his job at the law firm of Jones Day -- than would a degree from the City University of New York. As long as he's here, he will speak up.
"If you're going to have 50 black people in the room and they're not going to say anything," he said, "what's the point of them being there?"
UPSTAIRS, outside Room 100, there is a large table that serves as a universal meeting point. On one end, students were selling Valentine messages. On the other, people were adding their names to a "friend of the court" brief eventually signed by 13,922 law students nationwide, including 238 at Michigan, making the rather personal legal argument that diversity is a key element of their education.
"Hi, are you a supporter of affirmative action?" Ms. Sterken called out in the passing rush. "Hello, all over there. Are you guys supporters?"
Sometimes, said the first student. Yes and no, said the second.
"The people that sign on, you're saying that diversity is a compelling governmental interest," explained Beth Locker, a third-year student collecting signatures with Ms. Sterken. "And that it makes us better lawyers."
Caleb Weiner, a first-year student, stopped to flip through the eight pages. "Can I believe in diversity as a compelling interest without supporting affirmative action?" he asked, then left without adding his name. 
"I'm all for being around people who are not like me as much as I can," he said later. "I don't need to be around people like me. I'm around myself all the time." 
But while he thinks diversity noble, he finds the argument disingenuous. Affirmative action is really about making up for past discrimination, he said, and a better way to do that would be to create equal educational opportunity for everyone starting from Day 1. "It's a way of addressing a symptom rather than the disease."
The admissions controversy has had a funny effect on Mr. Weiner: "People say, 'Wow, you got into Michigan and you're a white male?"' he said. "That's quite an achievement; the odds were really stacked against you." In fact, over the last 10 years, 29 percent of white applicants have been accepted, compared with 26 percent of African-Americans. In 2002, whites made up 57 percent of applicants and 65 percent of the class, while blacks were 7 percent of applicants and 6 percent of the class. So it's not easier for blacks to get in, at least not in the sense that more of them do so. 
Instead, affirmative action means that blacks are often chosen over whites with higher test scores and grades: between 1995 and 2000, accepted minority students had average grade point averages of one-tenth to three-tenths of a point below their white counterparts, and L.S.A.T. scores seven to nine points lower. The plaintiff in the law school case, Barbara Grutter, points out in her brief that in the fall of 1999, Michigan accepted 81 percent of black applicants with G.P.A.'s between 3.0 and 3.49 and L.S.A.T. scores between 154 and 160, but only 3 percent of whites with similar grades and test scores. 
So if Mr. Weiner experiences a presumption of excellence, Christopher Moody, like many of his black classmates, feels pressure to prove he deserves his seat. "Some students see me and assume I'm here for something other than my academic abilities," said Mr. Moody, a second-year student from Memphis who went to George Washington University. "You just get to the point where you want to say, 'Let's all lay our G.P.A.'s out and see if I'm the one filling out the bottom of the curve."'
Knowing that black students' qualifications are suspect, Mr. Moody said, "I just won't go to class unprepared. I'm sure there are many students, many white students, who come to class and haven't done the reading and will just pass if they're called on," he said over dinner in the dorm known as the Lawyers' Club. "I don't want to be that guy." Later, in an e-mail message, he clarified his position, saying his commitment to homework was more about his own high standards than about race or affirmative action. "I have never been that guy, and never will be O.K. being 'that guy' -- that's just not me," he wrote. "Not in my majority black high school, not at my majority white undergraduate institution and not at the law school."
THE seminar "Alternative Dispute Resolution" on the roles of race, gender and culture in negotiations would seem as good a place as any to assess the impact of diversity on the educational process. There were 24 students in the class, including a black woman and two black men. There was also a Brazilian woman and a German man.
The students had written personal experiences involving a negotiation that they believed was muddled by these immutable characteristics. A white man told of a trip to Morocco and being warned not to buy anything at the bazaars. Another white man recalled his frustration while living in Peru when a tour bus was an hour and a half late. A Japanese-American spoke of generational conflicts. Mr. Moody shared a story from a political campaign when his candidate was running hopelessly behind schedule for a luncheon in Iowa, upsetting the man who had organized it. "I'm from the South; Southerners just stroll in when they stroll in," Mr. Moody said. "He clearly expected us to be on time, which shocked me. He's in Iowa, and Iowans tend to be on time."
Race was never explicit in the conversation, which, law professors and administrators say, is exactly the point. Critical mass means enough minorities so that they are not pigeonholed as racial spokesmen and are allowed to illustrate that black and Hispanic and Asian students have a range of experiences and views, just like white students. 
"In an environment where you have one person, every time he talks they'll think, 'Yes, it's him, he's black and he's talking,"' said Professor Primus. "If you have seven or eight, that starts to go away." That very day, in "Con Law," two black women had taken opposite stances on federalism. "They are free to express what they believe," he said, "and the whole class sees these two people who are demographically similar disagree." Last year, Mr. Moody was the only African-American in Professor Primus's "Con Law." On affirmative action day, he was silent, until after class. "He supports the diversity rationale but he didn't want to speak in class because he didn't want to represent," the professor said. "He's not able to give us what the diversity rationale promises because there's only one of him."
Affirmative action does not end at the admissions office. The Michigan Law Review, the most prestigious of six student-run law journals, also uses race, along with G.P.A. and writing samples, to dole out editorships. And the administration provides a special support group, the Minority Assistance Program, to help first-year students adjust.
Some white students resent that program participants lunch with professors monthly at Ann Arbor restaurants, a break from the daily ritual of trying to scrounge free pizza from some boring campus workshop. Last fall, such resentment grew when a criminal law professor gave the students tips before Thanksgiving about what would be on the final exam -- tips he planned to withhold from the rest of the class until after the break. When white students discovered the minority students' advantage and complained, the professor changed course and revealed his hints to all before the holiday.
But there is no affirmative action in a popular seminar on hypocrisy called "Faking It" -- students were selected among 100 applicants by lottery, leaving no blacks in the room. William Miller, the professor, does not care. "In a small class, it doesn't matter what the race of anybody is," he said. "A dull black kid and a dull white kid look the same to me. You want interesting."
When he taught "Negotiations," Professor Miller said, it did matter. He recalled a taped session in which a large black student exploited stereotypes to intimidate white sparring partners. "The white kids were scared, you could see it on film," he said. "I'd say: 'This is law school. You think he's going to take you out and beat you up?' The black guy was playing up the race stuff, it was an advantage he had. He wasn't going to let that go."
While Professor Miller does not buy the diversity argument, he also does not want to see affirmative action outlawed. "I don't think anybody, even the most die-hard of my conservative colleagues, is willing to teach in an institution with no black faces," he said. "If you have an all-black army and an all-white law school, something's not right. The democracy, the risks and benefits, simply have to be better distributed."
AT a bagel breakfast in the lounge of the Lawyers' Club, a first-year student stopped Professor Primus, who had clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to ask what he thought about students skipping class to carry signs outside the Supreme Court on the day of arguments. Tens of thousands rallied in Washington on April 1. Was it his experience from clerking that a significant march makes a difference, the student, Laurel Dumont, asked. 
"Absolutely not," Professor Primus said. "I think people do things like that to make themselves feel involved."
As for the case itself, which is expected to be decided in late June, he is pessimistic. 
"Usually, I'm 85 to 90 percent sure re constitutional cases," he told Ms. Dumont that morning. "I'm less confident in this, 65 percent. But my 65 percent is that we're going to lose." 
Professor Primus is one of several professors who consulted with the university's lawyers on the case. For him, the court's decision will affect not only who is in his classroom but also what he teaches. "I know that this year I'm going to teach Bakke for the last time," he said. "I know that next year, in that place on the syllabus, there's going to be a case called Grutter. I don't know what it says yet, but I know it's about me and my students." 
If the Supreme Court decides in favor of the plaintiffs, the professor said, it would mean the end of affirmative action not only in admissions but also in his card-shuffling ritual. Taking gender and race into account as he selects the students to be called on each day, he explained, would also be illegal. Then again, there would most likely be far fewer black faces to choose from.

HEADLINE: Commute to Nowhere 

BYLINE:  By By Jonathan Mahler; Jonathan Mahler is writing a book about New York and baseball in the 70's.

 BODY:
In the forest of khaki, heather gray and chambray that is the Gap's store on Fifth Avenue and 54th Street, the 6-foot-4-inch Jeff Einstein is a walking, talking redwood. The instant a potential customer breaches the invisible border of his department, he approaches to offer assistance. "Too bad I'm not selling cars," he jokes with one pear-shaped man after setting him up with a pair of khakis -- 40-inch waist, cuffs, pleats -- in less than 15 seconds.
 There's something self-conscious about Jeff's act, as if he's trying to prove to himself that he's comfortable with his job. Or maybe it's that he's overcompensating for having been a bit slow to tell me about it a few weeks earlier. ("I'm working in retail now," he had said cryptically.) Either explanation makes sense. Jeff is not your typical Gap salesman. 
 When his shift ends, we relocate to a nearby bar, and Jeff tells me the story of landing the job. The Gap was gearing up for the Christmas onslaught near the end of last year, and he was summoned for a group interview. "There were about 20 people in the room," Jeff recalls, "and each one of us had to introduce ourselves and talk about our most recent position. There was a cashier from McDonald's, a woman who had worked at Baby Gap, a ticket collector from Loews, a gift wrapper from Barnes & Noble. Then it came to me. I said I used to be an executive vice president and a director of interactive marketing for Rapp Digital, a digital media company with 300 employees and a P. and L. of $40 million."
Jeff, who is 50, lost his job at Rapp Digital almost two years ago, making him one of 21,000 computer-industry professionals in New York City to have been let go since the end of 2000. In percentage terms the numbers are even starker. Between December 2000 and January 2003, the industry slashed 41 percent of its positions. 
While the recession of the early 90's took a heavy toll on white-collar workers, this one seems to have institutionalized the phenomenon. Advanced degrees, no matter how prestigious, offer little protection. The economy is grim nationwide, but the picture in New York City is especially bleak. Since the end of 2000, the media-and-communications sector has cut 15 percent of its jobs, telecommunications 27 percent, advertising 25 percent. Eighteen percent of jobs on Wall Street have been slashed, and firms continue to lay people off. Given the delirium with which most high-tech jobs were first created, there's no reason to believe that many of them -- and the jobs in other sectors that they generated -- will come back anytime soon. 
By the numbers, women have been hit as hard as men, but white-collar men tend to experience unemployment differently, organizational psychologists say. For most women, survival trumps ego; they simply adapt and find some job. For men, grappling with joblessness inevitably entails surrendering an idea of who they are -- or who others thought they were.
A couple of weeks after we met at the Gap, Jeff Einstein is in the kitchen making chicken cacciatore as his wife, Mara, and I chat in the living room of their $2,200-a-month two-bedroom apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. She's a sturdy-looking, attractive woman, with chin-length curly blond hair and high, wide cheekbones.
When she first met Jeff in 1997, Mara tells me, he was living in the East Village and seamlessly moving from one job to the next. Companies would hire him to dream up and put in effect initiatives that would entice investors -- and then cut him and his high salary loose to appease those investors. There was always another high-paying position waiting. Whenever he switched jobs, a press release would go out; inevitably, his name would be prefaced by three words: "interactive industry pioneer."
Jeff discovered his passion for computers relatively late in life; until then, he was always something of an underachiever. He grew up near San Francisco in the 1960's and never graduated from college, opting to move to Israel instead. After several years there, he returned to the United States and knocked around from job to job for a while.
In 1983, at the age of 31, he found himself working at an ad agency in New York. One day, out of boredom mostly, Jeff picked up a computer manual and started reading. He found it incomprehensible. A few weeks later, he pitched a series of books to Harcourt that would be called Einstein's Computer Guides -- one of the first how-to books for personal computers. The publisher had only one question for him: Is your name really Einstein? He got the deal and flew out to California to pick up a free demo from Apple. While he was there, he went skiing in Lake Tahoe with a few of Apple's founders. For the next 15 years, Jeff had the rare experience of being exactly the right person for the right time.
After his computer guides were published, he was hired to install a PC network in American Airlines' club lounges that would offer financial information and e-commerce (though the term did not yet exist) to business travelers. He quickly realized that the network's real value was as an advertising vehicle and founded, with Jay Sandom, what industry experts consider the first interactive ad agency, Einstein & Sandom Inc.
Jeff was already an Internet crusader when the recession hit in the early 90's. He was convinced that as soon as the rain stopped and the sun broke through the clouds, a new industry would flower. 
He was, of course, correct. And so by the time Jeff met Mara, in 1997, he was a wizened rock star, the Mick Jagger of digital media.
Mara remembers going with him to an "industry event" -- those bygone giddy get-togethers of Internet evangelists -- and bumping into an old friend. Her friend asked what Mara was doing there. "When I told him I was with Jeff Einstein," Mara recalls, "he couldn't believe it."
They were married in 1998. Mara had an M.B.A. and was working in marketing at NBC. She also enrolled in a Ph.D. program in media studies at New York University and later quit her job to write her dissertation. Soon after, when she became pregnant, Jeff figured it was time to settle down. The job at Rapp Digital seemed as secure as they come; his old partner and best friend, Jay Sandom, was president, and Jeff was on the company's operating board. "I thought I was selling out when I joined Rapp Digital," he says. "We didn't even have any dot-com clients. Our clients were companies like Enron."
Not long after Jeff started, Rapp Digital's parent company, Omnicom, instituted a policy requiring every branch to show a 20 percent profit, which was out of the realm of possibility for his New York office. Jeff survived the first round of cuts, but not the second. He was laid off in May 2001.
Jeff figured an offer would arrive shortly after his name started circulating, maybe not as quickly as they had in the past, but he had three months of severance -- plenty, he thought, to get him to his next position. The three months went by, then four, then five, then six. His name was out there, but no offers were forthcoming. Jeff was periodically checking job boards like Monster.com, but he rarely saw postings that looked senior enough. Mostly he was hanging around the house like a moody teenager, checking his e-mail, surfing the Internet, playing the guitar.
Mara wanted to be understanding. "I promised myself I wasn't going to give him any ultimatums," she says. Instead, she took on more work. She secured a publisher for her dissertation and took a tenure-track position at Queens College. She also piled on the part-time teaching and consulting jobs, pushing her income up to $80,000 a year.
We've finished dinner now, and Jeff has gone into the other room to play with their 3-year-old daughter, Cayla, leaving Mara and me alone at the table.
As the months passed, she tells me, her patience started to wear thin. In May 2002, her father died of leukemia. That month also marked the anniversary of Jeff's unemployment. "Once it hits a year," she says, "there's no reason to believe it's going to be any better this time next year."
By that point, things at home were strained. "A lot of people were telling me that if their husband wasn't working for this long they'd throw him out of the house," Mara says. "I was starting to think, Am I an idiot for putting up with this?" 
Jeff became depressed and withdrew. Mara, resentful that she couldn't talk about her job without risking making Jeff feel worse, pulled back, too. They spoke only rarely, Jeff says, and stopped having sex altogether.
By the summer, she was just about out of sympathy. "He was like a retired person," Mara says. "I couldn't stand it." She wanted him to do something, anything. One day, over a cheese omelet and Belgian waffles at the diner around the corner from their apartment, she begged him to at least do some volunteer work, whatever it took to get out of the house. But he never did.
Jeff is back at the table now, but Mara seems to have scarcely noticed. She continues to speak freely about his unemployment and its toll on their relationship. Jeff occasionally nods in agreement. Once toxic, the subject now couldn't feel more benign.
In September, Mara says, Jeff agreed to go into therapy. They also started couples' counseling. Two months later, she did what she had vowed never to do: "I told him that come Feb. 1, if you're not contributing to the rent, you have to move out."
Now, working at the Gap at $10 an hour, it takes Jeff two and a half weeks to earn what he used to make in a day at Rapp Digital, where his annual salary was $300,000 (including bonuses but excluding stock options). But he and Mara are still together, and after "the year-and-a-half-long process of dehumanization," as Jeff calls it, he's happy to have any job. "It keeps me out of my head," he says, "which is a bad neighborhood to be in right now."
When the technology industry blossomed in the late 90's, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs that seemed to promise boundless prosperity, you didn't have to be a daydreamer to be intoxicated by the scent.
In 1999, Lou Casagrande, a graduate of Brown University with a Ph.D. in chemistry from Stanford and an M.B.A. from Long Island University, quit his job as a scientist at Northrop Grumman to take a position as an information-technology consultant in Warren, N.J. Lou and his wife, Janet, found a four-bedroom Colonial in nearby Summit with a big backyard that would allow them to expand and still have room in back for their three kids. The mortgage was a stretch. At his salary of $100,000 a year, the roughly $2,700 monthly payment represented 45 percent of his take-home pay. But, asLou says, "at that time, I was imagining an ever-increasing salary, ever-increasing stock options and all those wonderful things."
It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm sitting with Lou and Janet in the small living room of their white-shingled house on a quiet street talking about how they're managing. Lou was laid off in June 2001. At the time, he figured he'd be out three to six months tops. Twenty-two months later, he's still looking.
When G.D.P. growth resumed in the fourth quarter of 2001, Lou, like many economists, figured the worst was over. More than a year later, the unemployment picture for all workers remains bleak. Nationwide, more jobs were lost last February than in any single month since November 2001. We are in the worst hiring slump in 20 years.
Lou, at 43 a fit 5-foot-9 with a prominent nose and wiry dark hair that's quickly disappearing from the top of his head, sits on a couch next to me. Janet, who has long, straight red hair and hazel eyes, is in a chair across from us. She has made rugelach and coffee. Every 20 minutes or so she gets up to quiet their three kids, who are in an adjacent playroom littered with coloring books and Pokemon cards. Whenever she returns, she flashes Lou a smile.
Janet and Lou met through a ski club in 1989; Janet got a little drunk at lunch on a weekend trip to Vermont, and Lou, who was fresh out of Stanford, took care of her on the mountain. "I liked that Lou was active and that he wasn't judgmental at all," Janet says.
A year later they were married and living in an apartment in Middle Village, Queens. They saved up and bought a house on Long Island but were soon dreaming of moving to northern New Jersey, where most of their friends from Queens had ended up.
Now, the absence of tension between them is striking, especially given the dire state of the family finances. The Casagrandes ran through their long-term savings several months ago and are now well into the college funds -- accounts that Janet's father started for each child after birth. "That should last about another two to three months," Lou says. If he still hasn't landed a job by then, he and Janet will be forced to raid their 401(k).
The Summit house is their biggest source of both anxiety and comfort. They have considered downgrading to something smaller or perhaps even selling and renting. But their house is already pretty modest by Summit standards, and a rental big enough for the five of them isn't likely to cost much less than their mortgage. "With everything that the kids are already dealing with," Lou says, "we really don't want to move out of Summit."
The whole conversation is surprisingly matter-of-fact. Lou's job loss, it seems, has merely created a series of practical challenges.
"One of the first things we did," Janet says, "is cut off the kids' allowances" -- a savings of $6 a week. The Casagrandes also registered all three children for a state-subsidized school lunch program. 
When Lou's unemployment benefits, which came to $890 every two weeks, expired last summer -- they had already been extended twice, once by the federal government and once by the state of New Jersey -- he put up fliers around town advertising his software-installation services. He has had six clients for a total of about 20 hours, less than $1,000. 
Last fall, Lou started substitute teaching. The pay is $90 a day, but work is sporadic, particularly because Lou is limited to the Summit schools by the fact that the Casagrandes are down to one car, a 1995 Subaru. Their second car would not have passed its 2001 inspection without repairwork they couldn't afford, so they gave it away and took the tax deduction instead.
Lou has also been teaching a spinning class at the local Y.M.C.A. for several months now. At $12 an hour, the money isn't great, but as a part-time employee of the Y, he only pays $100 a year for a family membership. There's another hidden benefit, too. "Believe it or not," he says, "being in front of the group keeps up my confidence in my ability to make the kinds of corporate presentations I've made in the past and that I anticipate making again in the future."
A light snow is falling on the Wednesday evening when I go to pick up Lou's wife, Janet, from the Starbucks in a strip mall in Florham Park, N.J. In addition to teaching at a Montessori preschool, Janet now makes lattes. She's one of four women at her Starbucks alone who are working there because their husbands have been laid off. The appeal is obvious: though the pay is just $8 an hour, she needs to log only 20 hours a week to qualify for the company's health-care plan. The Casagrandes, a family of five, pay just $220 a month; Lou's Cobra, which would have expired by now anyway, was costing them close to $800.
Janet has become adept at spotting nametags of companies that might make an appropriate employer for her husband. A few minutes after I arrive, she points out a small table of professionals. "They come in every day at 5," she tells me as she looks around for a particularly successful-looking middle-aged businessman who recently joined the group. "I haven't had the right moment yet to approach him about Lou," she says, "but I will." 
Matthew, their middle son, just turned 8, and Janet tells me that he wanted a party, even if it had to be small. Janet's parents sent enough money for him to invite eight friends. Janet baked cupcakes with frosting in the shape of cobwebs and found a few Spider-Man-themed games on the Internet that they could play with string and paper plates. They had enough cash left over from the money Lou's parents gave them for the children's Christmas presents to buy Matthew a $20 skateboard.
Janet has been anything but shy about asking for help. She persuaded the Y to waive the extra fee for the kids' weekly karate class, and her most recent coup was getting the local Girl Scouts chapter to excuse Leah, who is 10, from paying $185 to go on a camping trip to the Poconos.
On occasion, help arrives unsolicited. This past Christmas, Janet's Montessori school made a donation to the Casagrande family rather than to a charity, the school's usual custom. And for a period of about six months, Lou and Janet were receiving $20 in cash in the mail every so often in an envelope without a return address. "I think it was one of the college girls who used to work at Starbucks with me," Janet says, "but she's gone now, and I was never able to be sure." 
A couple of weeks ago, Janet tells me later as we pull into the parking lot of the Y to meet Lou, Matthew asked her to cut his hair.
"Don't you want to go the barber?" Janet asked.
"But we can save money if you do it," Matthew answered.
Tom Pyle has the kind of background that's supposed to prevent this sort of thing from happening. Hotchkiss, Princeton, Harvard Business School -- he was, as he puts it, "programmed to be a world-beater."
A trim, compact man of 50 with a thin wisp of hair near the front of his otherwise smooth head, Tom is very much a creature of the old economy. Even without an office, he wears Brooks Brothers and Burberrys and carries a suitably distressed leather briefcase wherever he goes. He speaks thoughtfully and deliberately and often clasps his hands together, interlacing his fingers, when he's making a point.
During the late 90's, Tom took the 5:57 a.m. from Princeton Junction to Penn Station and went to work as a financial director at a Swedish bank, where he earned about $200,000 a year. He paid off the mortgage on his four-bedroom ranch house in Princeton, socked away enough money to send both of his children to the private college of their choosing, gave his wife whatever money she needed to run the household and invested the rest in the stock market. If anyone had safeguarded himself against the vagaries of the future, it was Tom Pyle.
At the end of 2001, Tom took a position as the director of development at the United States Rowing Association. The $100,000 (including incentives) salary was low, but Tom considered it a long-term investment. Banking was a young man's game; he could grow old in the nonprofit sector. 
Unlike most out-of-work professionals, who watched anxiously as their employers' flow of business slowed to a trickle, Tom never saw it coming. Six months after he started -- and three nights after his boss had taken him out to dinner to tell him how well everything was going -- a major sponsor abruptly withdrew its financing. For the first time in his life, Tom was terminated.
"I was stunned," he tells me one evening last month. We're sitting at the Pyles' kitchen table in Princeton as Tom's wife, Molly, dishes out chicken curry, rice and salad, all of which was prepared and ready to serve when I arrived. Molly is Chinese but grew up in London. When she entered her 20's, her father sent her back home to Singapore in the hope that she'd marry a Chinese man. Instead, she married Tom, who was working in Asia at the time. She has been a stay-at-home mom -- in her words, "a spoiled banker's wife" -- ever since. 
After we begin eating, the Pyles' 17-year-old son, Adam, a stringy senior at Princeton High with dark eyes and a thick shock of black hair, silently stalks in. As he shovels down a plate full of curry, his father explains that I'm writing an article about executives in transition. Adam refills, eats a second plate clean and then excuses himself without uttering a word. 
The scene is reassuringly timeless. The weeknight dinner in the snow-encrusted suburbs, complete with the brooding teenager, the well-organized mother and the father in a starched button-down. The difference tonight, and every night for nearly a year, is that the father hasn't just returned home from a hard day at work.
That's likely to be the case for the foreseeable future. As James Parrott, the chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit economic-policy group, says, "There's no rebound in sight, and there aren't even the glimmers of developments that would lead you to predict a rebound." That the current situation in Iraq has been accompanied by fears of a terrorist attack on New York and other cities has only further darkened the employment horizon. 
"I love traveling, and I don't do that anymore," Molly tells me, "and for groceries, I go to Sam's Club instead of the local market, which is very expensive." She hasn't bought any new clothing in months, or at least nothing that she didn't guiltily return the next day. "I'm thinking about working," she says. "I never thought I'd work in America."
This last suggestion clearly irks Tom. "She says that because she feels that things are worse than they really are," he says.
With the house paid off and the college tuitions protected, the Pyles are by no means in financial distress. Still, as Tom puts it a few minutes later: "Economic reality is not the rev.final arbiter of domestic tranquillity."
It soon becomes clear that one of the biggest obstacles to domestic tranquillity is proximity. 
"It's terrible," Molly says. "My husband is always in the house."
Seemingly a bit surprised by his wife's bluntness, Tom tries to soften the edge. "The traditional rhythm is that it's her abode," he says.
Tom hasn't adjusted to being around the house so much himself. "I'm not used to being on demand to solve family problems," he says. 
He's also not used to having his wife look over his shoulder as he does his job -- which, in this case, is looking for a job, a task Tom approaches with considerable gusto, obsessively checking job postings, going on informational interviews, making networking phone calls.
To Molly, those phone calls can sound suspiciously like personal calls, which she doesn't hesitate to tell him. She also remains unconvinced that his various networking meetings -- he goes to an average of two a week -- are helping the cause much, and when she learned how much Tom was paying a career counselor, she urged him to stop. He reluctantly conceded, although he was only partway through the program. "Spouses," Tom tells me later with an affectionate half-grin, "should not run job campaigns. They're not good advisers."
While there's no good time to lose your job, Tom's timing was especially bad: it happened the same month that their investment manager incorrectly predicted that the market had bottomed out. Molly, who'd never had any reason to examine the portfolio in the past, learned about this unfortunate event when she went to draw some money from the account for basic household items -- things that Tom's regular paychecks had always covered. She didn't sleep for weeks afterward. 
"We lost a lot of money in the stock market," Molly says. "A lot."
"It's a matter of perception," says Tom. "Everybody took a big hit."
"Excuse me," says Molly, getting up to serve us seconds, "but I do know how much money we lost."
It's a conversation that has no doubt played itself out at countless dinner tables across the country over the past two years. Tom's right; except for a very lucky few, everyone has taken a big hit. Still, he's in an impossible position. From his conciliatory tone it's clear that he doesn't want to continue the argument. At the same time, he knows that if he can bring her around to his way of thinking, she might actually feel less anxious.
Later, when Tom and I are alone, he tries to put the discussion into context. He doesn't resent Molly for getting so worked up; on the contrary, he feels guilty. "She wants stability and certainty, which every woman deserves," he says. "She held up her end of the deal, taking care of the house and kids, and she deserves a good life from here on out."
Only twice in two years has Lou Casagrande felt he was even close to getting a job. Once, a little less than a year ago, he was confident enough to take his wife and kids out to a Chinese restaurant for chicken and cashews to celebrate, their first family dinner out since he'd been laid off. Then the prospective employer, which does scientific product development for the semiconductor industry, fell on hard times. Not only did the offer fail to materialize; Lou never heard from the company again. 
When Lou first lost his job, his plan was to get into investment banking, probably as an analyst, and he had a few friends from Brown helping him out. Then came Sept. 11. With the prospects on Wall Street looking dimmer than ever, Lou decided to refocus his search on pharmaceutical companies. But the fact that his Ph.D. was in physical chemistry, not organic, proved too much of a liability even to getting his foot in the door.
Now, in order to keep himself circulating, Lou, like so many of the white-collar unemployed, goes to networking meetings. Every Monday night he commutes into Manhattan for the weekly gathering of a career-counseling group called the Five O'Clock Club. On the third floor of a Helmsley hotel, he joins dozens of others, a number of whom earned six-figure salaries in their last jobs. For someone at Lou's salary level -- or previous salary level, anyway -- a package of 10 sessions costs $600. (He re-upped after running through his initial 10 and is now what's known as "an advanced member.")
One night recently, Lou attended a monthly mixer sponsored by an online networking group called Ryze.com. Pronounced "rise," the group describes its mission as "helping each other 'rise up."' Basic membership is free; a "Gold" membership, which entitles you to discounts at mixers and an early peek at the bios of those who are planning to attend, is $9.95 a month.
Lou, a basic member for the moment, pays $10 at the door of the Chateau, a dark, smoky lounge in the West Village that Ryze.com has rented for the evening. Once inside, he is given a thin strip of paper with thumbnail-size head shots and minibiographies of four randomly selected people whom he is supposed to seek out and meet over the course of the night, an icebreaker for those who require an excuse to approach a total stranger. Lou is shy by nature and uncomfortable with the idea of self-promotion -- "I was always taught to let your work speak for itself," he says -- but he has been out of work for too long to need any pushing. He stuffs the dance card in his pocket and begins to network. He's the only man in the room wearing a tie.
Over the next two hours Lou meets two self-employed Web designers who want to design his Web page, a video producer who creates two-minute CD-ROM video resumes of job applicants for $1,000 and a man named David Schmier, the head of a career-counseling firm called GetHired.com.
"If you want to learn a language, you go to Berlitz," Schmier tells Lou. "If you want to ace your LSAT's, you go to Kaplan. If you want to find a job, you come to us." Schmier extends his hand.
Like a sprawling refugee camp, the land of the unemployed has spawned a whole new economy. Resume-writing services will punch up your resume; resume-blasting services will send it on to thousands of companies. Even Monster.com, the closest thing to an Elysian fields for the jobless, benefits from people looking for -- not finding -- jobs. The company's revenue model is based on their advertising space, which is considered valuable because surfers post their resumes and then click on them compulsively to see if any potential employers have checked them out.
And then there are people like Schmier, who was laid off last May as the director of interactive marketing for AOL. Now, like seemingly half the people in this room, he is trying his hand at selling services to the unemployed. "GetHired," he explains, "is not a career-counseling firm; it's a job-finding system."
Schmier starts by laying out his networking philosophy for Lou. "If I'm trying to get a meeting with someone, I don't tell him I'm planning to hit him up for job leads," he says. "I go out of my way to tell him that I'm not going to. After the meeting," Schmier continues, "I'll send him something, like an extra ticket to a trade show. A couple weeks later I'll send him something else, maybe a book that's relevant to his work -- not a new copy, but one I've spilled some coffee on, dogeared and underlined." 
It sounds a lot like dating advice from Mike Damone in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
Schmier waits a beat and then looks right at Lou. "When I call you again, are you gonna take my call?" he asks rhetorically.
Leaning in a little closer, he proclaims: "Be a giver, not a taker. Be a matcher, not a seller." Then he says: "How do you match yourself with a company? By learning its tribal symbols and presenting yourself as a member of the tribe."
He proceeds to illustrate this point by telling the story of how he was hired at AOL, an approach that could probably get someone arrested today. Schmier started by hanging around outside the company's headquarters eavesdropping on the smokers, then somehow scamming his way into the building in order to get a look at how the people in the department he wanted to work in dressed. Later, he set up shop at a nearby cafe, where he could chat up AOL staffers. By the time his interview rolled around, he looked and sounded as if he already worked at the company. He was, as he puts it, "a member of the tribe." Lou smiles.
A few minutes later, when Schmier hears that Lou might be included in a magazine article, he offers to waive the $159 fee for his all-day seminar. Lou enthusiastically accepts.
In a sense, he can't afford not to. After two years of unemployment, dozens of career-counseling sessions and networking events, countless hours of research and still no job offers, who is Lou to say that David Schmier might not be the man with the key to the code?
On a bitter cold night in early March, Tom Pyle and I are in his black Passat, speeding toward a FENG -- Financial Executives Networking Group -- meeting in a public library in Princeton Junction, N.J.
Networking. No single word -- not "position," not "salary," not even "unemployment" -- so permeates the conversations of today's job hunters. Whether you're a former executive for Tyco Electronics in Harrisburg, Pa., or an out-of-work Madison Avenue ad exec, there's a networking group for you. In addition to FENG, there's MENG for marketers, TENG for tech guys and SENG for "strategic" executives (whatever that is). As the recession continues to eat away at jobs, these groups continue to multiply and expand.
Tom is the founder and head of the local branch of FENG. In 1997, when the group was in its infancy, it had 53 members. Today FENG has more than 14,000 members -- or "colleagues," as they refer to one another -- with chapters all over the country. Tom also belongs to ExecuNet, which charges $399 a year and is open to all executives who earned in excess of $100,000, and IERG, the International Executive Resources Group. To "cross-pollinate" with people in other industries, he joined the New Jersey Senior Executives Networking Group and the Greater Philadelphia Senior Executives Networking Group. Tom has also created his own board -- a handful of friends, neighbors and former colleagues -- to whom he reports regularly on his job search.
It seems safe to assume that Tom has already hit up his classmates from Harvard Business School, and I ask whether they've been helpful. 
"I actually haven't called any of them yet," Tom says.
He explains that because he's looking into several different avenues -- nonprofits, banking, even possibly teaching -- he's concerned about projecting "a clean image to the marketplace."
Seconds later, however, he realizes that this doesn't sound very convincing. "I suppose I have a twinge of inhibition," he sighs.
"Why?" 
Tom stops to think for a moment. 
"I'm not sure I can answer that," he rev.finally says.
Another long pause follows. "You're not just invested in the expectations you have of yourself; you're invested in the expectations other people have of you," he says, pulling into the parking lot of the library. "We're all worried that the people we respect will say, 'Oh, gee, he's not really up to it, is he?"'
Tom takes a seat at the head table and before long, 30 people have crowded into the small conference room. All but three are men. Most are middle-aged, and more than a few are overweight; bellies strain against casual Friday attire.
One after another, the FENGers give their "elevator speeches," so called because they need to be short enough to deliver in an elevator. Three-quarters of them are out-of-work C.F.O.'s, C.P.A.'s or former vice presidents of finance who say they are looking for a position at a small- to medium-size company in the tristate area. Tom listens attentively as he spins his Mont Blanc pen between his fingers, the chairman presiding at his board meeting. When each person finishes his or her speech, Tom skillfully pares it down to a sentence or two and asks if anyone has any thoughts.
The idea is that one of their FENG colleagues will have a relevant contact -- or better yet, a job lead. FENG, like many networking groups, expect members to provide three fresh leads -- leads that haven't been plastered all over the Internet -- a month. As counterintuitive as it sounds, there's a theory behind it. In this economy, the thinking goes, the odds of getting a specific job are so slim that a lead is worth more as a trade good with which you can buy goodwill. It's an interesting, if not entirely persuasive, argument. But these groups serve another purpose that's beyond dispute: in a world in which job listings are posted on the Internet, company research is done online and the very idea of going to the post office to mail off resumes is as quaintly dated as sealing wax, they provide an antidote to the isolation of the job search.
This becomes abundantly clear after the meeting, when an accountant who has been out of work since December 1999 introduces himself to me. He's currently supporting himself -- and his wife -- with what's left of a diminishing 401(k). "Thank God for groups like this," he says before I even get a chance to ask. "At least you get emotional support. You can't get that at home."
"What do you get at home?" I venture.
"You get the attitude, 'Why don't you have a job yet?"'
Back in the car, Tom confides that he may soon pass the torch at FENG. "I have an emotional investment in this group," he says, "but it might be time to find someone else to run it." 
He enjoys seeing the fellows (as he puts it), and like Lou with his spinning classes, presiding over FENG meetings keeps Tom in shape for his re-entry into the corporate world. As the one-year anniversary of his unemployment approaches, however, he seems increasingly aware of the danger of allowing these meetings to become a surrogate job. While it may be more comfortable -- and comforting -- to network regularly with the same group of unemployed men, the practical returns, arguably limited from the beginning, diminish with each passing week. 
A few minutes after finishing up his shift at the Gap one evening in late January, Jeff wraps his ectomorphic frame in an enormous tan parka and walks over to a loud, overpriced hotel bar in Midtown to meet me for drinks. Jeff empties the bowl of peanuts in front of us, one manic fistful after the next, tilts his shaved head toward me and begins to trace the arc of his unemployment.
After he lost his job, his severance package included several months of outplacement services -- basically a free office he could use, along with a small support staff and a career counselor to help him make the transition to his next job. It was there, among lead counsels and C.F.O.'s -- "Guys who were way up there," Jeff says -- that it started to dawn on him that he might be out longer than he anticipated.
Jeff's outplacement proved to be little more than a halfway house between full-time employment and full-time unemployment. In November 2001, six months after being let go, he filed for personal bankruptcy protection. Despite his considerable salary, he'd racked up $100,000 in consumer debt over the past few years -- mostly credit-card advances for an online business he was developing. Making the interest payments had never been a problem, and he figured there would be plenty of time to round up investors later.
His job search, admittedly halfhearted as it was, was going nowhere. The metaphor Jeff uses to describe his situation involves his father, the revered sportswriter Charles Einstein. "When my dad retired from newspapering after a lifetime of service," Jeff says, "the Baseball Writers Association gave him a gold-plated press pass that would admit him to any ballpark in the country. The only problem was that no ballpark attendant knew what it was. For all practical purposes, the press pass was useless. That's how I felt about my resume."
Jeff tells me that he could see the resentment building in his wife. "What I missed most is how Mara would shout 'Hooray!' when I came home from a long day," he says. "She was just so happy to see me that she reacted like a child. It was a validation of everything: I'd been a good breadwinner, and I had a beautiful wife and daughter."
While Lou seems not to have internalized his fall from the ranks of the upper middle class, Jeff has been positively consumed by his downward trajectory. As Lou pedaled away on his stationary bike at the local Y and Tom zoomed off to his various networking meetings, Jeff sat home and ruminated on the difference between guilt and shame. "Shame is much more existential. It's about who or what you are or what you are not," he says as our third round of gin and tonics arrives. "I felt guilty about losing my job and shame about not being able to support my family."
Jeff was surprised at how intertwined his self-esteem and professional identity were, but the undergirding sensation -- that he was a fraud -- was familiar. He'd never finished college, and the fact that his only professional achievements had come in the illusory world of new media heightened his insecurity.
Mara eventually confronted Jeff in couples' therapy. "She told me to be a man," he says, "to do what I had to do to support my family." But the message still wasn't getting through.
Then came Mara's ultimatum to throw him out if he didn't get some sort of job. In that instant, everything changed. "It hit me like a flash of blinding light," Jeff recalls. "Things had run their course. I had hit rock bottom. It was like I was addicted to an old lifestyle. I had to make a decision to start over as someone new."
So last November, Jeff took the E train from Forest Hills to 53rd Street and walked along Fifth Avenue, leaving a copy of his resume in every store he passed. A week later he was offered the holiday position at the Gap, his first job on the clock since 1977, when he worked at a bookstore. Jeff took the subway to the apartment of a friend, another unemployed new media executive, to call Mara and tell her the news. As they spoke, she kept apologizing; she couldn't stop crying.
Still, learning to live with Jeff's new job has been complicated for Mara. Thrilled as she is that he's out of the house and working again, telling friends has been difficult. "It definitely stuck in my throat the first few times," she told me. "Whenever I mentioned to anyone that Jeff's working at the Gap, they'd say: 'Oh, really? What's he doing there?"'
It's clear, when hanging out with Jeff, why he was so much in demand during the Internet boom. He speaks in streams of abstract ideas about management systems and modern living that I can barely keep up with. ("When frozen food and TV got together, the dinner table disappeared," he says, expounding on a theory he has about improving one's quality of life. "The first casualty of technology is ritual.") There's a visionary's lunacy to Jeff's intensity, but once I'm able to parse what he's saying, it's all very rational, methodical even. 
So I'm not surprised when he says he's been working on a proposal for the Gap on how it can use the Internet to build and nurture long-term relationships with its customers. The five-page initiative includes a short pitch for why he's the right man for the job: "False modesty aside, my 18-plus years of senior digital marketing experience will likely surpass the aggregate digital experience of the top three individuals in any given interactive marketing agency or consultancy. Translation: substantially more bang for your interactive marketing buck."
For Jeff, those 18-plus years endure as new-media muscle memory. Starting over as someone new may not be possible. 
The Gethired.com seminar that Lou learned about at the Ryze.com mixer begins at 8:30 on a bleary Saturday morning. About 20 people in a small rented classroom on the West Side of Manhattan, including several familiar faces from the mixer.
Lou is already there when I arrive. He has decided that if he doesn't land a job by the spring, he's going to submit his application for a full-time job teaching high-school science in New Jersey. It's an idea he considered and rejected a year ago; at the time, it didn't seem possible that he'd be out of work much longer. This winter, however, he took the qualifying test. He aced it.
Yet even as Lou makes plans to start a new, less lucrative career, dreams that he had for himself just a few years ago, in the flush of the 90's, remain imprinted on his imagination.
At one point during the seminar, Schmier, who is much more sympathetic in the role of career coach than career-services salesman, instructs everyone to write down where, ideally, he'd like to be in 10 years. When he asks for a volunteer to read his out loud, Lou raises his hand. He envisions himself in Denver or San Francisco -- near good skiing and cycling -- as the chief technology officer of a large company at an annual salary of $1 million.
Wearing a belted tan trench coat over a navy suit, a white shirt with monogrammed gold cuff links and a perfectly knotted silk tie, Tom has come to the old Board of Education building in Brooklyn on a Thursday evening for an informational meeting about the New York City Teaching Fellows Program. Like Lou, he's toying with the idea of becoming a teacher, one of the few sectors where jobs are still available. 
The program lasts two years and pays about $40,000 a year. Fellows are placed wherever they're needed, which means that the vast majority wind up in the Bronx or Central Brooklyn. 
An ad on the subway for the program -- "You remember the name of your first-grade teacher. Who will remember yours?" -- got Tom thinking. "When I'm on my deathbed at 84," he asks rhetorically, "will my children be proud of what I did?"
During the session, a first-year fellow who teaches math to eighth graders in Bushwick tells the group that he spends most of his time disciplining his kids. When one student became violent, he says, he had to call the police on his cellphone.
Nevertheless, afterward, Tom sounds very excited about the prospect of becoming a fellow. A practicing Catholic, he sees teaching in the inner city as a sort of secular priesthood and imagines telling his students, "My mission is to make you world-beaters -- and I've got the background to do it." He's even thinking that he could incorporate himself as a 501(c)3, in order to solicit donations for state-of-the-art classroom supplies.
In terms of making it work financially, Tom figures he can sell the house, "reconfigure the fleet" (i.e., get rid of at least one of the family's three cars) and reposition the stock portfolio to produce more than $25,000 a year in interest income.
This would obviously be a big departure from his life in Princeton, and I ask Tom what brought him to it. He pauses for a second to think, then floats one idea: "Rejection. My fancy credentials don't seem to be resonating. Maybe that life isn't my calling after all."
A few minutes later, before he heads off to catch his train back home to Princeton, another possibility emerges. Tom is tired of the job search -- tired of going to one networking meeting after another, of seeing the same faces, of hearing the same speeches. "I'm looking for a conclusion here," he says. "I would like to get this thing resolved so I can rebuild my identity and get on with my life."

HEADLINE: The Next Resolution 

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub, a contributing writer for The Times Magazine, has reported often from the United Nations.

 BODY:
In the upper floors of the United Nations Secretariat Building, where the organization's chief policy makers roost, the collapse of the tortured negotiations over a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, and the subsequent decision of the United States and its allies to go to war nevertheless, has provoked a sense of deja vu. When I asked Shashi Tharoor, the under secretary general for communications and a U.N. lifer, whether he feared that the body was about to become irrelevant, as President Bush and other administration officials have threatened, he said: "We've been here before. Look at Suez in 1956, look at the Congo in the early 60's, look at Kosovo in 1999" -- all cases in which the Security Council was hamstrung by disagreements among the great powers, all accompanied by dire predictions about the body's future. "We've seen too many special cases," Tharoor went on, "and we know that it would be premature to write our own obituary." 
 It would be premature -- but only in the sense that many gravely ill patients do not die. In none of those previous cases did the United States feel its own vital interests were involved; in none did it suffer so public a rebuke. And so Iraq will probably not go down as just another "special case." While a debate has begun on the role of the U.N. in postwar Iraq, formulas for replacing or marginalizing the U.N. are circulating around the conservative policy circles that first drew up the case for war in Iraq in the late 90's. And the Bush administration, should it take its war on terror to other "rogue" or "evil" regimes beyond Iraq, is plainly prepared to dispense with the legitimacy conferred by a Security Council resolution. 
 The United States is not about to withdraw from the U.N. or ask the organization to leave New York for Paris or Brussels. But it is ready to take its problems elsewhere. David Malone, the head of the International Peace Academy and one of the U.N.'s most thoughtful and dispassionate observers, says, "The Security Council has probably been fatally wounded in terms of its centrality to the U.S. on the use of force around the world, though it will continue to be useful to Washington for the management of conflicts on which the U.S. does not wish to lead but on which it wishes to be seen to be engaged." The diplomats of Turtle Bay, he says, "don't fully comprehend the extent of the train wreck in which the Security Council has been involved."
The U.N. was a euphoric place in November, when, after two months of hairsplitting negotiation, all 15 members of the Security Council signed Resolution 1441, authorizing a toughened inspections regime in Iraq. Only twice in its 57-year history had the council managed to solve the most fateful issues of war and peace -- in 1950, when the council authorized war in Korea (while the Soviet Union was staging a boycott of the body), and in late 1990, before the first war against Iraq. The mere fact that the Bush administration even came to the council last fall was seen as proof of how very valuable a coin the U.N.'s legitimacy remained. The press attention was positively enthralling; seasoned U.N. professionals say that they had never seen so many media trucks parked out at First Avenue and 46th Street. 
The trucks are gone now, and the U.N. officials and Security Council delegates who seemed at the center of things just weeks ago now have all the time in the world to think about what went wrong. Many of the officials and delegates I spoke with said that the United States could have got its way had it behaved with greater regard for the U.N. and for the niceties of multilateralism. One U.N. political professional said to me that the debate became a referendum not on the means of disarming Iraq but on the American use of power: "The members ended up feeling that they had to stand up to American unilateralism." I tried out this theory on Juan Gabriel Valdes, the ambassador from Chile, a pivotal member of the 10 "nonpermanent" members of the council during the Iraq debate. Valdes blamed the French for eliminating the possibility of a common ground, but also the Bush administration for what he called a "double discourse." There was, he said, "a discourse here that gave a lot of importance to the U.N., and there was a discourse in the papers based on statements from nonidentified authorities in Washington who indicated that the U.N. was just a formal and somewhat cumbersome procedure that had to be followed, but that wouldn't change the fact and the direction of American decisions." Valdes did not appreciate being asked to serve as a rubber stamp. 
What was paramount for Valdes -- and for the Security Council as a whole -- was the preservation of the process of debate and decision. What was paramount for the Bush administration, however, was the outcome -- the disarmament of Iraq, by whatever means necessary. It may well be that an administration more inclined to play with others would have carried the day; but even a President Al Gore might well have defied the will of the council, as President Bush did, rather than accepting the consequences of his failure to win council approval. 
President Jacques Chirac of France threatened to veto any resolution authorizing hostilities; the French argued (and continue to argue) that the inspections process could have led to disarmament given more time. At the council, the United States never succeeded in overcoming this claim, in large part because Hans Blix, the imperturbable and ever-so-slightly impish Swede who headed the inspection team, continued to give it credence. I visited Blix in his office recently to see whether retrospection had altered his views. Not long before, he lived at the eye of a hurricane; now he receives visitors at his leisure. Blix insisted he still does not know whether the Iraqi cooperation to which he testified before the council was, in his words, "genuine" or was "designed to create illusions." I asked whether he believed that the issue could have been resolved if he had been given another three months, as he wished. "I think it's unlikely this wouldhave come to any bottom of the barrel," he said with his habitual caution, "because if they didn't have any anthrax, it's difficult to prove that there is none." And if they did? "With a very good tip, we would have come to it, and if you then had denial of access, it would have been decisive." Otherwise, he conceded, it would have been more stalemate. Blix says that one lesson he has learned is that "if you are faced with someone who has" chemical or biological weapons, "and who is determined to hide them, it is very difficult to get to the bottom of that barrel." 
What drove American officials crazy about Blix was his insistence on giving Saddam Hussein points for form -- for playing along with the inspections process even while frustrating its object. Blix says that he felt that it was important to preserve his prerogatives: "We being trustees of the Security Council have to at all times be careful about evidence, and not jump to conclusions." But he also seemed to be averting his eyes from the bottom of the barrel. Blix appeared to share the more or less consensual U.N. view that continued discussion is almost automatically preferable to fighting -- a view in which the belief in peace and the belief in process converge and war is always failure. 
But talk can also be a form of failure when war is unavoidable. As one U.S. official familiar with the Security Council discussions told me with some frustration, "People don't understand that we're at war." The events of 9/11 not only tilted American foreign policy in a strikingly martial direction; they also made Americans view the world very differently even from the way many of its chief allies do. "No other country has the global presence and responsibility and exposure that we do," as this official put it.
How, then, is the United States to continue operating in a body based on consensual decision-making? Despite the "we've been here before" rationale being voiced, many of the officials close to Secretary General Kofi Annan are acutely conscious of this situation, as is Annan himself. Mark Malloch Brown, who runs the United Nations Development Program, says: "We cannot continue after this crisis to believe that the world is the same. You've got to adjust your sights to reflect, or perhaps the word is 'respect,' the power of the United States." Edward Mortimer, Annan's chief speechwriter and an important adviser, says that the U.N. cannot simply dismiss the new American doctrine of pre-emptive warfare, though it is specifically prohibited by the U.N. Charter. The war in Iraq might come to be seen as the vindication of that doctrine, at least in carefully circumscribed cases. "The question," Mortimer says, "is 'What are the rules by which these decisions will be governed?' The Americans might not like to have any rules. But if you will agree that some rules are necessary, and that American exceptionalism cannot be the answer to all problems, then perhaps we can make headway on this problem." 
Perhaps, in other words, the Security Council can play a role in defining the new generation of threats to international peace and security, as it played a role in defining the threats of civil war and genocide in the 90's. Of course, it did a much better job of defining those threats than of countering them. 
Many conservatives -- and not only conservatives -- took the position last September that the Security Council was a quagmire to be skirted, not a legitimizing body to be courted. The collapse of negotiations vindicated their position and undercut those who had argued for the U.N. route, most notably Secretary of State Colin Powell and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. As policy makers and theorists begin to think about the architecture of a post-Iraq world, speculation about alternatives to the U.N. has begun to flourish. Writing in The Weekly Standard, arguably the most influential opinion journal at the White House, the computer scientist and essayist David Gelernter suggested that the U.N.'s flaws were "woven in, not printed on." What's more, he declared, any organization that gave the French a veto over American actions was not to be countenanced. Gelernter proposed instead a new organization -- the "Big Three" -- consisting of the U.S., Britain and Russia. (Anti-Iraq-war Russia earns a spot to preclude a possible imputation of Anglophone hegemony.) Gelernter also suggested that "democracies or aspiring democracies" could apply to be "junior members" so long as they spent enough money on defense. He did not make it clear whether this might include the French.
There is no lack of other formulations. An article in the old-line conservative National Review proposed an English-speaking condominium -- no concessions wasted on the Russians here -- to be known as the Anglosphere. A more common approach calls for the creation of not-yet-dreamed-of regional alliances. Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a "liberal imperialist," to use one term that advocates of this view have applied to themselves, suggests an Asian NATO, for example, which could bind South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and the United States -- and pointedly exclude China. Or a new version of the old Baghdad Pact assembled by Great Britain in the 50's might unite Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and the sheikdoms with the U.S. The appeal of such groupings is that the United States would be able to pursue its interests in concert with nations whose interests converge with ours, and thus ward off accusations of unilateralism. Our "partners" would in fact be patsies, and thus pose no threat to our interests. Boot himself unabashedly describes the proposed alliances as "a pathetic attempt to disguise American pre-eminence." 
Candor is, of course, always refreshing. And perhaps we should say that the willingness to speak in such stunningly neocolonial language is powerful proof of American pre-eminence; such is our might that we need not dissimulate our will to supremacy. It is a symptom as well of a rampant sense of moral superiority that our go-it-alone war in Iraq will only enhance, unless it somehow, close to endgame, goes very badly astray. Lawrence Kaplan, author, with William Kristol, of "The War Over Iraq," says, "We've begun to think of ourselves as a more trustworthy universal arbiter than the U.N. itself." Kaplan considers this good, not bad.
Other nations, of course, might regard such new alliances of convenience as self-discrediting. As David Malone of the International Peace Academy says, "Unless the United States is prepared to contribute to the solution of the problems of other regions and countries, those regions and countries will not long line up to serve Washington's purposes." In other words, what happened in the Security Council would recur in a new setting, sending us in search of new and yet more docile patsies.
The whole instant-alliance idea -- finding "partners" where we need them when we need them -- seems faintly preposterous. But it is good to remember that the idea of invading Iraq -- and doing so unilaterally, if necessary -- seemed outlandish when a group of foreign-policy intellectuals and former officeholders proposed it in a letter to President Clinton in early 1998. The group, organized as the Project for the New American Century, included Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. A number of figures in the Bush National Security Council, as well as the State Department, are thinking about the question of a new international order. And the Project for the New American Century remains an important player in nascent discussions of a new architecture. Gary Schmitt, the project's director, observes that NATO might be a better instrument for American policy than the Security Council, as long as the organization abandons the requirement of consensus in favor of a "supermajority," thus preventing France and Germany from frustrating American designs.
Whether any of these institutions come into being, or are reformed to suit our purposes, there can be no question that this administration will be looking for alternative means of demonstrating that it has company in its foreign-policy ventures. The United States is already accustomed to "forum shopping," as when we sought the NATO aegis for the bombing of Kosovo in 1999. The new wrinkle in coming years is likely to be the ad hoc, rather than formal, alliance -- the "coalition of the willing." The Security Council has in the past authorized such coalitions to act, as it did with the largely Australian force that intervened in East Timor, also in 1999. But don't count on the United States' waiting for U.N. approval. 
There is a theory that the United States needs the U.N. as much as the other way around. As the one global actor, the U.S. has the greatest possible stake in the solution of global problems like AIDS, refugees and of course terrorism -- problems that require the mobilization of the whole world, and thus the engagement of the U.N. Ambassador Valdes of Chile says that he recites this mantra to himself all the time, even as he sees the U.S. drifting further from the U.N. Certainly the U.S. will continue to find the U.N. a useful forum for the solution, or at least the discussion, of all sorts of problems. The big question is whether these problems include first-order issues of peace and security.
At the moment, the U.N. is helplessly awaiting the next signal from Washington. That signal will involve the reconstruction of Iraq, should the coalition forces ultimately succeed in ousting Saddam and his regime. Before hostilities even began, Kofi Annan formed an "Iraq steering group," which produced a document laying out plans for a United Nations "assistance mission" in Iraq. U.N. professionals have more experience with nation-building than anyone else in the world, though with varying levels of success. No one in the secretariat expects, or for that matter wants, to hoist a U.N. flag over liberated Iraq. But Annan and his chief aides say they are hoping to play the same kind of role as the U.N. now does in Afghanistan, where Lakhdar Brahimi, a representative of the secretary general, helped shape the Afghan government and continues to adjudicate among the various parties as well as acting as a buffer between them and the American military.
The politics of this question are fierce. Tony Blair, desperate to restore his multilateral bona fides with his own citizens and with the leaders of other European nations, has lobbied for the largest possible U.N. role; Secretary Powell has also been pushing, though less strenuously. On the other hand, administration hawks, whose case has been strengthened by the council's failure to adopt a second resolution, are determined that the U.S. run Iraq by itself before handing off to Iraqis of its choosing after several months. The Pentagon is already assembling a government in waiting consisting of retired American diplomats and soldiers. Late last month, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, visited Annan to say that the administration was eager for the U.N. to play a role in Iraq, but that the role would be limited to humanitarian relief. A senior administration official parses the question as follows: "We're not looking at Afghanistan redux. I think we're looking at something more of a division of labor, where the coalition retains the security function, where the U.N. and international agencies assume a lead role on the humanitarian side and where there's a division of labor or a sharing of responsibility on the political and economic side among governments, the U.N. and, increasingly, Iraqis."
Beyond the reluctance of key Bush administration officials to give the U.N. a prominent role in any postwar Iraq, there is the question of just how the U.N. can authorize its own involvement. Any U.N. mission beyond humanitarian aid will require a Security Council resolution. The French and the Russians might block any new resolution implying "retroactive legitimation" of the war. And if the Bush administration sees a battle looming, it may sheer off altogether. 
The truth is, we are still figuring out what the U.N., and especially the Security Council, is for in the era of American hyper-puissance, as the French have it. It may very well be true that the United States simply does not need the United Nations anymore; you might say that it almost never has. The U.S. does, however, need other countries; and the other countries we need believe in the U.N. whether we do or not. As Richard Haass, the State Department's director of policy planning, puts it, "To the extent we need multilateralism, we're going to have to live with the reality that the U.N. will be the multilateral institution for just about everybody else." Then again, Haass is about to leave the Bush administration to become the head of the Council on Foreign Relations. He may not be leaving behind very many people who agree with him.

HEADLINE: The Disquieted American 

BYLINE:  By Kurt Andersen; Kurt Andersen is the author of the novel "Turn of the Century" and the host of the Public Radio International program "Studio 360."

 BODY:
I am not by nature an anxious person. But like everyone else who has lived in New York City for the last year and a half, I have spent plenty of time fretting. Sometimes the worries are fleeting and lurid and specific (a suicide bomber exploding as I turn east down 47th Street from Sixth Avenue, a radiological device in a panel truck detonating as I walk past the federal building in Foley Square), and sometimes they take the form of a more amorphous dread. I don't find the fear debilitating, but it is chronic and a little fatiguing. 
 During the ramp-up to the war in Iraq, I was even more acutely anxious, but I was also unusually . . . wide awake. I felt like a born-again citizen, interested in international affairs and national security and America's place in the world in a way I hadn't been since my McGovernite adolescence. These last months, I have spent more hours reading news articles with foreign datelines than during the previous 25 years combined. I am devouring books of a kind -- Bernard Lewis's "Crisis of Islam," Bob Woodward's "Bush at War," Kenneth M. Pollack's "Threatening Storm" -- that I would never have opened before. This new policy-wonkiness has surprised and, on occasion, embarrassed those around me. At a dinner party a little while ago, when a British novelist declared Israel's government morally equivalent to Iraq's, my counter, in its nuanced entirety, was a brief, sputtered declaration ending in a four-letter word. I had never in my life unleashed such anger on a stranger. 
 But I don't regret these outbursts. As someone generally given to excruciating ambivalenceon such matters, I have enjoyed the opportunities to feel strongly. And it has been a pleasure to watch members of a jaded chattering class occasionally engage, for a change, in serious, impassioned debate. New Yorkers' suddenly rampant contentiousness is the flip side of our rampant anxiety, of course, the yang to the yin. (Or two complementary yangs. Whatever.) If our local risk of terrorist retaliation is greater than average Americans' -- and who doubts that it is? -- don't our opinions about this war, pro and con, deserve a privileged standing? This is the consolation prize for New Yorkers, who are always predisposed to drama-queen self-importance: a new way in which we can feel singularly, dreadfully special.
So it was with oddly mingled relief and regret that as the president issued the final 48-hour ultimatum, I found myself heading far away from New York, on vacation with my wife and daughters. We had been planning the trip for more than a year. We had already bought the tickets and booked the rooms and read the guidebooks and got the inoculations, so despite the natural nervous impulse to hunker down, we decided to stick to our plans rather than postpone the trip until the girls' summer vacation. In our damn-the-torpedoes holiday fashion, we made the same choice as the Bush administration -- which had, in its own way, already bought the tickets, booked the rooms, read the guidebooks and got the inoculations and was dead set on going to Iraq this season, before the weather got too hot. 
By the time of our departure, the vacation itinerary was so thick with historical resonance as to seem almost like fate. At the start of the first big, transformative war of the 21st century, I spent three successive weeks in three countries against which America fought its big, transformative 20th-century wars: Japan, Vietnam and, if you count the cold war, China.
As we approached Tokyo, I looked west out the airplane window and wondered whether, in the event of an attack by a North Korean MIG, I would be able to register the sight of an air-to-air missile before it blew us up. I had just finished "The Threatening Storm," the book that nudged me from fretful, overinformed 50-50 fence-sitting to fretful, rueful 53 percent support of an Iraqi invasion. I had been on a plane when I started it, too, traveling from Los Angeles to New York in February. During that flight, my immersion in the unhappy minutiae of Iraqi history and U.N. weapons inspections had been interrupted by my seatmate, a stranger in her 30's taking full advantage of the free business-class wine. Somewhere over the Sierras, she looked up from the magazine she was reading and asked me, out of the blue, "Is Saddam Hussein's regime really 'unambiguously horrific'?"
It had been a year since I was last overseas flashing a passport, publicly declaring myself an American. I had flown to Paris a few months after Le Monde declared that "Nous Sommes Tous Americains," back when we were still being treated as lovable and indomitable (albeit oafish and faintly deserving) victims. Now, waiting in the FOREIGNERS line at Narita airport immigration during the countdown to Operation Iraqi Freedom, I was a little more circumspect than usual about advertising my nationality to a mob of foreign strangers. If it comes to it, I'm willing to defend regime change, but I know that to most people in the world all my careful liberal caveats would seem irrelevant. Nationality is destiny, I realize, especially right now, and especially when one is abroad. 
When I have visited Germany, I've noticed a kind of Third Reich newsreel running in my head, but I figured our stop in Japan would be a time out from ambient war thoughts. The first afternoon in Tokyo, though, in the Shitamachi Museum of everyday urban life, I was drawn to a display of World War II artifacts, including a hand-cranked World War II air-raid siren. My 13-year-old daughter whispered, "Do the Japanese hate us because we bombed them and beat them?" No, I explained, they don't. I didn't mention that her grandfather served in the Pacific from 1942 to 1944, trying to kill Japanese. Later, as we walked down Omotesando-dori past the Gap and J. Crew, KFC and McDonald's -- and, weirdly, Howard Baker, the American ambassador, idling in a souvenir shop called the Oriental Bazaar -- the only old buildings I noticed were a compound of low-rise modernist flats. They are, I was informed later, where some of the American occupation forces lived. American occupation forces: I am reminded, of course, of Iraq, and our prospective years of nation-building there. I wonder if a couple of decades hence, Baghdadis will be buying Starbucks grande lattes and Gap Easy Fit Jeans along Sadoun Street. 
As we headed out of Tokyo for our flight to Hanoi, we passed an antiwar march -- a literally pacific, very Japanese-seeming march: neat columns of people, orderly chanting, giant drums, long flowing banners of yellow fabric. 
Going to Vietnam would have provoked a frisson at any time, as it must for all Americans over 40. And flying into Hanoi, as opposed to Ho Chi Minh City (ne Saigon), made the sense of retro transgression still more piquant, since even in my Viet Cong-sympathizing antiwar heyday 30 years ago, I thought of North Vietnam as a dark, Stalinist, irredeemably enemy place: N.L.F. good, N.V.A. bad. What a rich historical reversal, then, to find that the security presence today in Hanoi is far more modest than in New York. In Vietnam, we heard no fighter jets patrolling the skies. We saw no police or troops with assault rifles posted at approaches to the city. Even the men guarding the American Embassy seemed relaxed.
Just as we touched down in Hanoi, the American bombardment of Iraq began. Chong, the young man who picked us up, told us unbidden during the drive from the airport that he was "for peace." It became clear that Chong assumed from my surname that I was from Denmark. I told him no, but he didn't understand, and I didn't try very hard to set him straight. Semi-apologetically but matter-of-factly, he pointed out the spot where some of the heaviest American B-52 bombing occurred in 1972 and where the American P.O.W.'s ("including the Senator John McCain") had been kept during the war. 
The next day, our tour guide, a university graduate called Liep, who made clear his enthusiasm for Vietnam's new free-market economy, also brought up the war -- the war in Iraq. "I hate Saddam Hussein," he volunteered, "but I worry about Iraqi people being bombed." He paused. "Like here, during the American war." I took a breath. I told him that I shared his concern about civilian death and injury and that I was hopeful that precisely targeted bombs would make for less of it. I said that in Vietnam in the 60's and 70's, American policy wasn't driven by self-defense or, in the end, by a concern for the welfare of the Vietnamese and that our policy in Iraq really is. Even as I made the argument, though, my distinction between then and now struck me as slightly lame. Unlike Saddam, I ventured, Ho Chi Minh was authentically devoted to his people, and that devotion was obviously reciprocated. We were passing near the long, long line outside Ho's mausoleum, where the great man's mummified corpse is on display. "I'll bet if Saddam Hussein's body were put on display in Baghdad, Iraqis wouldn't line up for an hour to pay their respects." Liep said nothing, so I ended my ad hoc "Wars of National Liberation: Vietnam Versus Iraq" symposium.
But then he asked me my age -- his way, I realized, of asking about my involvement in the war in Vietnam. I told him I turned 18 in 1972, the last year of the draft lottery, just before U.S. combat forces withdrew; I lucked out. Liep was born in 1970, and he said that American bombs falling in Hanoi are his hazy earliest memories. Thinking about that fact, I felt overwhelmingly inclined to cut him (and, for that matter, everyone else in Vietnam) considerable slack for any reflexive opposition they may feel to big, well-intentioned American wars for freedom against small, AK-47-armed countries halfway around the world. In the debates over this war, Vietnamese opinions, like New Yorkers' opinions, get extra credit. 
Back in the states, a good deal of antiwar sentiment had struck me as automatic, driven both by visceral antipathy to George Bush and his administration and, particularly among people my age, by chronic Vietnam syndrome. Before the war began, I mostly hadn't bought the Vietnam-Iraq analogy. But Hanoi nevertheless turned out to be a salutary backdrop for watching and thinking about this momentous and profoundly uncertain new epoch. As a (wary) supporter of this war, I found myself strangely pleased to be in a place where no American could possibly be complacent about a big U.S. military intervention -- in a country whose very name is synecdoche for military quagmire and governmental folly-cum-tragedy. 
Liep told us that the old-fashioned loudspeakers mounted on top of crude cinder-block posts all over Hanoi still broadcast government announcements and exhortations, but that people today consider them premodern artifacts and ignore the propaganda drone. Unlike when Liep was young, Vietnamese can now afford radios and can watch CNN; every morning in the tea shops, he said, the conversation is about America and Iraq. And though we were in a developing country half a world away from New York, I was just as connected as ever to the 24-hour media barrage: MSNBC, CNBC, the BBC World Service, Chinese news, Japanese news, German news, Italian news and French news. I had watched the Vietnam War on TV in America, and now I was watching the Iraq war on TV in Vietnam.
Of course, each country's beamed-in war coverage was freighted with its own biases, which were all the more apparent when seen from abroad. I was dumbstruck by a couple of smarmy, jocular, sportscasterish anchors on Fox News. The nerdy Japanese commentators seemed to spend all their air time pushing toy soldiers and tanks around a diorama of the Middle East. And the French news channel, which featured a bearded intellectual wearing dark glasses in the studio in Paris, was absurdly heavy on antiwar protests -- including a too-French-to-be-true video of a mime in whiteface lying down on a boulevard and pretending to be dead. Being overseas and being immersed in war news of a half-dozen different ideological flavors became a kind of family adventure in edutainment: for us parochial and solipsistic Americans, the idea of global interconnectedness seemed, at this moment in this place, a very real thing. At lunch in our (French-owned) hotel restaurant, my children and I joked about the freedom fries that came with the meal, and as we witnessed a French patron letting her bratty, dangerous 5-year-old misbehave all over the restaurant, I nicknamed the boy Quday.
But out on the streets of Hanoi, among the crowds of Vietnamese, my mood always defaulted to sobriety. I tried extra hard not to seem like an ugly American. I found myself gazing at the 50- and 60- and 70-year-old faces, the people who endured such unnecessary hell for so long. While Vietnam is beautiful and exotic and cheap, its allure as an American tourist stop is based on its nightmare past and our role, as Americans, in perpetuating that nightmare. My eagerness to visit had been partly ghoulish and partly a desire for some kind of absolution -- by my very presence to offer a tacit apology and receive tacit forgiveness. 
On the second day of the war in Iraq, we visited the Museum of the Revolution, whose exhibits chronicle successive Vietnamese struggles against the Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Americans and "the American-puppet machine." I forced myself to examine the dusty, grimy low-tech munitions we used to kill them and the even dustier, grimier lower-tech weapons they used to kill us. I felt sick looking at the photograph of U.S. soldiers posing with big grins next to Vietnamese corpses. The next morning, when I read newspaper articles about the insanely outgunned Iraqi fedayeen's surprising, sneaky, half-mad attacks against American troops along the road to Baghdad, I couldn't help thinking of the insanely outgunned Viet Cong 30 and 40 years ago. 
The next day we headed to an 18th-century Buddhist shrine, up a quiet river through a landscape that was the classic Asian ink-brush landscape painting come to life: abruptly vertical little limestone mountains covered in banyan trees and gray mists. We came abreast of another rowboat carrying a group of Vietnamese, Buddhist pilgrims. One of them asked Liep where we were from. America, he told them, and they continued staring as they chuckled and chatted among themselves in Vietnamese. We asked Liep what they were saying. He seemed reluctant to tell us. "They're talking about bin Laden," he said, "and your invasion of Iraq." 
Spending the war's first weeks in Tokyo, Hanoi and Shanghai was chastening, as it obliged me to think about the real and terrible human cost of war -- and about its unexpected resonances in other parts of the world -- but I didn't turn into a pacifist or even a dove. In my glass-half-full way, all those cities, freighted with so much anti-American history, left me groping toward a hopeful long view of our place in the world. "They must hate us here," my 13-year-old said as we wandered through the horrific war displays in Vietnamese museums. And you would think so: during our dozen years there, the United States killed and helped kill at least 1.5 million people. If anyone on earth has a right to hate America, it is their tens of millions of widows and children and friends. But the Museum of the Revolution is tatty, even by local standards, and lightly patronized; the inference is that the government is no longer highly invested in the war qua war. And as an American in Hanoi, you don't even get the sense that the citizens themselves hold a grudge, particularly. For decades they were brutalized by imperialism, but their politics and their view of their place in the world seem built on something other than victimhood.
Of course, it is easier to be magnanimous and forgiving when, like the Vietnamese, you win. This seems like a lesson that Americans, as we stand astride the world, could afford to learn. "We put the war behind us," said Liep, who has traveled in Europe, "and instead we focus on the future." Maybe George W. Bush, after we win the present war, can finally try to make good on his campaign promise to conduct a foreign policy driven by humility.
As I saw the shockingly large billboards for Western companies surrounding the airport in Hanoi and felt the city's go-go entrepreneurial mania, I thought,We lost the battle, but we won the war. The triumph of free-market economics in Vietnam and in China is inarguable. Both remain nominally Communist, and neither is a liberal democracy, but they are a lot freer in every sense than they were 30 years ago. Maybe the same will be said someday of Iraq. Maybe it is not Panglossian American fantasy to imagine that the citizens of Iraq and other Arab countries will someday regard us the way the citizens of Japan and Vietnam and China apparently do today: without love, but without loathing, either. 
Those glimmers of long-haul quasi optimism are hard to sustain, though. As we stepped through the jetway at J.F.K., a functionary handed us pamphlets warning that we might be infected with SARS. And on the drive home, as our progress on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway slowed and then stopped, our Haitian taxi driver explained that because of the orange alert, new security checks had turned this stretch of highway into a permanent traffic jam, 24/7. Just the day before, he told us, they had suddenly closed the bridge completely. "Life in New York," he said, with a kind of good-natured, declamatory shrug.

Hong Kong Tourism Battered by Outbreak

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
THE skyscrapers and the verdant hills ringing one of the world's loveliest natural harbors are still here, but most of the tourists have been scared off by an outbreak of the new and deadly disease called SARS, for severe acute respiratory syndrome. 
 Hong Kong had been banking on tourism to rescue it from years of economic stagnation as companies have moved to lower-cost cities in mainland China. Tourism accounts for nearly 6 percent of the economy here and had been expected to grow as many visa restrictions have been lifted on visits by mainlanders; a Disney theme park is under construction near the airport. 
 But those hopes have been dashed for the time being by the World Health Organization's decision on April 2 to urge travelers to postpone all but essential trips to Hong Kong and adjoining Guangdong Province in China. While the organization, a Geneva-based United Nations agency, said it would review its decision daily, and has not discouraged travelers from changing planes at international airports at either place, the move delivered a powerful blow to Hong Kong's image as a comfortable, Western-style metropolis in the heart of Asia. 
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta issued two similar warnings to Americans late last month. Taiwan and Singapore acted even earlier, warning their citizens against travel to Hong Kong on March 14, three days after a Hong Kong hospital said a mysterious disease was afflicting 20 staff members.
Popular Hong Kong destinations like Victoria Peak and Man Mo Temple are nearly deserted, as are restaurants and hotels. The Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok, once the fifth busiest in the world in terms of international passenger departures, has become a series of vast, sparsely occupied and nearly silent halls, where travelers in surgical masks moved quickly to and from gates while many shop clerks wore latex gloves as well as masks. 
Hong Kong's tourism industry depends most heavily this time of year on visitors from Southeast Asia, where many countries, notably Singapore, have long school vacations in April. With Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand issuing frequent warnings against travel to Hong Kong, the number of visitors from these places quickly dropped by more than 80 percent, compared with a year ago, said Joseph Tung, the executive director of the Hong Kong Travel Industry Council, which represents 1,350 travel agents. 
Hong Kong has also depended increasingly in the last two years on tourists from mainland China, whose numbers jumped by more than 40 percent last year after Beijing removed many visa restrictions and authorized several hundred travel agencies to organize group tours here.
Last year the number of American visitors exceeded a million for the first time, a 7 percent increase over the previous year, representing 6 percent of all arrivals in Hong Kong. 
Richard Willis, the vice chairman of the separate Hong Kong Association of Travel Agents, said that the group had been advising members to keep tour buses clean and allow extra time at stops for travelers to visit restrooms and wash their hands.
The Hong Kong Tourism Board has followed the example of airlines after plane crashes in halting all advertising, which will resume after the outbreak is under control, said Simon Clennell, a board spokesman. 
For travelers who are compelled to visit Hong Kong or southern China anyway, local and international doctors have a series of suggestions to avoid catching the disease. Many are the same as for avoiding the common cold; indeed, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control have each said that SARS is mostly likely caused by a previously unknown kind of coronavirus, the same family of viruses that causes many, but not all, common colds.
The tips include washing hands regularly with soap, never touching the face except after washing hands, eating a balanced diet, getting plenty of rest, avoiding crowded places with poor ventilation and keeping windows down for fresh air when in taxis. Less clear is whether wearing a mask provides a significant benefit. Many companies have been handing them out to their employees here. But the W.H.O. says that it appears the virus can also be transmitted through handshakes or by having droplets from coughs or sneezes come in contact with the eyes.
Dr. David L. Heymann, the executive director for communicable diseases at the W.H.O., said that complete protection was very difficult and suggested that if people "want to really fly and be protected, get yourself goggles, a mask and gloves."
The big fear in the travel industry here now is that the current outbreak might last months, not weeks, which could bring many companies to the brink of bankruptcy.

Carving a Niche in Generic Drugs

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
IMPORTING chemicals isn't glamorous. And for 50 years after it was founded in 1947 by two Queens chemists, the Aceto Corporation usually generated company news about as exciting to read as your old high school chem textbook.
 "We've been mainly a quiet little company, until now," said Leonard S. Schwartz, a chemist who is chairman, chief executive and president of the company, which is based in Lake Success. 
 The change began five years ago, when Mr. Schwartz started to aggressively retool Chinese factories, giving them the knowledge and manufacturing processes to be able to produce industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals for the United States and European markets. 
In all, Aceto has brought about 400 Chinese factories up to Food and Drug Administration code, meaning those factories' products can be readily exported to the United States and, usually, Europe.
Mr. Schwartz prefers to talk about the company's organic growth, but a key pair of acquisitions has expanded Aceto's scope, according to John E. Roberts, an industry analyst with the Buckingham Research Group in Manhattan. In 2000, Aceto bought the United States nutritional chemical distribution business of Schweizerhall, a Basel, Switzerland, company, and in 2002 the larger Schweizerhall international pharmaceutical distribution business.
While Aceto competes in five different chemical markets, importing about 1,000 chemicals into the United States and Western Europe, its presence in the generic drug industry is what has piqued investors' and analysts' interest.
For much of the past winter, Aceto was the fastest-growing publicly traded company on Long Island, based on valuation. Its stock traded (Nasdaq: ACET) at just under $13.50 a share last week, after trading at about $6 a share for most of the past year.
The past six months were particularly strong. For the six months ended Dec. 31, revenue rose 29 percent, to $132.7 million, from the year before. Net income, before an accounting change, totaled $4.7 million, up from $1.8 million.
The causes behind Aceto's recent surge are more likely to be found in an economics primer than in a chemistry text.
Aceto has been helped by being the Western arm of many Asian factories, Mr. Schwartz said, acting as the distributor to the United States and Europe. 
Like most importers and distributors, Aceto concentrated on India at first, perceiving China to be lagging far behind in terms of capacity, productionquality, worker skills and cost.
But in 1996, spurred by a desire to find lower-cost partners, Aceto began actively seeking more business partners in China, and was willing to overlook the initial costs and occasional difficulties arising from two different political systems. Production costs in China are 25 percent to 40 percent lower than in the United States, according to Mr. Schwartz. "China is one of the most business-friendly countries in the world, provided you play by their rules," Mr. Schwartz said.
Since 1997, Aceto has trained thousands of Chinese workers and their supervisors to make chemicals that meet United States and European standards for quality and consistency. "Aceto is now the largest buyer of specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals for export from China," Mr. Schwartz said in an interview in his office.
The development of a cheap, high-capacity chemical supply from Asia has helped the company pour product into the Western market, as demand for a wide range of drugs continues to soar. 
"The niche we've developed is as a supplier to generic drug manufacturers in this country and Europe," Mr. Schwartz said.
Since 1984, when the federal Hatch-Waxman Act opened the door for manufacturers to create and sell replicas of existing brand-name drugs, these generic drugs have increasingly been touted as a safe way to slow the rising cost of health care.
Despite consumer skepticism, physician resistance and litigation by the pharmaceutical industry to block their use, generic drugs have steadily carved a niche in the health care market. Last year, for the first time, American pharmacists dispensed generic drugs more often than they did brand-name drugs, filling prescriptions with generic products 51 percent of the time, according to IMS Health, a pharmaceutical information company based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa.
The appeal of generics is clear: the lower cost. The average price of a generic prescription was $14.70 last year, compared to $70.79 for a brand-name drug, according to IMS. 
From 1993 to 1999, spending on drugs doubled, from $50 billion to $100 billion, and continues to grow rapidly, according to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association in Washington. Spending on generic drugs accounts for nearly 10 percent of expenditures for drugs in the United States, said Christine Simmon, vice president for policy and public affairs at the association.
Spending on generic drugs is rising faster than overall drug spending, industry statistics show, and will exceed $16 billion this year, according to Drugs Off-Patent Reports.
Because generics are priced higher for drugs just coming off patent, this market niche is particularly important for profitability, according to industry analysts. This year, projected sales from blockbuster drugs coming off patent will exceed $5.9 billion worldwide, according to MedAd News, an industry publication.
As demand has increased, so has retail price, which usually means higher profit margins for producers and suppliers. Prices of generic drugs are rising almost twice as fast as prices for brand-name drugs, according to IMS Health. 
In the pharmaceutical industry, market economics are blunted by the need to absorb the large costs of government lobbying and a dependence on litigation for market protection. When generics get to market, they have a six-month period set by law before other generics can compete. Accordingly, new generic drugs cost more to consumers. They are initially priced at as much as 70 percent of the cost of the brand-name drugs being duplicated. Then, after 180 days, competition sets in, and the price often drops to 30 percent or lower of the original price.
And generic drugs are expected to continue to capture a growing percentage of the pharmaceutical market, both in dollars and volume, according to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association.
The opportunities are so vast, that a company that capitalizes on only some of them will do very well, said Mr. Roberts, the analyst at Buckingham Research.
"The amount of drugs coming off patent is far larger than Aceto could ever think about controlling," Mr. Roberts said. "The opportunities are so enormous that it's all going to be about finding the right issues."
Mr. Roberts said that he thought Mr. Schwartz's success in establishing business relationships in China has been the key to Aceto's success.
"Developing relationships with these Chinese companies and other Asian companies is something that takes a long time," he said. "Some of the big companies rotate people through Asia, and they never establish the personal relationships needed. Aceto is a lean company and does this well and profitably."

HEADLINE: Concerts Causing Headaches Already 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
TWO outdoor rock concerts scheduled for Riverhead this summer -- one expected to attract 75,000 fans -- are raising concerns for some area businesses and for the local police.
"Time is going very quickly, and plans are progressing very slowly," said David J. Hegermiller, the Town of Riverhead's police chief. 
 Of particular worry, he said, are security, communication and transportation issues. 
 "I hope nothing happens, but being responsible, I have to think of every possibility," he said, alluding to Woodstock '99 in Rome, N.Y., which ended in rioting and fires. 
"In post-9/11, we also have to be worried about terrorism," Chief Hegermiller added. 
Both concerts are scheduled to be held on the former Grumman grounds in Calverton. The first, a rock music, arts and camping festival, will be held June 7-8, with Radiohead, the Beastie Boys and Beck as the headliners. Andrew M. Dreskin, the executive producer of Field Day in Manhattan, the show's producer, said he expected to sell 40,000 tickets for each of the two days.
The second concert, Bonnaroo NE, is scheduled to begin Friday night, Aug. 8, and end two days later, with 12 hours of music on Saturday and Sunday. The Dave Matthews Band will be featured.
The first Bonnaroo festival last summer in Manchester, Tenn., about 65 miles southeast of Nashville, attracted a sell-out crowd of 70,000. 
B. Ashley Capps, a vice president of Axis Music Festival in New Orleans, which promotes the Bonnaroo festivals, said no more than 75,000 tickets would be sold for the Calverton event, which he said would be the largest outdoor rock concert ever staged on Long Island.
Asked about reports that fans had to sit in traffic for hours to get to last year's Tennessee festival, Mr. Capps called them a "gross exaggeration."
"We did have traffic issues last year," he said, "but it was our first year and we were surprised by the traffic patterns."
Debbie Vaughn, a public service officer at the Manchester City Police Department, said it took fans 10 hours or more to reach the concert because of traffic that was backed up about 30 miles. "It took me an hour to get home, and I live not five minutes away," she said. 
Mr. Capps said his company had hired a consultant tostudy ways to minimize traffic congestion at the Riverhead event.
But William Schulman, vice president of Calverton Links, a golf course, restaurant and catering facility on Edwards Avenue in Riverhead, said he feared that his business would be hurt by concert traffic. His establishment abuts the eastern end of the Calverton site. 
He said he has one wedding already booked at the same time as the June concert, and he is worried that some guests will not be able to arrive on time.
"I've instructed my staff not to book any more weddings," Mr. Schulman said, referring to that weekend.
He added that Calverton National Cemetery on Route 25 is across the street from the concert site, and he fears that visitors and burials will be affected by the traffic. In addition, Mr. Schulman said, concertgoers will only make the bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Long Island Expressway worse.
"The beginning of May attracts hundreds of thousands of people who go to the Hamptons or to the wine country, and the bulk of them use the Long Island Expressway," Mr. Schulman said. 
Tentative plans call for those going to the concerts to take the Long Island Expressway and get off between Exits 68 and 72 and then follow local signs and traffic agents to the shows.
Robert Kozakiewicz, the Riverhead Town supervisor, stressed that before either promoter is given the final green light for their festivals they must satisfy a host of other agencies dealing with transportation, water for food vendors, emergency services, police, security and sanitation.
"These things must be addressed by them before they receive approval of the Health Department and the town," he said. "We gave them an operating license, now the onus is on the promoters to satisfy the people involved."
Mr. Kozakiewicz said that each promoter would pay the town $150,000 and that there would be local lumber and hardware supply companies that would benefit because both festivals will build their own stages. In addition, he noted that about 2,000 acres of the 2,900-acre site is for sale, and that the festivals would be a chance to showcase it.
Chief Hegermiller said he was consulting with county and state police about the two concerts. He estimated that it would cost his department $200,000 in overtime for the August concert alone. Mr. Kozakiewicz said he planned to discuss that cost with the promoters, because "we envisioned making a profit."
Joey MacLellan, Mr. Kozakiewicz's executive assistant, pointed out that Riverhead regularly plays host to large gatherings each summer without problems, like the Riverhead Blues Festival, which attracts 50,000 people over a weekend.
He said both promoters will hire their own security force. "The town does not want any glass brought onto the site, and security will also be looking for drugs and weapons," Mr. MacLellan said. 
Barbara A. Blass, a member of the town board, said the blues festival and the annual Polish Fair attract large crowds, "but nothing like this."
"Some people have likened it to Woodstock," she said.
Ms. Blass said she was in favor of holding the June concert, "with all the appropriate safeguards." 
"But I am totally against holding another one six weeks later," she said, "because if the first is a logistical nightmare, we will not have time to make the necessary adjustments for the second one. It could be disastrous. Unless we know what we're getting into, why jump back into another one?"
Gary Lewi, a spokesman for Field Day, the June concert's promoter, said his firm had in the past "demonstrated how to put together an outdoor concert that addresses security, sanitation and economic benefits for the local municipality by inviting family-oriented musical acts to perform."
He emphasized that Field Day has "hired the leading professionals in concert logistics" for the festival.
Chief Hegermiller said he was still waiting to meet with Field Day representatives to discuss their plans. Mr. Lewi said such a meeting would be held soon. "We would expect to work closely with him and his department to assure that any questions he may have are quickly answered," Mr. Lewi said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
Housing Demand Remains Strong in Fairfield

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
AMERICAN consumers may be behaving cautiously about spending on cars, appliances and other big-ticket items in these uncertain times, but spending for homes is another story, especially in Fairfield County.
 Home buying has reached a feverish pitch in much of Fairfield -- Norwalk is an exception -- fueled, brokers say, by declines in interest rates to 30-year lows, a shrinking of inventories and uneasiness over the war, a listless economy and a jumpy stock market. According to many happy brokers, real estate is at the top of the list as a sound investment. 
 The residential market, in the words of Elayne Jassey, a longtime broker at Prudential in Stamford, "is so overheated I could work 48 hours straight if I had the strength." Buyers, she said, are bidding tens of thousands of dollars over the asking price and still losing out to higher bidders. 
On her advice a Brooklyn couple drove up to Stamford at 9 p.m. recently to place a binder on a house that had just become available. "We wrote the binder at 11 p.m. in my office," Ms. Jassey said. "I didn't think that if they waited even a day the house would still be there."
The couple, Kim and Andrew Purcell, chose Connecticut for its lower taxes and Stamford because of family members living there. "Those are the main reasons," Mrs. Purcell said. "But I'm definitely concerned about New York as a target; my husband will be going back to New York every day to work, traveling on the subway. Of course, there's no limit eventually as to what could be a target, but certainly Stamford is less of one."
Theirs was among 84 binders and sales started this year and already completed in Stamford, compared with 83 in the corresponding period last year, even though sale prices have escalated from an average of $554,000 last year to $648,000 this year, according to Prudential's regional vice president, Candace Adams. 
Eileen Hanford, a sales agent at Kelley Associates, a Darien real estate firm, said, "I see more young couples moving out of New York City, attributable in part to high Manhattan rents." One of those couples, Pam and Jason Pokorny, bought a house from her and moved in on March 31. With their second child on the way, they wanted a house in the suburbs, and, Mrs. Pokorny said: "9/11 has been in the back of our mind. We've been house hunting for a year. Every now and then, we'd have a panic attack about getting out of the city, much as we love it. We're afraid of the war causing more terrorism here."
"Because we were competing against so many young couples in Manhattan in the under $1 million price range," she said, "we paid way over asking." The house was built in 1870, a colonial -- just what the Pokornys wanted. "We had already lost out on four houses with multiple sealed bids. This time we had an approved mortgage. 
"We let the home inspection go -- if $10,000 was needed to replace the roof, so be it. It was crazy. We'll have some empty rooms for a while, but we have a house we won't move out of for a long time." Her husband will commute to his job in Manhattan as a Wall Street trader. 
The experiences of these two couples should probably be regarded as a manifestation of a phenomenon for which lower Fairfield County is famous. That is, in good times or bad, home prices keep rising.
While first quarter sales figures from the real estate companies are not yet tabulated -- and would mainly reflect sales contracted before the war -- limited records of binders signed and building permits issued since Jan. 1 are available from various sources, showing low inventories producing fewer sales, but at higher prices. 
Kelly Associates took binders on 80 houses in the Darien area from January through March, compared with 107 binders a year earlier. Sales in Greenwich are down, according Pat Barry, manager of the Greenwich office of William Pitt Real Estate, although prices have risen 3 percent from an average of $1.17 million last year to $1.173 million. The winter weather has had a huge impact, discouraging turnout by potential buyers, she said, and to a lesser degree the war and the economy also seem to have had a negative effect.
At the beginning of April, Russell Pruner, owner of Russell Pruner & Associates in Old Greenwich, said: "Clearly, the war has some effect on decision making for people who don't have to buy, but people who do have to buy are going ahead. We had 18 offers on a property we listed yesterday at $1.85 million. We went to sealed bids last night. The house could sell at 20 percent over list. An open house we had for a $1 million home drew 30 people in two hours."
Interest rates, he said, are less important at the high end, where houses often sell for cash. Still, he said, "we are seeing reductions in prices over $3 million, a level that is moving slowly due to the loss of wealth."
Norwalk's market, according to Carol Ann Falasco, a sales agent at Coldwell Banker, "should be better, considering interest rates are as low as they are." She added: "Talk that they may be going up should bring people out, but it's not. I believe the war is definitely beginning to have an effect. We're looking at reduced prices because we're not getting enough showings, or accepted offers of houses that go back on the market a week later when people change their minds. One woman backed off, saying: 'Maybe I'd better hold off. The war may affect my job.' 
"Norwalk is not booming like Westport," she said. "We had 32 open houses last Thursday with lots of price reductions. People who come to Norwalk don't expect houses to be priced over $500,000, even though that's cheaper than other towns. Right now, I can't find a $450,000 house for a young couple."
Coldwell Banker's residential brokerage president and chief operating officer, Peggy Doepper, said, "There is not enough supply for the demand." She added, "Our listing inventory is down 13 percent from this time last year, but there is little or no difference in binders or contracts." 
Westport had 31 of the 56 building permits issued in February for the Stamford Labor Market, according to the state Department of Economic and Community Development. That includes Greenwich, New Canaan, Norwalk, Darien, Weston, Westport, Stamford and Wilton. Last year only 36 permits were issued in February in the whole labor market. It is currently the only labor market showing an increase statewide. "Things have not slowed down," said Cathy Barnard, director of Westport's Planning and Zoning Department. "People are putting on enormous two-story additions, tearing down houses to build bigger ones, and the issuing of building permits may not be backed up as much as it was last fall, but it's still very busy."
In the more rustic precincts of Litchfield County, where New Yorkers have remodeled antique farmhouses and built expensive vacation homes, things were very quiet in January and February, said Liddy Adams, owner of Prudential Adams & Associates, realtors in New Milford.
"Now the shock value of going to war is over, stock market weakness still drives business our way and the need for housing supersedes what's on TV," she said. "But people are waiting -- not buying a second home right now. Or they are not going for the expensive lakefront property or multiacre property. Maybe something smaller and easier to take care of."
"We're getting inquiries about summer rentals limited to a week or two," she continued, "but spending $20,000 or $30,000 for the season is not what people want now."
An increase in corporate transferees who are buying homes, a trend more typical of the 70's and 80's, is cited as a factor in an increase in contracts to 33 so far this year, compared with the 23 signed last year in the same period. "These are smaller companies, sending people here on special assignments," Ms. Adams said. "New Milford is the farthest outpost for commuting to White Plains, Stamford or New York, and prices are in the $250,000 range for single family homes and $180,000 for town homes."
"The war," said Todd Martin, chief economist at People's Bank in Bridgeport, "has plunged consumer confidence to its lowest level in 10 years and intensified the flight to safety by investors. We've seen a big flow into regular savings accounts and 10-year Treasuries at 3.8 percent. Mortgage volume is very strong, at the end of March at 5.91 percent for a 30-year fixed. People who refinanced last summer are refinancing again, with no points."
Nicholas S. Perna, former chief economist at Fleet, current head of Ridgefield Perna Associates and an economics faculty member at Yale, has a son in the Naval Reserves in Kuwait. "I worry about suicide bombers in malls," he said. "The president didn't clear up uncertainty when he said it will be over when it's over." Mr. Perna added: "Betting on a quick resolution, we should see a rise in housing starts after that bad spell of weather. Otherwise, stock prices would be lower and oil prices higher. I'm taking some comfort in the market's assessment of these things."

 DIVERSITY IN AMERICA:
Keeping Government
at a Safe Distance
By Peter H. Schuck
Harvard University Press,
464 pp., hardcover
 Mr. Schuck, a professor of law at Yale University, sees diversity as a tremendous natural resource for American civic life. But through laws that restrict economic freedom and institutions that squelch energetic public discourse, he thinks the government has turned this great asset into a liability. Teachers and students can't always say what they want when they want because of constitutional restraints of religious speech in school, liability to lawsuits on a range of discrimination issues and the general timidity that has followed.
School choice is a particular concern. "I contend," Professor Schuck writes, "that we cannot hope to improve the quality of schooling for educationally disadvantaged children unless and until we give their parents the power, not just the right, to send them to schools other than the ones to which their local school boards now consign them." 
Familiar as this argument is, it comes with a new twist in "Diversity in America." The critical challenge, Professor Schuck says, is to "decouple good schooling from residence." That is, to break the link between living in expensive neighborhoods and having good public schools. Real estate and neighborhoods are a central theme for the author, who sounds like a conservative until he starts talking about what makes a good neighborhood -- a town center, street-level shops and a wide range of housing, which encourage people to drive slowly, walk the streets and take public transportation.
Jane Jacobs, the eloquent theorist of American community life and a hero of the liberal left, seems to be the professor's hero as well. The connections he makes between the familiar and the unexpected, and among left, right and center, make "Diversity in America" remarkably original.

THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
By Jennifer Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick
Oxford University Press,
301 pp., hardcover
"Education," the authors write, "is a deeply political enterprise, regardless of how much people try to hide that point behind professionalism, nonpartisanship or abdication to the market." They build on this foundation with familiar arguments about the potential conflicts between what parents want for their own children and what they want for American children in general. Tracking students into gifted programs, for example, might be a bad idea for students in general but can do good things for those put on the golden track. 
Many of these ideas are familiar because Dr. Hochschild, a professor of government at Harvard, has written about them in her three earlier books about schools and social justice. Dr. Scovronick, a professor of public affairs at Princeton, spent most of his career as a high-level state education and finance official in New Jersey.
The authors' ideas become more compelling when they talk about the shape of American demographics to come -- a "racial generation gap" in which a largely nonwhite work force will be forced to finance a vast and largely white pool of retirees. If people continue to place their personal interests -- and the perceived interests of their own ethnic groups -- above the common interests of Americans, the country can expect a policy crisis. 
"The need for schooling for the young will be great at the same time that the demand for health care for the elderly will peak," they say. "At the least we can expect severe competition for public resources."
And at the worst? The kind of social division unknown in the United States for generations.

WHO'S TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN?
Why the Teacher Crisis Is Worse Than You Think and What Can Be Done About It.
By Vivian Troen
and Katherine Boles
Yale University Press,
210 pp., hardcover
Ms. Troen and Ms. Boles, professors at Brandeis and Harvard, respectively, say they have found the source of the weakness of American schools: teachers never got good educations themselves. They base much of their argument on the 1983 report "A Nation at Risk," which declared public education an embarrassment. Now the children educated in those poor schools are being trusted with the education of the next generation. The authors' solution is the Millennium School model, in which teachers have clear career paths, teach in teams, work for principals with control over their schools, and are expected to continue studying the art of teaching and serious academic subjects. The professors see little hope in any other reforms, which they say avoid the core issue of improving the ability of teachers to teach. Few would argue with such sensible prescriptions. Yet the book's title suggests a problem larger than its proposals. Like "A Nation at Risk," it insinuates that schools are wildly out of touch with reality but offers solutions for a system merely out of tune.

Free Guide to Black Colleges
YOUNG blacks are besieged by messages that undermine the value of higher education, says Clayton Banks, president of Ember Media, a New York technology company and publisher. "We felt it was critical we compete with those messages." The result is "The Key: An Interactive Guide to Historically Black Colleges and Universities," a CD-ROM being distributed free this spring to public high schools in Los Angeles, Washington and New York, and high schools elsewhere with more than 50 black students. The disc contains information on 104 black institutions, financial aid and the application process. Corporate donations are financing the $500,000 project, with a promotional assist from Bill Clinton and the radio personality Tom Joyner. MICHEL MARRIOTT

Military Schools at the Forefront

BYLINE:  By Leslie Berger 

 BODY:
PUBLIC opinion on the Iraq war may be deeply divided, but interest in the military is on the rise, judging by applications to service academies. "This is a sea change in young people's attitudes," says Capt. Richard G. Gurnon, a Vietnam veteran and vice president of student services at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. "Instead of, 'I'm going into the maritime academy for its great placement rate,' what I see now is, 'I want to serve my country. I want to be part of the people ferrying the materiel for war with Iraq." 
 The state college, at Buzzard's Bay, has 875 students and specializes in engineering and merchant marine training. It expects its biggest freshman class in 25 years, with applications up 10 percent from last year. Many students are making early deposits to secure their place. 
 Similar trends are reported at the State University of New York Maritime College, the Citadel in South Carolina, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., and the Virginia Military Institute, where one in four freshmen are enrolled in Arabic classes. The Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., whose graduates receive automatic commissions into the armed forces, reports a nearly 16 percent increase in applications this year over last.
"Whenever patriotism becomes more important in America we see our applications rise," says Ken White, a V.M.I. spokesman. The last such increase was during the Persian Gulf war. But the slow economy and cultural obsession with physical fitness may also be factors in military life's appeal, Mr. White says. "And short hair is in. In 1969, you went home for Christmas and you stuck out like a sore thumb. Now on MTV, what you see is the exact same hair style as a cadet. You know that fitting in makes a tremendous difference."

HEADLINE: Selling a Rainbow, and a Pot of Gold 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
IN the Norman Rockwellesque towns of Maplewood and South Orange, N.J. -- neighboring communities where colonial, Tudor and Victorian homes nestle below the gentle slopes of South Mountain Reservation -- racial and ethnic diversity is promoted as a real estate selling point.
 The jitney tour for prospective buyers rumbles through every neighborhood of what local leaders refer to as "two towns, one community" -- beside narrow railed-porch homes selling for $190,000 near the train stations, along winding roads dotted by $350,000 center-hall colonials, past million-dollar mansions farther up the mountain. 
 Local real estate brokers are urged to show buyers every section of the two towns. The South Orange/Maplewood Community Coalition on Race, created with financing from the two towngovernments seven years ago, places advertisements in urban neighborhoods like Park Slope, Brooklyn, trying to attract people who prefer integrated living. It offers low-rate second mortgages -- as down payment assistance or to help with fix-up costs -- to buyers willing to move into those parts of the towns where they will contribute to the mix. 
To bolster property values, one civic committee works to ensure that ordinance codes are equally enforced on every block. The school board -- shared by both towns -- has created a program to make the elementary school with the lowest test scores more attractive to students and teachers from all around the towns.
And, given that the rate of home-price appreciation in the two towns surpassed those in all but one of the contiguous communities over the last 10 years, the strategy seems to have been successful. While the median price in Millburn, the most affluent of all the towns in the area, increased by 101 percent from 1992 to 2002, the median price in both Maplewood and South Orange rose by 99 percent.
The inclusiveness campaign -- along with other factors -- certainly attracted Natalie Monroe Thigpen.
Ms. Thigpen, 38, lives with her 5-year-old daughter, Madeline, near the duck pond in South Orange. The pond is at the foot of Flood's Hill, a long slope where "when it snows there are hundreds of kids sledding," she said. "That's definitely one of the selling points."
There is also the "wonderful" Fourth of July fireworks display at the hill, said Ms. Thigpen, who is African-American, "thousands of people sitting out on blankets with picnic baskets, candles, wine." Then there are the jazz concerts, the art galleries, the theater companies -- "yes, plural," she said.
Ms. Thigpen is the marketing director for Seton Hall University, which is on the east side of South Orange. She moved to town in 1996 from neighboring East Orange, paying in the "mid-$200,000's" for a four-bedroom colonial on tree-lined Highland Road.
"There are other communities where you can get all this," she said. "But then you say to yourself, I would also like to live in a community that's more and more about what this country is coming to look like."
Jessica and Gary Sachs took a more circuitous route -- from Brooklyn to Georgia to Maplewood -- for similar reasons.
"We went from having Schumer as our representative to Gingrich as our representative," Mrs. Sachs said of the family's seven-year sojourn in Alpharetta, Ga., 15 miles north of Atlanta. "It was gorgeous, wooded."
It was in 1994 that Mr. Sachs, 49, a trial lawyer, took a job in Georgia. Mrs. Sachs, 46, a freelance writer, could "work anywhere," she said. Their daughter, Eva, now 11, was 3 at the time.
The Sachses, who are white, had purchased a two-bedroom, prewar co-op in Park Slope in 1989 for $235,000. They sold at a loss. "It was February of '95; the market was rough," Mr. Sachs said. "We ended up at $194,000. It hurt."
The sprawling raised ranch they bought in Georgia -- a three-bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on more than an acre, with a pond -- cost them $236,000. Last May, after Mr. Sachs accepted a new job in Manhattan, the Georgia home sold for $269,000.
At first, the family considered a return to Park Slope. "It was out of reach," Mrs. Sachs said. "My husband looked at comparables and it was $200,000 higher than when we left, even in the same building."
The Sachses looked at towns in Connecticut, Westchester and other parts of New Jersey. "I was concerned they would just be white bread," Mrs. Sachs said. "We spent almost eight years in Newt Gingrich's district and I found it isolating."
Then they heard about the emphasis on racial, ethnic and lifestyle diversity in Maplewood and South Orange. And so, 10 months ago, for $299,000, they bought a three-bedroom colonial on the east side of Maplewood. "We live on a street where it's very much 50-50, black and white," Mrs. Sachs said. "We were very welcomed to the neighborhood; people came out of their houses to introduce themselves." 
Mr. Sachs said, "It's Mayberry meets New York City, very much the best of both urban and suburban worlds."

Seeking Cultural Richness
'Cosmopolitan Chic' In the Suburbs
For Barbara Heisler-Williams, executive director of the South Orange/Maplewood Community Coalition on Race, it is "cosmopolitan chic in this old-fashioned neighborhood."
"The conventional wisdom that heterogeneous communities are somehow less desirable is shifting," she said. "People look for a stable, culturally rich community, and here they have the luxury of all that in a community that's also diverse."
The shift is, perhaps understandably, most apparent among people used to living in cities. "When they were singles or young married couples, they lived in diverse urban environments," said Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "And when they move into the child-rearing stage, they seek out equivalently diverse suburban environments."
In Dr. Hughes's estimation, South Orange-Maplewood -- and particularly the work of the coalition on race -- "is a state-of-the-art model for communities around the country."
The advertisements that the coalition places in local newspapers in city neighborhoods and in The New York Times, say things like: "What do Maplewood/South Orange, N.J., and Park Slope Have in Common? Fresh mozzarella. 21 breads. Gourmet coffee. Live jazz."
They also say, "Only 29 minutes to Midtown."
To be sure, the real estate market in the region that includes South Orange and Maplewood was significantly bolstered by the 1996 inauguration of New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct train service to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan -- eliminating the need to transfer to a PATH train in Hoboken and shortening the ride by about half an hour.
"Some people will say it's Midtown Direct," said Ms. Heisler-Williams, whose organization was founded the same year the train service was improved. "But we did an analysis of other communities on the Midtown Direct train line, and over the same period our growth in values has surpassed the other communities. So there's something else going on; it's not just Midtown Direct."
Viewed over the last decade, according to statistics gathered by Superior Information Services, a Trenton-based real estate research company, the median price in Maplewood increased by 99 percent, from $160,000 in 1992 to $320,000 in 2002. In South Orange, the median price also rose by 99 percent over the decade, from $171,000 to $340,000. By comparison, the median price in Millburn, the most affluent of the contiguous communities, rose by 101 percent, from $325,000 in 1992 to $654,500 last year. 
By using a different formula covering only 1995 through 2001 -- boom years in the region's real estate market -- the race coalition's statistician, George Robinson, came up with somewhat differing trends.
"We decided to use the assessed value of each home sold as a reference point and then determine how much that home's sales price had varied from its assessed value," Mr. Robinson said. The coalition determined the average of the ratio of sales prices to the assessed values for all the homes that sold in a given year. And then, by comparing the averages from year to year, it was able to estimate the change in home values for the entire community. "We have determined percent changes in value for each of the two towns and a number of other towns in the area," Mr. Robinson said.
In Maplewood, the average ratio of sales price to assessed value increased 72.3 percent between 1997 and 2001 (the last year for which the coalition made calculations), and in South Orange it increased by 84.7 percent. By comparison, in Millburn over the same period, there was a 54.1 percent increase -- 18.2 percentage points lower than Maplewood's increase during the period, and 30.6 percentage points lower than South Orange's increase.

Two-Town Tours
A Jitney Ride As Marketing Tool
 It wasn't the numbers that persuaded Diane Thomson and James Loadholt to make the move to Maplewood two years ago. It was the jitney ride.
"We went on a two-town tour; a volunteer from the coalition showed us every neighborhood," Ms. Thomson said. "Being an interracial couple, we felt positive about a community that had a coalition promoting dialogue on race issues."
Ms. Thomson, 45, a home organizing consultant, grew up in Appleton, Wis., (population 70,000) -- "bigger than Maplewood," she said -- and moved to New York in 1986.
Mr. Loadholt, 48, a marketer for a financial printing company, had lived a full Brooklyn experience. As a child, he witnessed white flight from Bedford-Stuyvesant, and then, as a teenager into his late 20's, from Crown Heights. After that, the one-bedroom, rent-regulated apartment in Park Slope where Mr. Loadholt lived, for 20 years, served him and his new wife just fine until their son, Jared, now 6, occupied the slightly-larger-than-crib-sized homemade bed in the corner.
Buying in Park Slope was out of the couple's reach; so they looked at some suburbs, including communities "described as integrated," Ms. Thomson said. "For us it felt very much like two sides of the tracks, economically divided, and the poor people were people of color."
Then they took the jitney ride. "The gentleman giving the tour pointed out how racially and ethnically diverse communities are usually in transition, which totally resonated with me," Mr. Loadholt said. 
Ms. Thomson said: "We didn't feel the economic extremes. They do exist here, but not with such definition."
Their 1932 three-bedroom English colonial with original kitchen and ornate woodwork cost the couple $270,000. And Mr. Loadholt began commuting to Manhattan, riding the jitney -- its rush-hour function -- to Maplewood's Tudor-style, complete with cupola, train station. "Even the way Maplewood chose the three jitney routes, it was very communal," he said. "They made sure to go through every neighborhood."
On the ride, Mr. Loadholt said, "You're discussing doctors, the school system, that community network thing." And in his daily experiences, "No, there are almost no racial overtones."
It wasn't always so.
Burned into William Calabrese's memory is the day, back in the 60's, when he and his baseball buddies crossed the line from East Orange to play in South Orange.
"I'm someone who wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth," said Mr. Calabrese, who grew up in neighboring Newark and then East Orange. Later, in the mid-1970's -- despite that day -- Mr. Calabrese moved to South Orange, opened a pharmacy and, since 1991, has served as president of the South Orange Board of Trustees -- in effect, the mayor.
"I was about 11, and the friends I came with were Afro-Americans," he said. "We were singled out. They said, 'You can't play on our ball fields.' I was never so embarrassed; I couldn't understand why that would happen. It's always stayed in my mind." 
"Now," Mr. Calabrese said, "this town is a model for what America should be like. You can live on any block, any part of the town. And the point is we're growing because of that."
Maplewood's mayor, Victor DeLuca, said there is still progress to be made. "We still have pockets of town that are predominantly one race," Mayor DeLuca said, pointing out that the town is about to redevelop Springfield Avenue "because, historically, it has been a dividing line."
"We need to continue to work to make sure that our integration efforts are successful throughout the town," he said. "I don't think any community can say that they've solved these problems."
In the 50's, South Orange and Maplewood were overwhelmingly white. But over the ensuing decades -- through the turbulence of the civil rights era, the 1967 riots in neighboring Newark, the years of white flight, race-based steering by unscrupulous brokers and, over time, the economic advancement of some African-Americans -- the two towns would increasingly face concerns about racial tipping.
In 1990, according to census data, the population of the towns stood at 38,115, of which 80.7 percent was white, 14.9 percent black and 4.4 percent other ethnic groups. But by 2000, with the population increasing to 40,232, 60.3 percent of the residents were white, 32.6 percent black and 7.1 percent other groups.
It was in 1997 that the two towns, at the urging of a group of residents, contributed $50,000 each to create the coalition on race, which has since evolved into a nonprofit organization with about 2,000 members. 
Concern about racial tipping may have played a role in the founding of the coalition. But as Ms. Heisler-Williams, its director, said: "Percentage is no longer valid. The notion that one too few white people or one too many people of color somehow vastly changes the community is just absurd."
Dr. Hughes at Rutgers concurred: "Many studies in the 60's and 70's attempted to quantify the tipping point. But there's been a major shift in attitudes in the United States in regard to the desire for diversity."
"In the 50's, 60's and 70's," Dr. Hughes continued, "there really was white flight from the cities seeking uniform and homogenous environments -- the parents of the baby boom. But the baby boom itself, and even the baby bust population, now often rejects those types of environments."
In fact, said Ms. Heisler-Williams, it is not just city dwellers who have come to South Orange and Maplewood in recent years. "We have a lot of people who had moved far west in New Jersey, trying to get away from the city," she said. "But that became a quality of life issue; they were so far out that they were commuting when their kid was playing T-ball."
What the coalition tries to do through its marketing campaign, she said, "is create balanced demand, make sure that every one of our neighborhoods is seen as equally desirable and accessible."
For Friedes and Tito Valbuena, it was an ad in a local magazine promoting the coalition's loan program that tipped them toward the balanced mix in South Orange.
"We lived for 20 years in Astoria, Queens; a six-family, prewar walk-up," said Mrs. Valbuena, who is research director for a life insurance company. Mr. Valbuena, an architect, was tired of his reverse commute to an office in Maplewood. They are both 57.
"We'refrom the Philippines, and it's hard when you go some places and you stick out because you're the only person who looks different," Mrs. Valbuena said, "which is why we loved New York."
The couple paid $185,000 for a small, 1900's railed-porch home on Riggs Avenue in South Orange, which, like all roads in town, is lined by old-fashioned gas-fueled street lights. The house has "two big bedrooms and one small bedroom," Mrs. Valbuena said. "The bathroom off the first-floor kitchen has that old kind of claw-footed tub."
"It's all small lots along our street -- like Astoria, side by side," she said, "but across the street they have big lots."
What convinced the couple that they would feel at home in the community was the $7,000 second mortgage offered by the coalition for moving to a neighborhood where they would add to the mix. The interest rate on the loan was 3.5 percent, with payments deferred for a year. "You can't beat those terms," Ms. Valbuena said. "We used it for moving costs." The loan program, through Allegiance Community Bank, is subsidized by the two towns and the Fund for an Open Society, a nonprofit group based in Philadelphia.
"The objective was precisely to preserve the diversity of the community," Ms. Valbuena said. "In other places I didn't find that kind of a solid signal that they really were serious about diversifying. That's what attracted us."

A Multifaceted Approach
How One School Is Being Upgraded
 For the Thomson-Loadholts, the interracial couple from Brooklyn, the most solid signal was how the community chose to bridge the achievement gap at the school where their son, Jared, is in kindergarten.
"My son goes to the Seth Boyden Elementary School on the poorer side of town," Mr. Loadholt said. "The school was allowed to slip, so that it needed a special program to bring it back. There was a racial component."
The South Orange-Maplewood School District has a record of significant educational achievement. Last year, 93 percent of the 416 graduates from the district's one high school, Columbia High School, went on to college. On New Jersey's eighth-grade language arts test last year, 87.4 percent of the students in South Orange-Maplewood passed, surpassing the 82.7 percent average pass rate for the state. On the fourth-grade language arts test, the district had a 90.9 percent pass rate, while the state level was 86.3 percent. 
Two years ago, at Seth Boyden -- the second year of the district's program to close the school's achievement gap -- 78.2 percent of the fourth-grade students passed the reading test. By last year, that had improved to 87.6 percent.
"Rather than busing," said Ms. Thomson of her son's school, "the district brought in a consultant to develop a multiple intelligence approach, addressing the fact that people learn in different ways. We are also the center for teacher training."
Mr. Loadholt said: "The heartening thing is the way the board of ed made it a demonstration school where the curriculum is attractive enough so people want to send their kids there, so that some of the better teachers want to work there."
"It's not a finished experiment by any means, and there are issues," he said. "But at the same time, the fact that this community took this approach is not an accident."
It was no accident that Julia Burch and Aixa Cintron -- a lesbian couple with two small daughters -- chose Maplewood.
Ms. Burch, 40, a freelance writer, began hunting on the Internet after Dr. Cintron, 42, was hired as a professor at the Fordham University School of Social Work. At the time, in October2000, the couple was temporarily staying in Brooklyn after moving from Cambridge, Mass.
"I found a mention on Planet Out, a gay Web site, that Maplewood was one of the best small towns for gay families in the country," Ms. Burch said, "and certainly the only one in the New York area mentioned on the list."
"I did a little Yahoo map thing," she said. "We never really imagined ourselves as suburbanites."
And so, early one Sunday morning, the couple -- along with Ino, then only a year old (Amelia was not yet born) -- took a drive. "We drove into Maplewood and stopped in a park for an urgent diaper change," Ms. Burch continued. "There weren't many people there. But who we did see was a gay male couple, two daddies with their kids, and two mommies with their kids. And we just kind of laughed and said, 'It's true.' "
The couple bought a four-bedroom fixer-upper "at the corner where Maplewood intersects with Newark, Irvington and South Orange," Ms. Burch said -- for $185,000. 
Dr. Cintron said living in Maplewood has been a blessing, particularly for Ino, now 3. "She's very articulate, and we run into enough couples like us so that when she finds kids who have one mom and one dad, she is able to say, 'We're a family, too, and it's two mommies.' "

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK; 
War's Irrepressible Presence in the Office

BYLINE:  BY LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BACK in the old days, you couldn't watch a war in real time. (Those were the same old days when there was no such expression as "real time.") And you certainly couldn't watch a war while at work.
 World War II was brought stateside on grainy newsreels seen by movie audiences. Vietnam was jarring, yes, but it was still contained between the start and end of the nightly news. Most of the visuals from the first gulf war (the ones not provided by the Defense Department) were taken from hotel room windows with a night-vision scope, not from "embedded" cameras capable of illustrating play-by-play commentary. 
 This war, on the other hand, allows us to tune in at any moment -- all war all the time. "Allows" may be the wrong word. We must tune in. We can't escape it, because the same technology that brings us this war also brings us our e-mail and our interoffice memos and our project research. This is the Internet's war, the computer screen's war, a war that has come to the workplace.
Go to Yahoo to search for a phone number. The headlines will tell you the latest tally of the dead and injured. Go to Netscape to check the stock market. You can see more streaming video of statues being toppled in Baghdad. Or go to a trading floor the way Jenny Fielding does every day. As an investment adviser with Morgan Stanley she sits surrounded by computer screens, hers and hundreds of others, all with an inset of CNBC. Huge television sets that loom in her field of vision are also tuned to the war.
In the early days, she says, when American forces were first bombing Baghdad, the voices of the traders would periodically go silent and the rows of monitors would rumble and echo as one. "It was like being in the middle of the war," she said. "It was that loud."
But while the images might be the same from one office to the next, the fact is we are all watching different wars. The one being watched by the families of soldiers is the most personal of these. They scan the screens looking for familiar faces, listening for a particular battalion name. No wonder they are finding it hard to focus on work.
The war I am watching distracts me in its own way. My war threatens my baby sitter's younger brother, Eric Cole, a Navy corpsman waiting for orders to ship out. And it threatens scores of my colleagues, some of whom I love like family, and whose job description now includes risking their lives in real time and in color. Word of Michael Kelly's fatal crash in the Iraqi desert came to me over my office computer. So did news of the deaths of reporters I have never met, but whose need to tell this story I viscerally understand.
The war Ms. Fielding is watching, in turn, is one of numbers and predictions. War as an investment strategy. "At work, war talk is all about the market," she says. "If the futures are up, the question is, 'What's going on in the war?' "
Her war has become internal, as the work she does battles for significance with the grief and destruction she sees on her sea of screens. "I find it a bit sickening to have to call clients and talk about their investments when all this dying is going on," she says.
And this, in turn, leads her to yet another kind of war -- the unspoken one she fights each day with the traders who sit around her, most of whom, she gathers, feel much more gung-ho about this military action than she does.
"People couch things in terms of, 'Let's get this war over so the market can go up,' " she explains. "And I sit there in the middle of all this and think: 'No, let's get this war over so more people don't die. Let's get this wrapped up so we're not there doing something immoral anymore.' "
I have been receiving a steady stream of e-mail messages from workers facing this same intraoffice war. A public relations executive wrote to tell me that her boss had given out yellow ribbons to all employees and she felt that the underlying message was that "if you don't wear them, you are seen as anti-American." An architect wrote that making sardonic comments about the war is what passes for sport in his office, so he keeps his own pro-war views to himself. All this adds an extra scrim of tension to a workday already strained by everything from a faltering economy and fears of terrorism to worries about catching SARS.
Ms. Fielding is developing strategies to avoid all these battles -- the ones in the gulf and the ones closer to home. Time was when she turned on the news every night, but now she craves music instead. She also used to eat lunch at her desk, but now she takes long walks around the city to clear the noise of war from her head. And when the trading day ends at 4:30 and everyone turns off their computers and goes home, Ms. Fielding has begun to stay behind. She sits alone in the empty room savoring the peace -- a word that takes on extra meaning lately -- and quiet.

HEADLINE: Back to the Second Shift 

BYLINE:  By ELLEN L. ROSEN 

 BODY:
WHEN Flo Wiener had her second child 12 years ago, she was ready for a break from practicing law. She quit her job at the New York State Attorney General's office and chose, as she puts it, to "do the June Cleaver thing." She stayed home for nine years, but as her children grew older, she began contemplating a return to the work force. 
 "I had been seriously considering going back to work for a year," said Ms. Wiener, who lives in Edgemont. "One opportunity had come up but it wasn't right because it didn't fit with my public sector background." 
 Eventually she met another Scarsdale resident who had retired from his corporate law practice and was forming a legal services organization for children. "We met, we hit it off, I said I'd work 60 percent time and he said fine," she recounted. 
Grace Flowers had a career in retailing before her three children were born. But after a 15-year break from work, she established a floral design company in her Greenburgh home. She was inspired by the flowers her husband, Robin, a vice president for public relations at AT&T, often brought her. 
"I loved them and didn't want them to die, so I started researching how to preserve them," she said. "I sold them from my home and did dried floral arrangements for brides. That led me to think I should expand further and learn fresh flower arrangements." 
She sought certification from the Southern Westchester BOCES, the cooperative educational center, and learned business skills from the Women's Enterprise Project in White Plains. Over the last four years, she has grown her business.
Ms. Wiener and Mrs. Flowers are among many throughout the county who have successfully "sequenced," the term coined in the 1980's by a University of Minnesota professor to describe the transition undertaken by professional women who quit their jobs to stay home with their children -- sometimes for years -- and then resume old careers or begin new ones. 
THERE are no statistics on how many women take time off to raise their children and subsequently return to work. According to the 2000 United States Census, of the 118,669 women in Westchester with children under the age of 18, 42,982, or 36 percent, are not working outside the home. The overall number of mothers at home increased by almost 5,000 over the last decade. 
The number of women home includes many professional women in the 1990's, who, buoyed by a bull market and a confidence that work but not childhood would wait, left their jobs. But the children born at the height of the baby boomlet in 1991 are now entering middle school, and many of those same mothers are wending their way back into the work force. Whether spurred by children who are old enough to be more independent or a change in personal financial conditions, many have dusted off their resumes and found new jobs after years of staying home. 
Their success results from perseverance, networking and at least some luck. While it is usually easier to leave the work force than it is to come back, many women are able to return, said Ellen Galinsky, the president of the Families and Work Institute in Manhattan. "The reality is that for most there is no one career path." 
The key is to view old jobs and time at home as integrated rather than isolated experiences. "Everything has a thread," said Maggi Landau of Edgemont, who made the transition from practicing law to running a business, with several years at home in between. "Where was it written in stone that I have to follow a certain path? There can be consistencies between jobs and you can learn from what you did before and apply it now."
THE biggest impediment to returning to work is often figuring out what to do. The first step, many say, is to talk with friends and acquaintances. "Often women don't understand how much of a network they have through volunteer and school activities," said Marcia Brumit Kropf, the vice president of research and information services at Catalyst, a nonprofit organization that works with business to advance women. "Through different venues, whether school, religious institutions or sports, you will meet other people who can help you gain entree back into the world of work." 
But she added: "You're unlikely to come back to a senior position as though you never left. You will have to show that you have skills for the current world. Projects taken on a consulting basis can serve you well and show what you can do."
Another problem facing women is the loss of confidence they feel after years at home. "Employers and women don't always value the experience gained from being home," said Ms. Galinsky. "But if you learn to be an authority with kids, and learn to do different things at the same time, these are good skills for the work force." 
Many of the women at home re-enter the work force in fields like education and real estate, where they can arrange flexible hours and work close to home. Others seek corporate work, or start small businesses of their own. Although the current economy is weak, it "shouldn't be an excuse for people not to begin the process of looking for work," said Nancy Collamer, a career counselor based in Old Greenwich, Conn. 
But, added Silvia D. Carroll of Miraset Personal & Professional Development Services in Pelham, "It takes a little longer and a little more work to get in." 
And once the job is found, re-entry is not as simple as donning a new suit.
"The biggest surprise for a lot of these women is that it's a lot tougher to balance home and work life," said Ms. Carroll. "They think it will be a simple transition, if they get their ducks in a row, especially if their kids are grown. But it is a challenge, and I advise people to take on part-time work or work from home as a bridge, so it's less of a shock."
Sally Genster Robling of Larchmont is one who segued successfully back into corporate marketing after a year's hiatus. She worked initially at General Foods Corporation in White Plains, but then her husband took a job in Philadelphia and she moved to the Campbell Soup Company, based in Camden, N.J.. When they decided to move back to Larchmont in 1999, she stopped working to get reacclimated in Larchmont. "I was class mom and did all the lieutenant stuff I wanted to do," she said. "I also worked with the church, but mostly I spent time with my children. But at 46 I didn't feel that it was responsible not to be professionally engaged. And I found it hard to go from 60-hour weeks to being home."
After receiving a call from an executive recruiter, she said she became "open to thinking about returning to work." She called the head of human resources at Campbell's, who introduced her to the new head of American Standard, the company that manufactures bath and kitchen products as well as electronics. She worked out an arrangement that enabled her to work part time. "It's a wonderful deal, although it does require a degree of flexibility," she said. "I don't control my schedule because I respond to my businesses. But I love my work. I thought for a long time of what I wanted to do."
While Ms. Genster Robling kept her career connections alive, those who have lost touch with former colleagues can get started again by networking with acquaintances met through volunteer work or in the neighborhood. Sometimes, said Ms. Carroll, it is important to set up simple informational meetings just to learn about a field of work.
Maryann Dennen followed this route. After her oldest child was born 13 years ago, Ms. Dennen, an accountant, returned to her job at Merrill Lynch where she "worked for a month or so before realizing that the job wasn't conducive to having kids." She left and stayed home for nine months, but then began teaching corporate finance at Manhattan College in Riverdale. After her second child was born in 1992, she stopped altogether and subsequently had a third child. In 1995, when her youngest was almost a year old, she started her own accounting and financial services company.
"I was given the opportunity just from meeting people in Bronxville," she said. "I was doing community work, whether for the Junior League or schools, so clients found me." 
Beth Smayda of White Plains says that volunteer work helped her land a job at MBIA, a municipal bond insurance company based in Armonk. Before her oldest child was born prematurely in 1986, Ms. Smayda worked as a municipal bond analyst at Moody's Investor Service in Manhattan. She intended to go back to work part time, but it wasn't an option back then, she said.
"Since I realized my son would need additional care, with weekly doctor's appointments, I decided to stay home, which fortunately I could do financially," she said. "I decided that as long as I was home, I'd have my kids at that time." 
Ms. Smayda had two other children and became involved with the League of Women Voters and worked on the White Plains city budget. "Through some of my volunteer work, I knew someone who worked at MBIA and had a job interview arranged through him," she said. "They hired me at the same level at which I left Moody's."
Fran Columbus of White Plains has never stopped working and has held a variety of demanding jobs. But after a stint as executive director of a Manhattan law firm, she started a consulting practice closer to home. She felt that "teenagers need more of a presence at home than younger children." 
She kept up contacts with executive recruiters, telling them to call her when the right job came up. That position presented itself this year; with her younger child a senior in high school, Ms. Columbus went to work as the chief operations officer of the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan. "The intellectual challenge of work is an important part of who I am," she said. "I want my daughters to understand that because I want them to have the same."
While most who have jumped off the career track acknowledge that they could do so because of their spouse's income, there are single parents with no financial cushion who have had similar gaps. Terri Geary, a West Harrison resident, was an events planner at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, before she had her son, Robert, now 4. But after 15 years in the field, she lost her job a year after her son was born. Out of work and suffering from health problems, she said she endured a "rough three years." She landed a job with a hotel company, but was laid off after Sept. 11. Ultimately, she found a job at California Closets in Hawthorne. Although her expenses are high and her income is a fraction of what it was, she said that after her son was born she had known she had to make a career change. 
CHANGING family circumstances can also prompt career changes. Ms. Landau was a successful real estate lawyer who had worked at a large New York law firm and then moved to a health care company and then to a real estate development company. But when her daughter was in eighth grade, she said, "Although I loved my job it dawned on me that my kids would leave home in a few years, so I quit cold turkey." But a few years later she was ready to work again.
"I realized that even when you're off, your personality doesn't change," she said. "I ran the P.T.S.A.. for the junior-senior high school. And then I decided my kids were old enough for me to return to work when my husband was diagnosed with cancer." 
Her husband, Bobby Minter, ran Rainbow Media, a sales, marketing and advertising company. When he became ill, she got involved in the business. After her husband died, she began running it.
"We all have the capacity to step up and do anything," she said. "Just allow yourself to make mistakes and then you can learn."
Often, the biggest difficulty for women who have been home for a number of years is determining whether they want to return to their former professions or find a new direction. The county's libraries have a program, the WEBS Career and Educational Counseling Service, which offers myriad career services. The program includes group sessions that "help residents get a clear sense of who they are and what they offer and to be able to connect with others going through transition," said Elaine Sozzi, who heads the 23-year-old program.
Westchester County also provides some workshops for women with no professional training as well as others seeking to start businesses. Anne Janiak, a former mayor of Scarsdale, runs the Women's Enterprise Project in White Plains, which she describes as "micro-enterprise development program that helps women achieve economic self-sufficiency through entrepreneurship." The group offers a 15-week course in owning a small business, with instruction in financing, marketing and time management skills. The group, which also provides mentors, works with women on public assistance as well as homemakers who need to re-enter the work force because of changes in their lives. More than 300 women have been through the program and close to 50 percent have started businesses as a result, according to Ms. Janiak.
One participant was Afra Sepulveda of Yonkers, who had worked for years at the investment banking firm Bear Stearns Companies, in the production department, where she managed as many as 45 people. But she lost her job in 2001, which she found shocking. 
"I thought I was a necessity, but that wasn't the case," she said. "It was a very difficult period, although I was laid off along with 800 other people. " She attended the Women's Enterprise Project, and decided to start a floral design business. Although she says she's making roughly 40 percent of her previous income she has no regrets. "The business is moving along and I have expanded. And I like being independent." 
Westchester Community College in Valhalla provides training and support through its Women's Forum, said Susan Shumejda, the program's director, which helps those looking for work to regain their confidence and understand their strengths. "Women can be nervous about stepping back into the classroom," she said. "Often the only notes they've written are excuse notes for their children." 
Even for professional women, the fear factor exists. "The women I work with are very talented, capable women, and yet have not been in the conventional workplace for a while," Ms. Collamer said. "Even when you were employed, there's a sense of being the new kid on the block and having to learn the ropes, the politics and the company when you start a new job. For a woman who has been out of the workforce the learning curve is a little steeper. But the good news is that people say it was tough, but then it's fine." 
Those who have jump-started their careers acknowledge that it often takes time to achieve a new family balance. But the nonfinancial rewards of going back to work can be as meaningful as the new salary. 
"Work keeps home in perspective and home keeps work in perspective," said Ms. Smayda.

HEADLINE: Report Cards That Bring Smiles 

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER school districts got their report cards from the state, and in much of the county the news was very good. 
 Eighty-five percent of the students who entered high school in the fall of 1998 graduated in June 2002, compared with a state average of 75 percent. 
 And the average scores for Regents performance on the English, math, United States history and global history were in the 80's and 90's -- well above the score of 65 needed to last year qualify for a Regents diploma. (Many students also took a fifth Regents exam, in science). 
Besides buoying the spirits of school administrators, these results figure into the competition between districts that is reflected in property values and assessments of real estate's desirability. 
Which is not to say that there aren't districts like Yonkers where there is plenty of room for improvement.
And the standards will keep getting tougher. The graduating class of 2003 will need a passing score of 55 or better on all five Regents exams. The graduating class of 2004 will have to pass the English test and both history exams, United States and Global), with a score of 65 or above, and the class of 2005 will have to pass all five required Regents with a score of 65 or above. And in 2005, the Regents-only diploma becomes the requirement for all, with the option of a local diploma eliminated. Dr. Debra Jackson, the superintendent of the North Salem Central District and president of the Chief School Officers' Association for Putnam and Westchester Counties, said the county schools performed well for a couple of reasons. 
"There's a commitment to education throughout all our communities, no matter what the socio-economic demographic, and in the region, we have a real commitment to staff development," she said. "We're able to do a lot of analysis of students, and putting the latest educational research in the hands of classroom teachers."
Dr. Edward J. Shine, the schools superintendent of the Rye City school district, said: "In the last five years, we've revised all our curriculum so that, at the very least, the state standards were included. Initially, we were focused on the test, but over the long haul, we've been able to incorporate all the educational issues into what we do, so that the amount of test prep would be minimized."
In Rye Neck, where - other than in the science exams - 100 percent of the students passed the required Regents, district administrators credit a concerted effort to provide academic support for all students as a key factor for these results.
"We've been working hard at making substantive changes in curriculum and instruction," said Dr. Peter J. Mustich, the schools superintendent. "We've been working with students who need support and help through after-school tutorials, as well as informal support services, improving what's going on in the classroom, and during the past three to five years, being more careful about test analysis and data. The district's expectations are more rigorous, and everyone's risen to the occasion. We're happy with the results, but we caution that the test results can change every year, and we have to constantly work on how we do." 
In Port Chester, where there is the highest percentage of non-English speaking students in the county, 89 percent of the students passed the Regents English exam with a score of 65 or better, while 98 percent earned at least the minimum score of 55. 
"We're bundling essential skills from elementary school on, and doing massive improvements to curriculum and instruction," said Dr. Charles Coletti, the school district superintendent. "It's not about money. We spend less per pupil than any district other than Yonkers or Mount. Vernon. We take teacher-student accountability very seriously."
For its part, Yonkers expects that its current strategy of offering extra academic help in after-school, Saturday and vacation tutoring sessions will translate into improved results.
"In general, we're moving forward," said Jerilynne Fierstein, director of public relations for the Yonkers public schools. "We have double English-language arts periods, advanced courses in math and science in the middle school and are fidning ways to help our students on the Regents."
For the forseeable future, the tests are inevitable. 
"Everyone worries about them," said Dr. Shine of the Rye City district. "If you look at these test scores as analogous to an organism, then if the test scores are sound, you can go off and do other kinds of things. We've tried to weave the tests into the fabric of what we do, and find a way to balance it. It's not going away."

Show Me the Deal That I Really Want

BYLINE:  By GREGORY JORDAN 

 BODY:
WHEN he negotiated contracts for baseball stars like Cal Ripken Jr. and Kirby Puckett, Ronald M. Shapiro flouted the most cherished creed of sports agents: show me the money. Instead, he advised these baseball stars to accept relatively moderate pay packages in return for the right to spend their entire careers with the same teams, allowing them to plan their post-baseball business careers.
 Therein is a lesson for corporate America, says Mr. Shapiro, 60, who still represents sports stars and now also has companies as clients. Rather than practicing the winner-take-all aggression endemic to professional sports, he believes business leaders should follow the path of cooperation and compromise. 
 His management consulting firm, the Shapiro Negotiations Institute in Baltimore, has signed up clients like MBNA, the credit card issuer; Automatic Data Processing, a provider of payroll services; Hearst-Argyle Broadcasting, a TV station group, and the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
It doesn't hurt that he has his fingers in so many business pies. In addition to running his institute, which he founded in 1995, he has negotiated contracts for sports stars and entertainment celebrities like Oprah Winfrey at his Shapiro, Robinson & Associates talent agency. He also remains active in his corporate law firm, Shapiro Sher Guinot & Sandler in Baltimore; runs his own book publishing company and another that prepares law graduates for the bar exam, and is the author of "The Power of Nice" (John Wiley & Sons, 1998), about deal making.
It doesn't hurt, either, that he spices his talk with the sports metaphors that many corporate executives love. "I try to ground the anecdotes with my own business and legal experience," said Mr. Shapiro, who has represented four members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and continues to advise them. "The bottom line is always that the other side needs a win as well."
Mr. Shapiro's system simulates negotiating sessions that play down competition and draw on the playing-field dynamic of teamwork to teach common goals. He says it also applies some of the conflict-resolution techniques described in a 1981 business book, "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In," by Roger Fisher and William Ury. 
"This runs counter to the prevalent deal model of getting the last pound of flesh," said Mr. Shapiro, who has been mentioned as a possible future baseball commissioner. "But in an age where Warren Buffett is saying C.E.O. pay should be cut and deals like Enron's are over, we are trying to restore a long-term approach."
John R. Cochran III, president and chief operating officer of MBNA America Bank, is one of Mr. Shapiro's biggest fans. "We'll have one of our top programs come up for renewal and Ron will come in and role-play, sit across from the sales team and show them what the other side wants," Mr. Cochran said, adding that Mr. Shapiro has also helped customer service representatives in their work and taught collectors "how to position a customer who is behind on payments to pay MBNA before other companies."
At Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Dr. J. Raymond DePaulo Jr., head of the department of psychiatry, credits Mr. Shapiro's techniques with helping him broker deals both inside the institution and with donors and investors.
"This method is miles away from what I see from the bankers and businessmen at the Davos World Economic Forum," Dr. DePaulo said. "First, you are not really negotiating but trying to understand and educate. Then, you get the rhythm of your proposal in sync with the rhythm of the other side's."
Some experts say Mr. Shapiro's approach can work against a client. Kenneth L. Shropshire, a professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who, with Timothy Davis, wrote "The Business of Sports Agents," said a bigger contract might have better served Mr. Puckett, for example, in his recent legal and personal troubles. Mr. Puckett, a member of the Hall of Fame, was left blind in his right eye by glaucoma in 1996 and could no longer play baseball. He went through a nasty divorce and was later accused of sexual assault, though he was acquitted this month. He had a $32 million, five-year contract that began in 1992.
 PROFESSOR SHROPSHIRE says Mr. Shapiro's way can work, or not. "You have got to compare the Puckett situation with Ripken's business success," he said.
"Given that the sports stories have an appeal in the business world, if I were an executive I would still want to hear from the agent who negotiates the deal that sets the market. Some agents repeatedly get that above-market deal, and, the ethics of sports agents aside, I would want to hear that side, too," he added.
But other clients even apply Mr. Shapiro's methods to labor relations. Stephen Bisciotti, chief executive of the Allegis Group, a recruiting and staffing firm in Hanover, Md., and co-owner of the Baltimore Ravens football team, says Mr. Shapiro's emphasis on inspiring, rather than scaring, the troops helped his company manage the fast growth in the late 1990's. "Jack Welch was famous for saying you have to cut the lowest-performing 10 percent of your people annually," Mr. Bisciotti said, referring to the former chief of General Electric. "But, under Ron's system, we learned that you keep the lower performer who is more devoted to the company."
Mr. Shapiro often uses the labor conflicts in Major League Baseball as an example of how not to negotiate. At consulting sessions with Illinois Power, he set up sessions in which management and labor switched sides, something he would do to help resolve the festering disputes between baseball team owners and players.
"With baseball, we still see the mutually destructive, win-lose approach on both sides, and the world sees how calamitous that can be for the industry and for management and labor," said Mr. Shapiro, who was a lead mediator in the 1994-95 strike. "It's a perfect example for corporations of how not to do things. There is no spirit of partnership."

Get a Horse (On Second Thought, Don't)

BYLINE:  By Neil Genzlinger 

 BODY:
I FIGURED out ages ago that the most efficient way for a man to get something he wants is to give it to his wife for her birthday. Thus mine in recent years has received a lovely set of Jack Olsen's true-crime books, a subscription to ESPN the Magazine and a video of the 1985 horror film "Re-Animator" (so rendered on the video box).
 But what I've always really, really wanted -- hasn't everyone? -- is a horse. So it seemed like a sign from above when I read the other day that Cook College at Rutgers was having a conclave called "Horses 2003." 
 I would, I reasoned, zip over to the event, browse, barter and have a nice-looking horse standing in the yard when the wife came down for breakfast on her birthday, which is this weekend.
Cook College, the state's land-grant institution, where things agricultural are taught, is one of the more pleasantly odd places in the Garden State. Animals graze alongside fields where students are playing lacrosse. The prints in the spring mud are as likely to be hoof as foot.
One building has a sign at the door that says "Welcome to the Swine Facility."
The campus seemed the perfect place for a suburban man to find the horse of his dreams -- his dreams generally consisting of romantic images of gorgeous, no-maintenance horses like the ones in movies and cigarette commercials. But the glow began to fade as I scanned the conference program. 
There were no useful presentations on the things I was interested in, like "How to Ride Your Horse at an Impressive Gallop So the Wind Flows Through Your Hair in That Really Sexy Way" or "Swooping Pretty Girls Up and Placing Them Behind You on the Saddle in a Single Motion Without Ever Breaking Stride." 
Instead, the titles were alarmingly unromantic: "Basic Hoof Care and Shoeing," for instance, and "The Scoop on Poop: Managing Your Manure." 
Not being interested in such details -- those would, after all, be the wife's responsibility, since the birthday horse technically would belong to her -- I skipped the seminars. I thumbed through a booklet that came with the registration material called "Horses 2003 Proceedings," hoping to rediscover the fun side of horse ownership, but I stopped when I hit these words, under the heading "Common Parasites and the Problems They Cause":
"Gasterophilus (bots) are flies in their adult form. Interestingly, these flies do not have functional mouthparts and cannot feed. They live long enough to mate and lay their eggs around the mouth, legs and shoulders of the horse. Larvae, which hatch from the eggs, enter the mouth, burrow into the oral tissue, where they remain for a while, then re-enter the mouth."
There's more, but you don't want to read it, and neither did I. So I tossed the book and headed straight for the vendor fair. 
I figured that, this being a horse conference, the vendors would be selling horses, but there wasn't a steed in sight. Instead, there were people hawking a dizzying array of horse-upkeep paraphernalia. There was "TractGard colic and ulcer preventive." There was "Rio Vista Hoof Manicure natural moisturizing cream." There was something in a 1,000-milliliter bottle (price: $25.95) whose label was written entirely in a foreign language except for two distinctly English words: "horse" and "deodorant."
Let me just take a moment to offer a word of caution to any other novice who might wander into a vendor fair at a horse conference: resist the temptation to try these products on yourself. The Bio-Pulse magnetic therapy blanket, for instance, may sound as if it will cure what ails you ("Sore in the back from stiffness, arthritic conditions or hard work?"), but it will look far more ridiculous on you than it does on a horse. 
An InflammaSaver maximum-strength anti-inflammatory and immune system booster is not, it turns out, an improvement on aspirin, and "Gourmet Stable Cookies -- baked fresh daily" are not nearly as tasty as the name implies.
Anyway, I left "Horses 2003" without a horse. More than that, I left concerned over the fact that the horse is our state animal. I know all about the role of the horse in our economy past and present, but shouldn't the state animal be something that anyone can own without having to devote inordinate amounts of time to parasite control and hooficures? 
The hamster, I believe, remains unclaimed by any other state.
The wife will no doubt be disappointed to not receive a horse for her birthday. But I'm sure the Beer of the Month Club membership will ease her pain.

A Bronx Cheer for Manhattan

BYLINE:  By JOE CONCHA; Joe Concha is a freelance writer who lives in Hoboken.

 BODY:
"YOU still live in Hoboken, huh?" an old acquaintance asked, innocently but with an oozing of condescension. "Don't you feel old still being there?" 
 It was not the first time in my 31 years that I had been exposed to such a pompous inquiry from friends trying to live the "Must See TV," "Friends" dream of life in Manhattan. 
 Maybe I am missing out on Lizzie's V.I.P. parties at Bungalow 8, the culinary masterpieces of Nobu or the cultural education only found at the Guggenheim. 
Tickets to "The Producers."
Jazz at the Blue Note.
Monday nights at the China Club with Jeter and Giambi. 
Working out with Gwyneth at Equinox.
But my friends who live in Manhattan are not living in this fantasy world either. 
Tune into "Sex and the City" for a few episodes and one cannot help but believe that casual intercourse and nightly blowouts are as much a part of everyday existence in the Big Apple as Starbucks and The Village Voice. The ugly fact is that though your city friends crow about a scene they are probably not privy to, the reality of a post-9/11 economy means that these same people are probably working longer hours than ever simply to survive. 
The circular lifestyle becomes increasingly vicious: The job exists to pay for the apartment that primarily serves as a place to get enough rest and have enough energy to go to work to pay for the apartment.
The supercilious dialogue truly begins when people who once lived in Jersey are invited to a Hoboken event and curiously go into complete denial that their past addresses ever existed. I invited one old friend to a bar party in Hoboken -- a girl who is convinced she IS Carrie Bradshaw -- and she responded: "Why don't you just have the party in the city? I don't feel like going all the way out there." You would think "out there" was a trek to Baghdad rather than a simple trip across the river. 
Manhattanites feel a sense of accomplishment from completing the progression to maturity and freedom when moving out of Jersey and into the concrete jungle. In their mind, the stairway to success reads: junior high school, high school, college, briefly back home with parents, Hoboken (or insert other North Jersey towns here) and, finally, New York City. Getting stuck at any of the rest stops on the way to urban utopia is considered failure. 
Another friend recently chided me about a date I had planned in Hoboken.
"What are you going to do?" he asked with a smirk. "Pick her up in your Camaro with Bon Jovi blaring and grab a meal at Sizzler?" 
Three weeks later, I am pleased to report, Seth needed to borrow $40 just to make it to his next paycheck because his rent and dinners with his Upper East Side, higher-maintenance-than-the-Giants-Stadium-turf girlfriend were eating him alive. Perhaps he put the cash to good use and went to swanky Trust downtown, where $40 can buy a three whole drinks. 
"It must be so inconvenient going out in the city and having to take the PATH back to Hoboken at 3 a.m.," is another commonly echoed advantage of calling New York home. But when applying basic math, the cost of a $35 cab ride to Hoboken, say, twice a month, is only $70 and almost as fast with no traffic at that time of night. Given the difference in the prices of rent (in Hoboken, the average one-bedroom rents for $1,335 as opposed to $1,875 in Manhattan) that $70 suddenly doesn't resemble the national debt. 
I once lived in a studio two blocks from Central Park at 95th and Columbus. Nice area. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops. And it was too cool to tell women that I had a place on THE Upper West Side (given my location, the word "upper" was particularly accentuated). Still, I felt strangely isolated in a city of eight million people. 
Going to a place where everybody knows your name may not be your thing, but Hoboken at least offers the choice. 
So go ahead, New York. Make the unsophisticated cheese that lives "there" the butt of your predictable jokes. When the chuckles subside, have fun writing out the $300 monthly check to park your car. Or enjoy your painful journey getting out of the city to go to the beach. Good luck finding a good shopping mall. 
Hobokenites will just sit here and soak up our bigger apartments, larger savings accounts and $3-to-anywhere-in-town cab rides. Oh, and those cozy B.Y.O.B. restaurants that are Hoboken's signature really have us feeling mortified to be stuck on the Jersey side of the world. 
What, you city folk really thought all $12 bottles of wine cost a minimum of $40, as they do in most New York restaurants? 
Finally, when leaving a Yankee game after the home team wins again, sing along to Sinatra's "New York, New York" blaring throughout the stadium. After all, who else is more appropriate to croon about the virtues of New York than an Italian guy from Hoboken? 
"You still live there, huh?" 
Yeah. Life is tough.

A New Investment, Courtesy of Canada

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
INCOME trusts, which have surged in popularity in Canada, are being offered on the New York Stock Exchange as antidotes to shrinking stock portfolios and tiny fixed-income returns. 
 The income trusts generally provide rich income streams, as high-yield bonds do, but the trusts are actually equity investments. Their value can shift sharply, and the payouts are by no means assured. 
 Despite the risk, many investors in Canada have been drawn to income trusts because of the prospect of consistently high yields. "Because a large number of baby-boom investors are nearing retirement, they're looking for stability of income," said Stephen Pincus, a partner at Goodmans, a law firm here that has helped structure many trusts. "They can't afford to invest in stocks, which require a long period of time to harvest capital gains." 
Like real estate investment trusts, the Canadian income trusts raise capital through an offering of units, or shares. They invest that capital in the equity and debt of an operating company and distribute most of their pretax operating income to investors. Shareholders can count on the income only if the underlying business continues to generate stable cash flow. 
In early March, the Fording Canadian Coal Trust, which controls North America's biggest exporter of coal for making steel, listed its units for sale on the New York Stock Exchange. The trust replaced Fording common stock as part of a merger with two other Canadian coal producers. Fording's shares closed at $19.08 on Friday, roughly the level at which they were listed. Three other Canadian trusts -- the Enerplus Resources Fund, the Pengrowth Energy Trust and the PrimeWest Energy Trust -- have also listed in New York. 
More than 100 trusts have been set up in Canada the last two years. They accounted for 57 percent of the value of new listings on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2002, said Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital at RBC Capital Markets here. Currently, he said, the trusts account for about 7 percent of the market value of the S.& P./TSX composite index, the main benchmark for stocks on the Toronto exchange.
Canadian income trusts were initially confined largely to the oil, gas and real estate sectors. But those set up recently are in industries as diverse as horticulture, food processing, check printing and telecommunications. The most suitable candidates have been well-established businesses with stable cash flow that is not required for new capital investment.
"Beware of businesses with significant reinvestment needs," warned Gordon Tait, who watches income trusts at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Calgary.
The typical yield on an income trust is 8 to 14 percent. Most have also produced significant capital growth. An income trust index compiled by BMO Nesbitt Burns gained 6.4 percent in the 12 months ended March 31, compared with a 17.1 percent decline in the S.& P./TSX composite. Many Canadians protect the distributions from taxes by holding the trusts in registered retirement savings plans.
The Canadian trusts have received relatively little attention from Americans, in part because of the small size of most of the offerings, typically around 250 million Canadian dollars each, and because of the uncertainties of investing in foreign securities.
United States residents are subject to a 15 percent Canadian withholding tax, though this can be applied as a credit against American taxes. Under Canadian law, no more than half the units of any trust may be held by foreigners. Currency risk is also an issue, because almost all the trusts, including those listed in New York, pay their distributions in Canadian dollars. The currency has strengthened in recent months; it now trades at68.85 American cents.
Michael E. Lewitt, president of Harch Capital Management in Boca Raton, Fla., said that although he is familiar with the securities, his company has not invested in them or recommended them. "It's something we haven't really thought about," he said.
But Mr. Pincus of Goodmans said, "As time goes on, I think we'll see a greater number of American investors participate in this vehicle." 
Some American businesses have raised financing in Canada by selling income trusts. One is the Specialty Foods Group Income Fund, based on a processed-meats business in Cincinnati, which raised 201 million Canadian dollars last month. 
American companies generally have not formed income trusts in the United States because they would be regulated as mutual funds, with strict reporting requirements and limits on fees, according to Andrew F. Viles, a partner at the law firm of Goodwin Procter in Boston. From an investor's point of view, he said, "one of the great things is that it's like a fixed-income product, so long as the business continues to perk along as it has."
The trusts' risks stem from their status as equity holdings. The absence of any cash-reserve buffer makes them especially vulnerable to changing business conditions, but some investors may not be aware of that. "You've got widows and orphans buying units and expecting dividends on a regular basis," said Kenneth Pearce, a partner at the law firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon here. 
THE risks were evident late last month when the Halterm Income Fund, whose main asset is a container port in Halifax, Nova Scotia, suspended income distributions after two shipping lines moved their business elsewhere. And the Sun Gro Horticulture Income Fund of Bellevue, Wash., whose underlying business is North America's biggest peat moss distributor, warned last month that its earnings for the 12 months ended March 31 would not be enough to cover distributions. 
The prices of both trusts' units, which are listed on the Toronto exchange, have slumped sharply.
Leslie A. Lundquist, who manages an income trust fund for Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, Alberta, cautioned that the trusts, by and large, "are fully valued, and there are probably pockets that are more than fully valued." Still, Ms. Lundquist said, "if you choose your trust carefully, you can get very nice cash distributions, even if you do see a bit of weakness in the capital value."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Next Time, Follow the Spenders, Not the Talkers

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WHERE is the big relief rally in stocks that so many strategists have predicted and even more investors have been pining for? As with all the any-minute-now rebounds since the stock market peaked more than three years ago, this one is AWOL. 
 It is especially exasperating to many investors that the stock market has shrugged off not only the quick United States military victory in Iraq but also the reports on Friday of an increase in consumer confidence and retail sales in March. For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent; for the year, it is down 1.3 percent. 
 Before the war, many market pundits had reasoned that the prospects of a conflict were weighing on stocks. Once the successful prosecution of the war became obvious, many of these people predicted that shares would surge. Instead, they have struggled. 
It brings back memories of January 2001, when Alan Greenspan started lowering interest rates. Remember the soothsayers who noted that stock prices were always higher six months after a series of interest-rate cuts began? 
Stock market strategists are often wrong, of course, and not only because they are human. Many are also in the business of generating trading commissions for their firms. Such commissions are far more likely to come from bullish pronouncements than from advice that investors remain on the sidelines or bet against rising stock prices.
Investors are understandably interested in an intelligent assessment of where the market might be headed. But rather than rely on big-name strategists for a view, investors should look at the expectations of large institutional investors, based on their actual bets made in stock-index futures. 
These derivative securities allow investors to bet on where they think the indexes, like the S.& P. 500, are going. RiskMetrics, a financial analytics company in New York, has analyzed S.& P. futures prices and determined how many investors are moderately positive, wildly optimistic or outright negative about the overall market for the next three months. 
At the moment, for example, while many strategists are calling for a hefty rally, only 19 percent of futures investors have bet that the S.& P. will rise more than 10 percent. Most of these investors -- 62 percent -- appear to believe that the index will trade in a range of plus or minus 10 percent. Some 14 percent have wagered that it will be 10 to 25 percent lower in three months. 
Professional traders in the government bond market use a similar tool -- federal funds rate futures -- to assess the thinking among investors about where interest rates might go. Bond traders either bet alongside or against these expectations.
Investors in stock-index futures can be wrong, of course. But a look at recent history shows that a majority has often been correct. For instance, in early January 2001, while the pundits were pounding the table for stocks, 54 percent of stock-index futures players had wagered that the index would remain in a range of plus or minus 10 percent. And 12 percent had made bets that the index would fall as much as 25 percent within three months. By the end of March, the S.& P. had fallen 9.6 percent.
And at the end of November last year, as investors bid up stocks on the glimmers of an economic rebound, 60 percent of stock-futures investors had bet that the rally was unsustainable. They were right. 
"This is an assessment of what investors in the S.& P. futures market believe, so it gives you a real feel for the actual money that is being bet on where the market is going," said Michael Thompson, a risk strategist at RiskMetrics. "It is the voice of the market rather than the voice of an individual strategist." 
And considerably more credible.

Carrying On When Suits Are in Camouflage

BYLINE:  By FARA WARNER 

 BODY:
DANIEL TRAVERS considers himself lucky. Before he was called to active duty in Iraq, Mr. Travers, a colonel in the Marine Reserves, was able to train a "second in command" to take over his civilian job as a logistics manager at Siemens Westinghouse Power in Orlando, Fla.
 But his co-workers are still coping with his absence. "People have come to depend on his strong personality and his leadership abilities," said his boss, Rick A. Merker. "His absence has left a vacuum." 
 As the armed forces rely heavily on reservists like Colonel Travers, 47, to fill important roles in the Middle East and at home, companies are quickly learning that dealing with the absence of important executives goes far beyond completing day-to-day tasks.
Much harder is filling in the gaps in creative, managerial and other skills that make many reservists so valuable in their civilian jobs.
At Ask Jeeves, an Internet search company in Emeryville, Calif., colleagues of Ronald W. Burkett, an account manager who is also a major in the Army reserves, are keeping in touch with his main clients, including Hewlett-Packard and the Navy. Major Burkett, a former Apache helicopter pilot, is on active duty in Houston, training soldiers on computer programs that help them simulate air and ground missions.
But his colleagues at Ask Jeeves said they couldn't replace the skills that help Major Burkett, who is known as Win, bring in sales.
"Revenue is really important during these economic times," said A. George Battle, chief executive of Ask Jeeves. "Win is one of our best producers, and we're a small company. We have people who can fill in, but that's like saying the Chicago Bulls know everything that Michael Jordan can do."
Reservists are also hard to replace in the military.
More than 218,000 reservists and members of the National Guard have been put on active duty because of the action in Iraq. That is the largest call-up since the Persian Gulf war, when about 265,000 reservists were called to active duty, according to the Defense Department.
Reservists and members of the National Guard -- all 1.22 million of them -- now make up 48 percent of all the armed forces, according Lt. Col. Stephen G. Brozak, a Marine reservist who is the spokesman for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.
The support agency operates a Web site, www.esgr.org, that provides information about the Reserves and the National Guard and civilian employment requirements.
"Reservists have become indispensable to the military as it has downsized -- there's been a 40 percent reduction in military personnel in the past decade," Colonel Brozak said. "Some military positions now are filled solely by reservists."
Reservists are even filling senior-level military positions. Last August, for example, James M. Collins Jr., a major general in the Army Reserve, took a three-year leave from his job at Weyerhaeueser to become the deputy commanding general and chief of staff of First Corps, stationed at Fort Lewis in the state of Washington.
General Collins says the Army has increasingly turned to the Reserves and National Guard to find people with specific skills. Sometimes, as in his case, skills are found in those who have worked both inside and outside the military.
Weyerhaeuser, he said, decided not to replace him as manager of information technology while he was on active duty, instead assigning his duties among other employees.
Though reservists often fill jobs in the United States, many are serving in combat zones. Colonel Travers was in Iraq in early April as deputy commander of the Marine Rear Area Operations Group. His job in the military mirrors his civilian job managing inventory and distribution.
Dr. Michael J. Paletta, the corporate medical officer for the Hospice of Michigan, in Detroit, also has skills that make him crucial to both his military and his civilian bosses. But he has gone even further than Colonel Travers in planning for active duty.
Dr. Paletta, 45, who is a colonel in the Air National Guard and the surgeon general of Michigan, has already written a specific plan so that his staff is ready to take over his patients. But even with such planning, he expects that the staff will face a challenge in caring for the more than 900 terminally ill patients at the hospice -- 170 of whom are under his direct care every day.
"Health care companies are much leaner than they used to be," he said. "There are no surplus executives here."
Dr. Paletta, 45, has not yet been called to active duty, but he is still balancing his civilian and military roles. He has orders with the Air Force that require him to be on call to train medics in combat medicine and in biological and chemical decontamination.
Technology and some advance planning are making it somewhat easier for reservists to keep track of their civilian jobs even when they are on active duty.
Major Burkett, 38, has kept in touch with his colleagues through phone calls and e-mail messages. The colleagues are accustomed to such virtual contact. Major Burkett, who is based in Houston for Ask Jeeves, works with four other sales representatives who work from offices in Massachusetts and California.
Before he left for active duty, Major Burkett was able to send e-mail messages to all his clients to explain his absence. Then he got on his cellphone to his colleagues. "I said: 'Have you got an hour? Because I'm going to a brain dump on everything I know,' " he said.
Despite the planning, Major Burkett's boss, Robyn N. Baer, vice president for account management, said it had been difficult without him.
"Clients fall into two camps," she said. "Some accept people filling in for Win; others say they'll wait for him to come back."
Some companies hire replacements for active-duty reservists, though federal law requires them to hold reservists' jobs open. Many companies voluntarily continue to pay salaries and health care benefits for reservists and their families.
BUT the use of executive replacements often means reconsidering how teams work together -- and what they work on.
When Col. James E. Couch, 50, a first vice president and counsel at Bank One in Columbus, Ohio, went on active duty in December, the two other real estate lawyers in his team felt his absence immediately.
After talking with Colonel Couch, the bank's general counsel, Molly Carpenter, decided to hire another lawyer. "But she's not just doing Jim's job," Ms. Carpenter said. "The whole team's work has been shifted because each lawyer has subspecialties. It's hard to find the same mix as it was when Jim was here."
Unlike some other reservists still in the United States, Colonel Couch has little time to think of anything but his military job. He is the deputy division chief for the Iraq task force at the Army National Ground Intelligence Center in Charlottesville, Va.
"My team keeps in touch," he said. "But they are very gracious about not burdening me with questions about work."

HEADLINE: In Iraqi Fields, Technical and Political Challenges 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
FROM Washington to Baghdad, the oil industry is uniformly regarded as the engine of Iraq's economic revival and eventual political stability. But making the oil flow again will likely take months, and require the Bush administration to cut through a thicket of technical, diplomatic and financial challenges, industry experts say.
 The challenges -- connected and concurrent -- begin with mapping a clear picture of Iraq's oil resources and infrastructure, which have decayed substantially under United Nations sanctions. 
 The technical work may be easy, according to industry experts, compared with the diplomatic horse-trading that the United States will have to do to secure the right to sell Iraqi oil. The Americans will also need to win the trust and assistance of Iraq's well-trained oil technocrats -- a delicate task that will rest partly on whoever is appointed Iraq's oil minister under the temporary civilian authority being established by the United States and Britain. 
"To organize the parties in an industry that is capable of exporting 2.8 million barrels a day is not a trivial task," said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "It's a big operation. Even for people to get up the learning curve and find the right people to talk to takes time."
By many estimates, Iraq's oil reserves are the third largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia's and Canada's. Iraq could vault ahead in such rankings once its territory, much of it unexplored for oil, is probed more thoroughly by the oil industry. 
Iraq's oil comes cheaply because drilling for it is relatively easy. And for years, Iraq's great advantage over its neighbors was a national oil industry filled with highly competent engineers and geologists and mostly devoid of corruption, foreign oil experts say.
But two wars and 12 years of sanctions have ravaged the Iraqi oil sector, as the flow of spare parts and technology to the country has dwindled. During the next several weeks, the military will have to secure the oil fields and assess the state of the industry, foreign executives and oil experts said. 
Though the major southern field, Rumaila, is already in British hands, and it appears that American special forces have taken over the Kirkuk field in the north, military explosives specialists are still working to ensure that the hundreds of oil wells in those regions have not been booby-trapped, said Yasser Elguindi, a managing director at Medley Global Advisors, a consulting firm in New York.
Then teams of engineers from oil-field service companies will have to scour the wells to determine their condition after a decade of often slapdash, make-do management that most outside experts think has badly damaged many oil reservoirs. Contracts have not yet been let.
"You want to give an interim Iraqi authority every tool to be successful, and oil is a part of that," Mr. Elguindi said. "There is an urgency to getting the sector up and running, but the administration is not going to cut corners. People take for granted how complex and hard it is to get oil fields up and running, especially when they have been shut down or mishandled."
AS it tries to revive Iraq's oil wells, the administration will also be working to find a way to export the oil. Toward that end, the United States and the other members of the United Nations Security Council have just begun to discuss revising -- or eliminating -- the oil-for-food program that has governed Iraq's oil sales for the last seven years. 
But many competing interests will be brought to bear on those discussions, diplomats and trade experts said.
Iraq owes billions of dollars in reparations to Kuwait for damage during the Persian Gulf war. Whether the Kuwaitis will insist on immediate reparations is unclear. Iraq also owes countries like Russia about $60 billion, not counting interest, and creditor countries want assurances that their debt will not be ignored.
Moreover, oil companies from Russia and France, two Security Council members, negotiated or signed preliminary deals with the government of Saddam Hussein to develop new oil fields. Those countries, industry experts and diplomats said, are likely to object to a unilateral abrogation of such agreements. 
Those issues are likely to be worked out, many experts said, but it will take time. "Countries should be more interested in cooperating, because reality is reality," Mr. Yergin said, "and I don't think any country wants to be in a position of blocking Iraq from exporting oil again."
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said on Friday that the United States might sell Iraq's oil on its own. That would flout a United Nations resolution that Washington helped draft, calling into question the legality of the sales. Oil traders and executives said companies would then be reluctant to buy Iraqi oil.

HEADLINE: Oil's Pressure Points 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
FOR weeks, oil prices have swung wildly on news from the battlefronts in Iraq. But the painful truth is that Iraq is only the most extreme example of the world's reliance on hot spots to slake the thirst for oil. 
 Through the winter, oil prices climbed steadily, not only in expectation of another Persian Gulf war but also because political strife in Venezuela was choking off that nation's exports. As the fighting began in Iraq, ethnic clashes in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta forced Royal Dutch/Shell, ChevronTexaco and TotalFinaElf to shut down their operations there, slicing the country's oil production by almost 40 percent. 
 Demand for oil continues to rise, bumped ever higher by the growing prosperity of emerging markets like China and India and the unquenchable demand of the United States, by far the world's largest consumer of oil. 
The upshot of all this, energy experts say, is a global oil industry and world oil markets that are more volatile and unpredictable than they have been in a decade. 
Increasingly, oil companies are shying away from holding large stocks of oil and drilling every time oil prices rise, for fear of the financial hit that comes when oil prices plummet. Without that extra cushion of oil at refineries or in storage, consumers have begun to feel every swing of oil prices -- and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. "Volatility is the norm, not the aberration," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. 
OPEC, the cartel that spurred past oil crises by cutting off exports to the West, now tries to steady the market, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others priming the pumps when less-stable producers falter. Under American influence, if not outright control, Iraq's huge reserves may offer further ballast in an uncertain energy world.
But industry experts say the unavoidable reality is that the search for diverse sources of oil -- a keystone of American policy -- is sending the oil industry into one fraught corner of the world after another. And the discovery of oil is itself almost a guarantee of conflict.
"People have to stop thinking that oil markets will be affected by embargoes, because embargoes are a thing of the past," said Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan minister of trade and industry and now editor of the journal Foreign Policy. "The problem is failed states. It's a harbinger of things to come: when internal political turmoil limits oil to world markets."

Prosperity and Consumption
More than anything, the force driving oil companies into ever more perilous parts of the world is the middle-class consumer: the American suburbanite in her sport utility vehicle and the Chinese city dweller behind the wheel of his first car.
Last year, the world burned 76.7 million barrels of oil a day, according to a report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
The United States far outpaces any other country in the consumption of oil. With just 3 percent of the world's population, it consumes more than 25 percent of crude oil, roughly equal to its share of the global economy. 
But industry experts predict that most of the increase in demand for oil over the coming decades will result from growing prosperity in the developing world, led by China. As people there make more money, they buy more products, including cars. As they leave the countryside for cities, they rely on buses and cabs to move around. By 2030, according to to the International Energy Agency, China will import as much oil as the United States does now.
The American economy is not as reliant on oil as it was 20 years ago, mainly because of significant improvements in energy efficiency and a shift away from heavy industry to service businesses. So when oil prices climb, the economy may slow, but it does not easily sink into recession, analysts and economists say.
Nonetheless, American prosperity stokes this country's appetite for oil -- and it shields most consumers from having to adjust their behavior when gasoline prices rise. 
Consumers grumble when oil prices spike, but there has been only the faintest evidence that high pump prices are chilling their ardor for S.U.V.'s. In part, that is because recent gas prices of $2 a gallon or more were still lower, when adjusted for inflation, than the record prices 23 years ago.
The Bush administration has backed long-term research into hydrogen to replace crude oil, but that technology -- at a competitive price -- is still 15 to 20 years away, most experts agree. 
In the meantime, the public debate continues over efforts to slow American oil consumption without damaging the economy. Just Thursday, the House of Representatives rebuffed legislation that would compel automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of S.U.V.'s.

Politics and Production
Eager to reduce America's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the Bush administration has been encouraging the search for oil in new places. 
Yet many of the sites that Washington has lauded for their abundant oil resources are political quagmires, one way or another -- from the steaming Niger Delta to the frigid coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
In Nigeria, the run-up to this month's parliamentary and presidential elections turned bloody when ethnic clashes erupted -- in large part over the complaints of the Ijaw tribe that they had been deprived of their fair share of the proceeds from oil development. The violence has largely abated for now, but dozens of Nigerians died, and major oil companies halted production in parts of the Niger Delta for weeks.
Two years ago, Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force promoted the prospects of big gains in Nigerian production. But the problems have highlighted the risks rather than the opportunities. 
Because the sweet crude from Nigeria is particularly good for making gasoline, refineries on the East Coast rely on it, especially as the United States enters the spring and summer driving season. It is still unclear how the temporary curtailment in Nigerian exports will affect American gasoline prices.
Oil and government interests in the United States have nurtured ties to Venezuela for decades, as a conveniently close supplier. But there, too, politics has interfered recently with oil production, as a popular strike against President Hugo Chavez's rule sliced oil exports for months by more than 80 percent from usual levels of about 3.1 million barrels a day.
The government has restored exports to about 2.5 million barrels a day, even as 17,000 oil company employees remain off the job -- but not beforethe oil markets had driven home the vulnerability of supplies that had never been cause for worry.
"Even if there were no Iraq crisis, what happened in Venezuela and Nigeria would have registered at the gas pumps," said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "What no one pays attention to is that the disruption of Venezuela was even larger than Iraq.
"The working assumption" in oil markets, Mr. Yergin added, has to be "that there will be political turbulence or other kind of turbulence."
Despite the volatility abroad, most major oil companies, including American ones, are steadily shifting their investments away from the United States. Oil production is declining in the United States, where proven reserves are small. For big payoffs, companies are turning to more technologically challenging -- and therefore more expensive -- areas here, like the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
But sites in the United States come with their own political perils. The administration and its Congressional allies, for example, see the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as the next big drilling opportunity in the United States. Yet opposition from many Democrats and environmental groups has for years kept the refuge off-limits for exploration.
The seemingly endless battle has quelled the oil industry's enthusiasm. Though oil companies publicly back the administration, most executives say in confidence that they would rather look elsewhere. No one really knows how much oil is in the refuge, they say, and they worry that drilling would be stymied for years by legal fights -- or that leases would be reversed if Washington shifted from support to opposition of development.
This world of uncertainty, industry experts say, underscores the fact that the sole oil producer that can dampen volatility is Saudi Arabia.
When Venezuelan exports plummeted this winter, for example, Saudi production rose sharply -- and American imports from Saudi Arabia climbed to record highs.
"Saudi Arabia is the central bank of oil," said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consulting group. "When things go wrong, they deliver. They always do things that are good for oil markets, and they know that extreme prices and disruptions are not good."

Prospects and Technology
 The West, though, is uncomfortable relying on the kindness of Saudi Arabia and on other big producers, like Russia and Mexico, that also guard their oil resources jealously.
Big oil companies complain that because they cannot work in many of the world's richest fields, production is growing at a far slower pace than they had forecast just a year ago. 
Many American and British companies have core projects in the North Sea, Alaska and the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, all areas where oil production is declining. Earlier this year, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell and ChevronTexaco announced that they had missed their production growth targets for 2002 and would no longer offer forecasts.
The prospects are not all bleak. Competitors are closely watching BP's plans, announced in February, to plow $6.75 billion into a development partnership in Russia. 
And as the Bush administration fashions a plan to govern Iraq after the war, it hopes to foster institutions that make the country a model of peaceful, democratic governance for oil-exporting states. The raw material is promising, regional experts say, including a domestic oil bureaucracy whose managers and scientists are widely respected for their professionalism and lack of venality.
Much closer to home, the United States already has a large, stable supplier of oil in Canada, with proven oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's.
Canada supplies 17 percent of American oil imports, more than Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. Conventional oil reserves in western Canada are gradually declining, but they are being replaced by new oil fields off the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and deposits of tarlike oil sands in northern Alberta.
The drawback of the Canadian oil sands is the high cost of production. "Instead of 50 cents a barrel in the Middle East, it's more like $6 or $7," said Brian Prokop, an energy analyst at Peters & Company in Calgary, Alberta. The oil sands are either mined or extracted by injecting huge amounts of hot water underground, after which the tar is processed into crude oil.
Such technology is the main reason production has remained viable. Another example is deep-water production in the Gulf of Mexico, which would not be possible or economically feasible without the great strides made in seismic technology and drilling methods. 
In testimony before Congress recently, Mr. Yergin predicted that new oil technology could expand world oil reserves by 125 billion barrels -- more than the proven reserves of Iraq.
"We're in one of those periods when a technological revolution is changing the economics and capabilities of the oil industry," he said in an interview. "What technology does is lower the costs and expand the horizons. And it keeps pushing the day of shortage and depletion out into the future."

HEADLINE: Farewell to Supersonic Travel 

 BODY:
Time is money, but only up to a point. That is the bittersweet lesson of the supersonic Concorde's retirement, announced Thursday by British Airways and Air France. 
For three decades, the needle-nose jet, travel's ultimate status symbol, has been able to hurtle passengers across the Atlantic at twice the speed of sound. But the economics have never caught up with the technology. 
 The Concorde burns twice as much fuel as a lumbering Boeing 747 and carries only a fourth the number of passengers. A generation of caviar-fed Wall Street bankers, Hollywood stars and other celebrities have relished flying high enough to see the earth's curvature and beating the clock, arriving in New York an hour or two earlier than they departed Europe. But despite the high fares, their glamorous crossings were subsidized for the sake of aviation's glory, and European pride. Americans have never built a supersonic airliner. 
 And we won't be doing so for the foreseeable future. Because of airlines' lack of interest, Boeing has scrapped its planned Sonic Cruiser. That leaves nothing revolutionary in commercial aviation's discernible future. Almost a half-century after it was conceived -- at a time when people assumed there would be passenger flights to the moon in the early 21st century -- the Concorde will remain the plane of tomorrow, even in retirement.

CAPITAL CITY:
New York City and the Men Behind America's Rise to Economic Dominance, 1860-1900
By Thomas Kessner
Simon & Schuster
($27, hardcover)
 In the fullness of New York's economy, the metropolitan business elite were so divided in their needs and interests, in their outlooks, preferences, commitments and beliefs, that they never managed to form a single power elite or to exert consistent political control. 
 This lack of unity did not prevent them from recognizing a common fear. Jay Gould was not being disingenuous when he testified before the U.S. Senate in 1883 that capital feared the rapidly accumulating masses of "uneducated ignorant people" from abroad, who might turn against property. Periodic outbreaks of labor violence only deepened these fears.
 The rich did not need reformers and socialists to remind them that they were but a minority and that they ought not treat too cavalierly the smoldering bitterness of the poor.
 This helps explain the new philanthropic urge among the corporate class. Earlier millionaires had not made much of an impression with their giving. The superwealthy, a New York Times editorial declared in 1879, were "very cheap here," meaning that they abounded in the metropolis, though the Times would also accept the second meaning. William B. Astor died with his fortune intact. Cornelius Vanderbilt left his money only to those who carried his name (while the city got a frieze emblazoned with his likeness). A.T. Stewart had no children to leave it to, but he parted with precious little nonetheless. William Rhinelander, another of New York's rags-to-riches crowd, ignored the city where he had made his fortune. Elsewhere, the wealthy did good, but, the editorialist griped, not in New York. 
 It was not long, however, before the "new wealthy" adopted a style of giving at great variance with the "modest" Stewarts, Vanderbilts and Astors. Morgan, Carnegie and Rockefeller ushered in a regime of philanthropy on a monumental scale. 
 Endowed with more generous budgets than the United States Treasury, and possessing a freedom of action that no official body could match, the Carnegie and Rockefeller charities, for example, with perhaps $1 billion between them, went on to attack disease, build public libraries, reform medical education, erect low-cost housing, fund Negro colleges and advance an agenda for social and cultural progress, while Morgan hauled more art to New York than the Medici gave Florence.

THE LAST GOOD SEASON: Brooklyn, the Dodgers and Their Final Pennant Race Together
By Michael Shapiro
Doubleday
($24.95, hardcover)
 A housing project stands where Ebbets Field once stood. It is possible to walk through the project's grounds and find the spots where the players once stood -- Carl Furillo's right field is a parking lot that continues as far as Duke Snider's center. So too is it possible to walk past a black wrought iron fence onto the spot where the marble rotunda rose up and walk straight ahead until the place where people first encountered the first great burst of stadium light and grass.
 A mile or so away, on the site where Walter O'Malley dreamed of building his stadium, stands a defunct appliance store. The site that Robert Moses had long before intended for the Dodgers or the Giants or any team he could find to fill the place is, of course, Shea Stadium in Queens. Shea itself is a much-despised park, a bland bowl whose only urban trappings are the auto parts stores that line the far side of the parking lot. 
 There is talk of tearing the place down and building a replacement in the parking lot. The new park would be called Jackie Robinson Stadium. It would, if it is ever built, have a retractable roof but otherwise look like a replica of Ebbets Field.
 The stadium, however, would sit at the confluence of highways, not city streets, which runs contrary to the idea of what Ebbets Field represented. It is an idea that other planners have incorporated in the new parks in Baltimore, Cleveland, Detroit, Seattle, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, San Francisco and other cities that had built and then torn down parks like Shea. It is the reason Chicagoans fill Wrigley Field even when the Cubs are dreadful.
 Ebbets Field was a city ballpark, a ballpark to which people could walk. They could pass it on their way to work, and hear the noise from inside when they were heading someplace else. It sat in the middle of a place where many people lived.

IN THE SHADOW OF SLAVERY: African Americans in New York City, 1626-1863
By Leslie M. Harris
University of Chicago Press
($42.50, hardcover)
Locally, black abolitionist-reformers continued their attempts to reshape the lives of New York's black workers. Some black abolitionists were able to unite their belief in moral uplift and abolition with practical programs to improve the conditions of black workers. 
 In 1839, the abolitionist and former sailor William Powell opened the Colored Sailors' Home at the corner of John and Gold Streets in Lower Manhattan. Powell was born the free son of a slave father in 1807 in upstate New York. After an elementary education, he apprenticed as a sailor.
 In the 1830's, he married and settled in New Bedford, Mass., where he opened his first boarding house for sailors. ... He was an active participant in the American Anti-Slavery Society and the New England Anti-Slavery Society, as well as in efforts to obtain equal rights for blacks in Massachusetts.
 In 1839, Powell moved with his wife and children to New York City, where he operated the Colored Sailors' Home under the auspices of the predominantly white American Seamen's Friend Society. Powell provided food, clothing and shelter for black sailors in port, and an employment agency for sailors wishing to return to sea. In the boarding house, "the banner of Reform float ed conspicuous." 
Powell established the home as an alternative to the rowdy conditions of other sailors' boarding houses. No alcohol was allowed; the house held a library and reading room; and" at meal time, and every occasion of interview, conversations were introduced on the various questions incidental to the elevation of man." 

SOUTH BRONX RISING: The Rise, Fall and Resurrection of an American City
By Jill Jonnes
Fordham University Press
($25, hardcover)
Just half a mile east of the Fox estate flowed the Bronx River, once crystal clear and lively. Various mills, particularly woolen mills, had sprouted along the banks in colonial days to avail themselves of the river's natural power and highly regarded cleansing qualities. Where Boston Road crossed its waters stood the village of West Farms, a name that came to encompass the nearby estates.
 In 1899 (William) Fox, president of the first gas company of America, sold his 86-acre estate for $1 million to the American Real Estate Company. Within the month it was announced that the elevated subway would follow Southern Boulevard out to West Farms. There ensued years of blasting and clearing as sewers and streets and sidewalks were imposed upon the former countryside, transforming it into part of the growing city.
 New York had already acquired nearby Crotona Park, 154 acres just north of Charlotte Street, from the Bathgate family. Alexander Bathgate, a Scotsman, had come to the Bronx in the early 19th century to work as the foreman for the first Gouverneur Morris. Eventually he saved enough to purchase the land from the second Gouverneur. When the Parks Commission bought the property in 1895, it was assumed that it would be known as Bathgate Park, after the former owner.
 A dispute with the family embittered a commission engineer, however, who retaliated by naming the park Crotona. This was an ancient Greek city in southern Italy thatwas home to the philosopher Pythagorasand many famous athletic teams. Perhaps the commissioners envisioned the rambling greensward, the large lake, many ball fields, and playing courts, as a haven for both philosophers and brawnv athletes.

NEW YORK CITY: A Short History
By George J. Lankevich
New York University Press
($17.95, paperback)
 Hopeful dreams must have stimulated the mind of King Francis I of France when he hired an Italian sailor-explorer, allowed him to borrow a 100-ton ship from the French navy, and sent him our on the historic trip that gave France an early claim to much of North America.
 On April 17, 1524, Francis I's Florentine captain, Giovanni da Verrazano (1485-1528), a brilliant navigator who was also a part-time pirate, blundered into what today we call the Narrows at the entrance of New York Harbor. Verrazano anchored his ship, the Dauphine, sent long boats into the bay, and noted the "very agreeable location situated within two prominent hills." 
 The sailors rowing into the bay must have seen Manhattan Island because they caught a glimpse of a "great river" before sudden squalls forced them and the Dauphine to withdraw. In retrospect, Verrazano seems amazingly lacking in curiosity, for he then sailed away and so forfeited his chance to be the first European to set foot in New York. 
 After naming the Upper bay after Santa Margarita, he cruised northward to Block Island and the Maine coast. In July, when he returned to France, he told Francis that an uncrossable continent stood between Europe and China. In 1964, Verrazano's name was selected to designate what was then the world's longest suspension bridge. 
 During the 1500's the tale of a vast "Sea of Verrazano," told by the twin brother of the explorer, drew other adventurous captains to New York. In January 1526, a Portuguese explorer in the service of Spain, Esteban Gomez, also sighted the "great river" and named it after San Antonio, but he, too, then sailed on.

New Fears Rise, Old Fears Stir

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; E-mail: amh@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR some, the war in Iraq may be a sideshow to the main event of this still-young century, the international war on terrorism. But for a lot of New Yorkers, who had just started to feel better after the attack on the World Trade Center, the war, though thousands of miles away, and a few days ago triumphally winding down, has reopened the psychic wounds of 9/11.
 These people see a link between their feelings then and now, of anxiety, insecurity, even panic. If post-traumatic stress disorder were not an overused diagnosis, that might be part of it. 
 Two New Yorkers for whom the war has been an emotional turning point are Janet Sabel and Dinah PoKempner. Although Ms. Sabel and Ms. PoKempner have never met, they have several things in common. Both are lawyers for good causes and live with their husbands and young children on the Upper West Side. They both sailed through 9/11, which happened in their city. 
 But they did not sail through the war, which was far more remote. Maybe that is because 9/11 softened them up for trauma, or maybe battle stress is real whether it comes in the heat of battle or after the battle is over.
 On Sept. 11, 2001, the first hijacked plane flew past the window of Ms. Sabel's Legal Aid office, across Vesey Street from the towers. She and her colleagues have never returned, because the building remains contaminated with heavy metals. 
 Ms. Sabel took comfort in her work, helping victims of the attack who had lost their homes and jobs. "I was on a mission," she said. "I was an obsessed person. I was never so grateful for doing the work that I do."
 The other day, sitting near the 107th Street soccer field in Riverside Park in drizzly rain, watching her son's team lose 5-0, she admitted that after two years of what -- denial? resilience? -- she felt punched in the stomach. 
 Ms. Sabel, 47, is an accomplished woman, accustomed to being in control of her destiny. The war made her feel helpless. "I had anxiety attacks," she confessed. In the subway, there were times when she felt unable to breathe. When she listened to the war news, she cried every time Sept. 11 was mentioned.
 Unlike the attack of Sept. 11, the war shattered her sense of her city as a fundamentally safe place. "For the people of our generation," she said, "this was the first time as a parent we said, 'Oh, my God, I have to protect the kids."' When she looked at the unsuspecting faces of her children, she imagined bombs falling. Perils that once seemed real -- that her children might fall off a mountain while hiking, for example -- seemed puny.
 "Will we hear the bombs?" asked her son, Henry, 11, who sublimates anxiety through information. "No," his mother replied, thinking to herself, "Not until they're here."
 Ms. PoKempner also had a delayed reaction. As general counsel for Human Rights Watch, which investigates human rights abuses in places like South Africa, Cambodia and now Iraq, she took the attack of Sept. 11 in stride. "I didn't have any sense right after 9/11 that the world had changed," she said. "I thought, 'Oh, the world has finally come to America. I know that world."'
 She likened the terrorist attack to an unexpected spike in crime: with the right police tactics, she told herself, the problem could be brought under control. But standing in a friend's kitchen last week, seven months pregnant with her third child, her husband out of the country on a business trip, she felt the world had become a much scarier place.
 "I am more afraid now than after 9/11," she said. Pointing to her children, frolicking near the stove, she explained: "I am afraid for them."
 The war may be in its final stages, but there remains the fear of what will happen next. Will Al Qaeda resurface? Will there be war in Iran or Syria? Will there be retaliation from the Arab world?
 Ms. PoKempner fears that, in a city known for dissent, her children will grow up in today's equivalent of the Red Scare. She fears that war will cripple the economy, leaving no money for schools like Public School 87, where her son goes.
 Offended by the sight of G.I. Joe dolls at Zany Brainy, a toy store near her West 93rd Street apartment, she responded by taking her children to an antiwar rally. Sophie, who is 4, was enchanted by a slogan she heard there: "Drop Bush, not bombs." If bombs fell on their apartment, she asked, "Will you and Daddy and Elijah hide under my bed?"
 "Yes," Ms. PoKempner said. She added that bombs would not fall on New York, because that is what mothers everywhere have always told their children. You are safe. You are loved. I will live forever.

News From the Front Fails to Lift Stocks

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
Despite major advances by United States and British forces in Iraq, the three major stock market indexes fell modestly for the week, amid light volume, as many traders turned their attention to corporate earnings reports expected in coming days.
 On Friday, upbeat economic reports on retail sales and consumer sentiment failed to stir the market, nor did White House declarations that the regime of Saddam Hussein was effectively over. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 73.74 points, or 0.89 percent, to close at 8,203.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.55 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 868.30. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 24.66 points, or 1.78 percent, to close at 1,358.85.
 Shares of I.B.M. and Microsoft, both of which are to report earnings this week, were among the worst performers among the Dow industrials. Hewlett-Packard shares also fell sharply, even though the company won a $3 billion contract from Procter & Gamble, beating out I.B.M. McDonald's, which said that it would pare capital spending this year, rose 8.45 percent, the Dow's biggest gain. 
 Yields on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.98 per-cent from 3.95 percent a week earlier. JEFF SOMMER

Invasion Is Easy. Occupation Is Hard.

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
A little history is a dangerous thing. And history is being brandished like a weapon right now in Iraq to shape the terms of the peace.
 Scenes of jubilant Iraqis, handing flowers to American soldiers in the streets of Baghdad, may evoke images of liberating troops in World War II, but for most of history, occupation has rarely been welcome or benign. Rather, it meant imperial conquest or retribution for defeat. Occupying armies were rapacious looters of the land and symbols of humiliation. 
 The question now is what it will mean for Iraqis, once the reality of a continuing foreign presence has sunk in. "We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects the rights of all citizens," President Bush told the Iraqis. "And then our military forces will leave." 
If only it were that easy. In reality, even the best intended of occupations often come to grief. "It's pretty hard to be a historian and to be optimistic," said Gaddis Smith, professor of history emeritus of Yale, surveying the sorry history of occupation. 
In 1898, the United States proclaimed that it was waging war on Spain to liberate Cuba and the Philippines from Spanish colonial oppression. Americans built roads and schools, but absorbed the nationalist rage once directed at the Spanish. A brutal American suppression of a Philippine insurgency, and eventual revolution in Cuba, ensued. The British liberated Greece from Germany after World War II, only to be drawn into a conflict between the monarchists they supported and the Communists. Even in Japan, todary regarded as a model occupation, the Americans were hated in Okinawa, which they ruled virtually as a colony. 
Yet if history tilts toward the pessimists, what does it teach America to avoid, or embrace, in Iraq?
1. Get out fast. 
Ahmed Abdu Al Rudda, greeting American soldiers from the 101st Airborne in Iraq on Wednesday, offered a warning: "We want them to finish Saddam Hussein, we want them to leave. Then we can be friends."
His sentiments are echoed by many scholars of the Middle East, as well as students of other occupations. The Israelis drove the Palestine Liberation Organization out of Lebanon but stayed in the south for 18 years, alienating the Shiites of southern Lebanon and helping turn Hezbollah into a deadly foe. 
In contrast, Americans acted swiftly and wisely in Germany, said Stanley Hoffmann, a Harvard professor and a scholar of international relations. "The lesson there was that it was a brief period and by 1949 they had regained fairly full sovereignty under someone who was anything but a stooge, Konrad Adenauer," he said. "Nor was he an exile." 
Nile Gardiner, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, points to the long-running United Nations administration of Bosnia and Kosovo as models to avoid. "The key lesson of history is that we cannot impose a government long-term on Iraq," he said. "We have to send a message to the rest of the Arab world that this is not a colonial occupation."
2. Build democracy slowly. 
How long does an occupier have to stay to instill democracy? "It's easier to create new institutions and democracy if you're willing to have U.S. troops occupy the country for nearly a decade," said Nancy E. Soderberg, vice president of the International Crisis Group. 
That is what happened in postwar Japan, where the United States deployed 100,000 Americans and stayed for seven years. They wrote Japan's constitution to disavow war, redistributed land to poor tenant farmers, wove praise of democracy into school textbooks and guaranteed the rights of organized labor. 
"If six months from now America has packed its bags and left, there's a very small chance that Iraq will be a real democracy," said Fareed Zakaria, author of "The Future of Freedom" (W.W. Norton, 2003). 
He said the Americans should quickly turn over authority to Iraqis who are perceived as legitimate. Then the United States and other nations should help create the prerequisites for democracy -- the rule of law, a system to balance competing ethnic and religious interests, economic reforms -- before the divisive process of holding elections. This is a crucial lesson of the United Nations experience in Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor and Cambodia.
3. Work though the locals. 
In Japan and Germany, American generals ruled, but local bureaucracies remained. For many Japanese or Germans, then, the face of government was familiar, which helped bestow a degree of legitimacy. 
Andrew Gordon, professor of Japanese history at Harvard, said many of the reforms the American occupation put in place had been backed by Japanese intellectuals, farmers, bureaucrats, labor unionists or women's groups. The Americans joined forces with those who shared their vision. 
That begs the question, said Mr. Gordon, who opposes the war in Iraq, whether such constituencies exist in Iraq today. Or whether there are enough untainted Iraqis to assemble a viable civil service. 
"Iraq is probably more Baathisized than Germany was Nazified," said Ian Buruma, the author of "Wages of Guilt," a study of how Germany and Japan view their wartime history. 
4. Avoid carpetbagging.
In hindsight, the American occupation of Japan succeeded in part because the country was in ruins and had no natural resources. In Iraq, the United States faces suspicions that it is really after oil -- suspicions that will only intensify if American companies are disproportionately awarded lucrative contracts to rebuild Iraq, or if America is seen as looting the oil itself. 
5. Win hearts and minds. 
The United States had not only unleashed the horror of atomic warfare on Japan, it had deliberately used Japanese civilians as the targets, firebombing 64 Japanese cities and killing tens of thousands. So why were the Americans embraced? 
Japanese citizens "had been led to expect brutality, the same sort of thing that the Japanese had done to others," Mr. Buruma said. "There was such relief that didn't happen that it led to gratitude and compliance."
In addition, Mr. Gordon said, after years of total warfare, the Japanese blamed their leaders as much as the Americans for their suffering, and no one questioned the Americans' right to occupy them.
It is not clear how much resentment Iraqis nurse toward the United States, or to what degree American largesse will win them over. In the near term, will American soldiers be seen as welcome enforcers of order, curbing the anarchy that has erupted in Iraq, or a hated police force? 
6. All occupations are unique. 
Iraq is riven by ethnic and religious tensions, more like Kosovo or Bosnia than Germany or Japan. And the global context of this war is different than World War II. John W. Dower, the foremost historian of the American occupation of Japan, points out that Iraq's neighbors are hostile to an American occupation, while Japan's neighbors welcomed the Americans. 
Both the optimists and the pessimists can draw ammunition from history, but history is always an uncertain oracle. "None of this means it's impossible," Mr. Zakaria said. "It just means it's hard."

Rebuilding the Alliance to Rebuild Globalization

BYLINE:  By JOHN MICKLETHWAIT and ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE; John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, who write for The Economist, have just published "The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea" and a paperback edition of "A Future Perfect: The Challenge of Globalization."

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
ALL wars end in reconstruction. This time the most visible reconstruction will be in Iraq -- in the form of roads, hospitals and, hopefully, a parliament. But there is the additional challenge of rebuilding the Western alliance: with President Jacques Chirac of France meeting with the leaders of Russia and Germany, the Elysee Palace and the White House seem so far apart. Yet rebuilding the alliance is key if the Bush administration is to rebuild an idea that Washington has championed for half a century: globalization.
 The fact that globalization could be in trouble is yet another sign of how much the world has changed since Sept. 11, 2001. Before the terrorist attacks, the ever-freer movement of goods, services, ideas and people seemed inevitable. All the economic indicators pointed toward greater global integration. Foreign direct investment topped $1.3 trillion in 2000. The Internet and the wireless phone promised to destroy distance. American culture appeared ubiquitous: you had to go deep into China to escape Leonardo diCaprio. 
 Now an old lesson is being painfully relearned. Far from being inevitable, globalization is a complicated, precarious process that relies on political will as much as economic logic. Trade barriers do not lift by magic; first, politicians have to pass laws.
The current era of globalization is inextricably entangled with the same Western alliance that now seems so precarious. Both were born in America near the end of World War II. The United Nations was created in San Francisco in 1945. At Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, America created its economic equivalents -- the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- and prepared the way for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (forerunner of the World Trade Organization). Just as America poured military resources into NATO, it poured $120 billion (in today's dollars) into the Marshall Plan -- to recreate a Europe strong enough to trade with. Indeed, European countries had to lower tariffs to get Marshall aid. 
The results were dramatic. World trade, which had contracted in the early 1930's, grew by 7.25 percent a year in the quarter-century after 1948. Most of the initial burst of prosperity was limited to Europe, America and Japan. Yet over the past two decades, liberalization spread to the developing world. In the 1990's, according to the World Bank, the gross domestic product per person in the 24 most globalized developing countries (with the highest ratio of trade to national income) rose at an average rate of 5 percent a year; over the same period it fell by 1 percent a year in the less global developing countries. 
Given these numbers, it is easy to see why people once believed that globalization was unstoppable. But since Sept. 11, things look different. Thanks to new security checks, goods and people move far less easily than they once did. World trade, which bounded ahead by 7 percent a year in the 1990's, seems to have stalled. Americans and Europeans have been squabbling over everything from food and "cultural products" to aircraft and farm subsidies -- and that is before you mention"freedom fries." Last week, the I.M.F.'s World Economic Outlook forecast "below-trend" growth for both sides of the Atlantic. 
The current fracture in the Western alliance seems ominous. What better way for Europeans to resist American imperialism and protect their farmers than keeping out America's genetically modified beef? What better way for Americans to punish "Old Europe" than by keeping out its wine? Washington is already talking about rewarding countries that support its foreign policy with bilateral trade deals.
The arguments about the Western alliance and globalization have a strange symmetry. Many in Europe feel that the biggest threat to the global order is not rogue states, but the dominance of America: hence the need to shackle it with treaties and multilateral organizations. They feel the same about American-style capitalism. To the French and other supporters of stakeholder capitalism, le capitalisme sauvage is a beast that needs to be tamed by all sorts of rules -- like the French law that bans people from working more than 35 hours a standard week. 
The debate will endure because it as much about the future of the European Union as the Western alliance. The French and Germans want the European Union to be a counterbalance to the United States, both in terms of geopolitical influence and economic style. The British have a far more liberal notion of the European Union as a free-trading area, powered by American-style companies. Le Monde has suggested that there are two Europes: "European Europe" and "American Europe."
Meanwhile, Washington seems nervous about the creed that it has championed for so long. A recent study of voting habits in Congress by the libertarian Cato Institute counted only 15 members of the House of Representatives and 22 senators as free traders. With a yawning trade deficit, support could ebb further. In fact, one vehicle of protectionism could be free-trade areas: why should the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement bother about global free trade when they have huge internal markets? 
The idea of a world dissolving into two feuding trade blocks might seem pessimistic. But to get really worried, look back at history. On the morning of June 28, 1914, many people on both sides of the Atlantic assumed that the world could only become more global. Who could resist new technologies, like the telephone, the airplane, the car and electricity? Or the logic of free trade, guaranteed by the acknowledged hegemonic power, Britain? 
Then Gavrilo Princip, a young Serbian nationalist, stepped out of the crowd in Sarajevo and shot Archduke Ferdinand. Within months, the world slid into the most ghastly war in history. And even when the war to end all wars was over, the powers once so keen on free trade erected tariff barriers. The world's economies contracted -- and dictators like Hitler and Mussolini built their monstrous tyrannies. It was this tragedy that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman tried to prevent from ever happening again. 
An act of terrorism presaging the end of an age of globalization? That is a terrifying precedent. There is no logical reason why the Western alliance cannot be rebuilt. But politics does not always work logically. These are perilous days for globalization -- regardless of the success in Iraq.

HEADLINE: The World: Uncertainty in North Korea; 
The Watchword Is Restraint

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
IN Iraq, the war may not yet be finished, but in this region, where all eyes are turned toward North Korea, it is already very much the morning after.
 Just as the United States invasion of Iraq has sundered old alliances in the West, the very idea that there might be a war to keep North Korea from becoming a full-fledged nuclear power has been enough to remake diplomacy in the Far East. 
 China recently started intensive consultations aimed at preventing conflict on its border. South Korea, whose new president, Roh Moo Hyun, took office in February pledging to stop his country from being pushed around by its ally, the United States, is suddenly scrambling to ingratiate itself to the Bush administration. 
Japan, which abhors violent solutions, especially in its own neighborhood, and has constitutionally forsworn military action of its own, has been debating the acquisition of deterrent weapons, even as it urges the United States to stick to seeking diplomatic solutions to its differences with North Korea. Russia, too, is getting into the act, wielding its influence in the Security Council to soften any confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang.
The two most difficult countries to fathom amid all of this swirling activity, however, are the main protagonists, the United States and North Korea.
The first rule of experts who watch North Korea is to hedge any predictions about its behavior, which is consistently among the world's most puzzling. Now, in the wake of the Iraq war, uncertainty over American intentions is running almost equally -- and uncharacteristically -- high, officials in this region and analysts of East Asian affairs say. Given this combination, almost no one of any repute is willing to predict how the crisis over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program will unfold over the coming months.
In some sense this is the most dangerous effect of having what appears to be a decisive turn of battle so soon in Iraq, said Scott Snyder, the Korea representative of the Asia Foundation, a San Francisco based research group. There is a concern throughout this region that American officials might draw an overly optimistic lesson about how American power could be applied here.
For months, Washington has hesitated over how and even whether to talk with North Korea. Yet few people, Mr. Snyder included, think the United States is eager to confront the country militarily. Moreover, with universal opposition among the region's countries toward such a use of military force, any American campaign against North Korea would set new standards of unilateralism.
North Korea is wretchedly poor. And since a war would likely ravage South Korea, a close ally of America with the world's 11th largest economy, it would probably leave Washington with the reconstruction bill in the North.
Notwithstanding all of these factors, the biggest fear here is that the famous paranoia of the northern leadership, which President Bush has already lumped with Iraq in the "axis of evil," could cause the United States and North Korea to stumble into war. 
"I was in Pyongyang two weeks ago, and I told the North Koreans I met with that if they want to avoid a crisis they must not cross certain red lines: reprocessing nuclear fuel, selling plutonium abroad, and launching long-range missiles," said Moon Chung In, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul who has been an informal adviser to the last two South Korean administrations. "I told them try to lower your profile, and so far they have been showing remarkable restraint."
North Korea has already confounded expectations that once the Iraq war was launched, it would race to restart its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and begin producing nuclear fuel before America was no longer occupied elsewhere and could respond more easily.
THIS apparent restraint has been interpreted in many ways, ranging from the view that North Korean scientists have run into technical challenges, to the deduction that the country has simply decided to try to preserve an uneasy but (in its view) survivable status quo.
According to this analysis, North Korea may have decided that productive talks with President Bush are unlikely Many analysts also say that next year's elections in the United States could play an important role in the Bush administration's calculations.
"It is going to be very difficult for the U.S. to take a proactive, aggressive approach toward North Korea," said Joel S. Wit, a Korea expert and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "It will take a long time to digest Iraq, and even then, it is going to take a long time, six months at least, to get the military ready for another conflict. Under the circumstance, with elections coming, the administration may decide that the current deadlocked status quo is actually good from their point of view."

HEADLINE: China Discovers Secrecy Is Expensive 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
THE illness called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is still a mystery. It could be as deadly as the Spanish flu of 1918, or a containable killer like Legionnaire's disease, or just fade into history as the scare of 2003.
 But one thing the medical community does not doubt is that SARS may have seemed less alarming, and almost certainly would have been less deadly, if China's government had not hidden it like a dirty secret for four months. 
 It took health authorities at the disease's epicenter, in this bustling southern provincial capital, from November until late January to begin classifying the disease as a potential epidemic. They did not address the issue publicly until Feb. 11, when they said everything was "under control." And the central government did not share any information with outside doctors until almost six weeks after that, by which time SARS had taken Hong Kong by surprise. 
This reticence -- or obstruction -- has prompted the biggest backlash since the Tiananmen Square crackdown nearly 14 years ago. China was rebuked by the World Health Organization for its handling of SARS, a black eye from a United Nations agency that rarely confronts member states. With foreigners saying they are worried about China's credibility as much as the number of SARS cases, tens of thousands of tourist bookings have vanished. Wal-Mart, Goldman Sachs and other major buyers and investors have restricted travel to the mainland. 
Economists say SARS could knock as much as half a percentage point off economic growth this year, just as the newly installed Communist leaders try to show their skill at managing the country. Beyond that, the disease has made clear the price to China of the Communist Party's traditional policy of denying the world what it considers embarrassing information. 
Leaders are discovering that they cannot court the World Trade Organization but ban the World Health Organization. They are realizing that the planes that carry China's microchips around the world also carry its microbes.
"The notion that there are still some aspects of China's 'internal affairs' that can be kept aloof from foreign intrusion is under assault," said Orville Schell, a China expert at the University of California at Berkeley. "If there was ever an apt metaphor for one-worldism, it is the interconnectedness of global health."
There are signs that China has begun to absorb this lesson. Beijing, after much stonewalling, allowed a team of W.H.O. doctors to visit Guangzhou last week. The doctors had access to the province's medical records on SARS that were until recently classified as state secrets. They were also allowed hospital visits to test the reliability of Guangzhou's statistics on the spread of the disease.
"They gave us the access we asked for," said Robert F. Breiman, the head of the W.H.O. delegation. "They have realized that there is no way we are going to solve SARS around the world if we can't solve it here."
Chinese officials also said they will disclose information faster next time. Li Liming, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, was charged with making an unusual public concession. "We must apologize to everyone," he said.
Such signs of contrition may reflect grudging change in this one-party state, where progress often only comes under pressure. Foreigners began cracking sensitive sectors, like telecom and banking, only after years of diplomacy and trade threats. Public health authorities were among those who until recently viewed themselves as immune from international scrutiny.
Still, there is little to suggest that the new leadership, headed by Communist Party Chief Hu Jintao, is doing much to address the sclerosis within the party hierarchy that caused the SARS problem in the first place. China has routinely failed to grapple with natural or created disasters, like the famine caused by Mao's forced collectivization in the late 1950's, because the sole responsibility of officials at every level is to keep their bosses happy. There is no direct accountability to the public, and every incentive to cover up bad news.
Officials do not seemed to have learned much from their mishandling of AIDS, when they went through a similar process of denial and belated recognition. And despite Guangzhou's about-face on SARS, Beijing continues to obfuscate about the number of patients in the capital. One reason may be that the caseload in Beijing has increased too quickly to fit the party line that the disease is now "effectively controlled."
Some of China's savviest and most Westernized leaders sound callous when they defend the government's handling of SARS. Long Yongtu, who as a senior trade official did much of the hard bargaining for China to join the W.T.O. in 2001, told an audience in Hong Kong recently that the press was hyping SARS.
"Twelve people in Beijing got SARS and three died," he said, citing some older statistics. "Beijing has 10 million people. We don't need to get so excited."
Even Asian leaders, normally careful not to offend Beijing, are not buying such assurances. Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister of Singapore, which is also grappling with SARS, visited India this week but told Beijing he was canceling his planned China trip. He was acting, his government said, "on the advice of his doctor."

HEADLINE: The Sand Wall 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: UMM QASR, Iraq 

 BODY:
As Berlin Walls go, the 20-foot-high dirt berm around Iraq's southern port of Umm Qasr -- the first wall to fall in the liberation of Iraq -- isn't much to look at, but it's a fitting symbol for this war. It is a sand wall, easily breached by American power, exposing a rotten dictatorship with little popular support on the other side. This area is full of regimes protected by such sand walls.
 But unlike the Berlin Wall, whose fall unleashed a flowering of freedom all across Eastern Europe, the fall of the Sand Wall alone will not do that. There are still two other walls holding back the explosion of freedom in the Arab East -- much harder walls -- that will also have to fall. 
 The first is the wall in the Arab mind. I hit my head against that wall two weeks ago in Cairo, while discussing the war with Egyptian opposition journalists in Feshawi's teahouse, the writing hangout of Naguib Mahfouz. These journalists could see nothing good coming from the U.S. "occupation" of Iraq, which they insisted was being done only to put Arabs down, strengthen Israel and extract oil.
Such encounters made clear to me that America was not just at war with Saddam, but with Saddamism: an entrenched Arab mind-set, born of years of colonialism and humiliation, thatinsists that upholding Arab dignity and nationalism by defying the West is more important than freedom, democracy and modernization.
Throughout this war, Saddamism was peddled by Al Jazeera television, Arab intellectuals and the Arab League. You cannot imagine how much distress there is among certain Arab elites that the people of Iraq preferred liberation by America to more defiance under Saddam. The morning after Baghdad was liberated, Abdul Hamid Ahmad, editor of The Gulf News, wrote, like so many of his colleagues: "This is a heartbreaking moment for any Arab, seeing marines roaming the streets of Baghdad."
The wall of Saddamism, which helped bad leaders stay in power and young Arabs remain backward and angry, was as dangerous as Saddam. "The social, political, cultural and economic malaise in this part of the world had become a threat to American security -- it produced 9/11," said Shafeeq Ghabra, president of the American University of Kuwait. "This war was a challenge to the entire Arab system, which is why so many Arabs opposed it. The war to liberate Kuwait from Iraq in 1991 was outpatient surgery. This war was open-heart surgery."
But this open-heart surgery will succeed in toppling both Saddam and Saddamism only if we are successful in creating a healthy Iraq -- an Arab state where people can find dignity, not just by saying no to the West, but by building a decent, tolerant, modernizing society that they can be proud of, an Arab state where people can speak the truth and that other Arabs would want to emulate. The widespread looting that has followed the fall of Saddam tells me just how hard that will be. So far, all that we have unleashed in Iraq is chaos, not freedom. There is no civil society here. We are starting from scratch.
And then we must also take down the third wall -- the wall of cement, fear and barbed wire being erected between Israelis and Palestinians. We must defuse this conflict. If we let this Israeli-Palestinian wall stand, it will reinforce the wall of Saddamism. Arab dictators will hide behind this conflict as an excuse not to change, Arab intellectuals will use it to delegitimize U.S. power out here, and the enemies of the new leaders in Iraq will use it to embarrass them for working with us.
When one of the Egyptian journalists at Feshawi's insisted that we were out to "occupy Iraq," I quoted to him a line from Colin Powell: America is as powerful as any empire in history, but when it has invaded other countries the only piece of land it has ever asked for was a tiny plot to bury its soldiers who would not be returning home. He actually smiled at that.
The moment reminded me of something the Arab columnist Rami Khouri liked to say, that Arabs for too long have seen the strength of America, but not the "goodness" of America. Partly that's because their media willfully distorted what we did, and partly it's because America has used its power out here more to defend oil and Israel than democracy. This war in Iraq was meant to bring the idealistic side of U.S. power into the Arab world.
Our task now is to apply that idealism to rebuilding Iraq and resolving the Palestine question. If we do it right, I am certain the other walls in this region will be taken down by the people themselves -- and never again will we have to ask for even the tiniest plot of land to bury our soldiers here.

HEADLINE: Quebec Seeking to End Its Old Cultural Divide 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, April 12 

 BODY:
The ache that clutches at the heart of Quebec, and arguably at the heart of all of Canada, is gradually easing. 
 The ache is the long, uneasy relationship between English speakers and French speakers in this otherwise congenial city rich in cafe romance and cultural life. It has played out over the last 40 years in a series of turbulent provincial elections, referendums over separation with Canada and marches over laws that dictate when and how French or English may be used. 
 The wounds are deep, going back to the mid-18th century, when the British seized the province from the French by force of arms -- and they may never be totally healed. But as voters prepare to go to the polls on Monday to choose a provincial assembly and premier, newspaper columnists and academics are marveling at the fact that this is the first vote in two generations that will not center on the issue of sovereignty. 
The separatist Parti Quebecois may still eke out a majority of seats in the assembly, but the current premier, Bernard Landry, has refused to promise to hold the province's third referendum on separation if he wins. Any other strategy would have meant writing off greater Montreal, where 45 percent of Quebec's 7.2 million people -- and the vast majority of Quebec's 920,000 remaining English-speakers -- live. That would have assured that he would lose the vote. 
Mr. Landry was falling behind in the polls this week against Jean Charest, the Liberal leader, who is a dedicated federalist. "There is a growing allergy to divisive rhetoric that is clearly related to the breaking down of barriers," said Jack Jedwab, executive director of the Association for Canadian Studies, a Montreal-based research organization. 
Health care, taxes and economic issues have trumped independence in this campaign as a growing number of both French-speaking and English-speaking voters are seeking -- and finding -- a bicultural, bilingual accommodation. 
The reduced tensions evolved over time, but the process was helped along by flight of a large number of angry and fearful English-speaking Quebecers to Ontario and the United States in the 1970's and 1980's as the separatists pressed their case. The departure of so many English speakers caused a demographic shift that damaged business confidence and the economy for decades, but it forced those who stayed behind to adjust their attitudes and learn better French. 
"What used to drive politics in Quebec was the Francophone majority's fear of assimilation into the English-speaking mainstream of Canada," said Benoit Aubin, who learned English listening to Bob Dylan records and is now the Montreal correspondent for Maclean's magazine. "But as soon as English speakers learned French the problem was gone. Being bilingual became cool." 
A wave of new immigration also helped bridge the gulf. The newcomers from Africa, the Caribbean and Asia -- some English-speaking and some French-speaking -- broke language barriers when they moved willy-nilly into both predominantly French-speaking and English-speaking neighborhoods. 
The French-speaking Quebecers who thought they were treated as second-class citizens by the old English-speaking Montreal elite are feeling less aggrieved now that a series of laws enacted by Liberal and Parti Quebecois governments have fortified the use of the French language and Quebecois culture. 
"There's still a gulf, but there's more of a gray zone between the two solitudes," said Antonia Maioni, director of McGill University's Institute for the Study of Canada, referring to Hugh MacLennan's 1945 novel "Two Solitudes," one of many that have probed Montreal's historic divide.
Although the Parti Quebecois has failed to create an independent country, as it had hoped, it succeeded in alleviating many of the old wounds that created the nationalistic urge that kindled its emergence. 
"Now that we have saved the culture, we don't need independence," said Pierre Bourque, a former Montreal mayor and a former separatist who is now campaigning in French, English and Spanish for a seat in the assembly from east Montreal on a platform that promises to put off more referendums indefinitely. 
The growing acceptance by English speakers of laws that protect the supremacy of French has helped make peace. 
The language laws, installed in the 1970's, were originally hotly contested by English-speakers and many new immigrants. The laws made French the official provincial language. They also required teaching in French for most new immigrants and required businesses to use French on their primary signs. 
The laws were softened in the courts, though, and were eventually seen by many English speakers as a small price to pay for social peace. 
In a recent study by the Missisquoi Institute in Montreal, 50 percent of English-speakers surveyed said the provincial government should maintain the language laws, though older English-speakers still expressed opposition. 
The signs of adaptation are everywhere in this city. Once a city that spoke English west of St. Lawrence Boulevard and French east of Boulevard St. Laurent, Montreal is increasingly becoming a city of linguistically mixed neighborhoods. The melange includes not only English and French but also a dozen or so immigrant languages. Conversations go back and forth in English and French from the traditional French cafes on Rue St. Denis to Schwartz's delicatessen on St. Laurent. 
With one-third of Quebec's native English speakers now marrying French speakers, romance is increasingly becoming bilingual.
"More and more French men are writing their love cards in English," said Teresa Jedrezejak, a Polish immigrant who owns a flower shop in Notre Dame de Grace, a once thoroughly English-speaking neighborhood on the west side that is becoming increasingly mixed. 
More French-speaking students are enrolling at McGill University -- and writing their papers in French -- and English-speaking students are enrolling in large numbers at the University of Montreal and writing their papers in English. Employees of department stores and bars that once were considered the domain of the English elite now welcome all customers with "Bonjour." 
The Montreal Gazette, the English-language daily, began in September to advertise in the French-language news outlets and promote itself on billboards in French. Articles written in French will appear in the paper by the end of the year. 
Ms. Maioni of McGill University is one of a new breed of Montrealers who over time may change Quebec politics forever. 
The daughter of English-speaking Italian immigrants, she attended a French university in Quebec City to become completely bilingual and there met a French-speaking aspiring political scientist, whom she married. They went to graduate school in the United States, and now have 4-year-old triplets who speak French as their first language but can speak to their maternal grandmother in English or Italian. 
"My children watch PBS Kids as easily as TeleQuebec," she said. "And I can live in English or French."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE AMERICANS; 
In the U.S., Elation Wrestles With Anxiety

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER with JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: STATE COLLEGE, Pa., April 11 

 BODY:
As it reverberated along the American hallway that is Interstate 80, the corridor from San Francisco Bay to the New Jersey suburbs, the national conversation about the fall of Baghdad this week ranged from applauding to appalled, from cocksure to gun-shy.
 "One thing the people over there respect is power," said Steve Khazadian, 45, a football coach from Syracuse who was eating lunch at a tavern between sessions of a coaches' clinic at Penn State. 
 Five feet away at the bar, Larry Barker, 67, a traveling businessman, muttered into his martini about "shock and awe."
"I don't like that image for the United States," he said. "It's so obnoxious. I don't think the role of this country should be to shock, and I don't think that because of us wreaking destruction we should be held in awe." 
Six months after a similar series of interviews along I-80 -- when the country was wrestling with President Bush's push to attack Iraq -- the nation's uncertainty over the necessity and cost of war seems to have given way to a host of new anxieties, as well as unsettling new answers.
Many speculate that the fighting in Iraq is far from over. Those who supported the invasion of Iraq find themselves wondering what will happen if no chemical or biological weapons are ever found. 
And admirers and detractors of the Bush administration ask whether it considered all the possible consequences of the war beforehand.
Outside the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, conservative stock traders voice misgivings about what they call the country's John Wayne approach to geopolitics. In Cheyenne, Wyo., real-life cowboys say that someone has to police the world, and that the United States is the only power that is capable.
A streak of paternalism emerges: in conversations across the Midwest, men young and old speak of the United States and Iraq as of a parent disciplining a rebellious child.
There was regret over the cost in lives -- more than 100 Americans killed so far, and untold Iraqi civilians and soldiers -- but seemingly little anguish. "It's never acceptable to have a loss of life," said Ed Prosser, a rancher in Cheyenne. "But considering the scope of the war, it's not much. That's easy to say if it's not your son; then it's tough to accept. I think it makes it easier when you know what you're doing is right."
All along the 2,909-mile highway, those who fear an indefinite postwar entanglement speak of its incalculable costs and ask what will be done about the limping American economy. Many also give voice to a deepening unease with the country's lonely position at the top of the global power heap.
But in South Bend, Ind., Gary Chadwell suggested a seemingly simple solution, with hardly a care for the message it sends. "I think they should pay us back -- maybe with a tax on their oil," he said. "We didn't have to go over there and help."
While the earlier interviews, in early October, were rife with references to Sept. 11, 2001, the recurring theme this week -- in scores of conversations at truck stops and ball fields, in small towns, college towns and big cities -- was of attacks on America possibly still to come, of threats not yet known, plotted or even imagined.
"We're pushing our luck," said Bassam Ramadan, a 22-year-old native of Jordan who was watching cars and women go by in Paterson, N.J., as police officers watched him and his friends from across the street. "Hopefully, our luck won't run out."

'We're the Big Guns in Town'
Robert Hartmann, 25, an equity analyst in San Francisco, welcomes the toppling of Saddam Hussein as much as anyone, since uncertainty in the war effort hampers economic growth. But he sounds as if he would not mind another military adventure as soon as this one ends.
Mr. Hartmann, of Marin, Calif., said the nation must police the world, especially what he called "closed-minded, uneducated countries." But he dismissed those who call the United States an imperialist power.
"We are not trying to take over the economy of another country," he said on a lunch break outside the stock exchange. "We are trying to provide its people with basic human rights."
Alan Reid Jr., of San Mateo, who runs a mutual fund firm, said his own overriding concern was whether the Bush administration had the diplomatic savvy and intellect to offer solutions.
"We have definitely sent a John Wayne message to the world," he said. "How can anyone not see that we have sent a message straight out of the American West? We're the good guys. We're the big guns in town. We'll tell you how it is going to be. But do we have the ability to build relationships?"
Mr. Reid said he was less confident in the nation's war on terrorism. "We're great with bullets and bombs," he said. "But this is the new war, and we haven't figured out how to fight it."

'A Bog-Down Concern'
 In Sacramento, Julie Baumhoff, 50, said she was repelled by the idea that the United States might invade other nations in the name of liberation or fighting terrorism. "The monster we know may be better than the monster we don't know," she said.
Ms. Baumhoff, a state worker, worries about California's immense budget deficit -- and thus her job. She worries, too, about the way America is perceived abroad -- a vestige of her days in the 1970's as an au pair in France. "We act like we're doing it for totally moral reasons, when often we're totally immoral people," she said.
Yet she says she is less worried about the United States becoming an imperial power, pointing to America's long presence in Japan, Germany and South Korea. "I have more of a bog-down concern," she said.
She complained that reading the headlines was like watching a yo-yo. "We seem to do really well one day and not the next," she said. "Two weeks ago, it looked as if we were going to be there for years." Now she is not so sure.
The images and news of the past few days, she said, bring her "a lot of worry, a little relief at this moment." She added, echoing many television watchers, "This is the beginning, not the end."

'There Was a Necessary Evil'
Walking his new foal, Rosa, around a small pen under a clear blue sky, Mr. Prosser, a fourth-generation rancher and a freshman Republican state representative, said he believed the war might help the United States improve the political environment in the region -- perhaps by sending a warning to other totalitarian regimes.
"We can't go to every country in the Middle East," he said. "Hopefully we can influence some other countries. I think that's one thing this administration had in mind with this war."
Mr. Prosser, 54, said he believed the administration was right to flex its muscle in Iraq and elsewhere. "We can't do it all, but we can't sit back and do nothing," he said. "I don't believe in isolationism, and we can't sit back and block the borders. We have to have some involvement."
In downtown Cheyenne, Jack Sorensen, a 54-year high school agriculture teacher from Wheatland, Wyo., waited for his students outside a Future Farmers of America convention. He said he was glad to see the statue of Saddam Hussein fall on Wednesday morning, but was cautious about the outcome of the war. 
"I'm not necessarily an advocate of war," he said. "But there was a necessary evil. I think it strains the relations with other countries, our allies, and the process of trying to deal with terrorism."
Mr. Sorensen said he had mixed feelings about America's role in world affairs. "I don't know where it was given to the U.S. that we had to feed the world, but we do," he said. "I don't know that we need to be the humanitarian leader of the world."
He was also still conflicted about Iraq. "I think it's essential they find some evidence of chemical weapons," he said. "I don't know what they'll do if they don't."

For Some, Second Thoughts
At Joliet Junior College, west of Chicago, Christine Martinez was surprising herself, imagining what could happen if America sent troops in to liberate other countries and set them up as apprentice democracies. She had not even supported the war in Iraq.
"But just by listening to the news and seeing the joy of the Iraqi people welcoming their freedom, I took a different point of view, saying that maybe us going out there was something good for the people, even though there was loss of life," said Mrs. Martinez, 36, a mother of three, on a break from cramming for an accounting test.
Now, she said, she believes that American troops should "stick around, to help those people who have just found a different way of life." After that, she said, "once we see that they can do it on their own, we should just back away and consider them an ally."
Mrs. Martinez said the country had to continue the war on terrorism, too. "I think it's still out there," she said. "I'm sure there are still some small groups planning to do something to us in America and other countries who are our allies. That's the scary part. But if we go in, freeing countries like Iraq, providing monetary support and a new government, they'll be stronger, and hopefully the terrorist groups will be smaller and smaller and we can overcome them."
Not everyone at Joliet Junior College had the same reaction to the as-seen-on-TV war.
Myrna Randolph, a 74-year-old student, said she had lived through every war since World War II, having graduated from high school in 1946. "I really despise how much you see on television now, but it really makes it real," she said, sipping water after a physical education class.
"I don't know," Ms. Randolph said. "It's a moral issue: here we are, blowing the devil out of their country for their own good. And I'm always worried about doing things for people's own good."

But Seriously . . .
"Put them in a ring," said Pat Johnson, as he put his money under the safety glass at a liquor store in an industrial stretch of Gary, Ind. "Let Bush and Saddam duke it out, like on 'Celebrity Boxing.' " He picked up a minibottle of V.S.O.P., two malt liquors and a bag of chips and walked out.
His friend, James Dalton, 33, a truck driver who served in the Army in the 1991 gulf war, laughed, but stuck around to talk seriously. He said he wished the country had finished the job then. But he questioned the appropriateness of both wars.
"I think the goals are all the same: monetary value and control," he said. "Why are we always sticking our nose in everybody else's business? These people, they've been under a strict dictatorship. It'll start nice and easy. But who's to say another dictator won't rise out of the people? One monkey doesn't stop a show. You got dictators waiting in the wings."
He shook his head, chuckled, then turned serious again. "I know I'm in a liquor store, but let me tell you, Jesus Christ is the only way," he said, heading out to catch up to Mr. Johnson.

'It's the American Empire'
Wearing flip-flops in 40-degree weather, Marc Ricchiute, a third-year law student at Notre Dame, dropped off a motion at the county courthouse in South Bend, Ind., and got to talking about the war, as he often does these days.
"I'm worried about the precedent it may set for American foreign policy," said Mr. Ricchiute, 26, who grew up here. "I was against the war in Iraq, against the idea of a pre-emptive war. And now we're talking about Syria, and the help they've given to members of the Iraqi regime. I don't want our foreign policy to return to that direction -- to the big-stick days."
He said that if soldiers found biological or chemical weapons, it would only give America "a leg up" on traditional allies that defied it over Iraq. "I'd like to see more balance," he said. "It's the American empire."
"I spent the last two years living in London," he added. "It was almost at times embarrassing to be an American, and trying to justify and speak for the Bush administration. I had to justify that to people who just see us as the world's police."
Mr. Ricchiute said he was talking to the mother of a friend in the military the other day. "He's in Baghdad now," he said. "I said, 'How would you feel if he died?' She said, 'At least I'd know he's fighting for our freedom.' But the Iraqi people haven't curtailed my freedom. I don't feel threatened by Saddam Hussein."

'I'd Be for It if No One Died'
The freshman and sophomore rowers of Notre Dame Academy's crew were out across the muddy Maumee River from downtown Toledo, Ohio, but they were still taking turns in the dock box, practicing their strokes, one at a time. There was plenty of time to stand around and talk about the war, the news, the blood and gore.
"It's devastating," said Ashley Lavey, 15. "I can't even watch it. It's so sad to see that, all the killing, everyone dying. I was reading the paper today, and they found a woman's torso and a little boy's body in a bomb they dropped. That's so sad! I'd be for it if no one died. I support our troops, but I'm not going to be all for it."
"I wonder what Osama is up to," said Laura Johns, 14.
"I just want to know, what'll happen when they catch Saddam?" Ashley said. "They have to finish it somehow. Or when they find weapons of mass destruction, and then Saddam?"
"I think we should stay out of it," said Sascha Ehret, 15. "I think we should be concerned with what's going on in our country."
"I'm glad Saddam's out of power," Laura said.
"I've heard Saddam is like torturing his people," Ashley said. "You see how happy they are now. I don't think they'd want someone from the U.S. to take over. I don't think they'd think of us as their best friend. But they're safer now."
"I think if we do stuff for them, they'll be thankful, but then they're going to just go back to hating us," Sascha said. "I think the Arabs dislike us because we chose to help Israel get a nation. Because if I was an Arab, and there first, and the U.S. helped Israel get a nation, I'd hold a grudge too."
"I think it was good we went to take Saddam out of power," said Lauren Hirt, 14. "But not to take power over them."
"We're making everybody think that we think that we're almighty," said Sascha. "That nobody can bring us down. I think it's going to make other countries not like us."
"But don't half of them already hate us?" Lauren asked.

HEADLINE: East Coast, West Coast, and Where the Twain Meet; 
Noting Similarities, Scholars Reject New York-Los Angeles Rivalry

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
New Yorkers in certain circles wear their disdain for Los Angeles like a credential -- proof of their superiority, intellectual and otherwise (should all else fail). Angelenos, of course, resent New York's claim to center stage. To them, Los Angeles is the future and New York is history. And they don't see the romance of living in an overpriced shoe box, waiting out snowstorms in April.
 The New York-Los Angeles dichotomy has long infected far more than annoying dinner-party conversations on both coasts. It has a way of coloring the discourse on everything: politics, culture, art and architecture, urban life. 
 Taking sides seems practically a condition of citizenship: Vertical vs. horizontal? Print vs. celluloid? Seasons vs. sun? 
Now a bicoastal detachment of social scientists is riding to the rescue. Using everything from census and employment data to crime statistics, newspaper articles and hundreds of previously published academic papers and books, they have compared and contrasted Los Angeles and New York -- their populations, politics, economies, residential patterns, immigrants, school systems, art worlds, images, riots, police.
Partisans may be sorry to learn that the two regions strike some scholars as increasingly alike, despite many real differences. Under scrutiny, perceived polarities blur. New York is becoming L.A.-ified and Los Angeles York-ified, some argue. Certain cherished assumptions about the two places turn out to be rooted less in reality than in myth.
Both regions have disproportionate shares of rich people and of poor people and a shrinking share of middle-income people wedged in between. Both areas are highly segregated, but in complex ways that bend the term. The proportion of Latinos is growing and the proportion of blacks is dwindling. Black ghettos are being Latinized. Chinese immigrants are skipping the inner city.
Los Angeles, kingdom of sprawl, has lately been cultivating its center. New York City, infatuated with its center, is spawning new vitality along its outer edge. Both regions are balkanized politically, the scholars found. Even the New York art scene, once tightly concentrated, has spilled into places like Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Hoboken, N.J. -- becoming more like the Los Angeles gallery scene.
"The first thing one had to do was get out of the horse race mentality," said Andras Szanto, a sociologist and deputy director of the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, who compared the visual art worlds in the two cities. "Rather than seeing this as a story where New York is ahead and Los Angeles is playing catch-up, increasingly I began to see it as two sides of the same coin."
Saverio Giovacchini, a historian who examined the New York film culture and the lure of Los Angeles from 1930 to the present, traces much of the bipolarism between Los Angeles and New York culture to the period after World War II when the New York intellectuals defined mass culture and Los Angeles as the opposite of art, modernism and New York.
"This discourse about Hollywood is, in a sense, a 'state of mind' -- the mind of a largely New York-based American intelligentsia that manufactured this cultural image of the movie citadel as the anti-intellectual 'sausage factory,' " Mr. Giovacchini writes in the 530-page book that includes the group's findings. The University of Chicago Press plans to publish "New York and Los Angeles: Politics, Society and Culture -- A Comparative View," in June.
The book wasconceived and edited by Prof. David Halle, a British-born sociologist with a lifelong interest in cities. For the past seven years, Professor Halle has commuted weekly between his home in Manhattan, where he lives with his family, and his job at U.C.L.A.
Professor Halle, director of the LeRoy Neiman Center for the Study of American Society and Culture at U.C.L.A., said the New York-Los Angeles project arose five or six years ago, in part out of his bicoastal existence. (His wife is Dr. Louise Mirrer, vice chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York -- which helps explain his commuting.)
Professor Halle said he happened upon what is known as the Los Angeles school of urban sociology, which focuses on what has been called the "sprawling, polycentric character of the urban, built environment." Los Angeles, with its development on the periphery and its fragmented politics, is seen as a prototype for a new pattern of metropolitan growth.
In contrast, the work of another group of scholars, which Professor Halle calls the New York school, focuses on central cities. They remain fascinated with contemporary New York City and Manhattan. They tend to champion the superiority of city over suburban life, not simply for the working class but also for the middle class and the rich.
"When I first said, 'I'm doing New York/L.A.,' a lot of people then started the 'Well, which place is better?' kind of argument," Professor Halle said last week in his Manhattan apartment, shortly before flying to Los Angeles. "That's the one thing we don't have much of in the book -- people going on about which place is better than the other."
In a chapter on the so-called social geography of the two cities, Prof. Andrew A. Beveridge and Susan Weber of Queens College find that the two regions resemble each other in many ways.
For example, both have a large share of their more affluent, native-born and white residents living beyond the core, while poorer, nonwhite and foreign-born residents cluster near the center.
On the two cities' economies, Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia, and David L. Gladstone of the University of New Orleans question whether being "global" enhances either city's well-being. For it is their global qualities that leave them vulnerable to economic downturns and make them "symbolic targets for terrorist wrath."
A U.C.L.A. sociologist, Prof. Jack Katz, compared perceptions of crime and law enforcement in the two cities.
He found that crime in Los Angeles had been attributed largely to gangs and that the police had been viewed as disorganized and incompetent.
In New York, crime had been attributed to "a diffuse culture of chaos," and the police had been credited with success in reining it in.
Professor Katz challenges the popular impression that the decline in the 1990's was that much more dramatic in New York than in Los Angeles. Analyzing the cities' crime statistics, he found that the murder rate in New York dropped to 8.3 per 100,000 population in 1999 from a high of 30.7 in 1990; in Los Angeles it dropped to 10.5 per 100,000 population in 1999 from a high of 30.3 in 1992.
Professor Katz suggests that "the image of New York's exceptional drop" resulted in part from the practice by the news media and the public of not looking comparatively at the experience of other cities, and from the habit of looking at raw homicides rather than rates. "Something miraculous arguably happened," he said, "but the difference in the decline of the two cities does not make an overwhelming case for attributing saintly powers to the police in New York."
Professor Katz also traces the greater respect accorded the New York Police Department in part to the five separate district attorneys' offices and two United States attorneys' offices available, and sometimes vying, to prosecute police misconduct in New York City. Los Angeles, he writes, has just one county district attorney's office, overseeing 49 police departments, and one United States attorney's office with jurisdiction over a wide stretch of California.
A number of the researchers found unexpected differences between the two places. Two scholars who wrote together about New York and Los Angeles as immigrant cities and regions examined the attitudes of Angelenos and New Yorkers to the immigrants who arrived after the 1965 Immigration Act. They found that New Yorkers were "far more accepting and welcoming" than Angelenos -- a difference they attribute to the two regions' immigration patterns and histories.
They traced the contrast in part to New York's longer history as an immigrant magnet. But they also pointed to differences in the makeup of the immigrant population in the two cities. A much larger percentage of immigrants to Los Angeles are illegal, and they are seen as straining social services, particularly in hard times.
In another chapter, Professor Halle and Kevin Rafter of the City University of New York question the assumption that Los Angeles is more prone to riots than New York, as some have suggested since the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Comparing riots in the two regions over the past 40 years, they conclude, "There is little reason for complacency when considering the social fabric of either New York City or the city of Los Angeles."
Looking back on the project, Mr. Szanto said in an interview last week: "In a sense, it's unfair at any one time to compare New York to Los Angeles. You have a city that came into its own 100 years ago. Los Angeles is just getting started. To compare at any one moment the two cities is rather like having a wrestling match between an older brother and a younger brother.
"The question is, compared with how youthful L.A. is on this growth trajectory, where is it? Especially in the last quarter-century, L.A. has every bit as much of the dynamism that New York had in its initial period of growth."

HEADLINE: As Labor Talks Bog Down, Tenants Face Prospect of Holding Doors and Hauling Trash 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With both sides reporting scant progress in negotiations, the union representing 28,000 apartment building workers and the association representing building owners say that they remain far apart on critical issues and that there is a strong chance of a strike when the current contract expires at 12:01 a.m. on April 21.
 Worried about a possible walkout, the Realty Advisory Board, the group representing building owners and managers, has sent manuals to 3,000 unionized buildings with one million residents, advising them to make preparations for a strike by doormen, janitors, superintendents, elevator operators and other building workers. 
 The two sides said sharp difference remained on many issues, including wages and management's call for higher co-payments for doctor visits.
"We are having a difficult time," said Michael Fishman, president of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. "We do not seem to be in the same ballpark." He estimated there was a 50 percent chance of a strike. 
Mr. Fishman said the union has already named 500 strike captains and set up eight strike headquarters around the city. A strike would principally affect buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.
Real estate officials acknowledge that both union and management have an incentive to exaggerate the likelihood of a strike. By talking up the possibility of a walkout, the union pressures management to be more forthcoming in bargaining. And management's warnings that a walkout is very possible help to ensure that tenants prepare to weather a strike, helping to strengthen management's hand in negotiations.
The two sides at first predicted that this round of bargaining would not be so difficult, but progress has been slower than expected, partly because the union and industry have clashing perceptions of the state of New York's real estate industry.
Building owners argue that conditions are bad, with the vacancy rate high and rents and building prices falling because of the weak economy and the aftershocks of 9/11. But the union argues that the industry is doing fine because, despite the recent dip, building prices and rents are far higher than they were in the 1990's.
Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council for New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that buildings have faced large increases in property taxes and insurance costs as well as outsized fuel bills this winter, stemming from the bitter cold and the spike in oil prices.
"This has been a very difficult year," said Ms. Rothman, whose group represents 2,300 condo and co-op associations. "New York City has suffered enormously in every way in the aftermath of 9/11, first of all psychologically and also very much financially."
Insisting that the industry cannot afford to pay the large raises of previous contracts, the Realty Advisory Board has offered a contract with a wage freeze in each year of a proposed three-year term, with lump-sum payments of $500 in the second and third years. The group also wants to increase co-payments for medical visits to $25, from $10.
Mr. Fishman said his members deserved a substantial raise, arguing that the industry can afford it.
A building superintendent in Brooklyn Heights, Joseph Meneses, said: "They might have issues with higher costs, but so do all the workers. We have to pay higher gas prices, higher rents and higher taxes. A wage freeze, that's unacceptable."
The president of the Realty Advisory Board, James F. Berg, said that while rents had been soft, wages for Local 32BJ's workers, averaging more than $34,000 a year, are the highest in the nation for janitors and rose by more than 10 percent during the current three-year contract, faster than the inflation rate.
Responding to Mr. Fishman's prediction that there is a 50-50 chance of a strike, Mr. Berg said, "I'd say that's 100 percent accurate."
"We're far apart. Mr. Berg added, "Any time you're in one place and someone is in another, it's often hard to get to a meeting point, but somehow we usually do."
Officials on both sides said it was possible that the strike deadline would be moved back because of difficulties negotiating during Passover, which begins Wednesday evening, and Easter, next Sunday.
Apartment building workers last walked out in 1991, in a 12-day strike that inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of New York tenants who had to guard front doors, sort mail and haul garbage.
One factor making a settlement more difficult, real estate experts said, is that Mr. Fishman is feeling pressure to secure a significant raise to help establish a standard for negotiations that the service employees' union is holding later this year for more than 60,000 workers in 15 other cities.
Local 32BJ and management have reached agreement on two issues. Management will raise its contribution for health insurance by $520 per year, on top of its current $6,215 contribution per employee, and it will increase its annual pension contribution by $83.20 a year, on top of its current $2,190 contribution.

HEADLINE: A Small School District Rises Up Against Albany 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: FAIRPORT, N.Y., April 9 

 BODY:
At school district headquarters here, Superintendent William Cala's desk is strewn with congratulatory phone messages, letters and e-mail messages. Hundreds in all, they praise him and the Fairport Board of Education for taking a stand against a state government that has not passed a timely budget in 19 years and that they see as dysfunctional.
 Editorials and op-ed articles have praised the courage of Fairport's school officials for telling Albany that they are fed up with late state budgets that make a mess of local spending plans and state regulations that force districts to spend money on things they do not think they need. 
 Fairport's rebellious resolution, unanimously passed last month, cast the school administration as David taking on the state's Goliath. 
When Dr. Cala arrives at McArdle's restaurant, one of his regular lunch spots in this prosperous Rochester suburb bisected by the Erie Canal, the hostess bows deeply from the waist, as if greeting royalty. Strangers and friends crowd around his table, offering high-fives or picking up his tab. 
Maureen N. Nupp, the board president, meets similar acclaim. At a funeral Mass she attended this week, the priest clapped her on the back with a hearty "Go get 'em." So, too, did a fellow board member, Joyce Kostyk. Her postman recently backed up his truck and said, "Give 'em hell."
"John Q. Public gets it," Dr. Cala said. "It's the bureaucrats who don't."
The State Education Department, for sure, has not taken kindly to Fairport's civil disobedience, detailed in a three-part resolution. First, the district has postponed a vote on its school budget, required by state law on the third Tuesday in May, until the state approves its own budget. Second, it has asked for relief from costly state requirements that must be paid for locally -- unfunded mandates, as they are called. And third, it has announced plans to send ungraded assessment tests to the Education Department because correcting them would cost $30,000 that the district would rather spend elsewhere.
The department, in a letter from its legal counsel, warned that flouting state education law is "grounds for removal" of the board and the superintendent. Only one such housecleaning has ever happened in New York, State Education Department officials say -- in Roosevelt, on Long Island, after decades of fiscal mismanagement. 
The Education Department distributed the "threat letter," as it is known in Fairport, to the 700-odd school districts. Not tit-for-tat, a department spokesman, Tom Dunn, explained, although Fairport had earlier sent out 700 letters of its own "encouraging other districts to break the law." It was only fair, Mr. Dunn said, to inform them of the sanctions they would face as law-breakers.
In all the nasty back-and-forth between Fairport and the Education Department, New York's education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, has been silent. "The law is clear," Mr. Dunn said, so Mr. Mills "had no option" but to inform Fairport it was out of line. The commissioner and his counsel would not comment. "I don't think they're required to speak here," Mr. Dunn said. 
The distribution of the department's warning letter dashed Fairport's hopes that other districts would step forward and adopt its resolution. Many individual school board members from other districts have communicated their support to Dr. Cala but have said they were unwilling to join Fairport's risky rebellion. Several districts put the resolution on their agendas, then removed it. 
Robert DeStefano, a school board member in Liberty, N.Y., sent a blunt letter to the department, with a copy to Ms. Nupp. "You are clearly out of your mind," it began, characterizing Fairport's action as "the equivalent of the American Revolution as it pertains to school economics." Mr. DeStefano asked "if our board and all the boards in the state follow suit will you dismiss us all?" Liberty's board has taken no action thus far. 
Words of support have also come from superintendents, among them Michael McGill in Scarsdale. "I share their frustration and anger at the state's inaction," said Dr. McGill, a comrade of Dr. Cala in their dislike of standardized testing. "It's more than a little hypocritical that Fairport has to obey the law while the state gets to disregard" its April 1 budget deadline. But "for me it doesn't rise to a level of moral injustice that justifies breaking the law," Dr. McGill said.
Dr. Cala and board members are disappointed, to put it mildly, at the cold shoulder from other districts since they say they doubt that Mr. Mills could withstand the public outcry if he started dismissing boards and superintendents all over the state. "I'm stunned that other districts won't do it," Ms. Kostyk said. "We never thought that there would be none, especially when the e-mails started rolling in."
But they are heartened by other developments.
Tom Golisano, a failed third party candidate for governor and a local business tycoon, says he will pay the legal bills for Dr. Cala and his board if the state makes good on its threat to remove them and they want to challenge the dismissals. Assemblyman Steve Sanders of Manhattan, who is chairman of the education committee, told The Times Union of Albany that it was "not out of the question" to amend the budget schedule for districts, although he proposed no legislation. 
David A. Patterson, a lawmaker from Harlem and leader of the State Senate Democratic conference, introduced a bill last week that would protect districts from the financial damage caused by a late state budget. Under current law, districts are prohibited from restoring programs they had cut if they get unexpected money from Albany after their local budgets have passed. And there are rumblings from the Statehouse that this could be the exceptional year when a budget is completed before the districts must themselves vote on spending plans, leaving the chronic problems for another day. 
Dr. Cala has long been known as a maverick superintendent, especially in his fierce opposition to assessment tests. He takes undisguised glee in stirring the pot, even now when his own job is at stake. But, according to separate accounts by all seven board members, he was not the instigator of the March 19 resolution. 
"It wasn't one person on a campaign," said a board member, Terri Pries Her colleague Christine Heisman agreed. "We were just searching for a solution," she said. "And to raise awareness."
The resolution evolved, they said, as the close-knit group contemplated Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget, which cuts state aid to schools by $1.24 billion and would cost Fairport $2.1 million from a budget of roughly $80 million. 
Expecting more money was not reasonable this year. But why not ask the state to suspend, in these hard times, any unfunded mandates adopted since 1995? This question, first raised at a legislative breakfast, became the second part of the resolution.
The third part, sending certain assessment tests back to the state for grading, would save $30,000 because classroom teachers are replaced by substitutes during the two- or three-day grading. There are other unfunded mandates that cost as much or more, Dr. Cala said, like buying defibrillators or fingerprinting staff members. But those raised safety issues that might alarm some parents. He has already built a consensus here against testing. 
The resolution's first part, which called for withholding the school budget from the voters until the state budget is passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor, grew out of longstanding complaints about why districts were expected to meet deadlines when the state was not. As the fiscal crisis worsened, a whine became a plan.
At a board workshop last month, Kenneth Harris, a former superintendent and the group's elder statesman, asked, "What would happen if we didn't pass a budget?" Everyone fell silent. Then came a cacophony of "what ifs?" Dr. Cala "never blinked," according to Jeanne Kremers, the board vice president, even though he was the only one with a paying job that might be at risk. As various deadlines approach, Dr. Cala seems more giddy than alarmed, titling his e-mail messages "revolution" and passing out protest buttons designed by a friend and bearing the slogan "Keep Bill, Fire Mills."
Some on the board are equally resolved in public. But they acknowledge privately that they could recant if they were on the verge of losing a beloved superintendent and leaving the district in the hands of a state-appointed board, which they said could hurt the children. 
"We're determined," Mr. Harris said, "but I'm not sure we're dumb." 
Ms. Kremers worries about fissures in the community if both board and state do as promised. "People here will rear up in protest," she said. "That could be ugly." 
But Ms. Nupp, who said earlier that she was delighted to be called "defiant" in a local editorial, responds with a crisp order. "Change that word 'ugly' " she said. "It would not be ugly. It would be inspiring."

HEADLINE: Insurer to Move Headquarters Downtown 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
The Health Insurance Plan of New York signed a deal on Friday to move its headquarters and 1,600 employees to downtown from Midtown Manhattan, two people involved in the deal said yesterday.
 In a transaction that real estate experts described as the largest move to downtown from Midtown since the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, HIP signed a 20-year lease for more than 500,000 square feet of space in the office complex at 55 Water Street, with plans to relocate in the summer of 2004. 
HIP's offices are now at 7 West 34th Street and 132 West 31st Street. 
 The downtown economy has been weakened after waves of layoffs by financial services companies, and HIP's move represents a bit of good news for the area. Gauging the weakness of the downtown New York office market is a difficult and politically delicate exercise, partly because different real estate firms use different measures. 
Still, the real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield estimated in a report for the fourth quarter of 2002 that the overall vacancy rate downtown, including sublease space, was 13.2 percent. 
By comparison, Midtown Manhattan, one of the healthiest office markets in the country, had a vacancy rate of 11.1 percent at the end of 2002, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
HIP will take some floors on the 805,000-square-foot south tower of 55 Water Street and all of its 520,000-square-foot north appendage, according to Mary Ann Tighe, president of CB Richard Ellis, a brokerage firm that represented the landlord, Retirement Systems of Alabama. GVA Williams represented HIP.
The insurer has negotiated with the state and the city for a cash grant of about $10 million, part of the federal money used to attract or retain companies in Lower Manhattan.
