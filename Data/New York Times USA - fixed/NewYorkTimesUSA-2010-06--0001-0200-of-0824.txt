HEADLINE: At $160 a Machine, Nestle Tries to Bring Its Coffee Technology to the Teapot

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- Are European tea drinking habits, refined over hundreds of years, ripe for change?
 Nestle, the Swiss food and beverage giant, thinks so. The company plans to follow up on the success of its Nespresso coffee pod system in Europe with a similar product for the tea market. Code name: Special T.
 It will be introduced in France and, if successful, soon after in large European countries. After that, potential markets include Russia, Turkey, the United States and even the largest cities in China. 
 ''People love their tea moment,'' said Henk Kwakman, the Nestle executive who will head Special T, having previously led Nespresso. ''You interrupt what you do. It's a special moment in a day, and people have strong emotions associated with it.''
 Nestle did not invent the coffee pod -- that honor is claimed by Illy, the Italian coffee company -- but the Swiss company has parlayed it into a global marketing success.
 The Special T process is much like that used by pod coffee machines. Sealed aluminum capsules containing tea leaves are inserted into the machine, which then recognizes which of the 25 blends -- including black tea, green tea, white tea, blue tea and infusions -- has been selected. Brew time and water temperature are then regulated to match the blend.
 After an introductory offer, the machine will be priced in France at 129 euros ($160) with pods costing 3.50 euros for 10. A new filter will be offered with bulk purchases of 150 pods. The cost is similar to that of Nespresso pods, which are priced between supermarket and cafe coffees.
 Can the same model work on tea lovers?
 ''It will take a while,'' acknowledged Mr. Kwakman, a wiry Dutchman with an ebullient manner. ''There's still a job to explain why the machine is there and how it will offer benefits.'' In his view, these include bringing quality tea, brewed as intended, to a broader public.
 In some respects, Nestle's timing appears favorable.
 Tea's perceived health benefits -- it has less caffeine than coffee and studies point to anti-aging properties -- have helped the market expand in recent years.
 And food and beverage sales traditionally hold up during economic downturns.
 The West European retail market for tea has been growing annually by about 3.5 percent over the last decade and, at 4 billion euros in 2009, represents 20 percent of global sales, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm. By comparison, the European coffee market is worth 12.8 billion euros.
 But there will be no shortage of skeptics ready to scoff at Nestle's tea ambitions.
 A leader in coffee, the company is something of a novice in tea; until now, it offered only iced-tea products. Then there is the established convenience of the tea bag and pot.
 In addition, the Internet, the sole sales channel for Special T, accounts for just 1.2 percent of European tea sales. Supermarkets control 62 percent, with brands like Unilever's Lipton and Twinings from Associated British Foods dominating.
 ''Is the market ready for this? It's possible, but there's lots of competition,'' said Fabien Maiolino, director of the Maison des Trois Thes, a tea buyer, distributor and consultancy based in Paris.
 Mr. Maiolino said the market has been evolving recently and it would be hard for Nestle to win over ''practical'' drinkers, who will stick with bags and pots.
 At the other end, it may take time to persuade the higher-end consumers of leaf and aromatized tea, he said, noting that Chinese companies are also considering entering Europe, having expanded in Asia.
 There is also a natural consumer skepticism to new products.
 ''I don't want another machine in my kitchen,'' Caroline Lefebvre, a senior Air France cabin attendant, said as she sipped espresso with friends on a recent afternoon in a cafe in Neuilly-sur-Seine, an upscale Paris suburb.
 Mrs. Lefebvre, 46, drinks tea daily at home. She said she would stick with tea bags and loose-leaf Earl Gray from the supermarket or, occasionally, a stylish boutique like Mariage Freres in Paris.
 ''It's too expensive and I don't want to be tied into one product,'' she said. Her two female companions concurred.
 Tea machines have been introduced before by companies like Tefal, with varying degrees of success. There are also combination hot-drink machines, for example the Tassimo range from Kraft, with Bosch machines.
 Still, Nestle shouldn't be ruled out yet. Reservations initially greeted Nespresso.
 That product was started in 1988 but really took off in recent years, helped by an advertising blitz using the actor George Clooney. Last year, Nespresso posted sales of 2.8 billion Swiss francs ($2.5 billion), an annual gain of 22 percent.
 No similar celebrity endorsement is planned for Special T yet. The tea idea stemmed from Nespresso consumer feedback, Mr. Kwakman said, adding the development process was trickier for tea than coffee.
 ''It was fun but extremely difficult because of the varieties,'' he said. ''The variety in leaf and size is enormous.''
 He paused when the question of the British market was raised. Tea consumption per capita there is higher than in any other developed Western market.
 ''In Britain there's a different tea culture,'' Mr. Kwakman said. ''People drink big mugs of tea with sugar and milk. Our concept is developed to fully enjoy the subtle flavor of tea.''
 Nespresso has in the past faced criticism for not offering enough recycling points for its aluminum pods and for not pushing its sustainability efforts further and faster.
 Special T will ''comply with all the Nestle practices in terms of sustainability and creating shared value,'' Mr. Kwakman said.
 Mr. Kwakman would not provide specific financial targets but said penetration in 1 percent or 2 percent of households in each market would be judged a success. All machines will be made under license and sold by Nestle.
 Last week, Nestle's top executives signed off on the product -- with tea.
 ''The board drank tea all day,'' Mr. Kwakman said. ''We had the first tea break -- instead of a coffee break -- at a board meeting in over 140 years.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Attempt To Divert Oil With a Dome

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Unable for six weeks to plug the gushing oil well beneath the Gulf of Mexico, BP renewed an effort Monday to use a dome to funnel some of the leaking crude to a tanker on the surface. A similar attempt failed three weeks ago, but officials said they had resolved some of the technical problems that forced them to abort last time.
 If successful -- and after the string of failures so far, there is no guarantee it will be -- the containment dome may be able to capture most of the oil, but it would not plug the leak. Its failure would mean continued environmental and economic damage to the gulf region, as well as greater public pressure on BP and the Obama administration, with few options remaining for trying to contain the spill any time soon. 
 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. plans to visit the Gulf Coast on Tuesday and meet with state attorneys general. Several senators have asked the Justice Department to determine whether any laws were broken in the spill.
 A lasting solution for the leak may be months away, after engineers complete the drilling of a relief well, which would allow them to plug the leaking well with cement. 
 On Monday, engineers positioned submarine robots that will try to shear off a collapsed 21-inch riser pipe with a razorlike wire studded with bits of industrial diamonds. If that is achieved, officials will need at least a couple of days to position a domelike cap over the blowout preventer, which failed to shut off the well when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers.
 The trapped oil would then be funneled through a hose to ships floating near the well.
 But, like all of BP's efforts so far, this method had never been tried at such depths before this spill. Moreover, if kinks in the riser are now reducing the amount of oil escaping, cutting the riser could unleash a greater flow. And the greatest worry of all may be the potential arrival of hurricanes in the gulf; hurricane season officially begins on Tuesday.
 Engineers and technicians working on the response said that an active hurricane season, which is predicted by meteorologists, could not only push more oil ashore, but also cause weeks of delays in efforts to contain the spill.
 Once a hurricane appears to be heading for the gulf, officials will have to disconnect the hose from the container on top of the well and retreat to port, leaving an unabated flow of oil into the water.
 ''Safety first,'' said Andrew Gowers, a BP spokesman. ''We build in hurricane preparedness in operations, and that requires us to take the necessary precautions.'' 
 Such precautions may stall the drilling of relief wells for weeks or more if a hurricane threatens. 
 ''Will hurricanes trump the capping procedures or even the whole operation?'' said Donald Van Nieuwenhuise, director of petroleum geoscience programs at the University of Houston. ''That's the wild card.'' 
 Pressure is building on the Obama administration from Congress to take greater control over relief operations, and Gulf Coast residents are increasingly directing their frustration at BP as more oil washes ashore each day. 
 Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive, drew criticism on Sunday when he said his company's sampling of water had suggested that all the leaking oil was coming to the surface, despite several reports from independent researchers that underwater plumes were stretching for miles.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee, said Monday that he had sent a letter to Mr. Hayward requesting documentation to substantiate his claims. 
 Meanwhile, attention turned to the latest dome effort.
 ''Everything is at stake,'' said Larry Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, an organization partly financed by the oil industry. ''If this doesn't work, you are looking at August before you can kill the well. That would mean oil would be seeping into the gulf, into our wetlands and into our way of life at the rate of 15,000 or 20,000 barrels a day -- you pick the number.''
 An immediate challenge lies in severing the riser without causing an even bigger leak. Carol M. Browner, the White House environmental and energy adviser, has warned that the well could leak an additional 20 percent. The hope is that this would be a temporary problem until the containment dome is installed. 
 The dome procedure began two days after a maneuver known as a top kill was aborted late Saturday, when officials were unable to stanch the flow of oil with heavy drilling mud and other materials.
 ''This is a containment operation that is more straightforward,'' Robert Dudley, BP's managing director, told CNN on Sunday morning. He said containing most of the escaping oil until a relief well could be drilled was ''not a bad outcome compared to where we are today.''
 Mr. Dudley and other senior company officials have said they do not expect that the operation, even if it fails, will worsen the flow of oil significantly. BP officials said a week ago that they estimated that a 10 to 15 percent increase was possible until the cap is firmly in place.
 But a technician working on the project expressed concerns that engineers cannot be sure how much more oil might escape if the operation fails.
 ''We're all concerned about it,'' said the technician, who spoke on condition of remaining unnamed because he is not authorized to speak publicly for the company. ''We simply do not have the data about the internal geometry of the blowout preventer'' to determine what volume of oil is being contained by the damaged blowout preventer and any damaged equipment or debris inside it.
 During the previous attempt to install a containment dome, icy water rushed into the box and filled it with natural gas hydrates. Ice crystals formed from water and natural gas under the high pressure a mile down. There was no room left for escaping oil in the dome, which also became buoyant and rose to the surface.
 This time, tubes will deliver heated sea water and antifreeze to the vessel. But the technician said that the formation of hydrates was still possible.
 Greg McCormack, director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas, Austin, said he believed there was a good chance the new effort would work, ''if they can stop the hydrates from forming.'' But he cautioned that a worst-case scenario existed in which hydrates disrupt the effort and more oil is released from the severed riser.

HEADLINE: Airline Reward Programs Pay Off Less Frequently

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR participants in frequent-flier programs, more miles are chasing fewer seats, and the problem is likely to get worse.
 In April, the five so-called legacy carriers (Delta, United, American, Continental and US Airways) averaged domestic load factors of 85 percent, which measures how many seats on airplanes are occupied by paying customers. 
 Southwest Airlines reported a load factor of 78.8 percent in April. That brought the overall average down a bit for the top six carriers. But no matter how you do the math and as every frequent flier knows, an empty seat is as rare a sight as a free meal on most domestic flights. 
 Randy Peterson, the frequent-flier mileage program expert, says members of airline loyalty programs worldwide are sitting on a monster-size cache of at least nine trillion frequent-flier miles. 
 Meanwhile, both business and leisure travel demand is rebounding, and airfares are rising. For anyone looking to cash in miles for a free ticket, how do these numbers add up?
 Not so well, according to a recent survey by the IdeaWorks and ezRez Software. Researchers made 6,160 inquiries seeking rewards on the Web sites of 22 frequent-flier programs during February and March. The inquiries sought a variety of long-haul and short-haul trips.
 The survey received considerable media attention since it was released last month, nearly all of it focused on which airlines delivered best on reward travel. In general, requests for short-haul travel scored best, which is one of several reasons that Southwest Airlines came out on top, delivering on 99.3 percent of inquiries. 
 The domestic legacy carriers, which have far more complicated frequent-flier programs, fared far worse. Of those five, Continental was best, at 71.4 percent. United came next, at 68.6 percent, then American (57.9 percent), Delta (12.9 percent) and US Airways (10.7 percent).
 Fewer mileage-award tickets are available. Continental, for example, awarded 1.3 million mileage tickets in 2009, representing 6 percent of its total miles flown, down from 1.6 million in 2008 and 8.5 percent of miles flown.
 The rankings got wide attention, as I said. The implications did not.
 Deals that airlines make with credit card companies are the bedrock of most big frequent-flier programs. Banks that issue airline-branded credit cards have paid billions to those airlines in exchange for huge amounts of frequent-flier miles. The credit cards are then marketed to customers accumulating mileage with every purchase they make. Where airline frequent-flier programs once were built on miles actually flown, most are now overwhelmingly built on miles generated by consumer purchases of all sorts.
 Revenue generated by selling miles to credit card companies became ''piggy banks'' as airline scrambled desperately for revenue, said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorks. ''The airlines have been treating this like crack cocaine to satisfy their needs. But they're not taking the money and investing that back into the programs to help fix the reward issue,'' he said.
 He says the system worked well before this because airlines could manage the line between free and paid tickets. ''That was when you could make more seats available to your frequent-flier program because you believed those seats wouldn't be sold for revenue. So frequent-flier members got the leftovers,'' Mr. Sorensen said.
 Now, there are more miles chasing fewer rewards seats. ''The days of 65 percent load factors, which even then generated profits, are gone. We are now in a higher load-factor, lower-fare environment,'' he said.
 Besides dissatisfaction about the general decline in availability, frequent-flier members are increasingly unhappy about the higher number of miles required to grab any reward seat, and the growing trend of airlines slapping fees on those supposedly free tickets.
 So what's ahead? I'm looking at a system that's plagued with diminishing rewards, growing desperation of credit card companies to get people to sign up, and staggering amounts of money bet on the assumption that travelers will continue to have faith in these frequent-flier programs. 
 With all that, I wonder if this is another great big economic bubble that's bound to burst?
 ''Most definitely,'' Mr. Sorensen said.

HEADLINE: A Summer of Full Flights and Rising Fares

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
This is not going to be a good summer for air travelers. 
 They face a potential combination of crowded flights, high fares and labor disruptions. And that does not even consider the possibility of more canceled flights because of new penalties for airlines that encounter long tarmac delays or the potential of continued disruption in Europe from the volcano ash drifting from Iceland.
 Demand for business and leisure travel is expected to be stronger this summer than last, which means travelers will be fighting for seats that have been reduced significantly during the recession. 
 According to an analysis of first- and business-class travel in the first quarter by the International Air Transport Association, the trade group for the airline industry, the number of passengers traveling in these classes was 7.6 percent higher than in the period a year earlier. The number of passengers in economy was up 7.4 percent in the same period. 
 Growth in all classes of service is ''being driven by business travel, rather than leisure,'' the group's analysis said. ''As business confidence and world trade have turned up sharply, business travelers have returned. Consumer confidence has not recovered in the same way as business confidence.''
 Major corporate travel agencies in the United States are also reporting strong growth in flying by business travelers. Dale Eastlund, senior director of the consulting group of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the corporate travel management company, said airline bookings by North American corporate customers were up 15 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2009. 
 Michael Steiner, executive vice president of Ovation Corporate Travel in New York, said the number of airline transactions by Ovation's corporate customers was 22.5 percent higher in the first four months of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009, while the number of airline transactions by its leisure customers was up 39 percent. 
 These double-digit increases in demand are in no way being matched by similar increases in the number of seats. The Air Transport Association, the trade group of the American airline industry, said domestic capacity will be only 0.2 percent higher this summer than last, while capacity on international routes will be up 6.6 percent. 
 ''Seats will be limited,'' said Michael Derchin, airline analyst for CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Conn. ''It's going to be a more difficult travel experience for business people, with 90 percent load factors in the peaks.''
 The inevitable outcome of limited seats and stronger demand will be higher fares, at least compared with the greatly depressed levels of 2009. 
 Business- and first-class fares are up 10 percent globally from their ''low point in mid-2009, but they're still a lot lower than they were prerecession,'' said Brian Pearce, chief economist of the international airline industry group. ''It indicates the development of a relative shortage of seats.'' 
 From January to April, the average ticket price booked by a corporate customer of Ovation Travel climbed 16.2 percent, Mr. Steiner said.
 Mathias Eichelberger, director of airline relations for Egencia, the corporate travel division of Expedia, agreed that fares were rising. ''There are going to be very full flights with high prices, especially on trans-Atlantic routes,'' he said. ''I think leisure travel on the trans-Atlantic is going to come back stronger, with a stronger dollar and overall consumer confidence.''
 Another result of more crowded flights could be a dearth of desirable seats, like those on aisles or in exit rows. 
 ''Flights are going to be full,'' Mr. Eastlund warned. ''In many instances, business travelers will end up in the middle seat.'' 
 And upgrades, which have not been plentiful recently -- at Ovation Travel, for example, business traveler upgrades plummeted 21 percent from January to April -- are expected to be even scarcer during the peak summer months. 
 ''It will be much more challenging to get upgraded, because of the lack of capacity and the high number of frequent fliers,'' Mr. Eastlund said.
 Disruption in flying is also possible this summer because of labor problems. Already, British Airways has been dealing with on-again, off-again strikes by its cabin crew, while the management of American Airlines is preparing for a possible strike by its flight attendants.
 The volcano in Iceland could also create further disruptions for travelers. Jennifer Wilson-Buttigieg, co-president and co-owner of Valerie Wilson Travel, a corporate travel company in New York, said she was advising clients with connecting flights in any city in Europe ''to build in a few extra hours for connecting time.'' 
 The Transportation Department's new regulations governing tarmac delays could wreak further havoc with air travel this summer because of the potential for thunderstorm delays, some experts say. Under the new rules, the government has said it will fine carriers in the United States as much as $27,500 for each passenger if they keep people on domestic flights waiting for more than three hours on the tarmac without letting them get off. 
 ''I guess airlines will err on the side of caution'' if they are considering canceling a flight, Mr. Derchin said, adding that the result could be ''more cancellations than normal.'' And if capacity is tight, it could be hard to rebook passengers from canceled flights. 
 To make business air travel as manageable as possible, corporate travel executives suggest booking as far in advance as possible to get the lowest fares and best seats available, and developing a backup plan in case of delays. 
 They also point out that some frequent American travelers can use automated kiosks to pass through United States customs as part of the Global Entry program. The executives note, too, that the Transportation Security Administration runs a Black Diamond program at many of the major airports that designates security lanes for travelers familiar with the agency's rules.
 There is usually an alternative to air travel ''if the potential for disruption is too great,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research. ''Take the train, drive or turn to technology.'' That way, he said, business travelers can avoid ''the hassle factor and not compete for overhead bin space with families.''

HEADLINE: Global Equities Are Mixed On Day of Quiet Dealings

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks in Europe were mixed on Monday, while equities advanced in Canada and Brazil in what was, over all, a quiet trading session driven by diverse news developments. 
 ''There was no bad news over the weekend,'' said Eduardo Favrin, who oversees about $2.5 billion in stocks as head of equities for HSBC Global Asset Management's Brazil unit in Sao Paulo. ''The absence of the American market really dries out the liquidity in other markets.'' 
 Stock exchanges in the United States were closed for Memorial Day, while those in Britain were off for a bank holiday.
 Spanish government bonds fell after Fitch Ratings stripped the nation of its AAA rating. Shares in Spain and France fell, while the German DAX index rose as investors speculated that the global economy would withstand the debt crisis in the euro zone. 
 Canada's economy grew at the fastest pace since 1999 in the first quarter, led by consumer spending and manufacturing. 
 Gross domestic product rose 6.1 percent at an annualized pace in the January-March period, Statistics Canada said on Monday. That helped drive the Standard & Poor's/TSX Composite Index in Canada up 0.78 percent. 
 Elsewhere, remarks by central bank officials encouraged investors. Developing nations remain ''a source of strength for the world economy,'' the European Central Bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said on Monday via video link to a Bank of Korea conference. 
 The MSCI World Index of stocks in 24 developed markets has rallied 57 percent from its low in March 2009 after economies began to show signs of recovery from the worst recession since World War II and central banks kept interest rates near record lows. 
 Indexes for South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia rose more than 1 percent on Monday.
 Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told reporters in Seoul that he ''wouldn't be surprised'' if the Fed's policy of low rates ''gets extended just a little bit.''
 Oil rose to $74.44 a barrel in New York. 
 ''Over the next one-two months a relatively resilient economic and profit outlook should push riskier assets up,'' Jan Loeys, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase based in London, wrote in an e-mailed report on Monday. ''Confidence surveys remain strong and lower interest rates, oil prices and a cheaper euro are providing positive feedback from the market correction.''
 A 1.8 percent rise in Brazil's Bovespa stock index was propelled by the government-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, as crude climbed on speculation that economic growth in the United States will sustain a global recovery in fuel demand.
 In Israel, shares fell 1.64 percent on concern that tensions may escalate after the killing of pro-Palestinian activists aboard a flotilla of relief vessels.

HEADLINE: Three Men and a Video Camera, Out to Reveal Urban Truths and a Cheaper Big Mac

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Buried somewhere in every bodega, amid the Crunchy Mini Donuts, 40-ounce malt-liquor torpedoes and greasy pork rinds is a certain urban truth. Leave it to the Internets Celebrities, a trio of guerrilla filmmakers, to uncover it.
 ''This isn't Whole Foods,'' said Dallas Penn, after riffing on all the chemically enhanced cakes, chips and beverages he found in a South Bronx bodega.
 ''It's part foods,'' replied Rafi Kam.
 But it is totally funny as part of ''Bodega,'' a short video that explores the meager options that residents of poor neighborhoods have for healthy eating. The video, which Mr. Kam, Mr. Penn and their friend Casimir Nozkowski made in 2006, joined a growing online oeuvre that has brought them cult status as wisecracking social critics who deconstruct the worlds of check-cashing outlets, street vendors and even sugar-laden breakfast cereal. 
 Assailing their targets with staged stunts and gleefully blue language, the three men, all New Yorkers in their 30s, conjure up a world in which Michael Moore might meet Dave Chappelle.
 ''They have the magic touch, where they can take a topic and turn it into a T-shirt slogan, yet not lose touch with the issue,'' said Ben Popken, one of the managing editors of Consumerist.com, a Web site specializing in consumer advocacy and personal finance. ''They're geniuses at doing that.''
 Their most recent and ambitious effort, ''Stadium Status,'' which will be shown for the first time Tuesday evening at the Brooklyn Public Library, takes on local sports franchises that get millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives while their neighbors scramble to make ends meet in a sour economy. The idea that luxury lives next door to poverty is not lost on the filmmakers.
 ''In this city you can have the poorest and the wealthiest, sometimes in the same ZIP code,'' Mr. Penn said. ''But even in this huge city, people feel separated and that shouldn't be. I hope our films can show that one way or another we are all connected.''
 Befitting an Internet invention, the trio's origins date back to the days, four years ago, when Mr. Penn and Mr. Kam were fans of each other's blogs. 
 ''I felt like there was a voice in my head that I didn't hear anyone else using,'' Mr. Penn said. ''I wanted to read between the lines, to write about what was going on in New York City with politics, relationships, movies. Anything that came through my head.''
 In one blog post, he told readers how to create a Big Mac for a fraction of the cost by combining items from the McDonald's dollar menu and requesting free items like Big Mac sauce. Some readers may have thought he was promoting the fast-food chain, but Mr. Penn saw himself as a subversive.
 ''The idea was how do you get over on McDonald's,'' he said. ''I didn't want to just do something that added to their coffers.''
 Mr. Kam knew Mr. Penn was on to something. ''I thought this could make a good short video,'' he said. ''YouTube had just started, so I thought, ''Let's get it out there.' ''
 He enlisted Mr. Nozkowski, a high school friend and filmmaker who had worked on music videos and promotional shorts for AMC and other cable channels. The three went to a McDonald's in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, ordered the necessary ingredients, made a few Big Macs, ate them, then posed outside. The resulting video, ''Ghetto Big Mac,'' has attracted more than a million views on YouTube.
 Their next topic gelled when Mr. Penn read that the Bronx was the nation's poorest urban county. He had spent time in Hunts Point for his job as a construction manager, and knew that the neighborhood had almost no place to buy healthy food, despite its proximity to the wholesale food market. 
 ''But you can find a bodega everywhere,'' Mr. Penn said. ''There's that yellow and red awning. Bodega! Oh, yeah!'' 
 Working on impulse, the men spent two days in the area, filming running commentary as they strolled through aisles of junk food.
 ''We had the bodega food pyramid,'' Mr. Penn said. ''You have the 40-ounce food group, the chips food group, the snack-cake food group and on top, the quarter-water food group,'' which includes small containers of flavored water, each costing 25 cents.
 The video struck a chord among viewers who recognized serious commentary amid the banter. A city-run literacy program asked to use the video, but proposed one change. ''We thought it was the language, when we cursed,'' Mr. Penn said. ''But it turns out they wanted us to remove the list of politicians we thanked at the end for keeping the Bronx poor.'' The men agreed, but the literacy program did not follow up on the idea.
 More recent videos have kept the poor in focus. ''Checkmate,'' about the lack of financial services in some neighborhoods, delves into the check-cashing business and their hefty fees. But it points out that big banks impose their own raft of charges.
 ''All the fees at a check-cashing place are up on the wall,'' Mr. Nozkowski said. ''But when I get a credit card statement from my bank, there is all this tiny print on the back of the form. In some ways those banks are shadier than the check-cashing places.''
 In ''Stadium Status,'' the filmmakers lament that sports franchises promise trickle-down benefits to local merchants who never get the same type of economic incentives. ''You go to the stadium, you're not going shopping or eating on River Avenue,'' Mr. Penn said. ''Yankee Stadium is like a mall, where everything happens in the confines of the stadium. At the end of the game, you just go to your car and get on the Major Deegan.'' 
 For all their popularity, the three men have yet to quit their day jobs, said Mr. Kam, a Web designer. They have attracted small investments to offset production costs, and modest payments for showing their videos on Web sites. One, the Daily Reel, paid them to cover the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, where they worked themselves weary.
 Right before they left on that trip, they named themselves the Internets Celebrities.
 ''We wanted to encourage the idea that anybody on the Internet can be a celebrity,'' Mr. Kam said. ''Of course it's different from real celebrity. When you're an Internets Celebrity, instead of standing on the red carpet, it's just on your shaggy basement carpet.''

HEADLINE: The Fading Summer Job

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
This year is shaping up to be even worse than last for the millions of high school and college students looking for summer jobs.
 State and local governments, traditionally among the biggest seasonal employers, are knee-deep in budget woes, and the stimulus money that helped cushion some government job programs last summer is running out. Private employers are also reluctant to hire until the economy shows more solid signs of recovery.
 So expect fewer lifeguards on duty at public beaches this summer in California, fewer workers at some Massachusetts state parks and camping grounds and taller grass outside state buildings in Kentucky. 
 Students seeking summer jobs, generally 16 to 24 years old, are at the end of the job line, behind the jobless baby boomers who are competing with new college graduates who, in turn, are trying to elbow out undergraduates and high school students. 
 With so many people competing for so few jobs, unemployed youth ''are the silent victims of the economy,'' said Adele McKeon, a career specialist with the Boston Private Industry Council who counsels students on matters like workplace etiquette, professionalism and resume writing. 
 Getting that first job ''is an accomplishment, and it's independence,'' Ms. McKeon said. ''If you don't have it, where are you going to learn that stuff?''
 The unemployment rate for the 16-to-24 age group reached a record 19.6 percent in April, double the national average. For those job seekers, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, ''This is the worst year, definitely since the early '80s recession and very likely since the Great Depression.''
 Or as researchers at Northeastern University, who issued a report in April on youth unemployment, put it, ''The summer job outlook does not appear to be very bright in the absence of a massive new summer jobs intervention.''
 Still, the poor numbers this year are not solely a symptom of the continued weak economy. For generations, government data shows, at least half of all teenagers were in the labor force in June, July and August. Starting this decade, though, the number of employed teenagers began to drop, and by 2009, less than a third of teenagers had jobs. This year, the number could fall below 30 percent. 
 That is a stark contrast to the job market for recent college graduates seeking full-time employment -- a market where this is actually a slight increase from this time last year. 
 There is no simple explanation for the large drop-off in summer jobs this decade, though experts say that more high school students are choosing to volunteer and do internships to burnish their college applications. But the Northeastern researchers said a large number of youths had been left out of the work force and wanted to get back in.
 The forecast for this summer is so dire that high school students took to the streets this year in Washington, Boston and New York to push lawmakers to come up with money for summer youth jobs programs as Congress did last year, allocating $1.2 billion for a program for low-income youths.
 On Friday, the House passed a measure that included the summer jobs provision, though its future in the Senate this week is uncertain.
 The Northeastern researchers estimated that an additional $1 billion federal infusion would create some 300,000 job slots this summer, barely putting a dent in the demand for jobs. 
 Still, those types of positions are desperately needed, said Neil Sullivan, executive director of the Boston Private Industry Council, which works with private and public employers to place students. 
 For students like Anthony Roberts, 18, and Deandre Briber, 18, at the Prologue Early College High School in Chicago, the federal money offers some hope. Both are applying to the alternative school's summer jobs program. 
 Last summer, with the aid of stimulus money, the school hired dozens of students, according to its principal, Pa Joof. This summer, without the money, the school can afford just 10.
 ''It was great last summer,'' he said. ''We had 80 to 90 kids kept off of the street seven or eight weeks. They were able to come right back to school without any problem'' in the fall, he added. ''What's happening right now in Chicago, you let these kids out there for four or five weeks, we are going to lose some of them. That's just the nature of the streets.''
 Mr. Briber, who graduates next January, said he had applied at T.J. Maxx, Target, Kmart, and at a local docking company, with no luck. Having an income will help ease the burden on his mother, he said. Also, he said, ''I feel like I do need to get a job because I'm kind of a handful. I want things, clothes, and to take care of myself. I just want to be on my own, to help out with bills.'' 
 Mr. Roberts, who graduates in June and plans to attend college, said he had been searching for a job for a year and a half. Everywhere he goes, Mr. Roberts says, there are other teenagers ahead of him. ''It bothers me, but at the same time,'' he said, ''I try not to let it bother me.''
 In Boston, at the Charlestown High School, Jamila Hussein, 19, said she had been running into the same problem in looking for a part-time job in retail or restaurants. ''It's harder than it sounds,'' said Ms. Hussein, who has a summer internship lined up in July to clerk for a judge. ''Right now, some of the things, even if they are available, you have adults looking.'' 
 Last week, Ms. Hussein was at the office of Ms. McKeon, the career specialist with the Boston Private Industry Council. The partnership with the private industry council and public schools is well entrenched, about 30 years old, Ms. McKeon said. Even so, she said, ''we've never seen it like it is now.'' 
 Jada Bonner, 15, another student at Charlestown High, was at Ms. McKeon's office applying for a summer job through a community program. ''I just want a job, independence. I don't want to ask my mom 24/7 for pocket money, and she might not even have it,'' she said. 
 While cities like Boston and New York have had to cut summer youth jobs programs, Cincinnati has maintained a $1 million budget for its youth initiative the last few years because of the mayor's commitment to the program, according to Jason Barron of the mayor's office.
 About 700 high school and college-age youths will be hired to create murals, landscape, work in the parks department, serve as junior counselors and intern at neighborhood recreation centers, he said. 
 Elsewhere, the Interior Department has committed to hiring at least 12,000 youth in 2010 -- a 50 percent increase over the 8,000 in 2009 as part of its Youth in the Great Outdoors initiative.
 But for the second consecutive year, CareerBuilder.com found in its summer hiring forecast that a vast majority of employers did not intend to hire seasonal help. ''Summer hiring plans clearly show that they are still waiting to see what the future brings before they move forward with recruitment,'' said Rosemary Haefner, vice president for human resources. 
 Still, Ms. Haefner said, there have been some positive signs, like an increase in job postings. 
 Retailers like American Eagle Outfitters are hiring at various locations, including its flagship stores in New York City, where it plans job fairs in June. In tourist spots like Atlantic City, businesses are expecting a rebound in seasonal hires, according to the Convention and Visitors Authority. 
 Indeed, career specialists say job seekers who persevere can find work. ''It's still going to be a tough summer for teens,'' said Renee Ward, who runs the job help site, teens4hire.org. 
 To which Mr. Sullivan of the Boston Private Industry Council, said, ''Everyone has fond memories of their summer jobs as they grew up.''
 ''For almost half of this generation,'' he said, ''that has been lost.''

HEADLINE: The Truth About Cat and Dog Food

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
A visit to a local supply store for pets has convinced me that many people's pets eat better than their two-legged companions, or their companion's children. 
 Whatever you think your pet needs (dog or cat, that is, I'm not getting into nutrition for birds, rabbits, turtles and the many exotic animals people keep as pets), there is a product ready to meet it: vegetarian, organic, holistic, natural, raw, kosher, all-meat, gluten-free, high-fiber, high-protein, grain-free, low-fat, ''lite'' and anti-allergy. There are products for young and old pets and those with sensitive skin, sensitive stomachs and sensitive skin and stomachs, as well as foods enriched with supplements like antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine and chondroitin, the value of which has yet to be established for people, let alone pets. 
 Do the conscientious pet owners who buy these products really scour the supermarket for the human equivalent of ''Grain-Free Optimal Holistic Nutrition for Dogs, Thoughtfully Chosen Whole Food Natural Ingredients in Every Bite,'' as proclaimed on the package of Earthborn Primitive Natural dog food? Or baby food like Innova Puppy Food made with turkey, duck, barley, brown rice, apple, tomato, carrot, potato, egg, cottage cheese and alfalfa sprouts? 
 Parents know how to respond when a baby reacts badly to a newly introduced food. But if a puppy eating Innova had a food sensitivity, how could you tell which ingredient was responsible? 
 I'm not against feeding pets well. They are, after all, much-loved members of the family, providing valuable emotional support. Although both cats and dogs can be as mischievous as toddlers and as rebellious as teenagers, they are always happy to see you and they never talk back.
 In fact, too often pets are overindulged, with too much food and too many snacks in proportion to the exercise they get. Veterinary groups have estimated that 20 to 60 percent of American dogs and cats are overweight or obese and at risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.
 And I wonder whether people who invest in high-end pet foods are getting their money's worth. Are their pets really healthier and happier? Do they live longer? And are these foods any better than the generic versions sold in supermarkets and big-box stores?
 Recognizing the high value most owners place on their companion animals, and distressed by recent recalls of contaminated pet foods, two scientists decided to examine the pet food industry and the evidence for the value of its products and the claims made for them. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, and Malden C. Nesheim, emeritus professor of nutrition at Cornell University, have packaged their findings in ''Feed Your Pet Right: The Authoritative Guide to Feeding Your Dog and Cat,'' published in May by Free Press. 
 In an interview, Dr. Nestle (pronounced NES-sel) said: ''People are willing to spend anything on their pets. The $18-billion-a-year pet food industry is considered to be recession-proof. Although during this economic downturn shelters have been overwhelmed with pets people could not afford to keep, those who have kept their pets are not stinting on what they spend to feed them.'' 
 She noted, however, that the so-called premium pet foods cost three to four times more than supermarket brands. Within the premium brands, there is also a wide price range, yet when the ingredients lists are compared, they are strikingly similar since all have to meet certain nutritional standards. The first five ingredients of nearly every kind of dog and cat food are generally the same, representing protein, fats and carbohydrates, Dr. Nestle said, adding that ''anything listed below the salt would be present in only very small amounts.'' She and Dr. Nesheim compared 10 premium chicken dinners for dogs and found that all contained basically the same ingredients: All start with chicken or chicken broth, followed by grains and vegetables. The nonpremium brands use more grains and poultry, meat and fish byproducts. 
 Most important, Drs. Nestle and Nesheim say, is to look for products labeled ''complete and balanced,'' indicating that they meet the nutritional requirements of cats and dogs listed by the Association of American Feed Control Officials. This organization, in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration, state officials and the animal feed industry, develops model regulations for pet foods, which are voluntary unless encoded in state laws.
 ''All pet foods are made from the byproducts of human food production,'' Dr. Nestle explained. ''No matter what the package says, your dog is not getting whole chicken breasts, but what remains after the breasts have been removed for human food.''
 And, indeed, it is primarily human food companies -- Nestle, Purina, Mars and Procter & Gamble -- that make the pet foods sold throughout the world. Of course, in much of the world, domestic dogs and cats survive on table and street scraps, not commercially produced pet foods. In seeking evidence for the added value to health and longevity of commercial pet foods, the authors found almost none with any validity. 
 No agency requires proof of pet food health claims, and no pet food company is willing to invest in decades of research to determine whether its products keep animals healthier and extend their lives, the authors state. Pet food companies say they do research, but it is rarely done in a scientific fashion, with comparable control and experimental groups. There is, however, ample evidence that, despite claims to the contrary, both dogs and cats ''are perfectly able to digest grains if they are cooked,'' Dr. Nestle said.
 None of this should imply that different pet food products make no difference to individual animals. When my friends' havanese began licking its paws incessantly, the vet suggested they try a corn-free pet food, which stopped the itching. However, they need not spend $31 for a 12.5-pound bag of premium food free of corn; Costco's Kirkland Super Premium Dog Food, also free of corn, costs about $15 for a 40-pound bag.
 Still, Dr. Nestle suggested, ''if one or another brand seems to completely change the way a dog behaves or cures an allergy, when you find something that works for you, stay with it.'' 
 While many pay good money for marketing gimmicks, Dr. Nestle also does not object to people paying for attributes they value. If characteristics like natural, organic, holistic, vegetarian or kosher are important to pet owners, it may be worth it to them to pay top dollar for pet foods that claim to provide the desired attribute, even if there is no official or enforced definition of the claim.
 Although some owners insist on cooking for their pets, the authors said animals are more likely to get all the nutrients they need, and in the right amounts, from a commercial product.
 ''Besides, the pet food industry serves an important ecological function by using up food that would otherwise be thrown out,'' Dr. Nestle said. ''If everyone cooked human food for the 472 million cats and dogs in America, it would be like feeding an additional 42 million people.''

HEADLINE: The States of War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL E. O'HANLON, IAN LIVINGSTON and HEATHER MESSERA

 BODY:
SO far in 2010, the story from the battlefields is one of continued gradual progress in Iraq, some headway in Pakistan and uncertainty in Afghanistan. The other big headline is that United States force totals in Afghanistan now exceed those in Iraq for the first time since early 2003. 
 Iraq is of course still complex, but mostly in regard to the political situation, not the military one. Despite incidents like the coordinated bombings last month that killed more than 100 Iraqis around the country, security trends are improving even as United States forces accelerate their drawdown.
 In Pakistan, the army continues its ''silent surge,'' having moved more than 100,000 troops from the eastern border with India to the western tribal regions over the last few years. Pakistan has largely cleared several key areas of ''miscreants,'' as its officials like to describe extremists and insurgents. Still, Pakistan's economic and demographic trends remain shaky at best, casting doubt on prospects for longer-term stability.
 In Afghanistan, the American and NATO buildup is well under way, with 25,000 coalition troops now in Helmand Province alone. Additional forces are being sent to clear the Taliban from the key southern city of Kandahar. Corruption and the weakness of the Afghan government continue to be the Taliban's key advantages. More promising are efforts to strengthen the Afghan Army and police, whose training and mentoring programs have been revamped under the American commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal. -- MICHAEL E. O'HANLON, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and IAN LIVINGSTON and HEATHER MESSERA, researchers at Brookings

HEADLINE: Our Epic Foolishness

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
If a bank is too big to fail, it's way too big to exist. If an oil well is too far beneath the sea to be plugged when something goes wrong, it's too deep to be drilled in the first place. 
 When are we going to stop behaving so stupidly? We nearly wrecked the economy and we're all but buried in debt. But we can't break up the biggest banks, and we can't raise taxes. Now we're fouling the magnificent Gulf of Mexico and ruining entire communities along the southern Louisiana Coast. 
 And, by the way, we're still fighting a futile war in Afghanistan that we've been fighting with nonstop futility for nearly a decade. (I'm sure the troops saddled with this thankless task were thrilled to see fans and teams demonstrating their undying support for their efforts by wearing fancy baseball caps on Memorial Day.)
 For a nation that can't stop bragging about how great and powerful it is, we've become shockingly helpless in the face of the many challenges confronting us. Our can-do spirit was put on hold many moons ago, and here we are now unable to defeat the Taliban, or rein in the likes of BP and the biggest banks, or stop the oil gushing furiously from the bowels of earth like a warning from Hades about the hubris and ignorance that is threatening to destroy us.
 BP and the Obama administration have been equally clueless about halting the millions of gallons of oil that have flowed into the gulf since the Deepwater Horizon explosion more than a month ago. President Obama's top adviser on energy policy, Carol Browner, unintentionally underscored the monumental futility of the response in a comment she made on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday.
 ''This is obviously a difficult situation,'' said Ms. Browner, ''but it's important for people to understand that from the beginning, the government has been in charge.''
 Got that? No one has been able to bring the crisis under control, and no one expects it to be brought under control soon, but the important thing for us to know is that the government has been in charge of this epic failure all along.
 However and whenever the well gets capped, what we really need is leadership that calls on the American public to begin coping in a serious and sustained way with an energy crisis that we've been warned about for decades. If the worst environmental disaster in the country's history is not enough to bring about a reversal of our epic foolishness on the energy front, then nothing will.
 The first thing we can do is conserve more. That's the low-hanging fruit in any clean-energy strategy. 
 It's fast, cheap and easy. It's something that all Americans, young and old, can be asked to participate in immediately. In that sense, it's a way of combating the pervasive feelings of helplessness that have become so demoralizing and so destructive to our long-term interests.
 People have talked about energy conservation for the longest time. But we have dawdled on making vehicles more fuel-efficient and weatherizing our homes and insisting that commercial buildings be more energy efficient, and so on. Turn those thermostats down a couple of degrees in the winter and up in the summer. Figure out ways to have a little fun while doing it.
 We also need a carbon tax. The current crisis is the perfect opportunity for our political leaders to explain to the public why this is so important and what benefits would come from it. 
 Above all, I'd like to see the creation of a second Manhattan Project that would lead us in a few years to an environment in which alternative fuels are abundant, effective and affordable. We are a pathetically weak player in that game right now.
 Instead of staring mesmerized at the tragedy in the gulf, like spectators at a train wreck, we should be trying to regain that innovative can-do spirit that made America the greatest of nations. 
 All around us is the wreckage of our failure to master the challenges confronting us. We see it in the many millions of Americans who remain out of work and whose hopes are not rising despite all the talk of economic recovery. We see it in the schools where teachers are walking the plank by the scores of thousands because of state and local budget problems.
 We see it in the shrinking middle class and in the black community where depressionlike conditions are fostering not just a sense of helplessness, but despair.
 What's needed is dynamic leadership (it doesn't have to come from the top) to reinvigorate the spirit of America and turn that sense of helplessness around.

HEADLINE: Hint of Tough Times in a Private School's Ads

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
SADDLE RIVER, N.J. -- The mad scramble for places in renowned urban private schools does not apply out here in the well-off suburbs. Parents here tend to think highly of their local public schools, while the nearby private schools often have empty slots and turn away relatively few students. 
 Still, the suburban private schools, like their city cousins, survive on the qualities that set them apart from public schools: small classes, flexibility, extracurricular activities, sophisticated courses. The differences are so well understood that they are usually not noted. 
 But for the last few weeks, the Saddle River Day School has been advertising in local newspapers -- a departure, in itself, for many private schools -- with a pitch subtly pointing out that at a time when New Jersey public schools are cutting back, Saddle River Day is not. 
 Over a photo of a teacher engaged with a single student, each ad has a headline like ''Skimping on science isn't smart,'' or ''Skimping on world language isn't smart.'' All of them point to the school's low student-teacher ratio and its enviable rate of graduates headed to top colleges.
 Budget-cutting in public schools ''has sparked me personally and us as a school because what they are cutting is not good for children,'' said Eileen Lambert, head of school at Saddle River Day. 
 The ad campaign comes at a moment of paradoxes. The recession that has prompted public schools to trim programs and increase class sizes, making private school more appealing, has also left parents less able to come up with the $25,000 to $30,000 a year charged by many day schools. And for private schools, taking advantage of the perceived vulnerability of public schools is a chance to shore up their own battered finances.
 Naturally, the advertising does not sit well with public schools' advocates, pulled between protesting the pain of lowered state aid to schools and defending the quality of those schools.
 ''I would view that to be very, very presumptuous in terms of characterizing educational excellence in the public schools,'' said Raymond R. Wiss, a board member of the Northern Valley School District, a few miles from Saddle River, who was recently elected president of the New Jersey School Boards Association. 
 ''It's a challenging time for local board members and local school districts to deal with the fiscal aspects of public education,'' he said. ''But I do not believe that there has been any significant curtailment at this juncture, not yet.''
 Private schools that belong to the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools have 2 to 3 percent lower enrollment than they did last year, said Linda Moore, executive director of the group. She said schools had to offer financial aid to more students, and bigger aid packages to keep the students they already had.
 ''There are parents who have lost jobs, especially in those areas where a lot of people work in finance,'' she said.
 At Saddle River Day School, administrators say that about 20 percent of students get financial aid, up from 15 percent before the recession, and that enrollment has slid from about 330 to 300. 
 Elite private schools do little advertising, beyond notices of open houses and maybe an item in an education magazine or a newspaper's education supplement. In particular, this genteel set is not inclined to trumpet comparisons -- however implied -- with the competition.
 ''I haven't seen anything like that in this area,'' Thomas W. Nammack, headmaster of Montclair Kimberley Academy in Montclair, said of the Saddle River ads. ''We haven't really taken out ads extolling the school in general.''
 But he found it understandable that a school would suddenly feel the need to drum up business, pointing to a sharp drop in the number of parents window-shopping at private schools. ''People are either sure that they want to do this and make a commitment,'' Mr. Nammack said, ''or they're not going to look.''

HEADLINE: The Oil Plume

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The failure of the top-kill technique in the Gulf of Mexico represents an interesting turning point on the Obama presidency. It symbolizes the end of the period of lightning advance and the beginning of the period of nasty stasis.
 President Obama swept into office having aroused the messianic hopes of his supporters. For the past 16 months he has been on nearly permanent offense, instigating action with the stimulus bill, Afghan policy, health care reform and the nearly complete financial reform. Whether you approve or not, this has been an era of bold movement. 
 But now the troops are exhausted, the country is anxious, the money is spent and the Democratic majorities are teetering. The remaining pieces of legislation, on immigration and energy, are going nowhere. (The decision to do health care before energy is now looking extremely unfortunate.)
 Meanwhile, the biggest problems are intractable. There's no sign we will be successful in preventing a nuclear Iran. Especially after Monday's events, there's no chance of creating a breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli dispute. Unemployment will not be coming down soon. The long-term fiscal crisis won't be addressed soon either.
 In other words, if the theme of the past 16 months was large change, the theme of the next period will be gridlock and government's apparent impotence in the face of growing problems.
 And, at this particular moment, we are confronted by the picture of an uncontrolled gusher of oil spewing destruction into the gulf. This image could be with us for another few months, searing into the national consciousness and becoming the defining image of 2010.
 Everybody is comparing the oil spill to Hurricane Katrina, but the real parallel could be the Iranian hostage crisis. In the late 1970s, the hostage crisis became a symbol of America's inability to take decisive action in the face of pervasive problems. In the same way, the uncontrolled oil plume could become the objective correlative of the country's inability to govern itself.
 The plume taps into a series of deep anxieties. First, it taps into the anxiety that the people running our major institutions are just not that competent. Second, it feeds into the anxiety that there has been an unhappy marriage between corporations and government officials, which has had the effect of corrupting both. Most important, the plume exposes the country's core confusion about the role of government.
 When this country was born, the founders laid down strict roles for the federal government and the president. But over the years, the roles of government and the presidency have expanded. 
 As a matter of conviction, the country is deeply uncomfortable with these expansions. Operationally, on the other hand, the country has become accustomed to the new programs and to the new presidential role.
 In times of crisis, you get a public reaction that is incoherence on stilts. On the one hand, most people know that the government is not in the oil business. They don't want it in the oil business. They know there is nothing a man in Washington can do to plug a hole a mile down in the gulf.
 On the other hand, they demand that the president ''take control.'' They demand that he hold press conferences, show leadership, announce that the buck stops here and do something. They want him to emote and perform the proper theatrical gestures so they can see their emotions enacted on the public stage.
 They want to hold him responsible for things they know he doesn't control. Their reaction is a mixture of disgust, anger, longing and need. It may not make sense. But it doesn't make sense that the country wants spending cuts and doesn't want cuts, wants change and doesn't want change. 
 At some point somebody's going to have to reach a national consensus on the role of government. If this disaster teaches anything, it is that we are a venturesome, entrepreneurial society. We rely on corporations like BP to bring us energy. At the same time, it is clear that even well-meaning corporations sometimes take shortcuts when it comes to controlling pollution and protecting worker safety.
 So we want government to regulate business. We want regulation to be strong enough to reduce risk but not so strong as to stifle innovation. We want regulators to work cooperatively but not be captured by those they monitor.
 We have known, for a long time, that regulation is about balance. The proper regulatory regime has to be set case by case and year by year. 
 We should be able to build from cases like this one and establish a set of concrete understandings about what government should and shouldn't do. We should be able to have a grounded conversation based on principles 95 percent of Americans support. Yet that isn't happening. So the period of stagnations begins.

HEADLINE: Answers On Ratings Are Overdue

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Raise your hand if you can explain why anyone still believes in credit ratings.
 One of the enduring questions of the financial crisis is how the credit ratings establishment got so much so wrong for so very long. How could century-old institutions like the Moody's Investors Service give their triple-A blessings to subprime junk?
 It is time -- in fact, past time -- for Washington to get some answers. Because despite talk of a shake-up, the companies that dominate the ratings business hope to avoid the radical overhaul their critics are calling for. 
 On Wednesday, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the federal panel that is trying get to the bottom of the financial crisis, will examine the ratings industry and its many failures at a hearing. There is no shortage of hard questions to ask, including the big one: How can we prevent these institutions and their sometimes cockamamie judgments from endangering our financial system again?
 Like so much of Wall Street, the ratings industry today looks much like it did before the crisis: powerful, profitable, protected. A few new players are trying to break into the business, but the old guard -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch -- still lords it over the industry.
 The mortgage collapse exposed the conflicts at the heart of this old-line ratings oligopoly. Restaurant reviews might seem suspect if they were paid for by the restaurants being reviewed. But that is essentially how things work in the credit ratings business. Even now, after all we have learned, Moody's, S.& P. and Fitch are still paid by the banks and companies whose securities they evaluate.
 Wall Street may have a bit of hearing fatigue these days, but the one scheduled for Wednesday in New York is bound to draw some scrutiny in banking circles. Joining Raymond W. McDaniel Jr., chairman and chief executive of Moody's Corporation, will be none other than Warren E. Buffett, who happens to be Moody's biggest shareholder. 
 Mr. Buffett has been selling some of his Moody's stock of late, but given his long and lucrative association with the company, the panel might want to know what he thinks about the ratings business, past, present and future. 
 This hearing could be one of the last opportunities to educate the public and Congress about how we might overhaul a system that failed the nation before the current financial regulatory reform bill is signed into law.
 To that end, here are a few questions the panel might ask:
 Mr. McDaniel, given the obvious failures of Moody's and its peers, why should the major ratings companies retain the competitive advantages bestowed upon them by the Securities and Exchange Commission? Moody's and other major agencies are designated as nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations. What advantages does this designation convey? How would business and profits be affected if this designation were revoked?
 What specific changes have you made in your policies, procedures and personnel as a result of the financial crisis and your role in it? How should the government regularly test rating agencies to see if they should maintain their special status?
 Defend your so-called issuer-pay model -- the notion that issuers, rather investors, pay you for ratings. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, once characterized it as ''like having one of the parties in court paying the judge's salary.'' Is Senator Levin wrong? Why is an issuer-pay model better than an investor-pay model, aside from profitability for Moody's? Given that investors rarely are willing to pay for research, what would happen to your business and the bond industry if the issuer-pay model was outlawed?
 The F.B.I. issued a warning in 2004 of ''an epidemic of mortgage fraud coursing across this country.'' Were you aware of it? If so, what steps did Moody's take to ensure that the mortgage investments it was rating were not tainted by fraud? How does Moody's detect possible fraud?
 Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general and candidate for governor, is investigating whether banks hoodwinked the ratings firms. Did anyone at Moody's worry that banks might be playing fast and loose? If so, did Moody's stop doing business with those banks, or warn regulators? If you didn't, why not?
 William A. Ackman, a prominent hedge fund manager, recently suggested that the ratings industry adopt a ''wait to rate'' policy. He wants ratings agencies to wait 60 days before rating a new security, thus compelling early buyers to do their own homework. He also suggests the agencies adopt a pay-for-performance model that would reward accurate ratings. What is so bad about that?
 Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has included a provision in the latest overhaul bill that would establish a government unit that would act as an intermediary between Wall Street banks and ratings agencies. The unit would assign agencies to rate new issues. Senator Franken hopes that would root out conflicts of interest and prevent rating agencies from competing for clients by offering higher ratings than the securities deserve. What do you make of the provision?
 Last month, Moody's disclosed that it received a ''Wells notice'' from the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, indicating that the commission might file a civil suit against the firm, claiming Moody's had filed misleading descriptions about how it assigned ratings. Why did you wait almost two months before disclosing the Wells notice? 
 On the day Moody's received the Wells notice, you sold $4.3 million of Moody's shares through a previously scheduled plan. Did you consider not selling the shares? And did you alert Mr. Buffett, your largest shareholder, of the notice? His firm, Berkshire Hathaway, sold $30 million of shares in the next week.

HEADLINE: Iran Is Said to Have Fuel for 2 Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
 WASHINGTON -- In their last report before the United Nations Security Council votes on sanctions against Iran, international nuclear inspectors declared Monday that Iran has now produced a stockpile of nuclear fuel that experts say would be enough, with further enrichment, to make two nuclear weapons.
 The report, by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a branch of the United Nations, appears likely to bolster the Obama administration's case for a fourth round of economic sanctions against Iran and further diminish its interest in a deal, recently revived by Turkey and Brazil, in which Iran would send a portion of its nuclear stockpile out of the country. 
 When Iran tentatively agreed eight months ago to ship some of its nuclear material out of the country, the White House said the deal would temporarily deprive Iran of enough fuel to make even a single weapon. 
 But Iran delayed for months, and the figures contained in the inspectors' report on Monday indicated that even if Iran now shipped the agreed-upon amount of nuclear material out of the country, it would retain enough for a single weapon, undercutting the American rationale for the deal.
 The toughly worded report says that Iran has expanded work at one of its nuclear sites. It also describes, step by step, how inspectors have been denied access to a series of facilities, and how Iran has refused to answer inspectors' questions on a variety of activities, including what the agency called the ''possible existence'' of ''activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile.'' 
 A spokesman for the White House, Michael Hammer, said in a statement on Monday that the report ''clearly shows Iran's continued failure to comply with its international obligations and its sustained lack of cooperation with the I.A.E.A.'' He said the report ''underscores that Iran has refused to take any of the steps required of it'' by the Security Council or the I.A.E.A.'s board of governors, ''which are necessary to enable constructive negotiations on the future of its nuclear program.''
 Iran, which insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, has said that it has conducted no work on weapons, and argues that the evidence of work on warheads is forged.
 Iran's nuclear progress had been expected to be a central subject at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday at the White House between President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Mr. Netanyahu canceled the visit after a deadly raid by Israeli commandos on ships carrying supplies to Gaza.
 But the I.A.E.A. report left hanging the question of whether Israel would ratchet up the pressure on Washington and its allies to show that they can deal with the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran diplomatically. Israeli officials have hinted, but never explicitly threatened, that they would take military action if diplomacy fails and Iran is close to weapons capability. 
 Administration officials have argued that the combination of the sanctions they expect to come out of the Security Council, along with other sanctions imposed by the United States and its European allies, may change Iran's calculus. But many inside and outside the administration are highly skeptical. 
 It has been four years since the Security Council first demanded that Iran cease all enrichment of uranium, citing its efforts to hide its activities and deceive inspectors. The country has openly defied those resolutions, telling inspectors that those demands -- along with calls to allow inspectors to visit a series of facilities that could be useful in energy or weapons production -- had been ''issued illegally and have no legal basis.'' 
 The inspectors reported Monday that Iran has now produced over 5,300 pounds of low-enriched uranium, all of which would have to undergo further enrichment before it could be converted to bomb fuel. 
 The inspectors reported that Iran had expanded work at its sprawling Natanz site in the desert, where it is raising the level of uranium enrichment up to 20 percent -- the level needed for the Tehran Research Reactor, which produces medical isotopes for cancer patients. But it is unclear why Iran is making that investment if it plans to obtain the fuel for the reactor from abroad, as it would under its new agreement with Turkey and Brazil.
 Until recently, all of Iran's uranium had been enriched to only 4 percent, the level needed to run nuclear power reactors. While increasing that to 20 percent purity does not allow Iran to build a weapon, it gets the country closer to that goal. The inspectors reported that Iran had installed a second group of centrifuges -- machines that spin incredibly fast to enrich, or purify, uranium for use in bombs or reactors -- which could improve its production of the 20 percent fuel.
 The inspectors also noted that the agency had finally succeeded in setting up a good monitoring system for the 20 percent work after a rocky start in February, when Iran began raising the enrichment levels. ''A new safeguards approach is now being implemented,'' the report said.
 But the report called the equipment upgrades and the continuing enrichment ''contrary to the relevant resolutions of the I.A.E.A.'s Board of Governors and the Security Council.'' Both have called on Iran to cease its uranium enrichment because of outstanding questions about Tehran's intentions. The sanctions, if passed, are intended to compel Iran to comply with that demand by the Security Council.
 Last fall, President Obama, along with the leaders of Britain and France, denounced Iran for secretly building a second enrichment plant near the city of Qum, without alerting inspectors until just before the three leaders' countries announced they had discovered the facility. But curiously, the report suggested that now, with its existence revealed, Iran might be losing interest in it. The report said that Iran had installed no centrifuges in the half-built enrichment facility, which is located inside a mountain near a military base. 
 Iran has sought to locate many of its nuclear facilities in underground sites so as to lessen their vulnerability to aerial attacks. In the new report, the inspectors said that the Iranians disclosed that a new analytical laboratory planned for construction amid a warren of tunnels at Isfahan ''would have the same functions as the existing'' unprotected laboratory there.
 The report quoted an Iranian letter as saying the second, underground laboratory was needed ''to meet security measures.''

HEADLINE: Using Obama Model, Alabama Candidate Runs Coalition Campaign

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- If Artur Davis wins the Democratic primary here on Tuesday, placing him within one step of becoming the first black governor of Alabama, he will have reached this milestone in the most improbable of ways: bypassing the hierarchy of the state's oldest civil rights organizations.
 In this combustible election season, as President Obama's policies are fueling a fierce debate in midterm races across the country, there is a different test under way in Alabama. Can Mr. Obama's coalition style of victory -- winning over white voters before gaining support from black leaders -- be replicated in the Deep South? 
 ''Some people have said during the course of this race that this is a good idea, but Alabama's not ready for it,'' Mr. Davis said, rallying supporters at his campaign headquarters on Monday afternoon. ''Some people have said, 'maybe someday.' Someday is the refuge of people who tell us to wait. Not someday, but right now.''
 When Mr. Davis announced his plan to run for governor early last year, the president's popularity was at its peak. Mr. Obama had won the state's primary, and even though he suffered a 20-point defeat in the general election, the enthusiasm surrounding the arrival of the first black president added to the notion that voters in Alabama, too, might be ready for change.
 Mr. Davis, 42, is among the nation's new guard of black political figures. But since he was elected to Congress in 2002, he has often been at odds with much of the state's black political establishment. He never sought -- or earned -- their blessing to run for governor. And the civil rights organizations that have long carried influence over many black voters in the state have lined up behind Mr. Davis's opponent, Ron Sparks, the state agriculture commissioner, who is white. 
 Just as Mr. Obama tried to keep racial politics from splintering his campaign two years ago, Mr. Davis has tried to keep attention fixed on his plans to improve economic opportunities in the state. He has proposed to lift the state sales tax on groceries, force out-of-state timber companies to pay property taxes and rewrite the state's Constitution, which has been in place since 1901, to streamline Alabama's government. 
 Gov. Bob Riley, a Republican, is prohibited from seeking a third term. Nine candidates -- seven Republicans and two Democrats -- are running in the Tuesday primary. The Republican contest is expected to be sent into a runoff election on July 13, but regardless of the winner, the party is likely to hold an advantage in the general election because only one of the last six governors has been a Democrat.
 While the campaign features a litany of contentious issues, like bringing Las Vegas-style gambling to Alabama and requiring that state driver's license exams be given only in English, the conversation on the Democratic side of the campaign is infused with race. 
 The leaders of the Alabama Democratic Conference, the Alabama New South Coalition and two other civil rights groups that endorsed Mr. Sparks delivered an ominous prediction that Mr. Davis, the only black candidate in the race, could not win in the general election. Several polls show that Mr. Davis holds an advantage, but Mr. Sparks has narrowed the lead in recent weeks.
 ''He's gambled on the fact that he'd rather go for the white vote than the black vote,'' Joe Reed, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference, one of the leading black groups, told reporters after endorsing Mr. Sparks in May.
 The intensifying exchanges between Mr. Reed and Mr. Davis underscore the evolution in the generational ranks of black political leaders. But as Mr. Davis worked to show his independence in Washington -- he was the only black member of Congress to vote against the health care bill this spring -- he drew a stern rebuke from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who scolded, ''You can't vote against health care and call yourself a black man.''
 Mr. Davis said he opposed the health care bill because it was too expensive and he preferred a targeted approach. But his rival, Mr. Sparks, and other critics said that Mr. Davis's vote was merely an attempt to build his appeal to white voters for the fall election.
 The strategy of creating a coalition of white and black voters is reminiscent of the approach taken in the early stages of Mr. Obama's presidential campaign. Many black political leaders in Alabama, South Carolina and other states did not initially support Mr. Obama's bid, but joined after he demonstrated support among white voters.
 Glen Browder, a former Democratic congressman from Alabama who last year wrote ''The South's New Racial Politics,'' said a victory by Mr. Davis would ''change the dynamics of Alabama politics'' and loosen the establishment's ''grip on the black vote.''
 ''He's taking a bold and risky gamble with an eye toward the general election, trying to establish himself as a new-style candidate, who is not the black candidate for the Alabama governorship,'' Mr. Browder said. ''The course he is taking is a roll of the dice.''
 In an interview on Monday, as he stopped by his campaign headquarters, Mr. Davis said that he was working to create ''the most diverse winning coalition a candidate for governor has ever put together in this state.'' He said that even though he did not win the endorsement of the civil rights groups in the primary, he believed that most black voters would support him if he reaches the general election.
 A bigger challenge, he said, will be running in a tough year for Democrats. 
 ''There's no question that many of President Obama's policies are unpopular in the state, but that's not going to determine who the next governor is,'' Mr. Davis said in his office, where a painting of the president was hanging on the wall. ''National issues just simply aren't relevant to the questions that are going to decide this race.''

HEADLINE: A Right Number of Nuclear Weapons?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In their May 24 Op-Ed article, ''An Arsenal We Can All Live With,'' Gary Schaub Jr. and James Forsyth Jr. forcefully argue that the United States military strategy can do well with just 311 strategic nuclear weapons. While the reduction from the existing 5,113 is drastic, the writers remind us that they are not proposing elimination of all nuclear weapons.
 They argue that ''nuclear weapons might be the most politically useful weapons a state can possess,'' adding, ''They deter adversaries from threatening with weapons of mass destruction the American homeland, United States forces abroad and our allies and friends.'' 
 It is safe to assume that American policy makers agree with this position. If that is true, then how can the United States argue that other countries, including Iran and North Korea, should not pursue their own nuclear arsenal? Indeed, this is how many in the rest of the world view the American position: a desire for supremacy in nuclear weapons while denying other nations from having them.
 If we want others not to pursue the bomb, we should ask for all countries that possess nuclear weapons to destroy them once and for all.
 Kamran Nayeri Oakland, Calif., May 24, 2010
 The writer is a retired political economist at the University of California, Berkeley.
 To the Editor:
 Gary Schaub Jr. and James Forsyth Jr., while questioning the size of the United States nuclear arsenal, do not challenge its existence. It is surprising that they continue to hold on to the myth of nuclear deterrence even in an era in which nonstate actors like Al Qaeda, rather than nation-states, pose the biggest threat to national security.
 Far from being a deterrent, the United States arsenal -- along with those of the other nuclear weapons states -- continues to provide justification for other nations that seek to acquire nuclear weapons.
 As long as even one nation justifies having even one nuclear weapon, there can be no hope for the global nuclear disarmament envisioned by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Contrary to what Mr. Schaub and Mr. Forsyth contend, the number of nuclear weapons that we can all live with is not 311, but zero.
 Ninad R. Bondre Stockholm, May 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The reduced nuclear arsenal advocated by Gary Schaub Jr. and James Forsyth Jr. invites a nuclear Pearl Harbor and is paradoxically more threatening.
 The nuclear arsenals of the superpowers escalated in size during the cold war because of the fear of nuclear pre-emption. Maintaining a proper balance between the two sides was and still is key to successful arms reduction.
 Drastic unilateral cuts could only revive such fears. During a severe crisis, a nuclear adversary could be tempted by its enhanced capability to eliminate our small force. Worse, we could be tempted to use it before it is pre-empted.
 In today's world, single-warhead missiles can paradoxically be more threatening than the multiple-warhead ones: it may be politically easier to conduct a single retaliatory attack than to rain a dozen nuclear weapons all at once on a smaller country like Iran.
 In the language of nuclear strategy, the writers' proposal is destabilizing. It could actually be safer to completely disarm unilaterally: we would become nonthreatening and wouldn't risk being pre-empted. But the safest plan is to continue balanced reductions through arms control treaties.

HEADLINE: Make Child Care Affordable for Working Parents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Cuts to Child Care Subsidy Thwart More Job Seekers'' (''The New Poor'' series, front page, May 24): 
 Given the economy, you draw important attention to a grave failure in America's social policy: a growing number of low-income single parents cannot afford to work because of the overwhelming cost of child care.
 Our research shows that especially for low-income mothers, having help to pay for child care is key to their success in the labor market -- and that for those without a high school diploma or who are single, subsidies are closely associated with the likelihood that they work, work more hours, keep their jobs and increase their earnings.
 Meanwhile, for the children, experiencing stable child care in a high-quality setting leads to positive cognitive development, while frequent changes during the first five years of life are harmful to that development.
 You also draw attention to ''benefit cliffs'' -- the abrupt termination of a subsidy upon reaching a given income limit -- in essence, penalizing workers who increase their earnings.
 We believe that when parents increase their earnings, their families should always be better off, so we have worked with a number of states to advance reforms to phase out subsidies more gradually as earnings increase.
 Curtis Skinner Sheila Smith New York, May 24, 2010
 The writers are, respectively, director, Family Economic Security, and director, Early Childhood, at the National Center for Children in Poverty, Columbia University.
 To the Editor:
 Thank you for your article showing how a lack of access to child care subsidies forces working mothers to leave their jobs and apply for public assistance. Because New York City commits substantial public financing to early childhood programs aimed at low-income working families, nonprofit child care providers like our member agencies can accommodate thousands of families whose incomes are above public assistance limits. Indeed, most have large waiting lists of eligible families.
 Unfortunately, the proposed city budget for the year that begins July 1 will finance thousands fewer slots than are currently available. As your article all too clearly demonstrates, in challenging economic times we must expand the opportunities for employed parents, not diminish them. Government budgets should not be balanced by making it impossible for working parents to keep working.

HEADLINE: Hawaii's Teachers and the Financial Crunch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Hawaii's Race to the Bottom'' (editorial, May 23): 
 Last year, facing an unprecedented $470 million education cut, Hawaii's school board urged lawmakers and the governor to tap special funds, warning that schools were at a breaking point long before the islands' tourism-driven economy hit bottom with the recession.
 When education was not prioritized, the school board eliminated programs and hundreds of positions, and closed schools. That wasn't enough to plug the financial hole, though it avoided teacher layoffs or increased class size, while reducing to 17 the 30 school furlough days that Gov. Linda Lingle originally recommended.
 Failure to prioritize education has hurt students nationwide as districts are forced to fire teachers and carry out four-day weeks and furloughs.
 Contrary to the editorial, Hawaii teachers did sacrifice, as furloughs amounted to a significant pay cut in a state with one of the nation's highest living costs. In an agreement with the school board that avoids furloughs next year, teachers also gave up planning time to restore instructional days.

HEADLINE: Year-End Round-Up | Social Studies, History, Geography and Civics

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Our lessons are on summer vacation, but here's a look back at social studies-related lessons from the 2009-10 school year.

 BODY:
As you may know, our daily lesson plans are on summer vacation and will return in early September. In the meantime, we've got some surprises in store for both teachers and students, starting with our Summer Reading Challenge. If you receive our e-mail, you'll see our summertime materials under the heading "Summer Special."
But this week we're looking back at the school year in various subjects, starting today with social studies, American and global history, civics and geography.
Please check out our round-ups in science, health, technology and math (tomorrow) and language arts, literature, journalism and fine arts (Thursday). Much of what we do is interdisciplinary, so you may well find something interesting and useful. 
And if you missed our year-end round-up, in which we reflected on the 2009-10 school year overall, please take a look. 
Whether you're spending the summer teaching or will use some vacation time to plan for the next school year, we hope these lessons are helpful to you.
It's been a busy news year, with lots for social studies, American and global history, civics and geography teachers to address in the classroom. 
Several news events cried out for attention, and we responded as well as we could with lesson plans and other teaching materials. First and foremost among these was the devastating earthquake in Haiti. Others included health care reform, the volcanic eruption in Iceland, the Catholic church controversy, national census and, of course, the Gulf oil spill and cleanup. 
As always, we also sought to help teachers supplement existing curriculum and connect perennial teaching topics to current events. 
Our lessons in American and global history, government and civics included these topics:
President Obama's first year and his policies, including his decision on how to proceed in Afghanistan, and his first State of the Union address terrorism and al Qaeda, including the Times Square bombing attemptthe European Union the proposed repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" issues related to Iran and China, including Internet freedom the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wallsocial protest movements and violent protests the legislative process in Congress public works projects
And our ideas for marking National Geography Week, Women's History Month, Black History Month, Martin Luther King Day and the Holocaust can be used anytime or bookmarked for next year.
In economics, we tackled the European debt crisis, unemployment and the recession and hunger and charity. 
Broader thematic lessons this year included: a look at generation gaps and the first decade of the century explorations of the relationships between language and culture and culture and education ideas for addressing immigration and race and identity an exploration of America's role in the world reflection on youth crime and the age of responsibility
We also considered how history is determined, including Howard Zinn's approach, and correlating learning to education standards. 
You might also try our project suggestions using travel and tournament brackets as themes.
If you're tutoring or teaching summer school, you might have students analyze the political parties ahead of the 2010 midterm elections and learn how to get involved in election issues, watch the confirmation hearings for Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court and consider the politics of South Africa through the lens of the World Cup.

HEADLINE: As States' Bills Pile Up, Tax Refunds Are Delayed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Procrastination is no longer just for the taxpayers who wait until the last moment to file their tax returns. Thanks to the economic downturn, at least a half-dozen cash-poor states are now delaying their tax refund checks. 
 Hawaii initially planned to delay all tax refunds until July, when its fiscal year begins, but decided two weeks ago that its finances were healthy enough to begin sending checks to people whose tax returns were processed back in January. New York briefly postponed sending out half a billion dollars worth of refunds until its new fiscal year began in April. Rhode Island extended its tax filing deadline until May 11 to help taxpayers who were still reeling from severe floods; now the state is delaying refunds to make sure it has enough money left to pay debts coming due in June. 
 ''We're sorry for the inconvenience. We understand that people are relying on the money for credit card bills, etc., etc., but we'll get them out as fast as we can,'' said Paul L. Dion, the chief of Rhode Island's Office of Revenue Analysis, explaining that 34,423 refund checks were being held up as the state ensures that it has enough cash on hand to pay its debts on time. ''For the record, mine is on hold as well.'' 
 Some states lack the staff to process returns on time. Budget cuts left Iowa's Department of Revenue without the money to hire the 50 temporary workers it usually adds around tax time. So some refund checks were slowed while nearly everyone in the department -- from auditors and revenue agents to top agency officials -- was directed to pitch in by opening up envelopes and processing tax returns. 
 ''It's been a learning experience,'' said Stuart Vos, the department's revenue operations administrator, who has ripped open some envelopes himself and said the experience had spurred state tax officials to consider changing the state's tax forms next year to make them easier to process. Mr. Vos said the state's delays eased after the department got permission to hire 17 temporary workers last month. 
 It is yet another change brought about by the longest recession since the Great Depression. Many state governments are as overextended as their residents, and find themselves balancing and rebalancing their checkbooks each week to make sure they have enough money to pay their bills. Of course, holding on to the money that many taxpayers count on is usually a last resort: several states that were greeted with angry outcries when they delayed sending out refund checks last year, including Alabama, California and Georgia, made sure to pay out their refunds faster this year.
 Last year, after Missouri's decision to delay its refund checks was greeted with anger, the state tapped into some of its stimulus money to help speed the process. This year, officials said, the refunds are being paid faster, without the use of stimulus money.
 Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said that it was ''exceptionally unusual'' for so many states to delay refunds, as they have throughout the current economic downturn. 
 ''I think it's just an indicator of how bad things have been,'' Mr. Pattison said in an interview. ''It's politically, obviously, a problem. Also, I think from a policy standpoint, it's a little hard to justify -- this is the taxpayers' overpayment that is due them.'' 
 Many states have a powerful incentive not to keep the checks out of the mail for too long: laws requiring them to pay interest on refunds delayed beyond 60, 90 or 120 days. In several states, lawmakers are seeking to speed payments by shortening the period before interest kicks in.
 But steep interest costs did not prevent Georgia from long delays last year, when its Revenue Department lost nearly 18 percent of its staff to budget cuts and found itself still paying refunds in August to taxpayers who had filed their returns by the April 15 deadline. The delay was a costly one: Georgia wound up paying roughly $2.1 million in interest to taxpayers whose refund checks were sent too late. 
 Over all, states refunded 2.9 percent less money this April than they did last April, according to an analysis by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government of 34 states that have reported their tax refund data so far. But officials there cautioned that it was difficult to say whether the decline was because of delayed refunds or whether the smaller refunds were the result of people earning less money, or of states raising their taxes during the downturn.
 Verenda Smith, a spokeswoman for the Federation of Tax Administrators, an association of tax agencies, said the vast majority of taxpayers were getting their refunds on time this year, and added that many of those whose payments were being delayed probably would not even notice a difference of only a few weeks. But Ms. Smith said she hoped the troubles would prompt more taxpayers to file earlier; file electronically, which allows for much quicker processing time; and change their withholding status with their employers so they would not overpay so much. ''You really shouldn't give it to your state government as a no-interest loan, and then have to cool your heels while you wait to get it back,'' she said.
 Still, she noted, the subject of tax refunds is often fraught. ''It generates emotions that come from depths that are hard to imagine,'' she said.
 Chris Campbell, 29, is still waiting for the $1,600 refund check he is owed by the State of Rhode Island. He wants to put the money toward repairs in his basement, which was damaged by the recent floods. Mr. Campbell, who lives in Massachusetts but pays Rhode Island income taxes because he works there as an accountant, said he has had a long wait for his refund: after the state claimed that it had no record of the return he filed in February, he filed another in April.
 But still, nothing has come.
 ''It's been a painful process,'' said Mr. Campbell, who added that the frustrating delay had prompted him to change his withholding amounts so that he will not have to wait for a refund next year.
 Tim Healey, 29, a father of two from Riverside, R.I., filed his taxes in March, and got his federal refund on April 2. But he is still waiting for the $1,019 refund he is owed by the State of Rhode Island. Asked if he had plans for the money, he said: ''It's already spent. I owe the day care money.''
 State officials said that the refunds would continue to be paid on a first-in, first-out basis, and that many would probably be paid out in mid-June when many business taxes are paid. 
 Many state revenue departments now have features on their Web sites allowing taxpayers to check the status of their returns. North Carolina keeps a running tally of all its refunds on its Web site, which notes that ''the state continues to feel the effects of the slow economy, and the department is managing the distribution of refunds as a result.'' 
 The revenue secretary, Kenneth R. Lay, said the state was keeping close track of how much it owes each week for payroll, Medicaid costs and other obligations before deciding how many refunds to send out. 
 ''It's much like when you pay the bills at the end of the month,'' Mr. Lay said.

HEADLINE: Showing the Benefits Of 'Green' Retrofits

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
The practice of retrofitting buildings with simple, environmentally friendly technology like more-efficient boilers and better-quality windows has been around for years, but there is little research on how much energy these changes actually save -- and by extension, how much money they can save landlords and lenders. 
 In an effort to supply that information, Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the German bank, is financing the creation of a public database of several hundred retrofitted buildings in New York City and a companion report to determine the savings from such moves. 
 ''Retrofitting buildings is considered the low-hanging fruit in carbon reduction, but despite its simplicity, it is still not mainstream,'' said Gary Hattem, president of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation. ''The largest obstacle to making these practices go mainstream is data that will convince building owners to retrofit their properties and at the same time increase underwriters' willingness to finance the projects.''
 The project, called the Deutsche Bank/Living Cities Building Energy Efficiency Data Report, was begun last fall when the bank brought together an advisory committee that included utilities like Con Edison, city agencies like the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and lenders like the Community Preservation Corporation. 
 The committee issued a request for qualifications this year for a firm to head up the 18-month project. In May, it signed an agreement with Steven Winter Associates, a building consulting firm based in Connecticut, that will be partners with the economic development and real estate advisory firm HR&A Advisors, based in New York. 
 With more than $1 billion expected to flow into retrofitting multifamily buildings in New York City in the next decade from federal stimulus money, city commitments and private initiatives, the time is ripe to publish this report, Mr. Hattem said. 
 And experts in green building say the need is enormous. ''There is an almost universal lack of understanding of building energy usage,'' said Luke Falk, a project manager at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and a member of the advisory committee. 
 The government has subsidized programs to retrofit buildings since the Carter administration, Mr. Falk said, ''but there is no national database that we know of that records the results. Likewise, utilities across the country run Energy Star programs, but there is no central aggregated database of the results of that effort.'' 
 Developers agree that a lack of data has hampered the spread of green technologies. ''If you approach a lender now with a plan to spend more to implement a green technology with the idea you will save on operating costs, they are skeptical and want to know what kind of proof you have,'' said Kenneth S. Horn, the founder of the residential developer Alchemy Properties. ''If you could be armed with an assortment of data, it would inevitably help you get financing and even increase your financing because your bottom line would go up.'' 
 Constantine E. Kontokosta, the director for the Center for the Sustainable Built Environment at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University, agrees. ''What ends up happening is that we have studies by engineers that estimate the impact of retrofitting a building, but then the underwriters just discount it because they have nothing to compare it to,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hattem, who said Deutsche Bank would have no proprietary stake in the data, hopes that lenders will not only finance more retrofits as a result of the project, but also use the information to create a new securitizations market. 
 ''The idea here is that if underwriters can determine a predictable savings from retrofits,'' he said, ''then they can create a financial instrument backed by these savings to sell on the open market.''
 The project has two parts, said Sam Marks, vice president of Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation. One will look at the preretrofit energy usage of 100 affordable housing projects, representing several hundred buildings and about 10,000 apartments across the city. 
 It will then look at the effectiveness of different energy modeling methods to see what can be predicted about how retrofits will affect energy usage. Finally, it will study the long-term efficacy of the retrofits in terms of how many gallons of oil or water, or kilowatt-hours of electricity, the changes saved, and translate this into dollar figures. 
 The types of retrofits studied will be inexpensive and efficient. ''It isn't about what new silver bullet is on the horizon,'' said Marc Zuluaga, a senior engineer at Steven Winter Associates, ''but rather implementing building technologies that are proven but have yet to be optimized on a wide scale.'' 
 Among the technologies will be methods to control heat and boilers, weatherizing of buildings and new sensor-controlled lights in stairwells that turn on only when the stairs are in use. 
 The second part of the project will focus on the economic impact of green technology by collecting information that will show how each dollar spent in retrofits circulates through the economy and adds jobs. The goal is ''to cut through the noise and rhetoric around 'green jobs' and root conversations about the green economy in empirical data,'' according to a summary of the project.
 ''Nothing like this has ever been done before around the country,'' said Steven Winter, president of Steven Winter Associates. ''We hope this project will provide a link between what the energy savings can be in affordable housing and the financial community's understanding of the value of this savings.''

HEADLINE: Loans That Vanished in a Property Bust Reappear

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
The W Hotel in Union Square has had an eventful six months. The 270-room hotel changed hands in December after the private equity division of Dubai World defaulted on a $117 million mezzanine loan in the face of dwindling business. But the lender, LEM Mezzanine, could itself lose the hotel in coming months as a result of its filing for bankruptcy protection earlier this year. 
 Mezzanine loans, which are secured by stock or other ownership stakes in a company, became a popular form of secondary financing during the real estate boom, offering high returns to investors and high interest rates for borrowers. There is an estimated $100 billion in mezzanine loans outstanding across the country, and when the economy slowed and business slumped they became a special headache for borrowers. 
 But despite built-in risks, lenders say mezzanine loans are beginning to resurface, albeit slowly.
 ''It's become something people want to do again,'' said William Shanahan, a vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis who specializes in investment properties in New York. ''I think it's fair to say that right now the desire to place mezzanine debt outweighs the demand for it, but a lot of people are looking to put mezzanine loans on their properties. There are a number of players out there right now.''
 Like the level between the first and second floors for which it is named, mezzanine loans come second in priority to the first mortgage. The loans are typically secured by stock in the company, so that if a property owner defaults, he risks not only handing over the keys to his building but also the equity tied to the asset. By comparison, when a borrower defaults on a first mortgage, only the property itself is at stake.
 As a result, many building owners who financed property at the height of the real estate bubble, including the proprietors of the W Hotel and the Hancock Tower in Boston, were at the mercy of mezzanine lenders after the economy turned down, profits shrank and junior loans swirled into default. 
 In March 2009, Normandy Real Estate Partners, based in New Jersey, took control of the Hancock Tower, the tallest building in New England, by quietly buying up mezzanine debt shortly after the property's owner, Broadway Partners, defaulted on loan payments. 
 But as banks begin to provide more senior financing on commercial assets and investor confidence returns to the market, so too will increased demand for new mezzanine loans, lenders said. 
 Since January, an estimated $374 million in mezzanine and other secondary loans have been issued across the country, an increase from just $210 million in all of 2009, according to data provided by Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago-based commercial real estate services firm. 
 Typically, borrowers who are unable to secure all of their financing needs for a property acquisition with a first mortgage have few options other than a mezzanine loan, mainly because first mortgage lenders usually demand locked-in agreements barring a second mortgage with similar terms.
 ''Little by little, you're going to have more liquidity in the market, which means the volume of mezzanine lending is going to increase,'' said Bruce Batkin, the president of Terra Capital Partners, a real estate investment company based in New York. ''I think that's going to be happening in the second half of the year.''
 The Pembrook Group, a fund management company based in Harrison, N.Y., is expected to originate as much as $100 million in mezzanine debt by the end of the year, including half a dozen pending deals in Chicago, California, Florida and Texas, said John Garth, a managing director in the New York City office of the six-year-old company. 
 In late January, the group placed a $12 million mezzanine loan at an existing office park outside Pittsburgh owned by the Keystone Property Group, which secured a $42 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank, Mr. Garth said.
 ''Money has become much more available and at much more attractive rates in the last 90 days, and business is getting signed up and closed,'' said Mr. Garth, who said Pembrook originated about $250 million in mezzanine loans in 2006, at the peak of the market. ''It's literally been since the first of February that we've seen a lot of competition on high-quality deals, from Wall Street shops, banks and insurance companies.''
 At the Partners Group, a private asset manager based in Switzerland, demand for mezzanine loans has escalated significantly since January, said Eliza Bailey, a senior vice president in the company's San Francisco office. She predicted that by the end of this year the group would place upwards of $300 million in mezzanine debt, both nationally and globally. 
 Among the Partners Group's recent deals, she said, was a $10 million mezzanine loan on a portfolio of commercial buildings throughout the United States, as well as an $11.3 million loan on a collection of residential assets in Germany. 
 ''It's improved dramatically in 2010 as far as the quality of the new asset deals that are in the market,'' Ms. Bailey said. ''There's more visibility to value the underlying assets, and there's a little bit more of a market acceptance of where we are in the cycle. In 2009, I don't think anybody was clear about where we were or where we were headed.''
 Dan Gorczycki, a managing director at Savills, said that until banks ramped up efforts to foreclose on defaulted loans, rather than extend them indefinitely, mezzanine lending opportunities would continue to be relatively scarce. The so-called extend-and-pretend strategy practiced by banks, he said, has prevented many commercial properties from returning to the market and, subsequently, from being refinanced with the help of mezzanine debt.
 ''Now that the market's recovered, some banks are getting tougher, but other banks are saying, 'Let's give these guys some more time to work things out,' '' Mr. Gorczycki said. ''It's been a combination of factors that have led these banks to do this, but it's really frustrated the mezzanine lenders who were hoping to make yield.''
 ''When nobody's forced to sell, there's nothing left to buy,'' he added. ''The real estate market goes up by just that factor alone. It's no different than the stock market.''

HEADLINE: Canada Raises Key Interest Rate, With Eye on Inflation and Global Stability

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- In a tentative and qualified move, the Bank of Canada increased its benchmark lending rate on Tuesday for the first time since July 2007. 
 The increase reflected growing concerns about inflation related to Canada's booming real estate market and strong economic growth. But the relatively small size of the rate increase, one quarter of a percentage point, also demonstrated the bank's concern about global financial stability.
 The increase, which brought the central bank's overnight rate to 0.5 percent, is the first by a Group of 7 industrialized country since the market downturn of 2008. Australia, which also has an economy based on commodity exports, has posted a series of rate increases in the last several months but its central bank decided on Tuesday to leave its cash rate steady at 4.5 percent. 
 In a statement, the Bank of Canada cited the ''robust 6.1 percent'' growth of Canada's economy in the first quarter, which was driven mostly by residential real estate and consumer spending.
 But the bank suggested that the economic turmoil in Europe would make further increases unlikely soon.
 ''Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments,'' the bank said.
 Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, a unit of the Bank of Montreal, said that the modest increase would most likely have very little effect.
 ''This is a baby step,'' he said. ''Interest rates are still exceptionally low. It really does nothing to slow the economy down.''
 The evolution of Europe's economy will determine whether the Bank of Canada follows up with further rate increases, Mr. Guatieri added.
 ''Monetary policy will not be on autopilot,'' he said.
 Canada's recent economic growth has bypassed many manufacturers in Ontario and Quebec.
 ''Making it more expensive for manufacturers to borrow to create jobs in Canada is not going to help,'' said Sylvain Schetagne, the senior economist at the Canadian Labour Congress.
 Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, has hinted broadly for months that rate increases were likely this year.
 ''It was widely expected not only in banks and boardrooms but households and kitchens,'' said Phil Soper, the president and chief executive of Brookfield Real Estate Services of Toronto.
 That caused an unusually large number of Canadians to enter the real estate market before mortgage rates rose. Unlike banks in the United States, Canada's banking system emerged largely unscathed from the credit crisis of 2008, so mortgages were easily available in Canada.
 But the run on the real estate market has led to concerns that prices were reaching unsustainable, and unaffordable, levels in some cities, particularly Vancouver and Toronto. 
 In response, the federal government tightened some lending rules, but that had little apparent impact. The modest size of Tuesday's increase means it is unlikely to significantly slow the demand for housing, said Gregory Klump, the chief economist of the Canadian Real Estate Association. It is unlikely to affect charges for the five-year, fixed-rate mortgages that are the most common form of real estate lending in Canada, he said.
 ''It's not a big deal,'' he said, adding that unaffordable prices are more likely to slow demand for real estate and stabilize prices over the coming months.
 Last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates ''without delay'' and suggested that the Canadian government wind down stimulus spending. Like some Canadian economists, it also raised concerns about personal debt levels in Canada.

HEADLINE: A New Dining Picture (but not Nouvelle) in Beirut

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
Beirut
 AFTER more than 30 years of civil war, invasion and occupation, Lebanon is prospering again, and the downtown area of Beirut, the capital, has risen from the rubble. Among more than 400 projects are a new waterfront area, parks, world-class hotels, high-end shops and restored monuments, churches, mosques and even the synagogue. 
 And to help the city reclaim its title as the Paris of the Middle East are more than 100 restaurants, some involving notable chefs and restaurateurs. 
 ''We are bringing in world-renowned chefs to make Beirut the food capital of the Middle East,'' said Joseph Asseily, chairman of Beirut Hospitality, a division of Solidere, the Lebanese company in charge of the downtown development. 
 Joel Robuchon, Yannick Alleno, Antoine Westermann, the Parisian baker Eric Kayser and perhaps even Jean-Georges Vongerichten are among the marquee names poised to draw tourists and cosmopolitan locals to the once devastated quarter. 
 But while some Lebanese might dare to try Mr. Robuchon's eel with foie gras, when it comes to their own cuisine, tradition rules. You'll find croissants seasoned with the spice blend zataar in bakeries, but that's about as far as most chefs dare to innovate. A few restaurants are adding Asian or Mexican dishes to Lebanese menus, but generally it's hands off when it comes to classics like hummus. 
 Lebneniyet, a Lebanese restaurant in the rebuilt area, prides itself on authenticity rather than creativity.
 ''The Lebanese like routine -- it's comforting after what they have gone through,'' said Philippe Massoud, the chef and owner of Ilili in New York, who is from Beirut but who left during the civil war. 
 The dozens of cold and hot plates that come under the heading of meze -- like hummus, tabbouleh, fattoush, eggplant purees, little grilled sausages, savory filled pastries, assorted kibbees and the like -- are appreciated according to the finesse of the preparation. 
 ''Nouvelle Lebanese does not exist,'' said Kamal Mouzawak, a writer who became a food activist and now supports small farmers and regional cooking traditions with a farmers' market and a restaurant in Beirut. ''Food like you get at Ilili in New York would be shocking to the Lebanese -- duck shawarma and things like that,'' he said, referring to the popular sandwich made in Lebanon with shavings of spit-roasted beef or chicken. ''Right now we are discovering our traditions. During the war and its aftermath we were too busy with other things.''
 Restaurants serving Lebanese food are now starting to feature ragouts, often vegetable-based, that typically were served only at home. Comfort food, yet something new.
 Advancing this trend there is Tawlet, which means ''kitchen table'' in Arabic. It's the airy, informal restaurant that Mr. Mouzawak opened in a fringe area of Beirut last November, where home cooks from villages around the country prepare regional specialties. These often amount to discoveries for Beirut residents. 
 ''It's like a food museum every day,'' Mr. Mouzawak said. 
 Every five weeks, reservations are at a premium when Joe Barza, a burly goateed chef who is an outspoken advocate of new Lebanese cuisine, cooks lunch at Tawlet. ''Why does hummus have to be made with tahini?'' he asked at lunch there a few weeks ago. ''I see a big opportunity.''
 His buffet included hummus made with broad beans instead of the usual chickpeas, enough of a departure. Kibbee was made with raw fish, not raw meat. And a dish called siyadieh, which usually combines fish with rice, was done with frik, a roasted green wheat that is cooked like a pilaf. 
 ''We have the ingredients,'' Mr. Barza said. ''We just have to think about how we are using them.'' 
 Lebanon's larder is extremely rich. Almost anything, including American beef, can be imported, and even pork is sold, a rarity in an Arab country. In the countryside, farmers set up impromptu stands along the roads with gorgeous fresh favas, green beans, strawberries and artichokes. The produce at Souk el Tayeb, the farmers' market that Mr. Mouzawak has organized on Saturday mornings in downtown Beirut, is nothing short of mouthwatering. 
 Fish restaurants like Chez Sami, which overlooks the sea just north of the city, display beautiful, mostly local catches that are simply fried or grilled. And yet the array has its limitations.
 ''Lebanon has some terrific ingredients they don't use, like sardines,'' said Mourad Mazouz, an owner of restaurants in London and Paris, who is on track to open in the newly developed area with a Moroccan-French-Lebanese menu. Both Mr. Robuchon and Mr. Alleno said they were going to try to use as many local ingredients as possible. 
 Unlike the restaurants, Lebanon's wineries are trying some new approaches to build on a tradition that is said to go back 5,000 years. 
 Ixsir, a new winery near Byblos, north of Beirut, is selecting grapes from farmers in several regions to find the best terroirs, according to Etienne Debanne, the owner. Massaya, in the Bekaa Valley, is experimenting with tempranillo, the red grape of the Rioja region in Spain, and it is making a white wine with a blend that includes obeidi, the native grape said to be a precursor of the French clairette. The unusual white wines of Chateau Musar, perhaps the best-known Lebanese label, have always been made with native grapes. 
 ''We're more behind the scene when it comes to experimenting with our food than with our wine,'' said Naji Saikali, the brand manager for Ixsir. ''We hesitate to innovate. Perhaps it's because we're living with risk. But you can't always postpone trying something new because you're afraid something may happen to disrupt your life.''

HEADLINE: A Waiting Game for Fishermen on the Louisiana Water

BYLINE: By JILL ABRAMSON

 BODY:
PORT SULPHUR, La. -- These waters have been closed longer this time than anyone here can remember. 
 At the Myrtle Grove Marina, , Capt. Dave Marino had been expecting six bookings on Sunday at $575 a pop. But instead of fishermen, his shrunken customer base now includes journalists and experts, like a marine biologist from Auburn University, who want a firsthand look at the devastation that many of the boat operators view as far worse than a hurricane. 
 Although lives were lost in Hurricane Katrina, Captain Dave, 41, believes that his livelihood may be gone forever. 
 ''I'd rather have another hurricane than this,'' he said as he motored past the oyster beds -- now all closed -- places he has known since childhood. 
 He stopped by an inland marsh to examine the grass at the edge of the water, which has turned a murky brown. ''With a hurricane, you know when it hits and what the damage is and what you've got to fix,'' he said. ''With this spill, the only answer is to wait.''
 There is plenty of time to ponder haunting questions.
 How many gallons of oil have already leaked into the canals leading out to the gulf? To the naked eye, the effects of the spill are still seen only sporadically, when the oil washes up in big patches despite the miles of boom that have been placed offshore. 
 How many more months will the oyster beds remain closed? After Hurricane Katrina, fishing resumed within a few days. Will there be any shrimp or oysters left?
 The Cajun Star, a shrimp trawler, cruised by with its green nets hoisted on deck.
 Captain Dave tore a single blade of sea grass and his fingers were coated with the sticky, rust-colored oil. ''The best minds in the world are supposedly working on this,'' he said, ''but no one has seen anything like this before.'' 
 The seafood industry is Louisiana's largest private employer and pumps $2.4 billion into the state's economy. BP recently gave the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board $2 million for public service announcements about the safety of the state's fish and shellfish. But if fishing remains closed, there will soon be none from this area to eat.
 In the Bus Canal, a fishing camp named for a gray school bus whose engine died during a 1954 visit, Tony Mitchell had planned a crab boil for his grandchildren. Instead, he's sitting on a cooler, drinking a Bud with two friends at a shack called Camp Blood Sweat and Beers. It is the ultimate man cave. Inside, CNN is broadcasting an update on the spill. Mr. Mitchell calls himself ''the mayor of the Bus Canal.''
 ''My margin of victory last time was 100 percent,'' he told a visitor. He choked up when asked about the spill's effect on the lives of his neighbors.
 ''It's unspeakable,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''I've been through five hurricanes and now this.''
 As Captain Dave's boat headed back to the marina, his 7-year-old son, Brandon, ran to greet him. The captain had expected to bring up his family on these same coastal waters.
 ''Dad,'' Brandon shouted, ''you got oil on the front of your boat.''

HEADLINE: Exotic Isle For Artists, Right in City

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When New York City artists plan their workdays, they usually don't have to factor in a ferry boat.
 Then again, they usually don't have studio space on Governors Island, either. 
 But since March, 24 visual artists and 4 performing groups have been making art in a former munitions storehouse there, rising early to catch one of the first ferries from Manhattan for workers on the island (they start running at 6:45 a.m.) and then rushing at the end of the day to catch the last boat, at 5 p.m. But the bankers' hours have their compensations. 
 ''I've never had a cannon out my window,'' said Birgit Rathsmann, who is making a series of abstract computer compositions incorporating quotations from the likes of Wittgenstein and Johnny Cash that will be installed on the ferry's upper deck this summer. 
 The studio program is run by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, a nonprofit organization that helped revive the arts downtown after the terrorist attacks of 2001 and has for several years found donated spaces around the city for artists. It selected two groups of artists for four-month residencies in Building 110 on Governors Island. The first crop has essentially had a corner of the 172-acre island to itself, though that will end on Saturday, when the island opens to the public on weekends, through Oct. 10. 
 The first structure visible to those getting off the ferry, Building 110 was built in the 1870s to store munitions and later became offices for the Army and the Coast Guard. Last year 14,000 square feet of the building was converted into an arts center, with partitioned studio areas, two performances spaces and a gallery for exhibitions, as well as expansive views of Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor. 
 Some of the artists are not only grateful for such picturesque surroundings but also for any space at all. 
 ''Before we had this studio, we were meeting in coffee shops and wherever we could find,'' said Heather M. O'Brien, part of a three-artist team called the Work Progress Collective that interviewed passengers on the ferry and will use their words in wallpaper strips of images that illustrate the recent recession with photos of tent cities, foreclosures and Wall Street executives.
 Erica Leone, another member of the collective, added: ''We're the first full-time artists on the island. There is this buzz in the air, and this momentum.''
 As part of Governors Island's public-access season, visitors will be invited to watch the artists at work on three weekends, those beginning on Saturday, on July 23 and on Oct. 8. 
 ''If you're not part of the art world or friends with an artist, you're not able to see the creation of art,'' said Leslie Koch, president of the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation, established in 2003 to oversee the island's redevelopment. ''We're very excited about there being more arts here.''
 Many of the artists, who were selected by a panel of experts, have drawn on the island for inspiration. Larry Shea has constructed a Styrofoam scale model of Fort Jay, the island's largest structure, on which he projects video of geometric imagery inspired by the Russian Constructivists and post-World War II Latin American geometric abstractionists. 
 Jenn Figg is making a series of illuminated drums for a performance installation in the fort because she was intrigued by the notion of ''the potential of a battle that never really happened there.'' 
 Matthew Jensen took photographs all over the island and gathered found objects like dirty golf balls, a battered fork, coffee cup shards and abandoned doorknobs.
 The island has ''definitely affected what we've made,'' said Jeffrey Kurosaki, who, with his partner, Tara Pelletier, is creating a painted wooden staging area for performances, with a ladder for people to climb and survey the island through binoculars.
 For the artists, the island studios are a kind of utopia of their own, a place close to the city but far enough away to give them the space and calm that are conducive to creativity and often hard to come by. 
 ''It's so meditative,'' said Sungmi Lee, whose work combines her art and her journals. ''I got really inspired by the space but also the trip that I make.''
 Many of the artists say the ferry ride has been a bonus and has fueled the work. You can see evidence of it in Jongil Ma's installation -- ''Yes, Honey, you can bounce back and forth, and you are a bit closer to it'' -- which is made of thin wood strips that bend, rise and dip like waves, filling his studio. 
 ''I always think a lot about my life and this piece,'' Mr. Ma said of his ferry ride. ''It's so quiet over the water.''
 The most difficult part for the artists is having to tear themselves away at the end of the day. But the schedule has demanded a certain discipline and forced them to take breaks they would not have ordinarily taken -- to live more balanced lives. 
 ''It has to be a very pointed effort to get work done,'' Ms. Figg said. ''It makes the time so much more precious.''
 The building itself has become a sort of commune. Except for a lone coffee truck, there are no food services or stores on the island -- although a cafe is due to open soon, and there will be food carts out during the public season -- so the artists bring bag lunches. The studios are organized in an open plan with only partial partitions, so the artists wander into one another's work areas to observe progress and in some cases offer comments. 
 ''It's this crazy little artist community,'' said Jessica Bruah, whose installation features postcards of esoteric tourist spots in the off season, including Governors Island.
 The hard part will be having to pack up and go. This group is scheduled to move out on July 29; the next is due on Aug. 9. 
 Rachel Bacon is exploring the fleeting nature of things on the island with her artwork, a paper model of a damaged canoe and a birch tree. ''First the Indians were here, then the Dutch,'' she said. ''It's a piece about the transformations that have taken place and how fragile everything is.''
 ''I'll be really sorry,'' she added, ''to see it end.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Premier Is Quitting As Public Approval Plummets

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan, who swept into power last year with bold promises to revamp the country, then faltered over broken campaign pledges to remove an American base from Okinawa, announced Wednesday that he would step down.
 Mr. Hatoyama faced growing pressure to quit, eight months after taking office, amid criticism that he had squandered an electoral mandate to change Japan's sclerotic postwar political order. 
 Since taking office in September, he had come to be seen as an indecisive leader. This image was reinforced by his wavering and eventual backtracking on the base issue, which set off huge demonstrations on Okinawa and drove his approval ratings below 25 percent.
 Calls had been rising within his Democratic Party for him to step aside before elections on July 11 that are seen as a referendum on the party's first year in power.
 ''Unfortunately, the politics of the ruling party did not find reflection in the hearts of the people,'' Mr. Hatoyama told an emergency meeting of Democratic lawmakers, broadcast live on television. ''It is regrettable that the people were gradually unwilling to listen to us.''
 Mr. Hatoyama is the fourth Japanese prime minister to resign in four years, which is likely to renew soul-searching about Japan's inability to produce an effective leader and to feed concerns that political paralysis is preventing Japan from reversing a nearly two-decade-long economic decline. Mr. Hatoyama, who was teary-eyed as he announced his departure, was also following the common Japanese practice of leaders' resigning to take responsibility for failure. 
 His resignation will not force a change in government, because the Democrats still hold a commanding majority in Parliament's Lower House, which chooses the prime minister. But it will be a damaging blow to a party that had taken power in a landslide election victory that ended more than a half-century of nearly unbroken one-party control.
 Mr. Hatoyama took power with vows to challenge the bureaucracy's grip on postwar governing and revive Japan's economy. Instead, his inexperienced government appeared to become consumed by the issue of the Okinawa base and a series of investigations into the political financing of Mr. Hatoyama and his backer in the party, Ichiro Ozawa.
 Mr. Hatoyama said Wednesday that Mr. Ozawa, the Democratic Party's secretary general and its shadowy power broker, would also resign. Japan's public broadcaster, NHK, said the party would meet Friday to choose a new prime minister. Candidates include party veterans Naoto Kan, the finance minister, and Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada.
 The contention over the American base, which dragged on for months, was emblematic of Mr. Hatoyama's inability to make up his mind, or follow through on ambitious campaign promises. 
 The Democrats failed to deliver on a number of pledges, from eliminating highway tolls to finding enough savings from cutting waste to finance new subsidies like cash allowances for families with children. Instead, the spending ended up raising concerns that Japan's ballooning deficit could one day lead to a Greek-style financial collapse.
 Mr. Hatoyama had been expected to be a diplomatic personality who would be able to build consensus among the members of his ideologically broad party. He had appeared to be naturally suited to the job, as a political blue blood who hailed from one of Japan's most powerful families. His grandfather had been a founding member of the Liberal Democratic Party, whose long grip on power Mr. Hatoyama's Democrats ended last summer.
 During the election campaign, he had drawn attention by pledging to end Japan's postwar dependence on the United States, and to build closer ties with China and the rest of Asia.

HEADLINE: Their Future, Made by Hand

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
THEY carry home-grown radishes and red-cooked pork. They transport dozens of empanadas, juggling sheet pans on the G train. They pack boxes of butterscotch cupcakes, Sichuan-spiced beef jerky and grapefruit marmalade. They haul boiled peanuts, ice-grinding machines, sandwich presses and at least one toaster oven painted hot pink. 
 One Saturday morning each month, the vendors of the Greenpoint Food Market converge on the Church of the Messiah in Brooklyn. 
 ''This is my investment in the future right now,'' said Fabiana Lee, 26, an interior designer who lost her job in 2009. She has been selling at the Greenpoint market since its inception in October. After experimenting with cookies (too much competition), she has pared her offerings down to two: gorgeously browned empanadas and irresistibly twee ''cake pops,'' golf-ball-size rounds of cake perched on lollipop sticks. At the moment, they are her main source of income. 
 Young, college-educated, Internet-savvy, unemployed and hoping to find a place in the food world outside the traditional route, she is typical of the city's dozens of new food entrepreneurs. As the next generation of cooks comes of age, it seems that many might bypass restaurant kitchens altogether. Instead, they see themselves driving trucks full of artisanal cheese around the country, founding organic breweries, bartering vegan pates for grass-fed local beef, or (most often) making it big in baking as the next Magnolia Bakery. 
 Joann Kim, 26, who organizes the market, cited the intersection of the economic downturn and the rise of the local artisanal food movement as reasons for the recent flowering of small culinary start-ups. 
 Aspiring cooks (and the adventurous eaters who love them) come face to face at markets like this one, which are opening and expanding at a brisk pace. The Brooklyn Flea, the Hester Street Fair and the soon-to-reopen New Amsterdam Market have become tasting destinations, where handmade food is as much of a fetish as vintage Ray-Bans or bargello pillowcases. The all-food Greenpoint market, which is open to home cooks of all stripes, is one-stop shopping: Mexican-Indian tacos, artisanal soda pop, roof-grown produce, exotic chili peppers, long-brined pickles, Taiwanese street food and retro-Southern snacks under one roof.
 ''I feel like I'm at a science fair and I get to eat all the experiments,'' said Erin Massey, a Chicago native who lives in Brooklyn, looking around the crowded church basement. ''It's like going to a music festival with all the different bands, only here it's different kinds of kombucha.'' 
 There were almost 50 vendors. Many had been up since dawn, rolling rice balls, filling containers with waffle batter, crimping pie crusts. In headscarves, retro-chic aprons and all manner of eyewear, they skidded around the crowded basement, jockeying for electrical outlets and space.
 ''We do whatever it takes,'' said Nicole Asselin, who brought tiny pies filled with organic rhubarb, chocolate chip cookies (to be warmed in the hot-pink oven) and logs of butter mashed with wild ramps that she had gathered in Vermont. 
 Each vendor had paid $25 to $50 for a table, with half the money going to the church and half to Ms. Kim. The cash they earned was theirs to keep. At $4 an ice pop or $3 an empanada, the margins on many products seemed high, but some of the vendors who have been operating without official certification may soon see their profits shrink. 
 On May 28, the New York Department of Health confirmed that all food vendors in the city must have a food handling permit, and may use only approved commercial kitchens. Renting space in a commercial kitchen costs about $200 for eight hours. For some vendors like Ms. Lee, who is in the process of getting her permit, that would mean the difference between making a small profit and just breaking even on a day at the market. 
 Ms. Kim said that she believed that the fact that the money benefited the church meant that unlicensed vendors were allowed to participate. ''I guess we've been trying to fly below the radar a little bit,'' she said, acknowledging that the bustle of the church basement might disappear under official scrutiny. ''It's been a wild ride.''
 Some of the vendors were amateurs there on a lark, to earn brownie bragging rights and a little spending money. 
 But for many, the stakes were much higher. In these markets, cooks like Laena McCarthy of Anarchy in a Jar, who makes extraordinary preserves from local fruit, have a shot at developing a viable food business without working with a commercial processor, such as the large food companies that she deems ''evil agribusiness warlords.'' (Her company's motto is ''The Revolution Starts in Your Mouth.'') Ms. McCarthy's jams have recently been picked up for sale by a Whole Foods store in Manhattan; for her, and others, a national distribution deal is the dream. 
 But for now, most of the vendors have a ''day job'' of some kind. Ms. McCarthy works as a librarian and teaches library science. Ms. Asselin is a pastry chef at Marlow & Sons in Williamsburg. Jun Aizaki, who makes Japanese rice balls called onigiri, wrapped in and scented with banana leaves, has designed the interiors of New York restaurants such as Rayuela and Macondo. 
 Two eminent but unemployed pastry chefs -- Fany Gerson and Hannah Goldberg -- banded together to start La Newyorkina, making delicious Mexican-style paletas, or ice pops, in flavors like mango, guava and horchata (cinnamon-rice). They have been selling outdoors at the new Hester Street Fair, and handed out mini-paletas to children to draw their parents in.
 ''If we first build a following at the markets and online,'' Ms. Goldberg said, ''then we can get the money to open a storefront that much more easily.'' Professionals like Ms. Goldberg say that a commitment to marketing, packaging and general hustling are as important -- or more so -- as kitchen skills. Twitter, Facebook, Etsy, Tumblr and Blogspot are important for spreading the word; so are the city's many new amateur cooking contests, like the Brooklyn Pie Bake-Off; so are food shops with a commitment to local artisans, like Blue Apron Foods in Park Slope and the Northern Spy Food Company in the East Village. 
 So is paring down your line. 
 ''I've already seen that you do much better if you're 'that girl' who sells 'that thing,' '' said Ms. Asselin, who has yet to commit. 
 Ms. Lee is still deciding whether her business, La Tia Faby, will focus on empanadas or cake pops. Growing up in Buenos Aires, she said, she set her sights early on a life in New York City. 
 ''I was used to being the only Asian girl at school,'' said Ms. Lee, whose parents were born in South Korea and now own a knitwear company in Argentina; she is fluent in English, Spanish and Korean. ''But I loved the mix of people and food in New York.'' Ms. Lee said that her mother, who served steak with kimchi on many nights, taught her the basics of cooking, both Argentine and Asian. Ms. Lee's chorizo and kimchi empanadas with Korean glass noodles are pleated down the edge, like huge Chinese dumplings; the spinach and mushroom version is folded like a fortune cookie. 
 Ms. Lee moved to New York to study interior design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn; when she graduated in 2006, she quickly found a job at a downtown firm. But in early 2009, she said, the effects of the stock market downturn began to hit. ''It was almost a relief when I got laid off like everyone else,'' she said. ''Better than sitting at my desk waiting for it to happen.'' Then she spotted an online open call for vendors at the Greenpoint market.
 The recession weaves through the back stories of many of the itinerant vendors, even those who are not new to selling food. Matt and Alison Robicelli had both a fledgling cupcake operation and a specialty foods shop in Bay Ridge until last October, when they decided that brick-and-mortar was a losing proposition. ''We sat down with an adviser who looked at our crazy life and said, 'You have three things to take care of: your shop, your cupcake business and your kids,' '' she said. ''He told us we had to pick two.'' Now they sell cupcakes -- including a dark, bittersweet ''Bea Arthur'' number that combines chocolate, coffee and cheesecake flavors -- through various cafes, at the Greenpoint market, and at another newly opened Brooklyn venue, the outdoor Red Hook Mercado.
 Ms. Lee is still unemployed, but she has never worked harder, she said, trying to build a viable business one bite at a time. The day before the Greenpoint market, in her sixth-floor walkup in Chelsea, Ms. Lee folded hundreds of empanadas and painstakingly decorated dozens of cake pops to look like pale yellow chicks, using sprinkles and edible inks she orders from online candy suppliers. (Cake pops and cake balls, made by mixing fresh cake crumbs with frosting, then dipping balls of the mixture into ''candy melt'' for a smooth, Ring-Ding-like coating, are up-to-the-minute successors to the no longer trendy cupcake.) 
 ''Transportation is by far the biggest stress,'' said Ms. Lee, who must travel by subway or taxi to Greenpoint; there are many casualties among the empanadas. But her wares have always sold out, so far. All day at the market, women exclaimed over the cake pops and asked about custom orders for baby showers and birthday parties; only a few of these inquiries have ever panned out. She took home about $500 in cash, having sold out by 3 p.m. 
 One of the charms of the food-market scene is an Old World sense of cozy community: everyone seems to know one another. But this also means a race to capture shoppers before somebody else does. At Greenpoint, two vendors of kombucha were stationed right across from each other, and there was more than one seller of pickles, fizzy drinks and gluten-free muffins. 
 ''I didn't know there would be another granola,'' said Alex Crosier of Granola Lab, eyeballing the competition for her ginger-molasses and cranberry-cashew mixtures. 
 At the end of the day, said Ms. Asselin, the vendors are very tired, very thirsty (much of the food is very sweet, very salty or both) and not much richer. 
 ''It's hard work,'' said Hannah Goldberg, speaking about her time at the Hester Street Fair. ''Our ancestors came through the Lower East Side to find a better life, and our parents think it's crazy that we're back here selling from a pushcart.''

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Rises And Manufacturing Expands

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economic recovery gained strength on the biggest rise in construction spending in nearly a decade and the 10th consecutive month of expansion for the manufacturing sector. 
 Temporary government incentives drove most of the construction spending increases in April. Industry spending rose 2.7 percent with gains in all major sectors, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
 In a separate report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its manufacturing index dipped slightly in May from a nearly six-year high in April. But the 59.7 reading for May was well above the 50 level that indicates expansion.
 Export orders rose last month despite the debt crisis in Europe, which threatens to spread.
 ''The European fiscal crisis doesn't appear to have harmed the prospects of U.S. manufacturers, at least not yet,'' wrote Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.
 Wall Street welcomed the news. Stocks erased early losses after the two reports signaled a lift in the economic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 40 points in midday trading after sliding in early trading, though it ended the day down 112.61 points.
 A home buyer tax credit helped residential construction surge 4.4 percent in April. The tax credit expired at the end of April.
 Government spending rose 2.4 percent. The increase was aided by the economic stimulus program that Congress passed in February 2009. State and local spending rose 2.3 percent, and federal spending was up 2.9 percent.
 The other major sector, nonresidential construction, climbed 1.7 percent. That was the first advance in that category since March 2009. The strength in April came from gains in private sector work on communications projects and power generation facilities. Construction of office buildings and the category that includes shopping centers fell in April. Commercial building projects have suffered in the weak economy through rising loan defaults and tighter credit.
 In the manufacturing report, the group's employment index, which measures employers' willingness to hire, rose 1.3 percentage points to 59.8. That was the highest level since May 2004.
 New orders, a gauge of future production, were unchanged at 65.7.

HEADLINE: New, Small Schools Brace for Extra Pain From City's Teacher Layoffs

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Glancing down the hallway at the Brooklyn Brownstone School, Nakia Haskins, the principal, did a quick calculation. 
 ''Probably at risk, at risk, definitely at risk,'' she said, pointing to the classroom doors of three star teachers. Each had been chosen from a pool of hundreds of candidates and now routinely works as many as 60 hours a week, but because they are among the city's most recently hired, they stand to lose their jobs. 
 Schools across the city are bracing for layoffs as city officials estimate that as many as 4,400 teachers could lose their jobs, victims of budget problems in the city and state stemming in part from the recession. Barring any rescue plan from City Hall, Albany or Congress, the job losses, expected to be announced this week, would be the first major cut to the city's teaching force in more than three decades. 
 But the schools that are likely to feel the layoff pain most acutely are the hundreds of new small schools that have been a cornerstone of Chancellor Joel I. Klein's efforts to overhaul the city's public education system. Because of seniority rules dictating who gets laid off first, the small schools stand to lose a disproportionate share of teachers. 
 The cuts are likely to decimate dozens of the new schools, which typically hire young, new teachers and rely on them to start new programs, design new lessons and spend countless hours helping students at any time of day. At Ms. Haskins's school alone, at least four out of eight teachers are expected to lose their jobs if current projections hold. 
 ''What makes any new school different is that the people who are in the school opt to be there,'' said Ms. Haskins, who opened the Brooklyn Brownstone School in Bedford-Stuyvesant in 2008; it has about 110 students from prekindergarten to second grade.
 Mr. Klein has indicated that few schools will be spared. But under the teachers' contract, the teachers who were hired most recently will lose their jobs, and Mr. Klein has warned principals that they could lose any teacher hired since 2007. And while Mr. Klein has pleaded for a change in state law to override the seniority rules, there is no indication that will happen before the layoffs.
 Under Mr. Klein and his boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the city has stepped up its practice of closing large, poor-performing schools and replacing them with smaller ones, on the theory that a more intimate environment, a new administration and new teachers will do a better job with the neediest students. 
 Principals had the freedom to hire whomever they chose, and many of the new schools were built around young staff members who were committed to their new principals, if not beholden to them. At Brooklyn Brownstone, for example, teachers agreed to work longer days, not to wear jeans to work (although Fridays are an exception) and to share extensive lesson plans and assignments with one another. Occasionally, a teacher even attends a child's birthday party. 
 It may not jibe with the official teacher's union contract, Ms. Haskins acknowledged, but she said there had not been any conflicts with teachers over the workload. On the contrary, she said -- teachers routinely call her on their way into school at 7 a.m., an hour before the day officially begins, asking if they should pick up coffee for anyone else. 
 But schools built with young teachers are now in line to lose many of them, leaving principals with stark choices. They can choose from a pool of more senior teachers to replace anyone they lose to layoffs, or simply cut the position. 
 For high schools, that could mean eliminating courses entirely, getting rid of, say, a poetry or an ancient history course. In elementary schools, it could mean drastically raising the number of students in an individual class. 
 Ms. Haskins said it would be nearly impossible for her to reduce the number of teachers at her already small school. And while she has the rather unusual positions of full-time art and music teachers, she is guessing that it is unlikely that Mr. Klein would make the politically unpopular move of eliminating them.
 Still, while she is hoping for the best, she has not discouraged her teachers from applying for other jobs. Denise Wadler, 24, moved to the city after graduating from Simmons College, excited at the prospect of helping create a new school. But last week, she sent out nearly 50 resumes for positions at preschools, day care centers and charter schools. 
 (Charter schools are not governed by the same union rules and are generally growing in enrollment; their financing is tied to the number of students they have, so few of them are expected to have to lay off teachers this year.) 
 ''This isn't what I ever expected,'' said Ms. Wadler, as her kindergartners ran around the playground last week. ''I wanted to teach in a place that valued me and where I really mattered. Here, every student knows my name and I know theirs.'' 
 David Cantor, a spokesman for the Department of Education, commented: ''New schools start from scratch, so they hire a lot of new teachers. They're painfully vulnerable to systemwide layoffs based on seniority.''
 Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city teachers' union, said that the problem was not seniority rules, but rather that the Bloomberg administration had been less than aggressive in obtaining the money it needed from Albany.
 ''It's strange for me that the person who is supposed to be in charge of protecting the schools has done nothing about how to solve layoffs,'' he said. In many schools, the wait-and-see approach has left principals and teachers on edge -- at one school in Queens, a teacher broke into tears inside the lunchroom last week. 
 Although there was a hiring freeze in place last fall, new schools were able to hire up to 40 percent of their teachers from outside the system. At the time, the exception was seen as a boon to the new schools, but now it has left them more vulnerable to cuts. 
 Kristin Erat, the principal of Grant Avenue Elementary School in the Bronx, personally scoured roughly 2,000 resumes to fill 12 positions. 
 ''We really thought we selected an all-star team -- to lose that now would be absolutely devastating,'' she said. ''It would be like asking if one of your siblings disappeared, would your family be the same.''

HEADLINE: Blacks Still Being Blocked From Juries in the South, Study Finds

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
In late April in a courthouse in Madison County, Ala., a prosecutor was asked to explain why he had struck 11 of 14 black potential jurors in a capital murder case.
 The district attorney, Robert Broussard, said one had seemed ''arrogant'' and ''pretty vocal.'' In another woman, he said he ''detected hostility.''
 Mr. Broussard also questioned the ''sophistication'' of a former Army sergeant, a forklift operator with three years of college, a cafeteria manager, an assembly-line worker and a retired Department of Defense program analyst.
 The analyst, he said, ''did not appear to be sophisticated to us in her questionnaire, in that she spelled Wal-Mart, as one of her previous employers, as Wal-marts.'' 
 Arguments like these were used for years to keep blacks off juries in the segregationist South, systematically denying justice to black defendants and victims. But today, the practice of excluding blacks and other minorities from Southern juries remains widespread and, according to defense lawyers and a new study by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit human rights and legal services organization in Montgomery, Ala., largely unchecked.
 In the Madison County case, the defendant, Jason M. Sharp, a white man, was sentenced to death after a trial by a jury of 11 whites and one black. The April hearing was the result of a challenge by defense lawyers who argued that jury selection was tainted by racial discrimination -- a claim that is difficult to prove because prosecutors can claim any race-neutral reason, no matter how implausible, for dismissing a juror.
 While jury makeup varies widely by jurisdiction, the organization, which studied eight Southern states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee -- found areas in all of them where significant problems persist. In Alabama, courts have found racially discriminatory jury selection in 25 death penalty cases since 1987, and there are counties where more than 75 percent of black jury pool members have been struck in death penalty cases. 
 An analysis of Jefferson Parish, La., by the Louisiana Capital Assistance Center found that from 1999 to 2007, blacks were struck from juries at more than three times the rate of whites. 
 In North Carolina, at least 26 current death row defendants were sentenced by all-white juries. In South Carolina, a prosecutor said he struck a black potential juror because he ''shucked and jived'' when he walked.
 Studies have shown that racially diverse juries deliberate longer, consider a wider variety of perspectives and make fewer factual errors than all-white juries, and that predominantly black juries are less likely to impose the death penalty.
 Excluding jurors based on race has been illegal since 1875, but after Reconstruction, all-white juries remained the norm in the South.
 ''It really made lynching and the Ku Klux Klan possible,'' said Christopher Waldrep, a historian at San Francisco State University and the author of a forthcoming book about a lawyer who was able, in a rare case, to prove jury discrimination in Mississippi in 1906. ''If you'd had a lot of black grand jurors investigating crimes, it would have made lynching impossible.''
 Back then, judges and prosecutors often argued that blacks lacked the intelligence or education to serve. That such claims persist is evidence, said Bryan A. Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, that jury selection remains largely unscrutinized.
 ''There's just this tolerance, there's indifference to excluding people on the basis of race, and prosecutors are doing it with impunity,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''Unless you're in the courtroom, unless you're a lawyer working on these issues, you're not going to know whether your local prosecutor consistently bars people of color.''
 In jury selection, potential jurors are first dismissed for cause -- reasons like scheduling conflicts or opposition to the death penalty. Then, both sides can ask questions and take turns dismissing jurors using what are called peremptory strikes (the number of strikes varies by state, but it is often enough for one side to eliminate all qualified minorities).
 In a 1986 case, Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court ruled that if a pattern of discrimination emerged during peremptory strikes, lawyers must provide nonracial reasons for their strikes. The reason does not have to be ''persuasive, or even plausible,'' the Supreme Court ruled in a later case in which a prosecutor said he dismissed one black juror because he had long hair, and another because he had a goatee, saying, ''I don't like the way they looked.'' It is up to the judge to decide if there was deliberate discrimination. 
 That is a high bar, defense lawyers say -- so high that in Tennessee and North Carolina, there has never been a successful reversal based on Batson.
 ''Anybody with any sense at all can think up any race-neutral reason and get away with it,'' said Stephen B. Bright, a capital defense lawyer in Atlanta. 
 Prosecutors have claimed to strike jurors because they live in high-crime neighborhoods, are unemployed or are single parents. In one Louisiana case, a judge allowed a black juror to be dismissed because the prosecutor said he ''looked like a drug dealer.''
 Often, a defense lawyer's challenge is based on showing that white jurors who answered questions the same way or had the same characteristics were not struck. For example, in the Sharp case, Mr. Broussard said that because one juror was studying to be a minister, she ''was not the kind of juror we were looking for.'' But a white man who was a minister was allowed to serve.
 Mr. Broussard did not respond to requests for comment, but Stephen Wimberly, the first assistant district attorney in Jefferson Parish, said that of more than 2,000 jury trials since 1997, only two had been reversed because of discrimination. ''The legal standard is not representation of any race or gender, but the fairness and impartiality of each respective juror,'' Mr. Wimberly said. 
 In one Mississippi case, a black man, Curtis Flowers, was sentenced to death in 2004 for killing four furniture store employees. The jury was made up of 11 whites and one black after prosecutors used all 15 of their peremptory strikes on black jurors. Montgomery County, where the crime occurred, is 45 percent black. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the case, noting that ''racially motivated jury selection is still prevalent 20 years after Batson.''
 At a retrial, in which prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, the jury of seven whites and five blacks was split along racial lines, resulting in a hung jury. At the second retrial, prosecutors sought the death penalty, which eliminated more blacks from the pool of qualified jurors. The jury, nine whites and three blacks, hung again when one black member declined to convict, said Andre De Gruy, the director of the state's Office of Capital Defense Counsel.
 The Equal Justice Initiative study argues that jury diversity ''is especially critical because the other decision-making roles in the criminal justice system are held mostly by people who are white.'' In the eight Southern states the study examined, more than 93 percent of the district attorneys are white. In Arkansas and Tennessee, all of them are white.

HEADLINE: Is There Still Hope for Syrah?

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
FORESTVILLE, Calif.
 THERE'S a joke going around West Coast wine circles: What's the difference between a case of syrah and a case of pneumonia? You can get rid of the pneumonia.
 It would be funnier if it weren't so sad. In the last few years, beginning even before the economic downturn, sales of American syrah essentially dropped off a cliff. While precise numbers are not available -- for tracking purposes, syrah is often lumped in with Australian shiraz, or consigned to ''other red wines'' -- American syrah producers all tell the same story.
 ''It appears to have crashed and burned in this country,'' said Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon Vineyards, who 20 years ago was one of the early proponents of planting California with grapes from the Rhone Valley, like syrah, grenache and mourvedre. Or, as Ehren Jordan, proprietor of Failla Vineyards, put it: ''There has been a collective running into a brick wall by people who make syrah.'' 
 Such an impact is hard to fathom with a glass of a Failla syrah in front of you. The aroma -- of herbs, olives and flowers -- stimulates the appetite. The question is not, what's wrong with syrah, but, where's dinner? Back in the mid-1990s, syrah was thought to be the next great hope for American red wine. Growers and winemakers, looking for an alternative to cabernet sauvignon and merlot, pinned their hopes on syrah, known for making savory wines in Rhone appellations like Hermitage, Cote-Rotie, Cornas, St.-Joseph and Crozes-Hermitage.
 How syrah went so horribly wrong may be a cautionary tale for anybody looking to capitalize on the next great trend.
 It's fair to say that much of the syrah produced in California is dreadfully generic red wine of little character. But perhaps more important to recognize is that quite a few producers like Failla are making superb California syrah, a fact that should not be lost in any analysis of the moribund market.
 Some producers have made good syrah for years. Others are fairly new to the field and are plunging resolutely ahead, even as the market shrinks. Crucially, though, they are succeeding by staying true to the northern Rhone ideal of making balanced, pungently aromatic wines that belong on the table.
 Here in Forestville, a small crossroads town in western Sonoma County, two childhood friends, Duncan Arnot Meyers and Nathan Lee Roberts, are making beautifully aromatic, elegant syrahs under the label Arnot-Roberts. Rather than emphasizing power, concentration and heavy fruit flavors, the Arnot-Roberts wines are graceful and relatively low in alcohol.
 ''We're California kids,'' said Mr. Meyers, standing in front of barrels holding the previous year's vintage. ''We believe that we can make really good wines here, but our reference points are the northern Rhone.''
 He and Mr. Roberts teamed up in 2002 on a shoestring budget. With little financial pressure to cater to the marketplace, they have enjoyed the luxury of stubborn idealism, making wines aimed at achieving the classic northern Rhone aromas and flavors of olives and herbs, bacon and minerals, flowers and spices, blood and earth.
 ''We don't want to make really fruity wines,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''It's those nonfruit aromas that we're really focused on.''
 One sniff of the Arnot-Roberts 2006 Clary Ranch syrah, made from grapes grown on the Sonoma Coast near Freestone, leaves no doubt of their ideals. With captivating aromas of black olives, laurel and minerals, the direct connection to the northern Rhone is clear.
 In the beginning, that was the idea. Back in the 1970s and '80s, the early efforts of American syrah pioneers like Mr. Grahm, Joseph Phelps, Bob Lindquist of Qupe and Steve Edmunds of Edmunds St. John were all intended to emulate Rhone wines.
 Later entrants to the game had different ideas. Syrah was barely on the radar screen in 1990 when, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, only 164 acres of the grape were planted in the state. Then came an explosion. By the end of that Rhone-mad decade, more than 10,000 acres were planted, and since then even that number has doubled -- less perhaps than other red grapes like cabernet sauvignon, merlot, zinfandel and pinot noir, but significant nonetheless.
 ''People were looking for something that would not be too tannic or challenging, and syrah was poised to be that go-to drink,'' said Patrick Comiskey, who is writing a book about the American Rhone movement.
 What happened? Partly, Mr. Comiskey said, pinot noir with its cinematic ''Sideways'' boost stole syrah's thunder. More damning, though, was a confusion of styles that robbed American syrah of any sense of identity.
 As syrah production was beginning to take off, some American wine critics were starting to award their highest scores to big, broad, powerfully fruity wines that displayed richness and opulence. Prominent among them was Barossa Valley shiraz, as syrah is known in Australia. The desire for critical approval, Mr. Comiskey suggested, caused many American syrah producers to emulate this intensely ripe, jammy style.
 ''Syrah tends to lose its character at higher ripeness levels,'' he said. ''The thing that makes syrah beguiling, beautiful and feral is all lost, and you end up with a much more generic, fruity experience.''
 Pax Mahle can attest to that personally. Back in 2000 he founded Pax Wine Cellars, making rich, powerful single-vineyard syrahs that were acclaimed by critics like Robert M. Parker Jr. and Wine Spectator. Some of these wines reached alcohol levels above 16 percent. But after a dispute with a financial backer, Mr. Mahle left Pax. He and his wife, Pamela, now make wines of a completely different style under the Wind Gap label, right here in Forestville.
 ''The Pax wines were good of their kind,'' he said. ''But I found on a Tuesday or Wednesday night they were the wines I least wanted to drink.''
 So he recalibrated his approach, and now aims for lower alcohol, subtler, more savory wines.
 ''I want the wines to show more earth than fruit, more savor and spice than sweetness,'' he said. ''I want them above all to be bright and fresh.''
 His 2006 Sonoma Coast syrah is full of the herbal, meaty, bacon and olive flavors craved by lovers of northern Rhone wines. It weighs in at 13.1 percent alcohol, but even his biggest wine, at 14.9 percent, from the Castelli-Knight vineyard in the Russian River Valley, is discernibly Rhonish.
 Contributing to the confusion is the fact that a good deal of California syrah is simply planted in inappropriate places.
 ''If you want it to actually have character, it needs to be grown in a very cool climate,'' said Mr. Grahm of Bonny Doon Vineyards, and most top syrah producers would agree.
 The Peay brothers, Nick and Andy, along with Nick's wife, Vanessa Wong, grow syrah on their vineyard near Annapolis, in the extreme northwestern corner of Sonoma County just four miles from the Pacific Ocean. There, the fruit struggles to ripen each year, but retains a freshness that comes from sufficient acidity in the grapes.
 ''Syrahs from warm areas lack the syrah signature of pepper, olive, meatiness, iron and mineral,'' Nick Peay said. ''From warm areas they just have this monochromatic blueberry and oak quality.''
 His brother chimed in: ''There is no better wine for lamb, game and meats, but people are making wines with too much alcohol, too much fruit, no elegance and too much oak.''
 The Peay syrahs are elegant and polished, not quite as savory as the Wind Gap or Arnot-Roberts wines, perhaps, yet still dripping with the pepper, olive, meat and animal character of syrah.
 Cool climates, at least in Northern California, are not without risk. Arnot-Roberts made a delectable wine from the grapes from Clary Ranch on the Sonoma Coast in 2006. In 2009, they didn't ripen enough to make a single-vineyard wine.
 As with any grape there is no single correct way of making a syrah. It mostly comes down to the personal preference of the growers and winemakers.
 ''The single most important thing is making a good decision about when to pick the grapes,'' said Mr. Edmunds of Edmunds St. John, who makes gentle, graceful syrahs with grapes purchased from a variety of sites in California. His preference is for freshness, so he tends to favor those picked on the early side. Other producers, including many in Paso Robles and Santa Barbara County, prefer riper grapes and bigger wines.
 ''Just because you can get it riper doesn't mean you should get it riper,'' said Mr. Lindquist of Qupe, who has never strayed from his original ideal of balanced, Rhone-influenced wines.
 While the finest syrah producers still manage to sell their wines, it is not without a struggle. Wells Guthrie of Copain Wine Cellars makes excellent single-vineyard syrahs with enthralling mineral, saline, briny flavors. His loyal customers buy direct from the winery. Nonetheless, from the 3,000 cases of single-vineyard syrah that he made in 2006 he reduced his production to 1,200 cases in 2009.
 ''Without the good portion that we sell direct, I don't know how you would sell any syrah,'' he said.
 Still, producers are keeping their hopes up. Mr. Jordan of Failla points out how young California's syrah vineyards are, and how much the grapes will improve as the vines age.
 ''People are already making dynamic wines, and are increasingly conscious of where things should be,'' he said.
 Mr. Grahm, Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Lindquist, who've seen consumer interest in California syrah rise from nowhere only to crash and burn, likewise continue to focus on the potential.
 ''It's a great grape, obviously,'' Mr. Lindquist said. ''And great grapes always rise to the top.''
 10 That Defy The Trend
 Here are 10 of the best California syrah producers (which make wines that emphasize balance and savory aromas and flavors rather than power, concentration and fruitiness), along with some suggested bottles to seek out:

HEADLINE: At Spoleto, a Departing Director and a Premiere

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- News broke out on Monday here at the Spoleto Festival USA after a placid opening weekend. Emmanuel Villaume, the French conductor who has been the festival's music director for opera and orchestra since 2001, announced that he would leave at the end of the season.
 Mr. Villaume, who is also the artistic director and principal conductor of the Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra and the principal conductor of the Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra, cited time pressure as the main factor in his decision. And already this season his profile seems lower here than it did in years past. 
 Mr. Villaume conducted the festival orchestra in the first of two major concerts on Monday evening. But he is not conducting any of the three operas being staged this season.
 ''That, again, is a reflection of his time,'' said Nigel Redden, the festival's general director, in an interview on Tuesday.
 Perhaps to make a virtue of financial necessity, each of those opera productions has achieved economies of scale. (Mr. Redden confirmed that plans for one larger production had to be scrapped for reasons of cost.) In particular, the pit band in each -- in Haydn's puppet opera ''Philemon and Baucis,'' in the 18th-century British ballad opera ''Flora'' and in Wolfgang Rihm's monodrama ''Proserpina'' -- is small and specialized.
 The performances of the period groups in ''Philemon'' and in ''Flora,'' at least on the opening nights, were not entirely distinguished. The young players, lacking the security of numbers, may also have missed the kind of detailed preparation Mr. Villaume used to supply. 
 ''Proserpina,'' on Sunday evening at the Memminger Auditorium, was another matter, with the contemporary specialist John Kennedy providing a steadying hand. Mr. Kennedy is the director of the festival's Music in Time series, and in that capacity he offered a wonderful setup for the opera: a concert of instrumental music by Mr. Rihm from the 1980s, mainly, in the Simons Center Recital Hall at the College of Charleston on Saturday.
 The program consisted of four segments from the ''Chiffre-Zyklus'' (''Cipher Cycle'') for chamber orchestra, pieces seemingly calculated to show how much music can be written without serious resort to melody. Rhythm, dynamics and instrumental color are everything. Melody scarcely amounts to more than fragments and, occasionally, ostinato figures. The piano appears prominently but almost entirely in its guise as a percussion instrument.
 Structure is modular, with clangorous episodes separated by long moments of intense quiet or actual silence. Though unpredictable from moment to moment, the music -- at times almost voluptuous, at others edgy -- affords a gratifying logic with its repeating motifs, within movements and from one to another.
 Mr. Kennedy's players supplied crack performances. Lydia Brown, in particular, handled that demanding piano part, unpianistic as it was, with aplomb.
 All of this (except for the high quality of the performance) was a world apart from ''Proserpina'' (2009), here in its American premiere. The work is a tour de force for soprano -- in this case, Heather Buck -- positively awash in lyricism: for at least half of its 45-minute length, limpid, flowing Straussian melody.
 In this setting of a text by Goethe, Proserpina, a daughter of Jupiter, finds herself in Hades, abducted by Pluto to be his queen. (Because Jupiter is a central figure in ''Philemon,'' you might have been tempted to tease a theme out of the Spoleto opera program if Haydn's trifle of a puppet opera and ''Proserpina'' had not been so disparate in medium and aspiration.) The Fates, represented by a chorus (women of the Westminster Choir), singing wordlessly at first, draw Proserpina inexorably into their midst, and the director here, Ken Rus Schmoll, has added a silent actor (Jason Bruffy) as a glowering and ultimately grasping Pluto.
 But the evening belonged to Ms. Buck, who sang beautifully in the plush melodies at the start and adapted expertly to increasing angularity and high-flying acrobatics as Proserpina's plight grew dire. Mr. Schmoll's spare production, with a set and modern-dress costumes designed by Marsha Ginsberg, provided Ms. Buck with a mostly blank slate, and she was equally compelling as a sheer stage presence, whether self-absorbed or interacting with the chorus and even the orchestra. 
 Mr. Rihm's music ranges widely and ingeniously through contemporary styles and includes a sort of historical framing, as he seamlessly weaves in patches of music from Goethe's era. The ''Dance of the Blessed Spirits'' from Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' appears in the orchestra at Proserpina's line, ''Your peaceful wandering, blessed ones,'' and a bit of the Queen of the Night's vocalizing from Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' creeps into Proserpina's rendering of ''Through the night I will pursue him.''
 As in the orchestral concert, Mr. Kennedy and the orchestra were superb advocates for Mr. Rihm's imaginative music. 
 The Spoleto Festival USA runs through June 13 in Charleston, S.C.; ''Proserpina'' is repeated on Friday and on June 9 at the Memminger Auditorium; (843) 579-3100 or spoletousa.org.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Unit Being Revamped for Sale

BYLINE: THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Citigroup is closing 330 branches of its consumer finance business as part of an overhaul aimed at finding a buyer for the unit, the bank said on Tuesday. 
 The branch closings at the unit, called CitiFinancial, will result in about 500 to 600 jobs being eliminated across 48 states, the bank said.
 CitiFinancial will also be split into two parts, one offering personal, home equity and refinancing loans, and the other handling loan modifications and restructuring, Citigroup said. CitiFinancial will be renamed after the reorganization is complete.
 The overhaul ''will provide a lot of clarity'' about CitiFinancial's operations for potential buyers, said Mary McDowell, chief executive of the unit.
 Citigroup split itself into two parts last year -- Citicorp and Citi Holdings, the division holding noncore, riskier assets, including the mortgage-backed securities that undermined the bank and other financial institutions. CitiFinancial is a part of Citi Holdings.
 Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, has said the bank would continue selling off Citi Holdings, which had $547 billion worth of assets at the end of 2009.
 Citigroup received $45 billion in government bailout money at the height of the financial crisis. It raised $20 billion in December to help repay the money it received as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 The remaining $25 billion was converted to stock last fall, giving the government what is now a 27 percent ownership stake.

HEADLINE: Policy Steps Help Cool China's Heated Growth

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The booming pace of China's manufacturing growth slowed somewhat in May, as an array of government steps to forestall overheating in the giant economy began to take effect, data showed Tuesday.
 Two surveys of purchasing managers in China, one by the government's Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and another by HSBC, eased in May. Both readings remained strong and showed that the manufacturing sector was continuing to expand -- but also indicated that the government's attempts over the past months to slow the pace of economic growth were bearing fruit.
 Buoyed by government spending programs and a flood of easy credit from state-controlled banks, China's economy recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis last year. With an expected growth rate of about 10 percent in 2010, China is poised to overtake Japan as having the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, sometime this year. 
 Much of the rest of Asia also has resumed solid growth, and though purchasing managers' indexes in South Korea, Taiwan and Australia also dipped in May, the region at this stage remains largely unaffected by the European debt worries and the probable slowdown in Europe's already feeble recovery.
 ''I remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for Asia,'' said Stephen Schwartz, Asia economist for BBVA in Hong Kong, adding that he did not think a slowdown in Europe would be enough to derail the growth momentum across Asia.
 ''Asia is taking a breather, and the trade cycle is slowing,'' echoed Frederic Neumann, regional economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. ''But it's far too early to talk about a hard landing in China.''
 The purchasing managers' index published by China's logistics federation slipped to 53.9 in May from 55.7 in April, close to what analysts had expected. And the index compiled by HSBC fell from a revised 55.2 in April to 52.7 in May, the lowest reading in 11 months. A reading higher than 50 indicates expansion.
 Many analysts welcomed the slight decline as a positive development and said it should ease market concerns about more aggressive growth-tamping steps.
 The Shanghai composite index, the main stock market gauge for mainland China, has been one of the world's worst performers this year as investors have fretted about China's policy measures. The index fell an additional 0.9 percent Tuesday, taking its total decline since Jan. 1 to about 22 percent.
 ''We believe the moderation in P.M.I. in May should provide some comfort to the market, reducing concerns about economic overheating,'' Qing Wang, China economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 Soaring property prices, which have been among the side effects of the government stimulus measures, remain a major thorn in the government's side.
 Beijing has introduced a string of measures in recent months to deflate what many analysts describe as a building bubble.
 On Tuesday the state-controlled China Daily reported that the government had signaled that it would gradually introduce taxes on property holdings. It also cited an unidentified government source who said a tax would be levied on state-owned properties, starting with Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, on a trial basis. Other details, including on timing, remained sketchy, but the news was fresh evidence of Beijing's determination to rein in property prices.
 The government has also instructed state-owned banks to cut back on the amount of loans they are making, and to set aside a larger portion of their reserves, a measure that restricts the amount of money the banks can lend.
 Both measures are part of a precarious balancing act that policy makers in Beijing -- and in other countries across the region -- are now engaged in: The authorities are seeking to slow down the breakneck speed of growth without choking it off entirely.
 But the uncertainties about Europe, combined with signs that China's measures to rein in the booming property market are taking effect, have reduced that chance that the government will intensify its tightening measures, Mr. Wang and other economists say.
 Elsewhere in Asia, too, policy makers are expected to put on hold plans to scale back the stimulus measures they introduced after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
 The Australian central bank Tuesday kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4.5 percent, interrupting the series of increases it started in October.
 Rising inflation pressures in India mean there is an ''urgent'' need for a rate rise there, said Mr. Neumann of HSBC.
 But elsewhere, inflation pressures have eased, helped by lower commodity prices, meaning the need for rate increases has declined.
 ''It's very much a fine-tuning exercise now,'' said Mr. Schwartz of BBVA. ''It's become even more challenging for policy makers in Asia to get the balance right.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Oil Spill Inquiry Chills Traders at the Close

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States were dragged lower by the energy sector after the government announced on Tuesday that it was opening investigations into the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., disclosed the inquiry in the afternoon, sending what had been a relatively mixed trading day into a sharp decline led by energy stocks just before the close.
 ''Everything fell off a cliff here in the last 15 minutes,'' said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. 
 It was a last-minute ditch to what had begun as a relatively benign trading day that generally picked up where it left off last Friday, when all three indexes ended May about 8 percent lower compared with April. 
 Then trade turned choppy as investors returned from a three-day weekend and reacted to data on the domestic economy and the state of European fiscal health.
 Near the close, the abrupt change in mood was typical of the volatility that has recently characterized the United States market, which has been overshadowed by concerns over the European debt crisis, the oil spill and tensions between North and South Korea. New data on factory use and construction spending lifted the market in early trading.
 ''It started out pretty sloppy on the heels of weekend activity in China and the euro zone,'' Mr. Orlando said. After reports of tension in Israel and Mr. Holder's visit to the spill zone, ''that probably did something to the energy stocks.''
 Among energy issues, Halliburton fell $3.68 to $21.15; Anadarko was down $10.23 at $42.10; Schlumberger fell $4.40 to $51.75; and Massey was down $2.95 to $30.17. 
 ''I thought we were going to tread water for the balance of the week into the jobs report,'' he said, looking ahead to the United States employment figures to be released on Friday, a report that is expected to be strong.
 At the close in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 112.61 points, or 1.11 percent, at 10,024.02; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 18.70 points, or 1.72 percent, at 1,070.71; and the Nasdaq fell 34.71 points, or 1.54 percent, at 2,222.33.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 102 1/32, and the yield fell to 3.26 percent, from 3.29 percent late Friday.
 ''Volatility has returned, and given the oil spill, currencies and employment numbers coming out, it's not going away anytime soon,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with Standard & Poor's. 
 New data on factory use and construction spending in the United States was unexpectedly strong. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was 59.7 in May. While the figure slipped from 60.4 in April, it was higher than the 59.0 forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
 The Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose 2.7 percent in April, while analysts had expected the figure to be unchanged. 
 Concern about the European economy was heightened Tuesday by a report that the jobless rate in the 16 nations that share the euro currency rose to its highest level since 1998.
 The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose in April to 10.1 percent, from 10 percent in March, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, said in Luxembourg. 
 The dollar was mixed against major European currencies. The euro fell 0.52 cents, to $1.2253, and the British pound rose to $1.4658, from $1.4545.

HEADLINE: Telefonica Bid Is Rebuffed

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Portugal Telecom said on Tuesday that Telefonica had raised its bid for a venture that controls Brazil's largest wireless operator to about 6.5 billion euros ($7.99 billion). 
 The stake in the Brazilian company, Vivo Participacoes, is currently owned by Portugal Telecom, which dismissed the higher bid as still inadequate.
 Telefonica's raised offer ''does not reflect the strategic value Vivo has for Telefonica,'' Portugal Telecom said, adding that it has decided to ask shareholders to vote on the bid in a meeting.
 Telefonica also offered to sell the 10 percent stake in owns in Portugal Telecom.
 Telefonica, based in Madrid, increased the bid after its initial 5.7 billion-euro unsolicited offer was unanimously rejected by Portugal Telecom's board on May 10.
 Telefonica's chairman, Cesar Alierta, aims to gain control of Vivo as competition from Vivendi and America Movil grows. Mr. Alierta needs to combine Vivo with Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo, or Telesp, Telefonica's Brazilian phone company, whose sales have slid.
 Brazil has South America's largest mobile phone market.
 Brazil's economy is expected to grow 6.5 percent this year after shrinking in 2009, according to a central bank survey of about 100 economists published last month.
 Vivo had 30 percent of Brazil's 179 million wireless subscriptions at the end of March, according to Anatel, the country's phone regulator.

HEADLINE: When Friends Fall Out

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
As a friend of both Turkey and Israel, it has been agonizing to watch the disastrous clash between Israeli naval commandos and a flotilla of ''humanitarian'' activists seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Personally, I think both Israel and Turkey have gotten out of balance lately, and it is America's job to help both get back to the center -- urgently. 
 I've long had a soft spot for Turkey. I once even argued that if the European Union wouldn't admit Turkey, we should invite Turkey to join Nafta. Why? Because I think it really matters whether Turkey is a bridge or ditch between the Judeo-Christian West and the Arab and Muslim East. Turkey's role in balancing and interpreting East and West is one of the critical pivot points that helps keep the world stable. 
 I also happened to be in Istanbul when the street outside one of the synagogues that was suicide-bombed there on Nov. 15, 2003, was reopened. Two things struck me: First, the chief rabbi of Turkey appeared at the ceremony, hand in hand with the top Muslim cleric of Istanbul and the local mayor, while crowds threw red carnations on them. Second, Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who comes from an Islamist party, paid a visit to the chief rabbi -- the first time a Turkish prime minister had ever called on the chief rabbi in his office. Since then, I have seen Turkey play an important role mediating between Israel and Syria and voting just a month ago in favor of Israel joining the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
 Therefore, it has been painful to hear the same Prime Minister Erdogan in recent years publicly lash out with ever-greater vehemence at Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians in Gaza. Many see this as Turkey looking to ingratiate itself with the Muslim world after having been rebuffed by the European Union. I have no problem with Turkey or humanitarian groups loudly criticizing Israel. But I have a big problem when people get so agitated by Israel's actions in Gaza but are unmoved by Syria's involvement in the murder of the prime minister of Lebanon, by the Iranian regime's killing of its own citizens demonstrating for the right to have their votes counted, by Muslim suicide bombers murdering nearly 100 Ahmadi Muslims in mosques in Pakistan on Friday and by pro-Hamas gunmen destroying a U.N.-sponsored summer camp in Gaza because it wouldn't force Islamic fundamentalism down the throats of children.
 That concern for Gaza and Israel's blockade is so out balance with these other horrific cases in the region that it is not surprising Israelis dismiss it as motivated by hatred -- not the advice of friends. Turkey has a unique role to play linking the East and West. If Turkey lurches too far East, it may become more popular on some Arab streets, but it would lose a lot of its strategic relevance and, more importantly, its historic role as a country that can be Muslim, modern, democratic -- and with good relations with both Israel and the Arabs. Once this crisis passes, it needs to get back in balance. 
 Ditto Israel. There is no question that this flotilla was a setup. Israel's intelligence failed to fully appreciate who was on board, and Israel's leaders certainly failed to think more creatively about how to avoid the very violent confrontation that the blockade-busters wanted. At the same time, though, the Israeli partial blockade of Hamas and Gaza has been going on for some four years now. It is surely not all Israel's fault, given the refusal of Hamas to recognize Israel or prior peace agreements, and its own repeated missile attacks on Israel.
 But I sure know this: It is overwhelmingly in Israel's interest to bring more diplomatic imagination and energy to ending this Gaza siege. How long is this going to go on? Are we going to have a whole new generation grow up in Gaza with Israel counting how many calories they each get? That surely can't be in Israel's interest. Israel has gotten so good at controlling the Palestinians that it could get comfortable with an arrangement that will not only erode its own moral fabric but increase its international isolation. It may be that Hamas will give Israel no other choice, but Israel could show a lot more initiative in determining if that is really so.
 One of my oldest Israeli friends, Victor Friedman (no relation), an education professor from Zichron Yaacov, e-mailed me the following on Tuesday: ''It's time we started using our wits. If we used even a tiny fraction of the brain-power and resources we put into 'defense' into finding a way forward in terms of living with the Palestinians, we would have solved the problem long ago. The strategic situation has never been more opportune -- the Arabs are scared of the Iranians, the Saudi peace plan is still on the table, and the Palestinians are beginning to act rationally. But we lack the leadership to help us make a real change.'' 
 This is a critical moment. Two of America's best friends are out of balance and infuriatingly at each other's throats. We have got to move quickly to get them both back to the center before this spins out of control.

HEADLINE: A Storyteller Loses the Story Line

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 It's not a good narrative arc: The man who walked on water is now ensnared by a crisis under water.
 One little hole a mile down on the ocean floor, so deep it seems like hell spewing up its sulfurous smoke, has turned the thrilling saga of ''The One'' into the gurgling horror of ''The Abyss.'' (Thank goodness James Cameron, the director of ''The Abyss,'' came to Washington Tuesday to help the administration figure out how to cap the BP well. What's next? Sending down the Transformers and Megan Fox?)
 With as much as 34 million gallons of oil inking the Gulf of Mexico, ''Yes we can'' has been downgraded to ''Will we ever?'' 
 It's impossible not to feel sorry for President Obama, pummeled by the cascading disasters, at home and abroad, unleashed by two war-mongering oil men -- plus scary escalations by Israel, Iran and North Korea. (Dick Cheney's dark influence is still belching like the well. BP just brought on a new public relations executive: Anne Womack-Kolton, who served as Cheney's campaign press secretary in 2004 and worked in W.'s White House and at the Energy Department.) 
 Obama wanted to be a transformative president and now the presidency is transforming him.
 Instead of buoyant, he seems put upon. Instead of the fairy dust of hopefulness, there's the bitter draught of helplessness.
 His battle against water is taking on Biblical -- even Job-like -- proportions.
 Besides the roiling water below, the skies opened from above and gusting, lightning-streaked rains drowned the president's plans to give a Memorial Day speech at the Lincoln cemetery near Chicago. On the evening news, pictures of the president standing under an umbrella shooing people off the soggy field were a sad contrast to the wildly sentimental Joe Biden presiding, hand on heart, over a sunny and moving Memorial Day commemoration at Arlington National Cemetery.
 After suffering more indignities -- a S.U.V. in his motorcade blew a tire on I-55 outside of Chicago -- a tired-looking Obama returned to Andrews Air Force Base at 7:30 Monday night and went to an area called the ''tactical fitness center'' to give his remarks to 150 or so subdued service members who had been rounded up by the White House advance team.
 As The Washington Post's Anne Kornblut wryly wrote in her pool report: ''It has been years since President Obama attended a rally like the one that took place here Monday night: sparsely attended, thrown together at the last minute, involving people who were not expecting to be there. We're partying like it's Obama circa 2005.''
 The oil won't stop flowing, but the magic has.
 Barack Obama is a guy who is accustomed to having stuff go right for him. He's gotten a lot of breaks: two opponents in his U.S. Senate race in Illinois felled by personal scandals; a mismanaged presidential campaign by Hillary Clinton; an economic collapse that set the stage for a historic win, memorably described by the satiric Onion newspaper as ''Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job.''
 Reporters grilled Robert Gibbs at his White House briefing on Tuesday about the president's strange inability to convey passion over a historical environmental disaster. This was underscored by Obama's perfunctory drop-by to a sanitized beach in Grand Isle, La. Despite his recent ode about growing up near an ocean, he didn't bother to meet with the regular folks who have lost their seafaring livelihoods.
 After Gibbs asserted that his boss was ''enraged'' at BP, CBS News's Chip Reid skeptically pressed: ''Have we really seen rage from the president on this? I think most people would say no.'' 
 ''I've seen rage from him, Chip,'' Gibbs insisted. ''I have.''
 Reid asked for an exact definition of what constitutes emotion for Obama: ''Can you describe it? Does he yell and scream? What does he do?''
 Gibbs mentioned the words ''clenched jaw'' and the president's admonition to ''plug the damn hole.''
 How does a man who invented himself as a force by writing one of the most eloquent memoirs in political history lose control of his own narrative?
 In ''Dreams From My Father,'' Obama showed passion, lyricism, empathy and an exquisite understanding of character and psychological context -- all the qualities that he has stubbornly resisted showing as president. It was a book that promised a president who could see into the hearts of other people. But there's so much you don't learn about candidates in campaigns, even when they seem completely exposed.
 This president has made it clear that he's not comfortable outside whatever domain he's defined. But unless he wants his story to be marred by a pattern of passivity, detachment, acquiescence and compromise, he'd better seize control of the story line of his White House years. Woe-is-me is not an attractive narrative.

HEADLINE: First Aid for the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Is there a ''Lost Decade Looming?'' Paul Krugman asks (column, May 21). Possibly but not probably. America is not Greece, nor is it Japan. Mr. Krugman states that markets are turning on America over its deficits and that policy makers aren't doing too much, they're doing too little. True. The administration is waging a war against a humongous debt with the efficacy of boys throwing stones at enemy tanks. 
 What is evident is the disarray in government discipline. To return to fiscal sanity, our deficit must be attacked with something like war discipline. Enormous efforts and sacrifices are needed on everyone's part. Too many opportunities have been wasted because of the ego-politicians of both parties.
 These measures must be quickly enacted: a value-added tax; a cut in the Defense Department budget of 50 percent; a cut in government by merging departments and agencies; postponement of all government salary raises until a more propitious time; a cut in Congressional junketeering of 75 percent; and a cut in the Congressional franking privilege of 75 percent.
 Also: enactment of an income surtax of 20 percent on great wealth; an added tax on all forms of gambling, including Internet gambling; an excess-profits tax on major oil companies and major financial companies; a 75 percent tax on Wall Street bonuses; a cancellation of farm subsidies; and a 50 percent curtailment in foreign aid.
 Prompt action will be necessary. America is in deep trouble. One senses that if our leaders will truly lead, we will all respond. They must awaken before awakening ceases to have meaning.

HEADLINE: Jobs Bill Vs. Deficit, A Showdown

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 You are a member of the Senate, and you're starting to get spooked by the deficit. Polls show that voters are worried about it. Economists are, too. Something needs to change.
 But you're tired of politicians who pound the table about the issue without actually naming programs they would cut or taxes they would increase. You know that reducing the deficit is like losing weight: it's as straightforward as it is difficult. ''We have to stop spending money we don't have,'' as Jim Cooper, a House member from Tennessee, said the other day.
 When Congressional leaders announced plans for a new $200 billion jobs bill recently, Mr. Cooper and other centrist House Democrats saw a chance to do something tangible. Only about a third of the bill's cost would have been paid, by closing tax loopholes for investment managers and overseas businesses. The remaining $134 billion would have been added to the deficit. In response, the centrists said no and forced the leaders to cut the bill's spending nearly in half.
 Now the slimmed-down bill is coming to the Senate, and you need to decide what to do. 
 It would still add about $54 billion to the deficit over the next decade. On the other hand, it could also do some good. Among other things, it would cut taxes for businesses, expand summer jobs programs and temporarily extend jobless benefits for some of today's 15 million unemployed workers.
 ''Oh, Master, make me chaste and celibate -- but not yet,'' Saint Augustine famously said.
 What you want to know is when, at long last, will it be yet?
 The case against the jobs bill starts with the idea that the economy is recovering. Since the recession's nadir, in January 2009, the job market has improved at the most rapid pace since 1983. On Friday, forecasters expect the Labor Department to report that job growth continued to accelerate in May.
 There is always the chance that the economy could slip back again. But the case for optimism seems stronger. Corporate executives are becoming more upbeat, surveys show. Business travel has picked up. Silicon Valley firms are doing more deals. Nissan broke ground last week on a car battery plant in Tennessee, and Chrysler is adding 1,100 jobs at a Jeep plant in Michigan.
 No one doubts that Washington will eventually have to switch from Keynesian pump-priming to fiscal discipline. If the economy has turned a corner, you wonder if maybe that moment has arrived. You know it certainly can't be too far off.
 Including the jobs bill, the deficit is projected to grow to about $1.3 trillion next year (and that's assuming the White House can persuade Congress to make some proposed spending cuts and repeal the Bush tax cuts for the affluent). To be at a level that economists consider sustainable, the deficit needs to be closer to $400 billion. Only then would normal economic growth be able to pay it off.
 So Congress would need to find almost $900 billion in savings. By voting down the jobs bill, it would save more than $50 billion by 2015 and get 7 percent of the way to the goal. That's not nothing. In a nutshell, it's the case against the bill.
 Unfortunately, you also know that the deficit over the next several years isn't the main problem. Medicare is. It and, to a lesser extent, Social Security and Medicaid are on pace to spend far more money than taxpayers will pay into the system.
 That means the deficit will continue to grow in the years ahead. To get it under control, Congress doesn't just need to find savings for 2011. It needs to do that and then find more cuts for 2012, yet more for 2013 and vastly more for the decades that follow.
 In this context, the jobs bill looks a lot smaller. Its cost is equal to only about 2 percent of the total cuts needed to get the deficit to an acceptable level over the next decade. Beyond the next decade, the bill could actually save money, because its spending is temporary -- mostly by 2012 -- while its closing of tax loopholes is permanent.
 Of course, even if the bill is not very expensive, it is worth passing only if it will make a difference. And economists say it will.
 Last year's big stimulus program certainly did. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 1.4 million to 3.4 million people now working would be unemployed were it not for the stimulus. Private economists have made similar estimates.
 There are two arguments for more stimulus today. The first is that, however hopeful the economic signs, the risk of a double-dip recession remains. Financial crises often bring bumpy recoveries. The recent troubles in Europe surely won't help.
 The second argument is that the economy has a terribly long way to go before it can be considered healthy. Here is a sobering way to think about the situation: If the next four years were to bring job growth as fast as the job growth during the best four years of the 1990s boom -- which isn't likely -- the unemployment rate would still be higher in 2014 than when the recession began in late 2007.
 Voters may not like deficits, but they really do not like unemployment.
 Looking at the problem this way makes the jobs bill seem like less of a tough call. Luckily, the country's two big economic problems -- the budget deficit and the job market -- are not on the same timeline. The unemployment rate is near a 27-year high right now. Deficit reduction can wait a bit, given that lenders continue to show confidence in Washington's ability to repay the debt.
 As a result, Congress does not have to choose between the problems. It can pass the jobs bill, putting people back to work, and even pass a separate bill to help struggling states. History has shown that state aid, which prevents layoffs of teachers, emergency medical technicians and other workers, is the single most effective form of stimulus.
 But this new spending needs to be accompanied by something more credible than Augustine-like vows of future parsimony. It should be paired with substantive cuts to continuing policies, like subsidies for oil companies and agribusinesses, outdated weapons systems, NASA's moon program and at least some Bush tax cuts, among many other things.
 That is the right economic strategy. It's probably the right political one, too. It shows serious concern about both jobs and the deficit.
 So what do you say, Senator?

 A Justice Department report determined that other than F.B.I. specialists, the department's staff received little training on how to respond to a biological, chemical, nuclear or radiological attack; that there was no central plan in place for such a crisis; and that the management of the department's plan was ''uncoordinated and fragmented.''

HEADLINE: Entrepreneur or Unemployed?

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH. 
Robert B. Reich, a former secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of ''Supercapitalism.''

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
 LAST year was a fabulous one for entrepreneurs, at least according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity released last month by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. ''Rather than making history for its deep recession and record unemployment,'' the foundation reported, ''2009 might instead be remembered as the year business startups reached their highest level in 14 years -- even exceeding the number of startups during the peak 1999-2000 technology boom.''
Another surprise is the age of these new entrepreneurs. According to the report, most of the growth in startups was propelled by 35- to 44-year-olds, followed by people 55 to 64. Forget Internet whiz kids in their 20's. It's the gray-heads who are taking the reins of the new startup economy. And if you thought minorities had been hit particularly hard by this awful recession, think again. According to the report, entrepreneurship increased more among African-Americans than among whites.
 At first glance, all this seems a bit odd. Usually new businesses take off in good times when consumers are flush and banks are eager to lend. So why all this entrepreneurship last year? 
 In a word, unemployment. Booted off company payrolls, millions of Americans had no choice but to try selling themselves. Another term for ''entrepreneur'' is ''self-employed.''
 According to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics by an outplacement firm, Challenger Gray & Christmas, the number of self-employed Americans rose to 8.9 million last December, up from 8.7 million a year earlier. Self-employment among those 55 to 64 rose to nearly two million, 5 percent higher than in 2008. Among people over 65, the ranks of the self-employed swelled 29 percent. Many older people who had expected to retire discovered their 401(k)'s had shrunk and their homes were worthless. So they became ''entrepreneurs,'' too.
 Maybe this is a good thing. A deep recession can be the mother of invention. These Americans are now liberated from the bureaucratic straitjackets they thought they had to wear. They can now fulfill their creative dreams and find their inner entrepreneurs. All they needed was a good kick in the pants.
 But this upbeat interpretation doesn't include lots of people who don't particularly relish becoming their own employers, like an acquaintance whom I'll call George. George was an associate partner at one of the world's largest technology and consulting firms until he lost his job last year in a wave of layoffs. For months, George knocked on doors but got nowhere because of the deep recession.
 Finally, his old firm got some new projects that required George's skills. But it didn't hire George back. Instead, it brought him back through a ''contingent workforce company,'' essentially a temp agency, that's now contracting with George to do the work. In return, the agency is taking a chunk of George's hourly rate.
 Technically, George is his own boss. But he's doing exactly what he did before for less money, and he gets no benefits -- no health care, no 401(k) match, no sick leave, no paid vacation. Worse still, his income and hours are unpredictable even though his monthly bills still arrive with frightening regularity.
 The nation's official rate of unemployment does not include George, nor anyone in this new wave of involuntary entrepreneurship. Yet to think of them as the innovative owners of startup businesses misses one of the most significant changes to have occurred in the American work force in many decades.
 Typically each year, large numbers of Americans leave their old jobs to find new ones. Unemployment rises during recessions mainly because companies hire fewer workers, not because they lay more people off. But this Great Recession has been different. Layoffs by mid-sized and large companies have surged while hiring has almost disappeared. These companies have used the sharp downturn as an opportunity to cull their payrolls for good -- substituting labor-saving technologies and outsourcing to workers abroad or to contract workers here. This explains why almost half of America's unemployed have been jobless for more than six months -- a greater proportion than at any time since the Great Depression. It also explains why so many people like George have joined the ranks of the self-employed.
 Yes, a growing number of Americans went out on their own before the recession, but clearly their numbers have vastly increased. While some are happy about their new status, most are worse off than they were before. It's one thing to be a contingent worker in good times and when you're young; quite another in bad times when you're middle-aged.
 Still, many would rather view these people as entrepreneurs and owners of startup businesses, and see their major challenge as getting adequate credit. Congress's Joint Economic Committee reported last week that small businesses continue to face tight lending standards. ''Small business is the job-creation engine that powers this economy,'' said Representative Carolyn Maloney, the New York Democrat who heads the committee. Democrats will be pushing bills to make loans more available to them.
 Indeed, America's startup businesses do need better access to credit. But many entities that look like small new businesses are actually self-employed people who need more than bank loans. They need predictable income and benefits.
 For starters, they could use what might be called ''earnings insurance'' that would pay for up to two years part of the difference between what they earned on the old job and what they earn now on their own. Employed workers would contribute to the insurance fund through their payroll taxes, as they do with unemployment insurance, but the total bill for benefits would be unlikely to rise because earnings insurance would get them back to work quicker and thereby reduce the number of weeks they relied on unemployment benefits.
 The self-employed also need more help saving. Since they can no longer depend on tax-free corporate matches to their 401(k)'s or I.R.A.'s, they should be entitled to tax credits that match them. Fortunately, thanks to the reform package passed by Congress, they will have more help getting affordable health care, as they will be able to use their aggregate bargaining power in medical exchanges to push down insurance costs.
 New businesses are vital to job growth, and entrepreneurship does fuel the economy. And surely some of America's new independent workers will build their own companies. But when the economy is still so hard on so many, it's important to distinguish between entrepreneurial zeal and self-employed desperation.

HEADLINE: Administration Opens Inquiries Into Oil Disaster

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and PETER BAKER; John M. Broder and Charlie Savage contributed reporting from Washington, Robbie Brown from New Orleans and Campbell Robertson from Port Fourchon, La.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Tuesday that it had begun civil and criminal investigations into the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, as the deepening crisis threatened to define President Obama's second year in office.
 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in New Orleans that he planned to ''prosecute to the fullest extent of the law'' any person or entity that the Justice Department determines has broken the law in connection with the oil spill. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 120 points shortly after Mr. Holder's announcement as energy stocks tumbled on expectations of the federal investigations. BP lost 15 percent of its market value during the day's trading.
 BP and government officials said flatly for the first time that they had abandoned any further plans to try to plug the well, and would instead try to siphon the leaking oil and gas to the surface until relief wells can stop the flow, most likely not before August.
 Mr. Holder's comments, which echoed those of Mr. Obama earlier in the day in the Rose Garden, reflected deepening frustration within the administration at the inability to stop the spill, along with wide concern that the government and the president appear increasingly impotent as oil laps at the shorelines of Louisiana, and now Alabama and Mississippi. 
 One person briefed on the inquiry said it was in an early stage and that no subpoenas had been issued yet to BP, the owner of the well. It was unclear whether any had gone to Transocean, which leased the Deepwater Horizon, the nine-year-old drilling rig that exploded and sank in April, to BP; Cameron, the company that manufactured a ''blowout preventer'' that failed to function after the explosion; or Halliburton, which performed drilling services like cementing. 
 Administration officials said they were reviewing violations of the Clean Water Act, which carries criminal and civil penalties and fines; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which can be used to hold parties responsible for cleanup costs; the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, which provide penalties for injury and death of wildlife. 
 ''BP will cooperate with any inquiry that the Department of Justice undertakes, just as we are doing in response to the other inquiries that already are ongoing,'' the company said in a statement. 
 Having abandoned the attempt to plug the gushing well, BP and the government moved ahead on the latest plan, to contain the oil and gas as it flows from the floor of the gulf and siphon it to the surface. BP prepared to sever the pipe that once connected the well to the surface and is now snaking along the sea floor from the wellhead. That pipe, called a riser, had been attached to a blowout preventer, a stack of valves sitting on top of the well. 
 Removing the pipe could increase the flow of oil into the gulf until response crews can complete the next phase of the operation, affixing a cap to the remaining stub of the riser at the blowout preventer and siphoning the leaking oil into the cap through a new riser and up to a ship on the surface. 
 The more confrontational tone from Washington underscored concerns within the administration about the long-term effect of the oil spill, not only environmentally, economically and politically, but on the national psyche as well. 
 Like no other, the topic of the oil spill now dominates the national conversation. Early comparisons to Hurricane Katrina have dissolved into comparisons to the hostage crisis with Iran -- an episode that spanned 444 days and beleaguered the presidency of Jimmy Carter. The spill has kept Mr. Obama from focusing attention on other issues, like creating jobs and carrying out the new health care law, at a time when polls suggest that public trust in government is declining and when his party is fighting to retain control of Congress.
 ''It's an interesting disaster because it's one that doesn't stop -- it's as if Katrina sat on top of New Orleans for six weeks without going away,'' said George Haddow, a disaster management consultant from New Orleans who was a senior Federal Emergency Management Agency official under President Bill Clinton.
 Tuesday amounted to the administration's most intensive effort yet to show that it is doing everything possible to respond and to hold BP and the other companies accountable. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama has been ''enraged at the time that it's taken'' to stop the leak.
 ''I've seen rage from him,'' Mr. Gibbs said, describing the president's ''clenched jaw'' at meetings. Mr. Gibbs added that the White House did not think BP ''was forthcoming on what the impact would be of cutting the riser off.''
 For Mr. Obama, part of the problem has been that the solution to the BP disaster is at its heart an engineering problem, and one the government has already acknowledged it is in no position to fix on its own. Former Attorney General William P. Barr said the administration's move to investigate risked looking like political damage control while chilling cooperation with the company at the time it is needed most. 
 ''The Department of Justice has to be very careful about using criminal prosecution to respond to political pressure,'' Mr. Barr, who ran the department from 1991 to 1993, said in an interview. But Mr. Obama said Tuesday that ''we have an obligation to determine what went wrong.'' He appeared after meeting with the two men he has appointed to lead an inquiry into the spill -- former Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a Democrat, and a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, William Reilly, a Republican. 
 During the meeting in the Oval Office, the president was adamant that the government and the industry had to find a way to make offshore drilling safe because the nation needs the oil, and stressed to Mr. Reilly and Mr. Graham that that was part of their charge, according to people familiar with the meeting. 
 The decision to try to siphon off the leaking oil came after the failed ''top kill'' procedure, in which heavy drilling mud was pumped at up to 80 barrels a minute into the well in hopes of overcoming the pressure of surging oil and gas. But, response teams were never able to drive the mud far enough down in the well to overcome the oil, said Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, in an interview during a helicopter ride over coastal areas.
 Officials suspect that the mud could have been escaping from the well far below the ocean floor, possibly through a rupture disk, a built-in weak point in the steel pipe that lines the well.
 This concern is what led officials to decide to end attempts to plug the well, Mr. Suttles said. If the well were capped -- such as by a new blowout preventer -- the resulting pressure could force oil out through a flaw in the well, and another leak could sprout on the ocean floor.
 Mr. Suttles said he expected the cap being readied this week would be able to siphon off the ''vast majority'' of the oil, though not all of it, and that subsea dispersants would be still be needed. 
 The challenges facing the maneuver are similar to the problems that bedeviled the 98-ton containment dome which was lowered over one of the leaks several weeks ago. That dome failed when hydrates -- icelike crystals of gas and water -- formed at the dome's opening and prevented oil from escaping. The cap-and-riser system is designed to fit fairly snugly to reduce the influx of water, and methanol and heated water will be used to further reduce the chances that hydrates form.

THE BUCOLIC PLAGUE 
 How Two Manhattanites Became Gentlemen Farmers 
 By Josh Kilmer-Purcell 
 304 pages. Harper. $24.99. 
 Josh Kilmer-Purcell is proud of his talent for making things sparkle. It's a gift that came in handy during his career as a drag queen and later served him well in advertising. It was also helpful when, in 2006, Mr. Kilmer-Purcell and his partner, Brent Ridge, bought and beautified a run-down 200-year-old New York State showplace beyond Albany. 
 They didn't even have to aggrandize its name. The grand white house, complete with 60 acres and ''a perfect red barn in the architectural style of Fisher-Price,'' was already known as the Beekman Mansion. And by now the fixing up of the Beekman has gone far beyond mere makeover. The Fabulous Beekman Boys, as Josh and Brent call themselves (they also call themselves Josh and Brent), preside over a blog, a reality TV series and a retail line of soaps made from goat's milk. 
 It's not just the goats that they're milking. In ''The Bucolic Plague,'' his memoir about the Beekman adventure, Mr. Kilmer-Purcell does a surprisingly deft job of wringing laughs from stories that should have dried up a long time ago.
 This feat is made all the more remarkable since Mr. Kilmer-Purcell has already published a memoir (''I Am Not Myself These Days,'' about his drag career), sounds a lot like his fellow hydroponic multimemoirist Augusten Burroughs, and is conspicuously short on material. It should be safe to assume that an author who begins a sentence about himself with the phrase ''Like the slowly ripening tomato,'' is knee-deep in manure. Somehow Mr. Kilmer-Purcell fertilizes this narrative until it reeks of charm.
 Josh and Brent embarked on their annual apple-picking weekend, venturing north of their 850-square-foot New York City apartment dressed in self-conscious, city-slicker plaids. They usually stayed in cheap motels, Josh writes, because these reminded Brent of his boyhood. Josh adds: ''They reminded me of Fleet Week, so it worked out well for both of us.'' 
 But this time they wandered past the Hudson Valley into Sharon Springs, where the most picturesque local hotel was run by a guy who liked to wear kilts, and not because he was Scottish. When he referred to the hotel's guests as ''my public,'' the newcomers began thinking that they might be very happy in this part of the world.
 Then they spied the Beekman. It was neglected, but it still looked good enough to make Josh wonder whether anyone polished the apples. Soon the two Manhattan workaholics (Brent, a k a Dr. Brent, is vice president for healthy living at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia) decided to take the big leap (weekends only), even though they set off a burglar alarm the first time they crossed their new threshold. Making up yet another madcap story, Josh imagined creating a bad first impression among the locals: ''Those two new city boys -- you know, the girly ones -- couldn't figure out how to break into their own house.'' 
 The Beekman was a big place with room for more than two occupants. But that's no excuse for Josh's principal narrative crutch: invoking Martha Stewart at every turn. Ms. Stewart is all over ''The Bucolic Plague,'' even though she exists mostly as a scoldy figure in Josh's imagination. Would Martha approve of the Beekman? How does its vegetable garden compare to hers? Would she ever deign to come visit? When she did invite the Beekman Boys to a party at her own farm, the real Ms. Stewart cut right to the chase. ''A memoir?'' she asked Josh about his first book. (He also wrote a second, a novel, before ''The Bucolic Plague.'') ''What did you have to write a memoir about?'' 
 That question seems not to have troubled Josh as he put this book together. He happily exaggerates the miraculous effect of freshly laid eggs, just as every other farm-life memoirist has done before him. He endlessly repeats the same memories of the drag-queen debauchery he left behind. He manufactures drama between himself and Brent, just as he pumps up the prospect that the farm will have to be shut down because of economic hard times. 
 There are tender moments that would make a chick-lit author blush. There are regrettable, not to mention incomprehensible, depictions of the Josh-Brent relationship as an Oprah-Martha dichotomy. On rare occasions ''The Bucolic Plague'' is cavalier to a terrible fault. For instance, Josh forgets to stop kidding when he describes the presence of slaves' bones in the Beekman's crypt and farming soil.
 But the amusing side of ''The Bucolic Plague'' makes up for a lot of lapses. After all, while writing about canning produce, Josh compares skinning tomatoes to ''trying to peel leather pants off of a sweaty, hairy, fat guy.'' And when he watches a goat give birth to multiple offspring, he is reminded not only of his old drag act but also of clowns getting out of a clown car.

HEADLINE: A Sharp Rally With Energy Leading the Way

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market rebounded Wednesday after a stronger-than-expected increase in pending home sales and a recovery in shares of energy companies.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 226 points, its third biggest gain of 2010. Major indexes recovered the losses they suffered Tuesday shortly before the close, when the government announced criminal and civil investigations into the gulf oil spill.
 Energy stocks led the advance after oil prices rose. Schlumberger, which provides services to oil companies, rose more than 8.8 percent, while Baker Hughes climbed about 10.5 percent. 
 Treasury prices fell, pushing up interest rates, after demand for riskier investments like stocks increased.
 The upbeat report on home sales provided some hope for the nation's housing market. An increase in signed contracts for homes was a result partly of a rush to obtain a tax credit that expired in April. The National Association of Realtors said its index of signed contracts for existing homes rose 6 percent. The increase was ahead of the estimates of economists polled by Thomson Reuters. 
 ''Anything that indicates more of a stabilization -- and not rapid declines -- in housing is probably a good thing,'' said Jason D. Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
 A rise in the euro from a four-year low Tuesday also drew buyers. Movements in the euro, which is used by 16 European countries, have often steered trading in the last month. The currency is seen as a reading on confidence in Europe's ability to contain a debt crisis that began in Greece, but has spread to other parts of Europe, including Spain and Portugal.
 The Dow rose 225.52 points, or 2.3 percent, to 10,249.54. The advance came after a two-day slide. It was the biggest point and percentage climb for the Dow since Thursday, when the index advanced 285 points, or 2.9 percent.
 The Dow is still down 8.5 percent from its high this year on April 26.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 27.67 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,098.38, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 58.74 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,281.07.
 Bond prices dropped. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 101 11/32, and the yield rose to 3.34 percent from 3.26 percent late Tuesday.
 Crude oil rose 28 cents to $72.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold fell.
 Investors are now awaiting the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is due Friday. 
 Economists predict the unemployment rate dipped to 9.8 percent in May from 9.9 percent in April and that employers added 513,000 jobs. Weekly reports on initial claims have hovered close to 450,000 throughout the year, which is considered above the level that would indicate strong growth.
 Among stocks, Schlumberger rose $4.56, or 8.8 percent, to $56.31. Baker Hughes advanced $3.76, or 10.5 percent, to $39.63. BP PLC rose $1.14, or 3.1 percent, to $37.66 after dropping nearly 15 percent Tuesday.
 The builder KB Home rose 28 cents, or 2 percent, to $14.01, while Hovnanian Enterprises advanced 18 cents, or 3 percent, to $6.15.
 Airlines rose after upbeat comments from analysts. Continental Airlines climbed $2.25, or 11.1 percent, to $22.54, while US Airways Group advanced 80 cents, or 9.3 percent, to $9.44.
 Ford Motor rose 44 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $11.85 after reporting that its United States sales rose 22 percent in May.

HEADLINE: Liquid Investments, Savored by the Palate Or as Part of a Portfolio

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

 BODY:
GENEVA -- A simple Internet real estate ad caught Filip Opdebeeck's eye in 2007: ''Strongbox for rent.'' The strongbox turned out to be a three-room vault beneath one of the many banks in this Swiss financial center, one room originally for bank archives, another for stock certificates, the third for gold.
 Today, the vault, 3,200 square feet and 30 feet below ground, holds a rather different sort of investment -- about 40,000 bottles of wine -- most of it part of portfolios owned, fittingly, by many bankers, but also by diplomats, professionals and others who just enjoy their glass of Saint Emilion, Romanee Conti or Mondavi. 
 The vault's newly installed racks, which resemble the stacks of a library, hold mostly French wines from the Bordeaux region, but also wines from Italy, Chile, Argentina, Australia and California's Napa Valley. Mr. Opdebeeck estimates the vault's capacity at about 100,000 bottles.
 Wine economists, like Philippe Masset of the Lausanne Hotel School, just up the north shore of Lake Geneva, say the inclusion of wine in an investment portfolio is increasingly common, especially prestigious wines like the reds of France's Bordeaux region. Those have invariably increased in value, he says, even during the financial crisis of 2008.
 ''Wine gives greater returns even than shares, and affords diversification,'' he said. As for Mr. Opdebeeck's vault: ''It's an anecdote,'' he said. ''But it's symptomatic.''
 Mr. Opdebeeck, 30, who was born of Belgian parents in Brazil and has spent adulthood in Switzerland, calls his company Au Bonheur du Vin, roughly Wine Lover's Paradise, a name he picked up from a similar operation in Paris and echoing a Zola novel, ''The Ladies' Paradise,'' about a merchant who designs a dazzling store to overwhelm women into spending.
 Mr. Opdebeeck is overwhelming Geneva into drinking fine wines. In a sense, he says, his business is much like banking, with the bottles as deposits or securities. He provides investment advice (which wines to buy), and provides an online bourse, where clients can bid for wines, buying and selling their bottles, for profit or just for the fun of bidding.
 ''I'm like a banker: I have a portfolio, but not too many bottles, because I say to my clients, wine is to drink,'' Mr. Opdebeeck said, leading a visitor through the vault, after pulling back its two-ton steel safe door. ''I ask my clients, 'Do you want high risk?' '' he said. ''If so I say, buy 12 bottles, drink 6.''
 If the idea was born in Paris, nowhere has it found broader acceptance than in Geneva. ''Geneva is a small town,'' he said. ''Everyone knows everyone else.'' And it has lots of affluent bankers who enjoy their wine.
 On any given day, Mr. Opdebeeck's iPhone flashes with clients' messages requesting that he add a Haut-Brion or a Chateau d'Yquem to the portfolio. This being Switzerland, the portfolios have no names, just numbers. 
 Clients within Geneva message him to deliver a case of wines to their homes or offices. On one afternoon, he was spied climbing the hill toward the Palace of Justice. A commodities broker wanted a case of French wines, and Mr. Opdebeeck pushed it up to him on his two-wheel dolly.
 ''You have to stock expensive wines,'' said the broker, Spyros Solounias, 40, ''because the storage is expensive.'' Not terribly. Storage of his portfolio of about 300 bottles, mostly from Bordeaux, costs about $26 a month. The wines he ordered included a 1994 Haut-Brion, worth about $300, and a magnum of Petrus that would fetch around $10,000 in the open market, depending on the vintage. His portfolio's oldest bottle is an 1894 Cognac. 
 The bank where Jean-Marie Formige works is just around the corner from Mr. Opdebeeck's vault. ''I'm what you'd call a wine lover, but for the pleasure of it,'' said Mr. Formige, 37, who keeps about 200 bottles with Mr. Opdebeeck, mostly French but some Swiss pinot noir. ''I drink my wine, yet there is always that reflex of an investment,'' he said. ''It's like a collector of art, who buys two paintings to sell and buys the one he really wants.''
 The vault is in the heart of the banking district, overgrown with the financial institutions that are the backbone of the city's business life and one block from the Rue du Rhone, one of the world's exclusive shopping streets.
 Some people are not so sure about the investment side. ''Obviously, it's the liquidity,'' said Michel Derobert, secretary general of the Swiss Private Bankers Association. Mr. Derobert belongs to a wine lovers club, known by its initials, CAVE. The letters stand for Club of Lovers of Exquisite Wines, in French; the word means wine cellar. Wine lovers have the money, he said, so they spend more, so prices go up. ''It's not a trend,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Opdebeeck's concept has caught on. In the suburb of Carouge, Frederic Krattinger, 38, has run a wine and liquor store for the last two years. People are definitely buying more wine, he said, especially the wines produced in the country around Geneva. ''A bit of it is to invest,'' he said of the increased purchases. ''But mainly it's to drink.''
 Others caution not to play down the investment side. Bruno Gueuning, 50, has run various wine businesses in Geneva for about a decade, and just set up a company dealing in Bordeaux wines. The 2009 vintage in Bordeaux promises to be one of the best since 2005, also a good year, he said, and prices are soaring steadily, mainly because of bidding by wealthy Chinese buyers. 
 Mr. Gueuning advises the bankers of Geneva, and Mr. Opdebeeck, to keep an eye on Asia. ''The 2009 will be worth much more than the 2005, if only to satisfy the needs of Chinese speculators,'' he said. ''The Chinese are gamblers.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Push for Bank Rules In Other Large Economies

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Wednesday that the United States would urge the world's largest economies to pursue a financial overhaul agenda that would ''restore fiscal sustainability over the medium term.''
 ''That is a shared imperative,'' Mr. Geithner told reporters at a briefing. ''We all recognize it.'' 
 Mr. Geithner, who will meet on Friday and Saturday with finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 nations, said he would press for greater transparency, new restrictions on derivatives trading and more stringent capital and liquidity requirements for banks.
 But Mr. Geithner conceded that the meeting, in the South Korean port city of Busan, was unlikely to produce consensus on an aim of American policy makers: a global tax on the largest banks.
 At summit meetings in London and Pittsburgh last year, the G-20 took on a new prominence, as leaders laid out basic agreements on responding to the economic crisis. Mr. Geithner said the forum had been ''remarkably effective at summoning collective will to meet common challenges.'' 
 With sovereign debt problems gripping the European Union, the challenges facing the G-20 this year are no less severe.
 The meeting in South Korea will lay the groundwork for G-20 leaders' talks in Toronto this month and in Seoul, South Korea, in November. 
 The G-20, which includes Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, represents a broader range of industrialized economies than the more Atlantic-oriented Group of 8. 
 Mr. Geithner tried to depict the United States as playing a major role in global economic ''rebalancing'' -- shorthand for greater domestic consumption in China and movement toward fiscal restraint in the United States and Europe.
 ''We're saving more as a country, borrowing substantially less from the rest of the world,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''We're meeting our responsibilities. The House and the Senate are on the verge of passing the most sweeping financial reforms that we've considered in generations in the United States, reforms that will meet all of the G-20 principles that we agreed to, I think, ahead of any other major economy.'' 
 Mr. Geithner said that awareness of the need for rebalancing could be seen ''most conspicuously'' in China. The United States has been gently urging China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate. 
 ''It requires substantial change and reform, but I think that you see much more support for that basic imperative than I would have expected a year ago,'' he said. 
 Though the House and the Senate have adopted bills to overhaul financial regulation, a conference committee needs to reconcile the two versions before a final bill can be passed and sent to President Obama.
 However, one of the areas in which the need for change is most pressing -- the tightening of capital and liquidity standards -- requires international coordination through forums like the G-20 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
 The Obama administration has called for a 10-year tax on banks that would generate at least $90 billion in the United States. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund support a bank tax, but several major countries, like Canada, do not.
 ''There's not universal support for that across the G-20, at least at this stage, and I don't think that's going to change in Korea,'' Mr. Geithner acknowledged.

HEADLINE: Ford to Stop Building Mercury After 71 Years

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Edsel Ford conceived the Mercury brand in the 1930s as a way to fill the gap between basic Fords and luxury Lincolns. Now, that gap will again go unfilled.
 Ford Motor announced Wednesday that it would discontinue selling Mercury models this fall, ending a 71-year-old brand that once stood for innovation and speed but that became a ''me, too'' division.
 Mark Fields, the president of Ford's Americas region, said Ford directors approved the step on Wednesday. He said the company would focus its resources on its core Ford division as well as Lincoln. 
 ''As we close this storied chapter on Mercury, we are opening a very exciting chapter, not only on Ford but on accelerating Lincoln,'' Mr. Fields said. 
 Mercury came to life during the Depression, when Ford was striving to keep pace with General Motors, which had passed Ford to become the country's top-selling automaker. At its cultural height in the 1950s, Mercury became known for innovative cars like the Turnpike Cruiser, whose features included a power rear window, the ''seat-o-matic'' adjusting seat, and the ''Merc-o-matic'' automatic transmission. 
 James Dean, playing a rebellious teenager, drove a black Mercury coupe in the 1955 film ''Rebel Without a Cause.''
 Mercury joins a sizable list of venerable Detroit brands that have disappeared in recent years. In 2009, General Motors said that it would eliminate Saturn, Hummer and Pontiac as it streamlined after its bankruptcy filing, and it did away with Oldsmobile in 2004. Saab was also discontinued as a G.M. brand, though it will have new owners. 
 Chrysler dropped the Plymouth brand in 2001, and the Chrysler brand itself is considered by some analysts to be in doubt, now that the company is under the management control of the Italian automaker Fiat.
 ''This decade is for sure going to be remembered in the auto industry as a decade of consolidation, a renewed focus on profitability instead of going blindly after market share, and shedding dead weight in terms of dealerships,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends and insights for TrueCar, a new-car pricing Web site.
 Before Mercury, the two ends of Ford's spectrum were its inexpensive cars and trucks, which the founder, Henry Ford, encouraged buyers to buy in the color black, and the sleek Lincoln models, which were known for their streamlined appearance.
 But G.M. picked up customers by offering ''a car for every purse and purpose,'' a phrase coined by its president, Alfred P. Sloan Jr. 
 So, Mr. Ford's son Edsel commissioned the development of the Mercury Eight, which went on sale in 1939. The car had a 95-horsepower V-8 engine that was 10 horsepower stronger than the Ford V-8, but it cost less than a Lincoln.
 Sales were strong until World War II interrupted production. They prospered again in 1949, when the first all-new postwar Mercury models reached showrooms. 
 By the 1960s, Mercury had become a place for slightly different and generally more expensive versions of the cars sold by the Ford division. 
 ''Mercury products have been nothing more than modestly restyled Fords for decades, and that's not how you build or maintain a brand,'' said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice.
 Mercurys of the 1960s included the Comet, a stretched version of the Ford Falcon, and the Cougar, originally a muscle-car variation on the Mustang but which was three inches longer and boasted a gutsy front grill that some likened to an electric shaver. 
 In the 1970s, because of the energy crisis and new fuel economy standards, Mercury made smaller cars, including the Capri, initially built in Europe. When Ford developed the Taurus sedan in the 1980s, it gave Mercury a version called the Sable.
 More recently, Mercury's lineup has included the Milan, its best-selling model, which is based on the Ford Fusion, as well as the Grand Marquis, a rear-wheel drive car that has been sold by Ford in some fashion since the 1970s.
 Mercury sales peaked at 580,000 in 1978, also a year of record hourly employment for the Detroit auto companies. In 2009, Ford sold fewer than 93,000 Mercury models. 
 So far in 2010, Mercury sales are 41,680, up 11.6 percent from last year, but they make up only 0.8 percent of the American car market.
 Mr. Fields said Ford has no stand-alone Mercury dealers, which should simplify shutting the division. He declined to say how much closing Mercury would cost Ford. Mercury models are sold by 1,700 dealers, which also have a franchise with Ford, Lincoln or another brand. 
 Bob Tasca Jr., a Rhode Island dealer who heads Ford's national Lincoln-Mercury dealer council, said dealers had pressed Ford for years to tell them the fate of the division and finally learned this year that a decision was at hand.
 Although expected, Mr. Tasca said, the step was fraught with emotion. For dealers, he said, ''there's going to be some cases where a lot of them are going to make it and prosper and some are going to go out of business.''

HEADLINE: Tax Collection in Louisiana Fell Sharply in First Quarter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Most states continued to collect less in taxes during the first three months of the year than they did during the same period last year, with the steepest decline here in Louisiana, a report on state taxes to be released Thursday finds.
 Total tax collections in Louisiana fell by a third during the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year, according to the report, an analysis of preliminary tax data by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. The drop-off came even before the oil spill began wreaking havoc with the state's coastal economy. 
 Louisiana was one of 34 states that collected less in taxes during the period, a troubling sign that the lingering effects of the economic downturn will continue to erode state finances for some time.
 Over all, state tax collections around the country grew by 2.4 percent during the quarter when compared with the same period last year, the report found -- the first year-over-year increase in collections since the summer of 2008. But the report cautioned that the growth was largely because of tax increases enacted in New York and California, rather than a sign that an economic recovery was beginning to fill state treasuries. 
 Even with the slight growth, states were still collecting significantly less money than they were before the recession, the report found. The $138 billion that was collected during the first quarter of this year represented a decline of 10.9 percent from the same period two years ago, when the states collected a total of $154.8 billion in taxes, the report found.
 ''Most states will continue coping with budget gaps for quite some time,'' said the report, which was written by Lucy Dadayan. 
 Things could soon get worse for states that are heavily dependent on personal income taxes: the report said that preliminary data suggest that many states will face big declines in income tax collections from April to June, on top of the steep declines they faced a year ago. The report warned that many states whose fiscal year ends on June 30 could be forced to take ''hasty actions'' to deal with shortfalls, and suggested that further tax increases, spending cuts and layoffs could be in the offing. 
 Sales tax collections rose by a slight 0.5 percent during the quarter compared with the previous year, but that was partly because of states that raised sales taxes, including Massachusetts and California. Thirty-seven states reported collecting less in sales tax during the quarter compared with the same period last year, the report said.
 The erosion of tax receipts in Louisiana was due in part to reduced collections of taxes linked to the gas and oil industries, even before the oil spill in April, the report said. The state has also cut a number of tax rates, and is grappling with the recession. A sharp downturn resulted during the first three months of the year: sales tax collections were down 20 percent, personal income tax collections were down 54 percent, and corporate taxes, which are often volatile, were down nearly 120 percent, according to the report.
 In mid-April, Louisiana's Legislative Fiscal Office, an independent agency, warned that the national recession was hitting the state ''in a big way'' and said that dwindling tax collections had opened a $319 million hole in the current year's budget. A few days later the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico and raising new questions about the state's economic outlook.

HEADLINE: 4 Preliminary Bids Are Made for Newsweek Magazine

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and JOSEPH PLAMBECK

 BODY:
Two magnates, a conservative publisher and the company that bought TV Guide for $1 have all raised their hands as potential buyers of Newsweek.
 By the time the deadline to submit preliminary bids for the magazine expired Wednesday at 5 p.m., at least four parties had indicated an interest to the Washington Post Company, which has said it no longer views Newsweek as an economically viable operation.
 It was unknown whether the Post Company considered any of the bids to be financially attractive. None of the parties that submitted bids would say how much they offered, nor would they disclose other terms of their proposals. 
 The Post Company declined to comment.
 The group of potential buyers is eclectic and diverse. One is Newsmax Media, which publishes the right-leaning magazine and Web site of the same name. The company confirmed its bid in a statement issued on Wednesday.
 Another bidder was OpenGate Capital, the private equity fund that owns TV Guide, said someone with direct knowledge of the company's offer, who was granted anonymity because the negotiations were private.
 Thane Ritchie, the hedge fund manager, who unsuccessfully tried to buy the Sun Times Media Group last year, also submitted a bid, according to his spokesman. Mr. Ritchie has developed a reputation as something of a political provocateur in Illinois, most recently for his efforts to explore creating a third political party with supporters of Ross Perot. 
 And Sidney Harman, the 91-year-old founder of the stereo equipment giant Harman Kardon, said that he had informed the Post Company that he was interested in exploring a potential bid.
 Haim Saban, the media mogul who had expressed some interest in buying Newsweek, was not believed to be among those seriously considering placing a bid, according to someone familiar with the bidding process.
 There are many lingering questions about the parties that have expressed curiosity in Newsweek, including their motives for buying the magazine and how seriously they are considering it. When companies are for sale, bidders have been known to submit intentionally low prices to generate buzz. Or sometimes they just want to roll the dice on the outside chance their lowball bid is accepted. 
 Newsmax, which was founded by Christopher Ruddy, the onetime Clinton family antagonist and former New York Post reporter, moved quickly to dispense with any speculation that it would remake Newsweek with a conservative slant.
 ''The company's bid for Newsweek's print and online assets is congruent with its objective to diversify and expand into numerous distinct media brand offerings,'' Newsmax said in a statement. ''Newsweek's staff, advertisers and readers can be assured that if Newsmax Media Inc.'s bid is successful, Newsweek's stellar brand and editorial representation would remain distinct from our other brands.''
 Mr. Harman stressed in a brief telephone interview that he was not making a bid but merely expressing an ''intention to bid,'' which he said was a significant distinction. ''I'm interested in looking at this extremely complicated matter,'' he said, adding that he did not intend to specify a purchase price in his letter of intent. 
 Whatever the final purchase price of Newsweek is, assuming the Washington Post Company can attract an offer it deems financially palatable, it is unlikely to be robust if the recent sales prices for magazines are any indication. 
 TV Guide sold for $1 in 2008 to OpenGate Capital, which assumed tens of millions of dollars in liabilities. Bloomberg bought BusinessWeek late last year for around $5 million. 
 Any price, of course, would tell only part of the tale of what Newsweek is worth.
 ''The top-line number is almost meaningless,'' said Walter Isaacson, the former Time managing editor, pointing out that liabilities like debt and pension obligations assumed by Newsweek's buyer are the more telling numbers. ''I don't think a number makes any sense, whether it's zero, or $5 million or $20 million.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses The Airlines To Do More For the Flier

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
The Transportation Department signaled on Wednesday that it planned to be more aggressive in forcing airlines to address common traveler frustrations, proposing a wide range of consumer protections. They come on top of earlier rules limiting how much time passengers can sit on planes on the tarmac. 
 The proposed rules would, among other things, raise compensation for passengers denied boarding on oversold flights, allow customers to get a full refund within 24 hours of buying an airline ticket and require reimbursement of baggage fees and expenses when luggage is not delivered on time. 
 They would also require the airlines to more speedily notify travelers about flight delays and cancellations and ban airlines and ticket agents from advertising prices that are not the full fare -- specifically mandating clearer disclosure in advertisements for ''one-way'' fares that can only be acquired as part of a round-trip ticket.
 Taken together, the proposals, which are expected to take effect in the fall, are the Obama administration's answer to rising frustrations about airline delays, proliferating fees, shady advertising practices and the general lack of responsiveness by carriers to customer complaints. Legislation to deal with some of these issues remains stalled in Congress, and previous administrations generally relied on the airlines to address these problems themselves.
 ''All of these rules come about as a result of complaints that we've heard from the flying public,'' Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, said at a news briefing. ''These are the things that people get irritated about.'' 
 The tarmac rules, which took effect in late April, require airlines to give passengers stuck on the tarmac the option to get off the plane after three hours, with exceptions for safety and security reasons. Carriers were also required to develop plans to deal with lengthy tarmac delays and provide passengers with snacks, water and working bathrooms.
 The new proposals expand the number of airlines required to adopt tarmac delay contingency plans to include foreign carriers, which would also have to begin filing data with the Transportation Department about tarmac delays. 
 The reporting provision would be extended to any carrier operating any aircraft with 30 or more seats, including regional airlines. Currently the rule applies only to the largest airlines in the United States.
 Both American and foreign airlines would be required to include these contingency plans in their contracts of carriage -- the lengthy legal document governing any ticket purchase -- a provision the passenger advocacy group FlyersRights.org asked the department to adopt. 
 ''That gives more notification to the passenger,'' said Kate Hanni, founder of FlyersRights. ''It also adds a layer of enforceability.''
 Ms. Hanni said raising the compensation for passengers denied boarding was another provision she had requested. In her view, it is the most important provision in the proposed new rules, based on the number of complaints her organization has received about this issue.
 The minimum compensation would be increased more than 50 percent, to $650 to $1,300, depending on the destination and the length of the delay. The new amounts would be automatically adjusted to account for inflation every two years. 
 The compensation for bumped passengers was raised two years ago for the first time in two decades, but by an amount that fell short of the cost of the inconvenience many experienced.
 The rules would require airlines to offer compensation to passengers who were bumped from their scheduled flights and were traveling on frequent-flier awards (not just those who paid for their tickets). The airlines would also have to inform bumped passengers that they can choose monetary compensation in lieu of the travel vouchers that airlines often offer as an alternative to cash.
 These vouchers typically have restrictions on how and when they can be used, potentially making them as difficult to redeem as frequent-flier awards. The new rule would require carriers to clearly outline any such limitations when they offer vouchers.
 In response to the proposed rules, the Air Transport Association of America, an airline trade group, issued a statement that said: ''The A.T.A. member airlines' shared goal is to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and economically viable air transportation system consistent with the expectations of their customers, employees and shareholders. Today's D.O.T. notice of proposed rule-making will be evaluated against that standard, with a focus on minimizing potential passenger inconvenience.''
 Representatives from individual airlines declined to comment, saying they needed time to digest the 84-page document, but would be participating in the comment process. The government estimates the new rules would cost the airlines $26 million over 10 years, though these figures are difficult to quantify.
 All the proposals announced Wednesday are subject to a 60-day public comment period, and Mr. LaHood encouraged ''common, ordinary citizens'' to submit feedback online at Regulations.gov. The department is also working with Cornell to make it easier for travelers to comment.
 As part of an effort to increase participation in agency rule-making, Cornell's RegulationRoom.org Web site lets travelers choose an issue and post their opinions. 
 One topic the department is soliciting feedback on is dealing with passengers who have severe peanut allergies. It offered several options, including prohibiting airlines from serving peanuts or requiring carriers to create a peanut-free zone.
 ''What we're really trying to do is lower the barriers to participation,'' said Cynthia Farina, a professor at Cornell Law School who is working on the university's rule-making initiative for the Web.
 Speaking last month at the first meeting of the Future of Aviation Advisory Committee at the Transportation Department's headquarters in Washington, Mr. LaHood acknowledged his own frustration with the government's rule-making procedures.
 ''We're as frustrated as you all are about rule-making,'' he said. ''It's a torturous process.''

HEADLINE: I'll Have a Vodka, With a Splash of Celebrity

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
THERE are certain Bruce Willis signatures -- the bald head, the self-deprecating humor and the cockiness -- and he brings them all to a new campaign for Sobieski vodka. Mr. Willis serves as the brand's celebrity spokesman, and he owns a small percentage of the Polish vodka maker's parent company.
 In a series of ''Bruce Has Ideas'' commercials, which began appearing online this week, he makes it clear he has a stake in the company. At the same time, he pokes fun at himself, saying, in one ad, ''No, I'm not just an action hero with rugged good looks and some singing ambitions.'' 
 In wry exchanges with Sobieski's chief executive, Krzysztof Trylinski, Mr. Willis also concedes, humorously, that he is not an expert in distilled spirits, asking in one commercial: ''What the heck does Bruce Willis know about making vodka? Nothing.''
 The ads are part of a digital and print campaign by Sobieski Vodka of North America, which entered the American market three years ago and used a back-to-basics theme to promote its rye-based vodka, the top seller in Poland.
 Mr. Willis, who advertised wine coolers in the 1980s for Seagram's, is part of Sobieski's effort to counter the fancy packaging or lavish settings used by its competitors to market vodka, which is about one-third of the American distilled spirits market.
 Sobieski, whose American sales doubled in volume last year to 500,000 cases, sells for $10.99 at retail, and is being marketed as a premium vodka to compete against labels like Svedka and Smirnoff.
 The seven Web commercials with Mr. Willis were created by Meter Industries. They followed the campaign's initial phase that used short phrases or quips to focus on the country's newfound frugality after the national financial crisis, like: ''Overspending on vodka? That's so 2008.''
 Emphasizing the basics theme, the print, digital and billboard ads showed only the bottle, and were in black and white with a splash of dark red from Sobieski's label and bottle top. The ads won an Effie award this year -- given by the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association -- in the alcohol, beverages category.
 The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States says that there are 350 vodkas in the American market, which is why Sobieski ''decided to differentiate itself by going after the gimmicks; we're trying to get people to focus on quality,'' said Marty Weiss, chief executive and creative director of Meter Industries.
 He added: ''We wanted everything to feel premium, but simple. So we were looking for someone iconoclastic, the real deal.'' That led to Mr. Willis, who became a global spokesman for Sobieski last year; he later received a 3.3 percent stake in Sobieski's owner, the French company Belvedere -- worth about $4 million at the time -- as compensation.
 Chester Brandes, chief executive of Imperial Brands, the Florida-based distributor of Sobieski, said that the company choose Mr. Willis because he was ''authentic, likable and not superficial -- plus he likes our vodka.''
 In the commercials, Mr. Trylinski is the foil for Mr. Willis's humor. Clad in a black T-shirt and jeans, Mr. Willis contrasts with the chief executive, who is dressed in a business suit and tie. Sitting at a table with an open bottle of Sobieski and two glasses, the two spar over the inexperienced Mr. Willis's ideas about how to promote vodka.
 ''The idea is to show that he's involved, he has ideas,'' Mr. Weiss said.
 The ads began running this week on the company's revamped Web site, truthinvodka.com. There will also be a feature called ''Ask Bruce,'' where the viewer can type in a question and receive one of about 30 recorded answers from Mr. Willis.
 ''It will be playful,'' explained Mr. Weiss. ''You could ask: 'Should I get married?' and an answer from Bruce might be, 'Do it already.' ''
 There will be banners on Web sites like gawker.com to direct visitors to truthinvodka.com, he said.
 The print ad campaign will appear in US Weekly, Rolling Stone and Playboy. Also, Mr. Willis will take part in Sobieski-sponsored events around the world.
 Mr. Willis is not the first celebrity to endorse and be a partner in a vodka company. Ciroc Vodka, owned by the distilled spirits giant Diageo, three years ago signed the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs as a spokesman. Mr. Combs, who receives a share of the profits, has appeared in advertisements showing Ciroc in luxury settings.
 Sobieski's strategy, said Mr. Brandes, is to focus attention on what is in the bottle rather than how the vodka is presented. As part of the campaign, Mr. Willis also filmed a separate and somewhat longer ad, called ''Cruelty in Vodka,'' to be shown on television screens in liquor stores to acquaint buyers with Sobieski.
 ''They filter it through diamonds. They put it in pills. They flavor it with bacon. They enrich it with platinum ions. They color it pink,'' Mr. Willis says, needling other brands.
 ''I'm talking about vodka,'' Mr. Willis says in the commercial and then he urges buyers to ignore all the enhancements and ''return this fine spirit to its roots.''

HEADLINE: Mayor to Cancel Teachers' Raises, Averting Layoffs

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Wednesday that the city would withhold across-the-board pay increases for public school teachers and principals for the next two years to ''save the jobs of some 4,400 teachers.'' 
 ''This was not an ideal decision and it certainly does not solve all our budget issues,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement, which was released minutes after he had notified Michael Mulgrew, the president of the city teachers' union. 
 ''In our conversation this morning,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''Michael Mulgrew and I agreed that we would go together to Albany and Washington to press our case to restore more education funding.''
 But the move drew immediate condemnation from Mr. Mulgrew, who said that the mayor did not have the power to take such a step. The union's last contract with the city expired in October, and negotiations are at an impasse. 
 ''He does not have the power to unilaterally decide on the teachers' contract, and we have reached no agreement on his proposal to freeze teacher pay,'' Mr. Mulgrew said.
 Ernest Logan, the leader of the principals' union, the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, said that he would fight the decision in negotiations; the union's contract expired in March.
 ''We have not consented to his proposal to eliminate raises for the next two years,'' Mr. Logan said, ''and we have yet to sit down at the bargaining table.'' 
 In practice, however, the mayor does not need the permission of either union to freeze wages because neither has a current contract. If the unions do not accept his terms, the mayor could refuse to sign a new contract with them. (Principals worked for nearly four years, beginning in 2003, without a contract.) 
 The mayor's move does not entirely freeze teachers' pay. Teachers typically receive an annual raise and ''step increases'' for seniority and for earning advanced degrees or academic credits. Teachers will still receive step increases, which can range from around $400 at the beginning of a career to more than $8,000 for teachers who reach 20 years. Teacher salaries would still go up an average of 3.3 percent based on such increases, education officials said. 
 Fiscal watchdogs have questioned the mayor's willingness to repeatedly grant annual raises of around 4 percent to the city's public employee unions, especially as the economy sputtered. The city has not broken its pattern of increases in decades, even during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. 
 Earlier this year, Mr. Bloomberg announced that he would seek raises of 2 percent for the next two years for teachers and principals; his current position does away with raises entirely. 
 The mayor and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, have been warning of widespread layoffs for months and complaining about a state law that requires layoffs to be based on seniority. The warnings became so dire last week that many young teachers began to send out resumes. 
 But Mr. Bloomberg, who has staked his reputation on his efforts to overhaul the city schools, was apparently unwilling to have layoffs become part of his legacy. He said that the salary freeze would save the city $400 million next year and that the city still expected to cut 2,000 teaching positions through attrition, mostly in retirements. 
 ''From our vantage point this is the right call,'' said Charles Brecher, the vice president of the Citizens Budget Committee, which monitors city spending. ''If you have a trade-off between wages and jobs in education, you want to save the jobs.'' 
 The mayor's move, coming just days after he persuaded the State Legislature to more than double the number of charter schools in the state, could put pressure on lawmakers to allocate more money for schools. But any increased spending on schools would most likely have to be offset by spending cuts elsewhere or by higher taxes.
 Thousands of teachers nationwide are facing layoffs because of the recession's drain on state tax revenues. New York City, which employs about 80,000 teachers, has not given pink slips to teachers in more than three decades. 
 Despite the lost raises, the mayor's move took some pressure off the teachers' union, which had come under fire for defending the seniority rules. Since schools will no longer be losing their young teachers, parent outcry over the budget cuts is likely to be more muted. 
 Mr. Mulgrew, of the United Federation of Teachers, softened his initial tone later on Wednesday, saying that he was pleased that the mayor was eager to lobby Albany and Washington to restore the education budget cuts.
 Mr. Klein, in a news conference, said he expected the budget for 2011-12 to be even worse than this year's, because the city will not have federal stimulus money. 
 The schools received their budgets on Wednesday, with an average cut of 4 percent. This probably means that principals will have to cut after-school programs or some course offerings. But Mr. Klein said that the situation was far better than what principals had been braced for. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, persuaded some unions to accept a two-year wage freeze in the mid-1990s. And today, dozens of school districts around the country have halted salary increases to avoid laying off large numbers of teachers. In many cases, local teachers' unions have agreed to the wage freezes, but other cities have made the decision unilaterally, said Emily Cohen, a policy director at the National Center on Teacher Quality, which tracks contracts all over the country. 
 ''These are kind of unprecedented times, and a lot of what happens next is unclear,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''The unions will want to protect their most vocal and most active members, who are going to care a lot about their salaries not going up, but not about the 22-year-old teacher who is going to be at risk for losing her job. But it's not clear they are going to even have a choice.''
 Joan Shur, 55, who teaches special education at John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx, said that after nearly two decades in the system she was appalled at the idea of a salary freeze. 
 ''They have been cruel to the older teachers,'' she said of the Bloomberg administration. Pointing out that rookie teachers can make half as much as veteran teachers, she added, ''They want the younger ones because they can get two for one.''
 But Jason Hull, 38, an English teacher at Kennedy who has worked in city schools for seven years, said he supported the move. 
 ''In light of the situation in Albany,'' he said, ''I think it's fair, absolutely, as long as there are no givebacks or layoffs.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Relations Played Major Role in Downfall of Japanese Prime Minister

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and MARK LANDLER; Martin Fackler reported from Seoul, and Mark Landler from Washington. David E. Sanger contributed from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- When Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan abruptly stepped down Wednesday, largely for his failure to move an American air base off Okinawa, he was essentially admitting he had not won popular support for a prominent campaign pledge: ending Japan's postwar dependence on the United States for its security.
 ''This has proved impossible in my time,'' Mr. Hatoyama said in a teary speech to explain his decision to step down. ''Someday, the time will come when Japan's peace will have to be ensured by the Japanese people themselves.''
 Mr. Hatoyama's plunge in popularity, just eight months after his victory ended a half-century of nearly unbroken one-party control, suggested that the Japanese public had rejected his attempt to rethink Japan's cold-war-era alliance with the United States, its most important ally. Rising tensions between North and South Korea in recent weeks and an increasingly assertive China reinforced the public's sense that Japan needed the United States more than ever. 
 The Obama administration's reaction to the resignation suggested that it would not miss Mr. Hatoyama much either. The White House, in its statement, pointedly did not thank or praise him, saying only that the alliance would ''continue to strengthen,'' regardless of who was in charge. Senior officials often seemed frustrated by his decision-making, and President Obama never developed a rapport with him.
 In Washington, some analysts even argued that Mr. Obama played a role in Mr. Hatoyama's downfall, damaging his standing by keeping him at arm's length and refusing to compromise on the air base. Administration officials denied this, saying they worked with Japan in recent months to resolve their differences. Mr. Obama, they noted, lavishly praised Mr. Hatoyama for his decision not to move the base off Okinawa.
 What seems clear, analysts said, is that while Japanese were sympathetic to putting the relationship on a more equal footing, they shied away from more fundamental changes, in a country that still views Washington as a largely benign protector.
 ''The Japanese public was not willing to follow Hatoyama down this path of Futenma and changing the alliance,'' said Izuru Makihara, a professor of politics at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, referring to the American base, United States Marine Air Station Futenma. ''The consensus is that Japan needs the United States, with China and North Korea nearby.'' 
 Mr. Hatoyama's sudden departure left his Democratic Party scrambling to find a new leader to restore a sense of direction for a party that had swept into power with high hopes last summer in a landslide. The party's control of Parliament's Lower House ensures it will hold on to power despite the resignation.
 Party members gathered behind closed doors to select candidates for an internal party vote on Friday that will elect Mr. Hatoyama's successor. The finance minister, Naoto Kan, 63, a former leader of the Democratic Party, emerged as an early frontrunner.
 As the party moves to choose Japan's sixth prime minister in four years, many in Japan see Mr. Hatoyama as having frittered away his party's historic electoral mandate on the seemingly minor issue of relocating a single American military installation.
 In truth, his government faltered on a host of issues, including scandals over political financing; an inability to deliver on other campaign promises like eliminating highway tolls; and the party's failure to focus on pocketbook issues affecting voters, like unemployment or Japan's anemic growth rates. 
 Still, Mr. Hatoyama's handling of the base issue seemed to crystallize all that went wrong with his short-lived government, including what many Japanese saw as its fatal flaw: his own indecisiveness. The prime minister seemed to waffle between appeasing Washington and assuring Okinawans that he would honor his campaign vows.
 During last summer's election campaign, Mr. Hatoyama pledged to end Japan's dependence on the United States, and improve ties with China and the rest of Asia. His fall is a blow to China, which had hoped to expand its influence in Japan. 
 The centerpiece of Mr. Hatoyama's push was a pledge to move the Futenma base and its noisy helicopters off Okinawa. But Mr. Hatoyama ran into fierce resistance from the Obama administration. Eager to establish that the United States was not retreating from Asia, it refused to back down from a 2006 agreement to relocate the base to a less populated part of the island.
 During a visit to Japan last October, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates made it clear he had no intention of reopening negotiations.
 Public opinion turned against Mr. Hatoyama's handling of Japan's crucial relationship with Washington. His government's approval ratings plummeted from more than 70 percent in September to the high teens in recent weeks.
 In the end, the lack of support, and what Mr. Hatoyama called his belated recognition of the importance of the Marines as a deterrent, forced him to accept most of the 2006 agreement. He resigned a week later, as he appeared to be a heavy liability for the Democrats facing parliamentary elections on July 11.
 Analysts say that the public did not reject all aspects of Mr. Hatoyama's agenda. His calls for building a more equal relationship with the United States resonated in Japan, which has grown weary of its junior status in the alliance.
 ''Hatoyama tapped into the feeling of many Japanese that it is time to rethink their nation's place in a changing world,'' said Takashi Kawakami, a professor who specializes in security issues at Takushoku University in Tokyo. ''But wanting to be treated as an equal by Washington is not the same as wanting to be independent of Washington.''
 A curious aspect to Mr. Hatoyama's fall is that for decades the United States has sought to loosen the Liberal Democratic Party's hold on the country. But the two governments that succeeded in doing so -- one in 1993-94, and the current one -- simply could not pull the levers of power, leaving American officials deeply frustrated.
 Once a new leader is in place, ''I do think there will be a desire to exhibit a different kind of management from the outset,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
 Analysts said there were lessons in Mr. Hatoyama's fall for the Obama administration. Sheila A. Smith, a senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said American officials did not initially show enough patience with the new government. ''There was responsibility on both sides,'' she said. 
 One immediate upshot of Mr. Hatoyama's failure will most likely be that his successor will avoid making big changes in foreign policy, in favor of focusing on domestic issues.
 ''Hatoyama self-destructed on Futenma,'' said Mr. Kawakami of Takushoku University. ''His successor is not going to want to touch that issue.''

HEADLINE: As Oil Slips Away, So Do Opportunities

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is supposed to leave Washington in 10 days for Indonesia, Australia and Guam, but with oil still gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, some in the White House are wondering whether the weeklong trip should be scrubbed.
 For now, the trip remains on the schedule. But as the White House tallies up the spiraling price tag of the largest oil spill in American history, the bottom line extends beyond dollars and cents. Also on the line are the opportunity costs for a president who already had a packed agenda before a rig exploded in the waters off Louisiana. 
 Now that engineers have given up trying to plug the leak and have turned their efforts to containing it until a relief well can be finished in August, Mr. Obama faces at least two more months of crisis management that will complicate his hopes of advancing his agenda in other areas. Every day he devotes to a spill that seems beyond his control, and every day it consumes attention in Washington, is another day that he cannot focus as much energy and resources on his own initiatives.
 Mr. Obama had hoped to spend his summer creating jobs, passing financial reform, promoting his health care program, getting a Supreme Court justice confirmed and an arms control treaty with Russia ratified, pressing for international sanctions against Iran and jump-starting the troubled Middle East peace process. While not abandoning any of those goals, Mr. Obama now must find ways to continue pushing them while demonstrating to the nation that he is concentrating on a spill he has called ''our highest priority.''
 ''This has hijacked his entire legislative agenda,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University who has written about Jimmy Carter, whose presidency was consumed by the Iran hostage crisis. ''The White House felt they were on a roll. They were looking to be a new New Deal or new Great Society and they were just getting momentum going. Something this awful has sidetracked the agenda.''
 Sara Taylor Fagen, White House political director under President George W. Bush, said the failure to contain the spill would make it hard for Mr. Obama to accomplish anything this year. ''He'll likely be managing the fallout for years to come,'' she said. ''Not until his re-election campaign will he have an opportunity to press reset.''
 White House officials reject that, saying the president can still move forward on several fronts. They pointed, as an example, to his effort in a speech on Wednesday in Pittsburgh to push for Senate passage of his energy and climate change legislation. Advisers to Mr. Obama are anticipating a new jobs report on Friday that they hope will show progress in rebuilding the economy, and they expect that new financial regulations will pass regardless of the oil spill.
 ''The nature of the presidency is you lay plans and you pursue them knowing that there are going to be exigencies that occur,'' said David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser. ''What you can't do is, no matter how dramatic the challenge, you can't concentrate all your energy on one thing and one thing alone.''
 Even as the president huddles each day with advisers on the spill, other parts of government grind on. The withdrawal of combat forces from Iraq is on track to be complete by August, despite political uncertainty in Baghdad. The president's Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, appears likely to be approved, barring unforeseen revelations.
 And the oil spill may even have helped in some instances by diverting attention from issues that otherwise might have been bigger fights. For instance, measures intended to ultimately lift the ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military advanced in both the House and Senate in recent days with relatively little furor while cable television focused on the gulf.
 ''The American people are far more concerned about an economy that is still struggling and the oil spill they see every day on their TV screen than they are about the prospect of gays and lesbians being allowed to serve openly in the military,'' said Aubrey Sarvis, head of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy group.
 Still, this crisis has dragged on for more than six weeks and promises to take another two months, setting off ''Day 43''-like media attention. History shows that presidents like Mr. Carter have had their agendas overcome by long-running crises. Bill Clinton found it hard to gain traction during the year he was investigated, impeached and ultimately acquitted of perjury in the Monica Lewinsky case. Mr. Bush found second-term domestic legislation like Social Security investment accounts hobbled as violence engulfed Iraq.
 Patrick Griffin, Mr. Clinton's chief Congressional liaison in his first term, said the trick was to organize the White House to wall off the crisis from the rest of the team, so that governing in other areas can continue as much as possible. And yet the crisis is still hard to overlook. ''It leaves a wound or a scar on an administration, notwithstanding the cause, that makes you operate with a limit,'' Mr. Griffin said.
 At the least, Mr. Obama's schedule for the next month will force choices. After the week in Indonesia and Australia, he is supposed to host President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia in Washington and fly to Toronto for meetings with the Group of 20 major powers. He is loath to cancel the Australia-Indonesia trip because he already postponed it once to focus on health care legislation.
 That has become a pattern for a White House that has been buffeted by crisis while sometimes still defying the odds. ''One of the things we have learned throughout our time here,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, ''is you do not get to pick what events you deal with.''

HEADLINE: After Spate of Suicides, Technology Firm in China Raises Workers' Salaries

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Bao Beibei contributed research. Miguel Helft contributed reporting from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Stung by labor shortages and a rash of suicides this year at its large factories in southern China, Foxconn Technology said Wednesday that it would immediately raise the salaries of many of its Chinese workers by 33 percent. 
 The pay increase is the latest indication that labor costs are rising in China's coastal manufacturing centers and that workers are demanding higher pay to offset an increase in inflation and soaring food and property prices. 
 On Wednesday, Honda Motor said it had resolved a strike in southern China and resumed operations at a transmission plant there after agreeing to give 1,900 Chinese workers a 24 percent pay raise. 
 The Honda strike, which lasted more than two weeks, was a rare show of power by Chinese workers, who are not commonly allowed by the government to publicly strike and walk off the job for higher wages. 
 At Foxconn, the basic salary for an assembly line worker in Shenzhen is expected to rise from 900 renminbi ($132) a month to 1,200 renminbi ($176). The minimum monthly wage in Shenzhen is 900 renminbi, about 83 cents an hour. 
 The announcement comes just a week after Foxconn's chairman, Terry Gou, visited its factories in the southern city of Shenzhen and promised to do everything possible to halt a spate of worker suicides and improve conditions at Foxconn, which is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer. 
 The police say 10 Foxconn workers have committed suicide this year in Shenzhen. 
 The company, which is based in Taiwan and employs more than 800,000 workers in China, has denied that the suicides were work-related or above the national average, saying instead that they were the result of social ills and personal problems of young, migrant workers. Foxconn said Wednesday that the decision to raise salaries was not a direct response to the suicides. 
 But Foxconn, which produces electronics and computer components for Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Apple, has come under growing scrutiny in recent years because of recurring reports of harsh labor conditions at its factories, including long working hours and claims by labor rights activists that the company treats workers like machines. 
 Apple, Dell and H.P. each said last week that they were concerned about the recent suicides and were investigating the situation at Foxconn. 
 Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said Tuesday during a technology conference in California that he was concerned about the deaths at Foxconn, but said that the factory was not a ''sweatshop'' and added that Apple was ''over there trying to understand what is happening.'' 
 Like most manufacturers in southern China, Foxconn is also struggling to hire thousands of workers at a time when the economy is booming and there is a shortage of unskilled migrant workers in many parts of coastal China. 
 Many migrant workers who typically move from inland provinces to coastal cities looking for factory work have complained that factory salaries have not kept pace with inflation. Many of them have decided to look for work closer to home. 
 Foxconn executives say the company's factories in Shenzhen alone have hired more than 100,000 workers during the last year, and that labor rights groups have pressed the company to raise salaries. 
 ''First, a pay raise will give our workers more leisure time,'' said Arthur Huang, a Foxconn spokesman. ''Second, such a huge pay raise will attract more qualified workers.'' 
 Southern China's manufacturing centers have been struggling with labor shortages since about 2003, and many coastal cities have raised the minimum wage in recent years. 
 Indeed, to help offset inflation and rising food, energy and housing costs -- and to spur domestic consumption among the lower classes -- Beijing urged local governments early this year to raise the minimum wage in the regions. 
 Many cities responded by raising the minimum wage by about 10 to 15 percent, to about 750 to 1,100 renminbi. 
 To cope with labor shortages and hold down costs, many factories in southern China expect employees to work a considerable amount of overtime. And often half of an employee's wages come from overtime pay. 
 As a result, Foxconn's 33 percent increase in wages could translate into even higher labor costs. Mr. Huang at Foxconn said the company had not yet calculated its impact on profitability. 
 But Debby Chan, project officer at Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, a labor rights group based in Hong Kong, said the wage increases were insufficient. 
 ''We're advocating the living wage, and we think the standard should be between 1,700 to 2,100 renminbi a month,'' Ms. Chan said Wednesday. ''And we also have other demands, like Foxconn should look into the problems of their management methodology.''

HEADLINE: A Knock-Down, Drag-Out -- Yawn

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Something has been missing from the fight over the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan: the fight.
 When President Obama nominated Ms. Kagan, his solicitor general, to fill the seat being vacated by Justice John Paul Stevens, the usual array of Washington pundits and prognosticators predicted a summer dominated by a contentious battle over her confirmation. Nearly four weeks later, that battle has yet to crystallize, and Ms. Kagan seems to have emerged as a kind of Teflon nominee.
 ''This is not a coronation, it's a confirmation,'' Senator Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Wednesday, sounding more than a little bit frustrated. 
 Unlike Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose nomination became quickly caught up in a fracas over her ''wise Latina'' comment and her aggressive questioning style -- a debate that introduced a new term, ''hot bench,'' into the Washington lexicon -- Ms. Kagan is more low-key than lightning rod.
 Justice Sotomayor made history as the first Latina on the Supreme Court, and captured the public imagination with her up-by-the-bootstraps personal story. Ms. Kagan, with her thin paper trail and brainy-girl-from-the-Ivy-League past, seems to inspire neither intense devotion from fans nor blistering criticism from her foes. 
 The conventional wisdom, even among conservatives here, is that barring some unforeseen bombshell, she will be confirmed.
 ''There's a lack of enthusiasm on the left that is matched by a certain fatalism among some folks on the right,'' said Edward Whelan, who has been issuing conservative critiques of Ms. Kagan from his perch as president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington. His article about Ms. Kagan in the current National Review is headlined ''The Blankest Slate.''
 Ms. Kagan's slate, however, is about to grow a lot less blank, a development that could change the political dynamics of her candidacy. This week the National Archives is expected to release the first batch from a total of 160,000 pages of documents relating to Ms. Kagan's years in the Clinton White House -- including e-mail messages that, some conservatives hope, might reveal a more candid side of the ever-cautious solicitor general.
 As Mr. Whelan said, ''We all know how problematic e-mails can be.''
 If there is a fight brewing over Ms. Kagan at all, it seems to be over the records. Mr. Sessions has been pressing hard for them, and warned in the interview that Republicans might use the filibuster to block Ms. Kagan's confirmation if all the documents are not released in enough time for senators to review them before the start of the hearings, now scheduled to begin June 28.
 ''We would not like to filibuster,'' he said, ''but I would say a failure to produce documents and actions in that vein could lead to more tension than some people might expect.''
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and Judiciary chairman, said Republicans were trying to use a double standard. ''We're going to have far more documents than we had for Roberts and Alito, and a lot sooner,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Vermont, referring to the two justices nominated by former President George W. Bush, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr.
 Conservatives and liberals alike are eager for the documents; both sides would like to gin up a little bit of controversy, if only to energize their bases in this midterm election year. Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy group, said the records had the potential to transform Ms. Kagan ''from a candidate who's a blank slate to one with a very complex, intricate portrait.''
 In the weeks since her nomination, Ms. Kagan has been making the usual courtesy calls to senators. So far, she has visited more than 50 of them, a parade of mostly ho-hum sessions that Dahlia Lithwick, who writes about legal issues for the online magazine Slate, has aptly dubbed ''the Elena Kagan Bore 'Em to Death Tour.'' 
 So far, only one Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, has said outright that he will not vote for her.
 Others, including Mr. Sessions, say they have serious questions about Ms. Kagan, citing her lack of experience -- she has never been a judge -- and her decision to briefly bar military recruiters from facilities at Harvard Law School while she was dean. Yet the complaints seem to have gained little traction. 
 After Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Judiciary Committee, met with Ms. Kagan, he issued a statement saying he did not believe ''prior judicial experience is a prerequisite for sitting on the court,'' and added that he took her ''at her word that she respects the military.''
 In part, Ms. Kagan has benefited from the capital's short attention span. With all eyes on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- and confirmation hearings at the end of June, the Washington equivalent of light-years away -- the nomination has fallen out of the news and the public is not yet engaged. A poll released last week by CBS News found that more than 7 in 10 Americans had yet to form an opinion of her.
 Mr. Sessions, though, predicts that will change. He says conservatives, especially Tea Party activists, are deeply interested in a discussion of judicial philosophy, a debate in which Ms. Kagan will be put on display as Exhibit A. 
 ''A lot of people at tea parties carry a copy of the Constitution in their pockets,'' the senator said, adding that if the debate seems sleepy, it is only because his colleagues are not yet paying attention. ''We've got so much going on -- the economy, the oil spill, defense issues, whatever,'' he said. ''They're just beginning to focus on this.''

HEADLINE: Obama Says He'll Push For Clean Energy Bill

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- President Obama said Wednesday that it was time for the United States ''to aggressively accelerate'' its transition from oil to alternative sources of energy and vowed to push for quick action on climate change legislation despite almost unanimous opposition from Republicans and continued skepticism from some Democrats.
 Seeking to harness the deepening anger over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to the advantage of his legislative agenda, Mr. Obama promised to find the lagging votes in the Senate to get the climate change and energy bill passed this year. Last year, the House passed a version of the bill, which tries to address global warming by putting a price on greenhouse gas pollution and provides incentives for alternative clean energy sources. 
 ''If we refuse to take into account the full cost of our fossil fuel addiction -- if we don't factor in the environmental costs and national security costs and true economic costs -- we will have missed our best chance to seize a clean energy future,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months.'' 
 Mr. Obama's remarks were made to a group of about 300 local business owners and economic officials at Carnegie Mellon University. He used them to reiterate his call to roll back Bush administration tax breaks for oil companies and to make a broader case for his administration's accomplishments heading into an election season. 
 He defended what he cast as his vision of active but restrained government against a conservative limited-government philosophy that he said had proved a failure under President George W. Bush, and he criticized Republicans in Congress as obstructionists.
 ''From our efforts to rescue the economy to health insurance reform to financial reform, most have sat on the sidelines and shouted from the bleachers,'' the president said. ''They said no to tax cuts for small businesses, no to tax credits for college tuition, no to investments in clean energy. They said no to protecting patients from insurance companies and consumers from big banks.''
 Republicans shot back quickly. Even before Mr. Obama had begun his speech, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip, issued a statement saying ''the president gives a good speech, but good speeches can't improve failing policies.''
 ''Out-of-control Washington spending,'' Mr. Cantor said, ''has created a massive debt, private-sector businesspeople -- small and large -- are preparing for additional tax increases, and the government keeps on growing.''
 Many clean-energy advocates have argued that Mr. Obama should try to take advantage of the national anger over the gulf oil spill to challenge Republicans on the climate change bill, saying that his best chance to get such a bill passed is now.
 Apparently eager to seize an opportunity to take the offensive after weeks of playing defense on the oil spill, Mr. Obama suggested that he was happy to engage in a major battle for the legislation in the coming months. 
 He described the ''inherent risks to drilling four miles beneath the surface of the earth,'' to fuel the country's dependence on oil. ''We consume more than 20 percent of the world's oil, but have less than 2 percent of the world's oil reserves,'' he said. ''Without a major change in our energy policy, our dependence on oil means that we will continue to send billions of dollars of our hard-earned wealth to other countries every month, including countries in dangerous and unstable regions.''
 The White House has been trying to stop the environmental disaster in the gulf, now in its seventh week, from consuming the second year of his presidency. 
 A day after disclosing that the federal government is conducting criminal and civil investigations of BP and other companies in connection with the spill, Mr. Obama did not directly criticize BP or the oil industry generally. Instead, he framed his agenda in positive terms, saying that the ''time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future'' and that the transition would succeed only ''if the private sector is fully invested in this future.''

HEADLINE: Oil Companies Weigh Strategies to Fend Off Tougher Regulations

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and JAD MOUAWAD; Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Obama administration imposed new restrictions last week on offshore drilling in the wake of the BPoil spill, officials carved out an exemption that received little public attention: Companies working in shallow waters, unlike deep-sea operators like BP, could again begin drilling for oil and gas. 
 The decision, which followed a furious appeal from lawmakers allied with the oil industry, represented a surprising victory for the shallow-water drillers in the midst of what could prove the biggest environmental disaster in United States history. And it reflected the intense lobbying efforts at work from all sides, as Congress and the administration consider ways to prevent another drilling disaster off the nation's coasts. 
 Environmentalists and their supporters in Congress, hoping to seize the political momentum, are working to push through measures to extend bans on new offshore drilling, strengthen safety and environmental safeguards and raise to $10 billion or more the cap on civil liability for an oil producer in a spill. 
 ''You don't want to let a good crisis get away,'' said Athan Manuel, the director of lands protection for the Sierra Club's legislative office, which is pushing for a permanent moratorium on new offshore drilling. 
 Oil industry executives acknowledge the stiff political resistance that they face. Despite the success of shallow-water drillers in avoiding a continued ban on their end of the industry, executives and industry analysts say the daily images of oil wafting onto the coastline will make it tougher for them to fend off calls for tougher regulations that extend far beyond BP and the Deepwater Horizon spill. 
 Bruce Vincent, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents both deep-sea and shallow-water drillers, said Wednesday that he was concerned about a ''domino effect'' sweeping through Washington, with new regulations now under discussion threatening to cut oil production, jobs and industry profits. 
 ''It's amazing to see the impact that one company can have for all sorts of other people,'' he said. ''When a plane crashes, you don't just shut down every airline in the fleet until you find out what happened.''
 The oil and gas industry is a formidable presence in Washington. It spent more on federal lobbying last year than all but two other industries, with $174.8 million in lobbying expenditures, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. 
 Political action committees set up by the oil and gas producers contributed an additional $9 million last election cycle to Congressional candidates, with Koch Industries, ExxonMobil, Valero Energy and Chevron leading the way, the data showed. (BP ranked 19th, with $75,500 in contributions, most to Republicans.)
 For decades, the oil industry had showcased and developed its latest technology in the Gulf of Mexico. But the spill now casts a pall over offshore oil and gas operations, just as the industry thought it had snatched a major victory from the administration, which agreed to expand oil and gas drilling earlier this year. 
 Rex Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil, admitted last week that the industry faced a huge challenge.
 ''The most difficult challenge confronting the whole industry at this point is regaining the confidence and trust of the public, the American people, and regaining the confidence and trust of the government regulators and the people who oversee our activities out there,'' he said in response to questions from reporters after a shareholder meeting.
 The industry was already grappling with the prospect of tighter scrutiny over some of its drilling practices even before the gulf spill. Congress has been looking at the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, where water is pumped at high pressure to break rocks and free natural gas, a technique that some environmental groups believe can pollute underground water sources. 
 Now the industry is facing a much graver threat as it seeks to determine how long the administration's deepwater drilling ban will last. The Interior Department said last weekend that all drilling activity in the waters deeper than 500 feet was to stop for six months. But some analysts fear the ban could be prolonged until a commission appointed by the president provides its conclusions. 
 That could extend the ban for a year, and the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group, forecasts that a longer delay could crimp future production by as much as 400,000 barrels a day by 2015. 
 As well as imposing a drilling ban in the Gulf of Mexico, the administration also halted new drilling off Alaska and Virginia for the time being. The announcement stalled plans by Shell to drill three exploration wells in the Beaufort Sea this summer. It also put off a long-awaited sale of new leases off Virginia for the first time since the administration lifted a longstanding moratorium on drilling in the Atlantic. 
 With the environmental damage growing from the BP disaster, the industry's most persuasive argument in trying to fend off tougher regulations may prove to be jobs. That was one of the crucial elements used by the shallow-water operators -- mostly smaller companies that produce about 20 percent of the gulf's daily oil production of 1.7 million barrels -- to earn an exemption from the new restrictions at the Interior Department. A spokesman for the agency declined to explain why the agency had reversed course.
 Representative Gene Green, a Texas Democrat who led about 50 lawmakers in appealing to the administration to lift the ban on shallow-water drillers, said he did not want to see 6,000 employees working in shallow waters risk being put out of work.
 But the political pressure on the entire industry will keep growing as long as the spill lasts, bringing with it daily images of soiled coastlines. 
 ''The oil companies know that if this is not resolved quickly, the well has been poisoned for everybody,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, a veteran energy economist. ''They are going to be painted with a broad brush. They are on the hook here.''

HEADLINE: Questions For Moody's And Buffett

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
When it comes to investing, stick with what you know.
 It's the kind of plainspoken advice that Warren E. Buffett, the legendary financier, has been dispensing to ordinary investors for decades, along with perennials like ''make money'' (duh) and ''stick to the basics'' (no fancy derivatives, please).
 Mr. Buffett famously sat on the sidelines during the dot-com boom and bust because, he said, he did not understand the industry well enough, and his holdings are dominated by household names like Coca-Cola, Costco and General Electric. 
 On Wednesday, though, Mr. Buffett testified that he did not know all that much about the credit rating market, even though the holding company he controls, Berkshire Hathaway, is the largest shareholder in Moody's Investors Service, one of the three companies that dominate the business.
 ''I've never been to Moody's,'' he said at a hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which is investigating the causes of the global crisis that led to the government bailout of big banks. ''I don't even know where they're located. I just know that their business model is extraordinary.''
 Mr. Buffett's remarks about Moody's business, of course, could be interpreted not so much as a plea of ignorance but rather as a rhetorical flourish meant to put distance between him and the company. He appeared before the panel under subpoena after first declining an invitation.
 Pressed to explain how it was possible that he did not have an intimate knowledge of Moody's operation, Mr. Buffett offered the example of another of his holdings, Johnson & Johnson. Citing the recent recall of some of the company's Tylenol products, he said that he did not know the inner workings of the drug maker's labs but that he had faith in the company's reputation for solid management.
 Likewise, he said that Berkshire Hathaway had 260,000 employees and at least one of them was doing something wrong at that moment. He just wished he knew who it was. 
 To that, Phil Angelides, the commission's chairman, said, ''There's a difference between that and systemic failure.''
 Moody's was the subject of the daylong hearing, held in New York, as part of the commission's examination of why rating agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch gave top investment grades to mortgage-related bonds that were later downgraded to junk after the housing collapse. Berkshire owns about 13 percent of Moody's, down from a peak of about 20 percent.
 Appearing for two hours of questioning alongside Moody's chief executive, Raymond W. McDaniel Jr., Mr. Buffett declined several times to say that Mr. McDaniel should have been fired for what proved to be inaccurate ratings. 
 He did say that Mr. McDaniel and Moody's were no better or worse at predicting the financial fiasco than virtually every other player on Wall Street. 
 ''The entire American public was caught up in the belief that housing prices could not fall dramatically,'' Mr. Buffett said. Moody's ''made the wrong call,'' he said, but he counseled humility because ''I was wrong on it, too.'' 
 Before the catastrophe started, he called the housing bubble a ''bubble-ette,'' he said, a term he now regrets: ''It was a four-star bubble.'' Mr. Buffett was the marquee speaker at the event, held in a large room on the second floor of the New School in downtown Manhattan. The hearing had the feel of a Congressional road show, including the ritual swearing in, as well as a raised platform ringed with blue bunting for the panel members. 
 Most of those testifying were former or current Moody's employees, and much of the day was spent exploring the pressures that analysts and managing directors felt to maintain market share against its competitors. 
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the former employees tended to be more critical than those still on the Moody's payroll. Mark Froeba, a onetime senior vice president, told the panel that the culture of Moody's was transformed after the company was spun off from Dun & Bradstreet in 2000. 
 Quickly, the quasi-academic atmosphere of Moody's vanished, he said. Analysts suddenly felt their first priority was to help the company maintain market share, not get the ratings right.
 ''Cooperative analysts got good reviews, promotions, higher pay, bigger bonuses, better grants of stock options and restricted stock,'' Mr. Froeba said in a prepared statement. Uncooperative analysts, he added, were often fired. 
 Mr. Buffett's large stake in Moody's has brought him an unusual level of criticism, largely because he has a history of denouncing practices on Wall Street that he considers reckless or geared toward short-term gains. 
 The commission's questioning of Mr. Buffett was not particularly harsh, though panel members were scornful, at times, of Moody's. Mr. Angelides said in his opening statement that 89 percent of the securities given a top triple-A rating by Moody's were later downgraded. 
 ''The miss was huge,'' he said. ''Ninety percent downgrade. Even the dumbest kid gets 10 percent on the exam.''
 Mr. McDaniel fell back on a defense that has been heard often from top executives at rating agencies: the drop in housing prices was without precedent and therefore all but impossible to predict. 
 ''We believed our ratings were our best opinion at the time we assigned them,'' he said. ''I'm deeply disappointed with the performance of ratings associated with the housing sector.'' 
 Mr. Buffett sounded his most sober note when asked by a panel member, Brooksley Born, the former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, if the derivative market was ''still a time bomb ticking away.'' 
 ''I would say so,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Study Cited for Health-Cost Cuts Overstated Its Upside, Critics Say

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
In selling the health care overhaul to Congress, the Obama administration cited a once obscure research group at Dartmouth College to claim that it could not only cut billions in wasteful health care spending but make people healthier by doing so.
 Wasteful spending -- perhaps $700 billion a year -- ''does nothing to improve patient health but subjects you and me to tests and procedures that aren't necessary and are potentially harmful,'' the president's budget director, Peter Orszag, wrote in a blog post characteristic of the administration's argument.
 Mr. Orszag even displayed maps produced by Dartmouth researchers that appeared to show where the waste in the system could be found. Beige meant hospitals and regions that offered good, efficient care; chocolate meant bad and inefficient.
 The maps made reform seem relatively easy to many in Congress, some of whom demanded the administration simply trim the money Medicare pays to hospitals and doctors in the brown zones. The administration promised to seriously consider doing just that. 
 But while the research compiled in the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care has been widely interpreted as showing the country's best and worst care, the Dartmouth researchers themselves acknowledged in interviews that in fact it mainly shows the varying costs of care in the government's Medicare program. Measures of the quality of care are not part of the formula.
 For all anyone knows, patients could be dying in far greater numbers in hospitals in the beige regions than hospitals in the brown ones, and Dartmouth's maps would not pick up that difference. As any shopper knows, cheaper does not always mean better.
 Even Dartmouth's claims about which hospitals and regions are cheapest may be suspect. The principal argument behind Dartmouth's research is that doctors in the Upper Midwest offer consistently better and cheaper care than their counterparts in the South and in big cities, and if Southern and urban doctors would be less greedy and act more like ones in Minnesota, the country would be both healthier and wealthier.
 But the real difference in costs between, say, Houston and Bismarck, N.D., may result less from how doctors work than from how patients live. Houstonians may simply be sicker and poorer than their Bismarck counterparts. Also, nurses in Houston tend to be paid more than those in North Dakota because the cost of living is higher in Houston. Neither patients' health nor differences in prices are fully considered by the Dartmouth Atlas.
 The mistaken belief that the Dartmouth research proves that cheaper care is better care is widespread -- and has been fed in part by Dartmouth researchers themselves.
 The debate about the Dartmouth work is important because a growing number of health policy researchers are finding that overhauling the nation's health care system will be far harder and more painful than the Dartmouth work has long suggested. Cuts, if not made carefully, could cost lives.
 Looking in detail at Dartmouth's evidence helps show why.
 Criticisms on Spending
 A main focus of the Dartmouth Atlas is comparing spending among the nation's hospitals. To do that, Dartmouth researchers use data on how much hospitals have billed Medicare for patients with a chronic illness who were in their last six months or two years of life.
 ''We show where the waste is in medicine,'' said Dr. Elliott Fisher, a physician who is one of the principal authors of the Dartmouth work and was a frequent visitor to Washington during the long legislative debate. ''If everyone could operate like Oregon, Seattle or the Upper Midwest, there's huge savings.''
 But the atlas's hospital rankings do not take into account care that prolongs or improves lives. If one hospital spends a lot on five patients and manages to keep four of them alive, while another spends less on each but all five die, the hospital that saved patients could rank lower because Dartmouth compares only costs before death.
 ''It may be that some places that are spending more are actually getting better results,'' said Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a professor of medicine and health policy expert at Yale.
 Failing to receive credit for better care enrages some hospital administrators. But for the Dartmouth researchers, making these administrators uncomfortable is the point of the rankings.
 ''When you name names, people start paying more attention,'' Dr. Fisher said. ''We never asserted and never claimed that we judged the quality of care at a hospital -- only the cost.''
 In interviews, administration officials acknowledged that the Dartmouth Atlas was far from perfect. Mr. Orszag says he does not rely on the atlas alone to prove that huge savings are possible.
 ''What I have repeatedly said is that a wide variety of evidence suggests there is substantial opportunity for savings, and the challenge is in capturing that opportunity,'' he said.
 Still, the Dartmouth work remains influential in Washington.
 Dr. Donald Berwick, nominated by President Obama to run Medicare, called it the most important research of its kind in the last quarter-century. In March, in response to the Congressional Democrats who would have otherwise withheld their support for the health legislation, the administration made a promise. It said it would ask the Institute of Medicine, a nongovernment advisory group, to consider ways of putting the Dartmouth findings into action by setting payment rates that would punish inefficient hospitals and reward efficient ones.
 But if that system penalizes big city hospitals like those at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and NYU Langone Medical Center -- which look profligate by Dartmouth's measure but may rank much higher by other quality indicators -- a battle over the validity of the Dartmouth work is almost certain in Congress.
 In fact, among health policy analysts, that battle has already begun. Critiques have been published in prominent medical journals, and more are on the way.
 Differences in Patient Care
 In interviews and extensive written comments, Dr. Fisher and Jonathan Skinner, a health economist at Dartmouth who works with him, vigorously defended their work. They berated what they described as ''a cottage industry in new studies trying to debunk our findings.''
 They say their critics fail to understand the issues and often make significant statistical errors. And they say even if they adjusted more fully to reflect differences in regional costs and patients' health, the overall effect on the atlas's findings would be relatively small.
 The researchers also say they have made some of those adjustments in some of their other published work. Many other health researchers say Dartmouth should be praised for highlighting the tremendous differences in how patients are treated and for emphasizing that patients often fail to benefit from additional care.
 ''Dartmouth opened our eyes to something that I believe is real and important,'' said Dr. Robert M. Wachter, a professor in hospital medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
 But even those who defend Dartmouth say that failing to make basic data adjustments undermines the geographic variations the atlas purports to show. David Cutler, a professor of economics at Harvard, likens it to failing to account for inflation when looking at gross domestic product. ''Nobody in their right mind would talk about G.D.P. growth without adjusting for prices,'' he said.
 In addition to their hospital rankings, the Dartmouth researchers have also done separate studies of how Medicare spending affects patient care regionally. A 2003 study found that patients who lived in places most expensive for the Medicare program received no better care than those who lived in cheaper areas.
 Because some regions spent nearly a third more than other regions without any apparent benefit, the Dartmouth team concluded that at least one dollar in three was wasted by Medicare. When applied generally to the nation's health care system, that meant about $700 billion could be saved.
 But as it began publicly discussing its research, the Dartmouth team often extrapolated beyond this basic finding. Not only do high-spending regions fail to provide better care, the Dartmouth team began to argue, but those regions actually offer worse care.
 In just one example of this extrapolation, Dr. Fisher, in testimony before Congress last year, summarized his and others' work by asking, ''Why are access and quality worse in high-spending regions?''
 And on Dartmouth's Web site, a question-and-answer section suggests that this interpretation is appropriate:
 ''The evidence is that higher utilization does not extend life expectancy, and might be correlated with shorter life expectancy, compared with lower utilization. Therefore, sending people with chronic diseases to higher-efficiency, lower-utilization hospitals for their care could result in both lower spending and increased quality and length of life.''
 While a few studies by other researchers have shown that more spending leads to worse health, some others have suggested the opposite -- that more expensive hospitals might offer better care. But many have shown no link, either way, between spending and quality.
 In other words, there is little evidence to support the widely held view, shaped by the Dartmouth researchers, that the nation's best hospitals tend to be among the least expensive.
 In interviews, Dr. Fisher and Mr. Skinner acknowledged that there was no proven link between greater spending and worse health outcomes. And Dr. Fisher acknowledged the apparent inconsistency between his statements in interviews with The New York Times and those made elsewhere, saying that he was sometimes less careful in discussing his team's research than he should be.
 In any case, the more-is-worse message has resonated with insurers, whose foundations now help to finance the Dartmouth Atlas. Dartmouth researchers also created a company, Health Dialog, to consult for insurers and others on Dartmouth's findings. Valued at nearly $800 million, the company was sold to a British insurer in 2007 and still helps to finance the Dartmouth work.
 Rankings in Wisconsin
 Last June, as Mr. Obama campaigned for his health care overhaul, he visited Green Bay, Wis., praising the city for getting ''more quality out of fewer health care dollars than many other communities.''
 Two of Green Bay's hospitals, Bellin and St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center, rank fourth and 11th within Wisconsin on the Dartmouth list.
 But again, Dartmouth ranks hospitals only by costs and number of treatments and procedures. A different picture emerges from work done by the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality, a voluntary group of health care organizations that uses both price and quality of care measures. In an analysis of heart attack care, for example, it ranks Bellin second, and St. Mary's 15th, among the 22 hospitals in the state.
 And a Medicare ranking based on its own data that shows how many people die after treatment for certain conditions -- statistics that exclude costs entirely -- puts Bellin fifth, but drops St. Mary's to second-to-last: 67th of the 68 hospitals statewide that were measured by both Dartmouth and Medicare.
 Do the Green Bay hospitals favored by Dartmouth really offer better care? Maybe not.
 Similar problems arise with Dartmouth's regional data. In Dartmouth's rankings, for instance, New Jersey comes in dead last because its costs per Medicare beneficiary are the nation's highest. And yet, for the quality of care offered in New Jersey, independent of cost, federal health officials rank New Jersey second only to Vermont.
 Researchers who have examined the Dartmouth Atlas numbers have found other flaws that can distort hospital rankings. Doctors at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, for instance, found that Dartmouth had failed to distinguish two different types of intensive care units the hospital runs. Dartmouth also might have overcounted the number of specialists examining each patient.
 The errors, Cedars-Sinai said, meant the hospital probably fared worse in the Dartmouth rankings than it should have. Cedars-Sinai's chief medical officer, Dr. Michael Langberg, said he had tried to discuss these problems with Dartmouth researchers but had thought they were unresponsive.
 Dr. Fisher said he had tried to address Cedars-Sinai's concerns. But he also argued that while the Dartmouth Atlas was not perfect, it provided useful insights into differences in the way various hospitals treat patients.
 ''For the past 20 years, my colleagues and I and now many others have been working hard to clarify the causes and consequences of regional variations in practice and spending,'' Dr. Fisher said. ''The work is challenging and more work needs to be done, but we have learned enough to help guide health reform.''

HEADLINE: Palmetto Political Passions

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
The political sex scandal spotlight is on South Carolina, which has hogged that stage so much lately you'd think it would be willing to give somebody else a turn. 
 Maybe there's something in the water. Or perhaps it's difficult to maintain marital unions in the state that invented nullification.
 Nikki Haley, a 38-year-old candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, has had an action-packed month. Sarah Palin endorsed her candidacy on the steps of the State House. She rocketed ahead in the polls. Then a blogger and former political consultant, Will Folks, claimed he'd had some sort of sexual relationship with her. 
 ''If you were elected governor, do you think questions raised about your personal life would affect your ability to recruit jobs to South Carolina?'' Haley was asked in a debate on Tuesday.
 This may have marked the first time in history that a candidate for governor was asked whether allegations that she committed adultery might be harmful to state economic development.
 By Wednesday, Haley, a third-term state representative, went up with a new ad in which she appears with her husband and says, ''I've seen the dark side of our state's politics.'' 
 A few hours later, another political consultant surfaced with a story about a one-night stand in Utah.
 ''But this is the second allegation in two weeks,'' said the moderator of another debate on Wednesday night, which was supposed to be about oil drilling. 
 ''I've been absolutely faithful to my husband for 13 years,'' said Haley, who attributed the charges to plots by an ''establishment'' that feared her fight for term limits and on-the-record voting.
 The American public has historically been pretty indifferent to allegations of sexual misbehavior by its elected officials, but you could understand why South Carolinians might be a little touchy on the subject. The governor they're trying to replace, Mark Sanford, not only sneaked off to Argentina to visit his lover, he failed to leave a contact number, triggering a mini-missing-person alert followed by a weepy press conference about his South American ''soul mate.'' 
 Haley's problems began when Folks, who had once been Sanford's press secretary, announced on his Web site that he and she had had an ''inappropriate physical relationship.'' 
 Questions abounded, not the least of which was: what exactly is an inappropriate physical relationship? Not as obvious as you might think in South Carolina. When Sanford held his post-adultery press conference he claimed that while he had ''crossed lines'' with a number of other women during his 20-year marriage, he had refrained from jumping over ''the ultimate line'' until he met the aforementioned soul mate.
 Clearly, this is a state that does a lot of sexual parsing. 
 Folks, who was also briefly Haley's political consultant, claimed that he was forced to go public because other reporters were working on a story about the relationship. That is the second most popular excuse for this sort of tattling, right behind, ''I thought we were going to get married.'' Since then Folks seems to have gone underground, although he released phone records showing that he and Haley spoke about 700 times over a three-year period, occasionally for more than two hours late at night. 
 The jury was out on who was telling the truth, but voters had definitely learned that Haley is a person with a lot of time on her hands.
 The new player in this drama, Larry Marchant, worked until this week for another gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer. (Bauer, who once compared the school lunch program to feeding stray animals, is pretty much a walking explanation for why Governor Sanford was never tossed out of office.) 
 ''You paid him,'' Haley said accusingly. Bauer, who looked as though someone had just hit him over the head with a mallet, demanded that everyone discuss the issues.
 The issues in the primary have basically been which Republican dislikes government most. During the Tuesday debate, Bauer claimed that illegal immigration was caused by lavish government welfare payments, which caused poor people to refuse to do manual labor. Haley bragged that she had opposed the federal stimulus program. The attorney general, Henry McMaster, who is currently suing to try to stop the federal government from bringing health care reform to South Carolina, attributed the failures of the state's public schools to teachers' being so busy ''filling out federal forms that they can't teach.'' 
 ''Here we are in this very poor state that needs help very much,'' said Mark Tompkins, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina. ''We're sixth in the nation in unemployment, and we're fighting about whether the federal government can help us with health care.''
 Government may not be the problem, but the people doing the governing could definitely use some work.

HEADLINE: Workplace Flexibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The studies featured in ''Families' Every Hug and Fuss, Taped, Analyzed and Archived'' (front page, May 23) examine the often-mundane daily challenges facing 32 California families. But their stories reflect a deeper struggle shared by millions of working Americans -- a struggle that is more significant than mere fussiness. 
 Working parents fight a daily battle to balance the demands of work with caring for children and, more and more often, aging parents. This struggle has typically been seen as an individual problem families must face alone. But in reality, allowing workers to succeed on the job without sacrificing family life has become a social and economic imperative.
 President Obama highlighted this at the White House Forum on Workplace Flexibility, which explored possibilities for restructuring the American workplace to reflect the realities facing our modern work force. As the president rightly said, workplace flexibility not only ''affects the well-being of our families ... it affects the strength of our economy.''

HEADLINE: For Nannies, Hope for Workplace Protection

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER; Andrew Boryga contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In a city of secret economies, few are as vital to the life of New York as the business of nannies, the legions of women who emancipate high-powered professionals and less glamorous working parents from the duties of daily child care.
 Those nannies, as well as other domestic workers who make possible the lives of New York's eternally striving work force, have long gone without basic workplace guarantees that most employees take for granted.
 That appears likely to change soon.
 The State Senate this week passed a bill that would require paid holidays, sick days and vacation days for domestic workers, along with overtime wages. It would require 14 days' notice, or termination pay, before firing a domestic worker. 
 The Assembly passed a similar measure last year, and lawmakers expect that the two versions will be reconciled and that Gov. David A. Paterson will sign what they say would be the nation's first such protections for domestic workers. It would affect an estimated 200,000 workers in the metropolitan area: citizens, legal immigrants and those here illegally as well.
 Albany has wrestled with similar legislation for six years. The bill that passed the Senate, 33 to 28, on Tuesday had faced opposition, largely from Republicans, based on additional costs to the employers and the extension of workplace protections to illegal immigrants. Advocates in California and Colorado hope that similar legislation will be introduced in their states next year, said Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
 Ms. Poo said the effort was driven by workers who felt that they worked in a ''wild west'' atmosphere because of the lack of standards.
 ''You have some employers that are very good and some that are not, and there is nothing mediating that relationship,'' she said. ''So early on, workers said, 'We need basic protections and guidelines so that we won't be at the whim and mercy of our employers.' ''
 Gueisa Alvarez, 40, a nanny for two decades, said she felt exploited by families early in her career, before she attained the confidence to stand up for herself. She said she hoped a law would protect new workers.
 ''It will inform them of things they don't understand as young women coming from some other country and just trying to make some money,'' Ms. Alvarez said.
 But among domestic workers, there are some doubts that immigrants lacking legal documentation would be willing to report violations of a new wage law to a government agency.
 ''If you are legal in this country, you will benefit from it, but if you are not, then I don't think it will do much for you,'' said Rhea Bolivia, who immigrated from the Philippines and works as a nanny for a family with two small children on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
 Once an employee is hired, state labor laws become enforceable, regardless of the employee's immigration status. Penalties have been issued against supermarkets, restaurants and other employers for failing to pay overtime to groups of employees that included illegal immigrants. The legislation would give the State Labor Department and the attorney general the power to enforce its provisions.
 State Senator Diane J. Savino, a Democrat who sponsored the bill in her chamber, said domestic workers and farm workers were excluded from New Deal-era labor protections to appease Southern Democrats at a time when most of the workers were black.
 ''The same prejudices that applied to them in 1935 have continued to apply to them both in federal law and state laws,'' said Ms. Savino, who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island.
 The potential for additional costs to the families who hire the caretakers is not clear. Many already voluntarily provide such benefits. Domestic workers are now covered by minimum-wage laws, and the bills would set no other mandatory wage levels.
 The bills would increase the risks of getting caught for employers who pay domestic workers off the books to avoid taxes. ''That's what we are trying to end,'' Ms. Savino said.
 But for nannies and parents alike, the legislation, if enacted, could well create a kind of baseline for negotiations over pay, hours and benefits. Now, the dealings typically leave both sides unsure of what is fair, and in the end, employers sometimes feeling guilty and employees feeling shortchanged.
 ''We are really looking toward healing the divide between employee and employer,'' said Sarah Fields, program coordinator at the advocacy group Jews for Racial and Economic Justice.
 The Senate bill would nullify the requirement of 14 days' termination pay if an employer ''acted upon a good faith and reasonable belief that the employee had committed assault.''
 But State Senator Andrew J. Lanza, a Republican from Staten Island, said he voted against the bill because it might cause some mothers to keep quiet about caregivers suspected of being abusive in their homes rather than providing termination pay and possibly having to explain themselves in court.
 ''I just think that's wrong when it comes to a parent-child situation in a person's home,'' Mr. Lanza said.
 The Assembly bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright of Harlem, would not require paid vacations, paid holidays or severance pay.
 Governor Paterson made public remarks last year saying that he supported the spirit of the Assembly bill. Lawmakers say his office will be involved in reconciling the two versions. Mr. Paterson's spokesman said Wednesday that the governor would not commit to signing the legislation until he could evaluate a bill passed by both houses.
 After going nowhere for years in the Republican-controlled State Senate, the Assembly bill was expected to be approved last June by the Senate, after it came under Democratic rule. But the hopes of domestic worker groups waiting outside were dashed as Senate business stalled in fighting among Democrats.
 ''We were literally there when the Senate came to a screeching halt,'' said Priscilla Gonzalez, director of Domestic Workers United. Ms. Gonzalez started her group, which now has 3,000 members, after seeing what her mother went through as a nanny and housecleaner.
 Ms. Alvarez, the nanny, said she came to the United States from Bolivia when she was 8. Starting when she was 20, she worked in a variety of unappealing nanny jobs, including one for a family that refused to give her time off to take her own daughter to a hospital after an injury.
 She said her current employer, a wealthy family with one child, already gave her a better package than what would be guaranteed in the Senate bill. But sitting among nannies at a Central Park playground, she said the lack of legal standard left many nannies less fortunate.
 ''I am one of the lucky ones,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Federal Response to the Oil Spill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Administration Opens Inquiries Into Oil Disaster'' (front page, June 2):
 Every time BP and the government describe their efforts to contain the out-of-control oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as ''untested'' at the one-mile depth at which they must work, they issue their own indictments. BP was permitted to explore for oil in the gulf at depths at which proven well blowout prevention techniques had not been used.
 From ''top hat,'' to ''top kill,'' to ''junk shot'' to ''cutting the riser,'' both BP and the government are engaged in nothing more than a series of trials to determine which of their experiments will succeed. 
 BP should have never been permitted to play Russian roulette with the Gulf of Mexico, the coastline and the economies of the gulf states. It's shocking that the federal government would permit any oil company to drill in the gulf without proven and effective contingency plans based on a worst-case scenario.
 Robert P. Silverberg Washington, June 2, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In ''Drilling for Certainty'' (column, May 28), David Brooks calls liberals' desire for ''more control over industry'' a predictably partisan response to the gulf oil spill and writes of our struggle to control ''an ever-expanding array of intricate high-tech systems.''
 Mr. Brooks articulates exactly why we need more, not less, effective government regulation. As ''potentially catastrophic complexity'' increases, the actions of a few individuals or organizations can profoundly affect the lives of countless others.
 Federal oversight offers the potential to protect us from the unintended consequences of shortsighted decisions by a handful of oil executives or investment bankers.
 ''There must be ways to improve the choice architecture,'' Mr. Brooks says. And he is certainly right. Systems ''too complex for any single person to understand'' should not be left to their own devices, but instead regulated by the government accountable to all of us.

 The recent mine disaster in West Virginia and the Gulf of Mexico oil catastrophe have a common theme, besides the fact that both resulted from our insatiable hunger for energy.
 That is the contrast between the before-the-fact safety violations for the sake of quicker profits and the after-the-fact assertions that the giant corporations responsible would do ''everything we can'' to salvage the situation.
 If the corporations had done everything they could to prevent the disasters, incalculable damage and loss could have been avoided.
 Anne Golden Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., May 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 ''Questions About the Gulf'' (editorial, May 31) asked ''whether the federal government should now develop its capacity to deal with a huge blowout,'' and said ''that could be expensive.''
 Why can't Congress create a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation type of agency financed entirely by oil companies to ensure that adequate safeguards exist -- an Offshore Drilling Insurance Corporation? Any company in the business would be required to participate.
 All industry members must have a strong vested interest in ensuring safety and pooling together to resolve problems quickly. They make enough profits that they can afford to pay for oversight.

 Re ''Once More, With Feeling,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, May 30):
 Where is it written that the president of the United States should be everyone's ''daddy''?
 We elected a president, and this one, for a change, is bright, articulate and coolheaded, and appears to work very hard to understand the troubling problems confronting the United States and most of the world.
 This country's leaders and its people are not participants in a TV reality show or Facebook ''friends.'' There are many serious issues to be addressed and we do not need a weepy, angry, emotional president ''feeling'' his way to solutions. It is a dearth of critical thinking, contingency planning and discipline that has brought us to our present sorry state.
 Barbara Hood Louisville, Ky., May 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 It's discouraging to see many calling for the president to ''get angry'' or show more outward emotion regarding the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. What would that accomplish?
 The president is not some puppet that must lash out as some in the public might find appropriate. He's the president. And you know what? He's acting like one.

HEADLINE: Home Buyer Commitments Rose 6% in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rush of home buyers trying to meet a deadline to qualify for a federal tax credit pushed the number of signed sales contracts in April to the highest level since October. 
 The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes rose 6 percent in April from a month earlier to a reading of 110.9. March's reading was revised upward to 104.6.
 The rise was the third consecutive month of increases, all of them aided by federal tax credits of up to $8,000.
 But the tax credits expired on April 30 and many analysts expect sales to decline in the coming months.
 ''Clearly, the race to meet the tax credit deadline has left the home-buying pipeline rather empty, and we fear that still high unemployment, heavy indebtedness and tight credit will mean that it stays that way,'' wrote Paul Dales, United States economist with Capital Economics.
 Evidence of a slowing market was apparent Wednesday when the Mortgage Bankers Association released a weekly report on applications to buy homes. Applications fell for the fourth-straight week to the lowest level since April 1997.
 Investors, however, seemed pleased with the April rise in pending home sales. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 60 points in early trading.
 The association's index provides an early measurement of sales activity because there is usually a one- to two- month lag between a sales contract and a completed deal. A reading of 100 is equal to the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started.
 Congress included a temporary tax credit to increase home sales in the $787 billion stimulus package signed into law a month after President Obama took office. 
 About 2.6 million households used the credit as of late April at a cost of $18.7 billion, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
 The biggest increase in pending sales was in the Northeast, where sales rose nearly 30 percent. Sales were up 7.5 percent in the West and about 4 percent in the Midwest. They fell 0.6 percent in the South.

HEADLINE: Mix of Politics And Banking In Spain's Woes

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
CORDOBA, Spain -- ''In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.'' 
 With this blessing, the chairman once opened board meetings of CajaSur, a Spanish savings bank controlled by the Roman Catholic Church that was one of the country's better-known lenders. But last month, CajaSur was taken over by Spain's central bank, which replaced the banker priests.
 ''There was no need to say more or go further, since we already spend plenty of our time praying,'' joked Fernando Cruz Conde, who was CajaSur's third-most senior director until it was seized. (He remains vicar general of Cordoba, second to the bishop of this historical Andalusian city.)
 Prayer, however, did not protect CajaSur from the consequences of its reckless lending to the real estate companies whose excesses have been at the heart of a Spanish financial crisis that now reverberates across Europe and around the world. 
 Many of Spain's savings banks, known as cajas, were originally pawnshops started by Catholic charities. The clergy gradually ceded control of most cajas to regional politicians, who were eager to use them to finance city projects. But the priests of Cordoba fought hard to maintain the banking powers they had held since 1864, even after a merger with a secular competitor created the current CajaSur 15 years ago.
 In most ways, though, CajaSur's woes are much like those endemic in the cajas, which control about half the banking assets in Spain. Local political parties in Cordoba accumulated loans from the bank totaling 87 million euros, or $106 million, over the last five years.
 More recently, with CajaSur maintaining its generosity toward borrowers while the construction sector plummeted, ''it was probably difficult to tell the bank to stop lending when your own party was relying on its loans,'' said Luis Martin Luna, a center-right politician who is also a former CajaSur director.
 This intertwining of politics and business is a big reason why Spain's government has taken so long to consolidate and clean up the cajas. Their troubles also largely escaped notice in the early stages of the financial crisis because prominent commercial banks like Santander and BBVA, which were subject to more stringent regulation, did not need government rescues like many banks in Europe and in the United States.
 Now, Spain's 45 cajas (pronounced KA-has) have been given an ultimatum to complete merger talks within a month, with the goal of halving their number. 
 But some economists favor a bigger overhaul, including opening up the cajas' capital to commercial banks and other investors. ''The only way to ensure proper governance is for the cajas to change their role and have real owners,'' said Javier Diaz-Gimenez, an economics professor at the IESE business school.
 For its rescue, CajaSur required a capital injection of 550 million euros, ending the church's control.
 After losing 596 million euros last year, CajaSur posted a loss of 114 million euros for the first quarter. Despite the takeover, this financial hemorrhage is likely to continue. This week, the first privately owned airport in Spain, at Ciudad Real in the central part of the country, was declared insolvent by a local judge. CajaSur is one of its largest creditors, holding 18.8 million euros of its outstanding loans. 
 CajaSur's banker-priests have long had a sacred-secular relationship with Cordoba's governing politicians. With 325,000 inhabitants, the city has been run by Communists or their left-wing heirs, Izquierda Unida, almost without interruption since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s. 
 ''We've been Spain's only Communist city, a place where everybody, including the church, seems to believe in relying on subsidies,'' Mr. Martin Luna said. 
 In Cordoba and the surrounding region, CajaSur's footprint stretched far beyond its 3,100 employees and 500 branches, largely because the cajas, instead of paying dividends, distribute about a third of their earnings to social works.
 Through such donations, CajaSur supported schools and housing for the elderly and disabled, hospital and university research, as well as museums and cultural events like an annual guitar festival. It was also the main sponsor of the soccer team and a shareholder in the printing works and city newspaper.
 And of course, Mr. Martin Luna said, ''CajaSur certainly financed church restorations.'' 
 Though it accounts for less than a percent of Spanish banking assets, CajaSur and its rescue echoed across financial markets, given the broader concerns about Spain's economy and the health of the cajas. Fears about the overall weakness of the cajas led depositors to withdraw a combined 21.6 billion euros in the first four months of the year, according to data published this week by Spain's central bank. Depositors took out 8.2 billion euros in April alone.
 But local residents do not seem particularly panicked about CajaSur's predicament.
 ''I've got faith in the system -- and that's not because I'm an ardent Catholic,'' said Juan Antonio Exposito Pelado, 81, a retired metals factory worker who collects his monthly pension of 550 euros from his CajaSur branch. ''I know the bank has problems, but I can't imagine them letting down a wretched old man.''
 Now administrators are combing through CajaSur's books before advising the next step -- most likely an attempt to sell it to a stronger institution.
 Politicians in Cordoba said that their findings could also lead to legal action against its deposed chairman, Santiago Gomez Sierra, and other former directors. 
 CajaSur's real estate investments, which were concentrated in the Costa del Sol region where many Northern Europeans vacation, may have created conflicts of interest.
 A current court case involves allegations of corruption by the management of Arenal Sur 21, a local property developer in which CajaSur had been both creditor and shareholder. 
 Father Cruz Conde would not comment on the case or detail the bank's operations. But he offered his own explanation for CajaSur's cozy relationship with local politicians despite the long conflict between the Roman Catholic Church and Communism.
 ''It's been easy to cooperate with Izquierda Unida and other parties,'' he said, ''because everybody knew that if CajaSur was no longer under the authority of Cordoba's diocese, decision-making powers risked moving elsewhere, perhaps to Seville or Malaga.''
 Indeed, CajaSur was rescued a day after merger talks broke off with Unicaja, a larger Andalusian savings bank based in Malaga. 
 Most politicians have condemned CajaSur's rejection of Unicaja after 10 months of negotiations. Still, few in Cordoba blame the priests for mismanagement. 
 ''Competence has nothing to do with being a priest or not,'' said Francisco Tejada, one of Izquierda Unida's City Hall representatives. ''Somebody with all the world's economics degrees can prove a disastrous bank manager.''

HEADLINE: Hopeful Outlook on Jobs Gives the Market a Lift

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Thursday as speculation that a jobs report on Friday would bolster optimism in the economy overshadowed concern about slowing growth in China.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had its first back-to-back gain since April. Dell rose 4.9 percent after its founder said he had considered taking the company private, helping lead technology shares to the biggest gain in the S.& P. 500. 
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold sank after saying that China's plans to curb growth would hurt demand for copper. 
 The S.& P. 500 rose 4.45 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,102.83. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.74 points, or 0.06 percent, to 10,255.28. The Nasdaq composite index rose 21.96 points, or 0.96 percent, to 2303.03.
 Microsoft and Cisco Systems led advances in the Dow. 
 ''The market is due for a rally, and the jobs report would help,'' said Don R. Hays, chairman of the Hays Advisory Group. ''Pretty much everyone is saying we're going to have jobs growth tomorrow.''
 The S.& P. 500 has slumped 9.4 percent from its high this year on April 23 as the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and slowing growth in China have threatened to derail the global economic recovery. 
 Stocks rose in early trading after jobless claims fell and the service sector expanded in May for a fifth consecutive month, indicating that the recovery in the United States was broadening. The Institute for Supply Management's index of nonmanufacturing businesses held at 55.4 for a third month. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
 The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits last week fell by 10,000, to 453,000, the Labor Department said. An ADP Employer Services report based on private-sector payrolls showed a gain of 55,000 jobs, below the 70,000 economists had expected.
 The releases came a day before the Labor Department's monthly jobs report. 
 According to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, the monthly report was expected to show that payrolls climbed by 536,000 in May, the fifth consecutive month of gains and the biggest increase since 1983. 
 Benchmark indexes slid to their lows of the day in midday trading as the euro tumbled as much as 0.8 percent, to $1.2153, near a four-year low of $1.2111 reached two days ago. 
 ''There has been speculation in the past day or so that the E.C.B. is going to have to roll out some kind of debt guarantee program,'' said Greg Woodard, portfolio strategist at Manning & Napier in Fairport, N.Y., referring to the European Central Bank.
 ''That signals to the markets that maybe the E.C.B. knows something that the market doesn't,'' he added, ''suggesting that conditions are worse than we know about.''
 Shares of Dell rose 64 cents, or 4.9 percent, to close at $13.76 after its chief executive, Michael S. Dell, said he had considered taking the company private. He is more than three years into a turnaround effort at the personal-computer maker.
 Abercrombie & Fitch gained $2.32, or 6.6 percent, to $37.58 after saying international net sales rose 84 percent in May.
 A gauge of raw-materials producers slumped 1.1 percent.
 Freeport and Codelco, the world's two largest copper producers, said China's plans to curb its economy threatened to reduce demand for copper; prices have fallen 15 percent in two months. 
 Shares of Freeport declined $2.87, or 4.13 percent, to close at $66.17, while Alcoa fell 11 cents, or 0.96 percent, to $11.37.
 Coal companies also declined on concern that demand from China would slow. Massey Energy, a producer with operations in three states, lost 2.2 percent, to $31.57. Alpha Natural Resources, another large coal company, lost 4 percent, to $35.81.
 The banking sector fell 1.2 percent. Wells Fargo dropped 1.1 percent, to $28.86, while JPMorgan Chase declined 1.1 percent, to $39.10.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 101 4/32, and the yield rose to 3.36 percent from 3.34 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Before the World Cup, An African Ideal Crosses Borders

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Maqongqo, South Africa
 As Rita Mkhize led the way through the nooks and crannies of the Maqongqo primary school, she admitted that she was not familiar with Coach Doc Rivers or the Boston Celtics. And she did not follow the United States soccer team, even though her school team had won several championships. (''They win all of the time,'' she said proudly.)
 She wanted to be clear, however, that as a school principal in this rural community just outside Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal, an hour from Durban, she was pleased to know that two American sports teams had adopted the Zulu word ubuntu as a rallying cry for their championship crusades. 
 Ubuntu seems especially well suited to team sports in that it describes an approach to life that is characterized by selflessness, sharing, unity and respect.
 Rivers and the Celtics, who began referring to the humanist concept of ubuntu two seasons ago, opened the N.B.A. finals Thursday against the Lakers almost 11,000 miles away in Los Angeles. The United States soccer team, which began invoking ubuntu during the Confederations Cup last year, is five hours away in Irene, preparing for its World Cup opener June 12 against England.
 For Mkhize, the significance of the World Cup is largely economic. ''We are excited in a way because we thought it will bring more economic opportunities,'' she said. ''Most of the people are not working. As it is now there are people who have got some opportunities. Some of them are selling flags on the road, they're getting a bit of money. Some of them have prepared accommodations for visitors, so they are going to get something from that, and then you meet new people. It's exciting.''
 Maqongqo primary serves 964 students, from preschool to seventh grade. The 22 classrooms burst with as many as 45 students each.
 Mkhize, who was born to the north in Nkandla, Zululand, has been the principal at Maqongqo since 2002, though she began teaching there in 1992. The concept of ubuntu has been part of her life for as long as she can remember. It was, she said, like the air, the trees, the rivers and the valleys. It was part of the atmosphere.
 Ubuntu is indeed a way of life, a way of thinking.
 Beyond being a catchy slogan or good-luck charm, ubuntu is a road map for how life should be lived. In South Africa, ubuntu is the reinforcement of its constitutional principles.
 In the Constitutional Court, ubuntu was referred to as a concept that underlies the foundation of the constitution. The court characterizes it as synonymous with humanness; social justice; fairness; the rehabilitation of offenders; the maintenance of law and order; and recognizing a person's status as a human being entitled to unconditional respect, dignity and value.
 ''Ubuntu is more than just a word,'' said Thobile Ngubane, who works along with Talent Mbeje as an interpreter for American students in the Fulbright program and who has a degree in business management and communication studies from the University of KwaZulu-Natal. ''It's more of a concept, an understanding that we are what we are because of other people.
 ''The whole theory is an ideal. Different areas of a person's life are affected by how they understand these concepts and how they understand sharing and giving opportunities.''
 My journey to Maqongqo was triggered last month by a letter from Joseph Napolitano, a student from New York University who describes himself as one of a small group of Celtics fans who were students and speakers of isiZulu.
 Napolitano spent last summer in South Africa through the Fulbright-financed Zulu language-immersion program.
 Napolitano was so humbled by the Maqongqo community and his host family that he wanted to find a way to give something back. Since the Celtics have had such good fortune with ubuntu -- winning a title in 2008 and reaching the finals this year -- Napolitano thought the team might consider a trip to South Africa, specifically to Maqongqo.
 In the course of my drive through South Africa from Johannesburg to Cape Town, to Port Elizabeth to Durban, the consistently expressed sentiment was that this World Cup would somehow accelerate the healing process from deep heart wounds suffered by so many for so long because of apartheid.
 ''We have a problem because we're becoming too Westernized,'' Ngubane said. ''The spirit of ubuntu is diminishing because people are more involved with themselves, and more conservative -- you do your thing, I'll do mine.
 ''As a 21st-century African woman, I'm feeling the crunch. I'm feeling like people are losing the spirit of ubuntu a little bit. That's why we try to come here to Maqongqo and show that in these kinds of areas people still have that spirit, it still exists, it still lives on. People are still willing to share, still willing to give.''
 That two high-profile American sports teams have embraced the spirit of ubuntu is heartening.
 The Celtics and the United States soccer team should know that they now have a strong following in the village of Maqongqo.

HEADLINE: New York G.O.P. Selects Candidate for U.S. Senate

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Closing out a raucous and at times contentious state convention on Thursday, New York Republicans designated Bruce A. Blakeman, a lawyer and former Nassau County legislator, their preferred candidate to run against Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand this fall.
 A second candidate, David Malpass, a former chief economist at Bear Stearns, also earned enough votes to qualify for the primary ballot. But Joseph J. DioGuardi, a former New York representative, failed to make the threshold, and said he would seek a spot on the ballot through a petition drive.
 That sets up a split between New York's Republicans and the Conservative Party, which has endorsed Mr. DioGuardi. In Democrat-dominated New York, it is hard for Republicans to win statewide office without the endorsement of the Conservative Party. 
 The outlook for the Republican Party was further clouded on Thursday when Carl Paladino, the wealthy Buffalo developer and outspoken candidate for governor, said that he would spend about $500,000 to mount a petition drive for a spot on the Republican primary ballot and to create a third party to attract Tea Party supporters.
 He denounced the choices of the two major parties, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who was designated by the Democratic Party, and Rick A. Lazio, a former Long Island representative, designated by the Republican Party.
 Mr. Paladino said they were mainstream politicians ill suited to the task of reforming state government. And he criticized the leadership of Edward F. Cox, the embattled Republican state party chairman.
 ''I thought the Republican process would be fair and open,'' Mr. Paladino said at a news conference. ''It wasn't. It was a charade from the start.''
 Mr. Cox spent months trying to recruit a high-profile contender to take on Ms. Gillibrand, who was appointed to her job by Gov. David A. Paterson and remains relatively unknown to voters. But the strongest potential Republican candidates, Rudolph W. Giuliani and George E. Pataki, stayed out of the race.
 After two rounds of balloting on Thursday, Mr. Blakeman, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for state comptroller in 1998, emerged with just over half of the votes of Republican delegates, making him the convention's designee. 
 Mr. Blakeman was also in the news, somewhat indirectly, last year, after his estranged wife, Nancy Shevell, became romantically involved with Paul McCartney. Ms. Shevell and Mr. McCartney reportedly plan to marry after her divorce from Mr. Blakeman is final.
 ''Ladies and gentlemen, I've traveled all across this state many times,'' Mr. Blakeman said after his designation. ''I think I've qualified to vote in every single county. People want change -- not the kind of change that was promised to us in the last election. But they want affordability, responsibility, accountability -- the principles of the Republican Party.''
 He continued: ''Don't punish businesses. Don't punish successful people. New Yorkers have not lost faith in America. They've lost faith in their leaders.''
 As for the governor's race, Mr. Paladino's announcement, which was expected, was bad news for Mr. Lazio, who faces a steep fund-raising gap with both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Paladino. 
 Mr. Paladino has had a bumpy candidacy, fraught with accusations that he has sent racially insensitive and sexually explicit e-mail messages to friends and business associates in the past. While few expect him to win a Republican primary, Mr. Paladino could serve as a spoiler if he remains on the ballot on a third-party line in November.
 Mr. Paladino said he was already looking past Mr. Lazio, and largely dismissed him. ''He doesn't have the fire in the belly to get the people excited,'' he said.
 ''The real demons here are in Albany right now, led by Andrew Cuomo,'' Mr. Paladino added. ''Andrew Cuomo and those who feel he is entitled to this office will be our immediate target.''

HEADLINE: A Jobless Rate Still Unaffected By New Hiring

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- After hemorrhaging jobs for months, the economy is finally starting to add them. Yet the unemployment rate is not really budging because of people like Regina Myles.
 Ms. Myles, 51, has been out of work for three years. After a grueling job search yielded 150 interviews but no offers, she simply stopped looking last fall. Then this spring, with a $3,000 government-funded grant to help pay for a training course at a local beauty school in this Chicago suburb, she began applying for jobs online and in stores again.
 ''I just know if I am given this chance to finish this course I can make it,'' Ms. Myles said after practicing a facial on a classmate at the International Skin Beauty Academy. ''I feel like it is my time now.'' 
 Millions of people became so discouraged during the brutal recession that they gave up the job search altogether. Some entered training programs to redirect careers; others focused on caring for family members. Some college graduates, despairing of their prospects, enrolled in graduate school, rather than hunt for jobs. 
 Now many of them are beginning to look for work again, encouraged by four consecutive months of job growth and reports of a strengthening economy. But the initial return to the labor force may prove dispiriting, since so many people are already chasing too few jobs. 
 Because the government does not count people as unemployed unless they say they are actively searching for work, many discouraged people have been hiding in the shadows. 
 Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, estimates about 2.4 million ''missing workers'' either left the labor force or did not enter it in the last 28 months. That is on top of the 15.3 million people who are officially counted as unemployed. 
 Although economists expect the jobs report scheduled for release on Friday to show that employers added perhaps half a million jobs in May, that kind of growth would have to be sustained for some time to absorb the backlog.
 ''The problem is if they come back into the labor force because they perceive that jobs are being offered again, but they come in at a faster rate than those jobs are really being offered,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
 In other words, just because it has rained for a few days does not mean the drought is over.
 In April, those people who started looking again helped push the unemployment rate to 9.9 percent, from 9.7 percent in March and close to this recession's peak of 10.1 percent last October. 
 If, as some economists predict, the unemployment rate edges up or remains stubbornly high, that could prove a political problem for the Obama administration heading into the fall midterm elections.
 To a certain extent, the bad news is also the good news. The fact that people are looking for work again ''is a vote of confidence in the overall economy,'' said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board.
 Ms. Myles, who speaks in a low timbre and is quick to smile, is trying to remain optimistic during her renewed job hunt.
 After a bitter divorce in 2007, she lost her job managing a tax preparation office that she ran with her ex-husband for eight years. To supplement $900-a-month alimony payments, she applied for everything from secretarial positions to fry cook at a McDonald's. She tried for so many jobs online, she said, ''I think my resume is on YouTube at this point.''
 Last fall, she thought she was finally close to getting hired when she was called back for a third interview for a clerical job at a pharmaceutical company.
 When it did not work out, she hit bottom. For weeks, she sat at home, crying and wondering how she would pay her rapidly accumulating bills.
 Around the holidays, a neighbor told her J. C. Penney was hiring, and Ms. Myles decided to dip her toe back into the job market. She still did not have any luck, but early this spring, she pulled together the application for a government grant to help pay for beauty school. 
 When she graduates in October, Ms. Myles expects her new skills will help her find a job. ''People have a tendency to figure out a way to do our beauty products,'' she said.
 In the Chicago area, which lost 360,000 jobs -- or about 8 percent of its jobs base from the beginning of 2008 through 2009, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics -- those re-entering the market confront a sobering landscape.
 At a job fair last week in Palatine, another Chicago suburb, Matt Landmeier, a recruiter for Just Energy, a local natural gas and electricity supplier, collected 110 resumes from a line of half-haggard, half-hopeful candidates. A majority told him they had been out of work a year or longer.
 Recruiters and economists worry that those who quit the labor force for a while will have difficulty competing with younger workers or people who have been out of work for only a short period.
 Even with a robust recovery that creates three or four million jobs in the next year, said Lawrence F. Katz, professor of economics at Harvard, ''most of those jobs will go to new entrants and short-term unemployed people.''
 That concern is not lost on Roman Landa, a former mortgage broker in Glenview, another Chicago suburb, who suspended his job search in frustration early this winter after applying for nearly 700 positions in three years. 
 Because he has been out of finance for so long, he fears it is getting harder to go up against younger workers. ''It's like a boxer who is closer to retirement thinking he is as good as he was when he was 20 years old,'' he said.
 Mr. Landa, 36, who stayed home with his six-year-old son for two months without looking for work, started searching again in April. He has a promising lead, but if he does not receive an offer soon, he plans to enlist in the Army. ''I need to take care of my family,'' he said.
 In some industries, the outlook is improving enough for re-entrants to find jobs. In April, manufacturers added 44,000 jobs, the largest increase since 1998. In Rockford, a manufacturing outpost west of Chicago, Donald Ritter, who was laid off 14 months ago, recently found a temporary job operating a machine for a hydraulics company. 
 Mr. Ritter, a boyish 52, had stopped submitting applications in the fall, when the want ads dried up. ''I was not applying for work because there was no work,'' he said. 
 Last month, he noticed an advertisement for eight immediate openings at the hydraulics firm, and pounced. He started there a few weeks ago at $13 an hour, a significant cut from the nearly $20 he was making a year ago. ''Essentially, I am just going to get caught up by the time I am supposed to retire,'' he said. 
 Ms. Myles, too, is discouraged by job prospects that will barely cover her expenses. But on a recent afternoon, she was determined not to lose hope again.
 After finishing classes at the beauty academy, she drove to a nearby strip mall and dropped into an outlet of Tuesday Morning, a retailer that sells closeout housewares. A manager directed her to a computer kiosk in the corner. 
 In response to the question ''What are your hourly rate expectations?'' Ms. Myles quipped, ''$4,000 an hour?'' but typed in $12. 
 Once she finishes beauty school, Ms. Myles figures that at the least, she can administer facials and wax treatments from home. 
 For now, she is on the hunt. After finishing at Tuesday Morning, she spotted a Barnes & Noble across the parking lot. ''I think I'll go apply there,'' she said, and sped off.

HEADLINE: Going Solar Is Harder Than It Looks, A Valley Finds

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ALAMOSA, Colo. -- The nightmare in the Gulf of Mexico, as oil spews unchecked from BP's wrecked well, makes this high mountain valley seem even more idyllic than it is. Energy here, from the sun, is free, abundant and clean. For generations of farmers, and the hippies in the 1970s who went off the grid with their sun-powered water-heaters, and most recently the large-scale solar companies that have come looking for a new kind of harvest in one of the nation's sweet spots for renewable energy, the sun is an anchor of life. 
 But perhaps nothing is simple or easy in energy, and the bitter fight over solar's future here in south-central Colorado is providing an object lesson that the path to a new energy future will not be without its own messy entanglements of politics, power and place.
 Jason Kirkpatrick's farm is a good place to start. 
 Mr. Kirkpatrick, like most farmers in the San Luis Valley along Colorado's border with New Mexico, uses lots of electricity -- $10,000 a month in peak irrigation season to power the pumps and sprayers for his potatoes, wheat, barley and alfalfa. But high costs do not ensure reliability: power comes into the valley at one point, over a mountain pass on lines that are old and near capacity. 
 Solar development also depends on getting the energy to more distant markets. A 200-acre solar field project is under construction about a mile from Mr. Kirkpatrick's house.
 That's where a proposed 140-mile transmission line, a billionaire rancher/hedge fund manager, and questions about who will benefit and who will be harmed by energy's trajectory, collide.
 The $180 million line, which has been planned for more than a decade, is meant to solve many of the valley's problems in one fell swoop -- more power in, more power out, more economic development in one of the poorer corners of the state. The billionaire, Louis Moore Bacon, bought the 172,000-acre Trinchera Ranch in 2007. He opposes the part of the line that will cross his property.
 Last month, the lead company in the power line project, Xcel Energy, said that delays in the project -- blamed on Mr. Bacon and his lawyers -- had undermined potential development of solar power in Alamosa.
 ''We may have to go somewhere else,'' said a spokesman for Xcel, Mark Stutz. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Bacon, Cody Wertz, said he believed the utility was reconsidering the viability of solar power for economic rather than legal reasons, and using Mr. Bacon as a scapegoat because backing away from renewable energy is not politically popular.
 ''If we're going to back up from solar, who do we lay that blame on?'' Mr. Wertz said, describing Xcel. ''Oh it's easy, the billionaire.''
 The state legislature in Denver added another wrinkle to the story when it changed Colorado's renewable energy statute this spring. The new law raised to 30 percent, from 20 percent, the proportion of their production that investor-owned energy companies must generate from renewable sources by 2020. 
 But the law also repealed a specific set-aside requirement for solar power, substituting instead a mandate that 3 percent of the power supply come from small-scale and locally produced and consumed energy, called distributed generation, which might be solar or might not.
 In any case, locally made and consumed energy will not require a giant power line to move it long distance. Xcel has said it will file a revised plan for its energy portfolio in June.
 Whether Mr. Bacon is to be credited or blamed for the shift in electricity's future here is equally a matter of local debate. 
 Some residents say that scuttling or reducing in scale a giant power transmission line could ultimately be a good thing, if it encourages smaller-scale development.
 ''The true potential is keeping the power generation local and keeping it small enough so that local economies can benefit,'' said Wayne Caldwell, chief financial officer at the Monte Vista Cooperative, whose members include farmers and residents.
 Others, like Mr. Kirkpatrick, 54 and a third-generation farmer, believe that the electricity line is crucial to the valley's future, and that powerful interests have once again gotten their way.
 ''The big guys can fight it,'' he said. ''We've seen that.'' 
 Small-scale solar energy production has a long history here. As far back as the early 1980s, farmers and back-to-the-land hippies, who still share and define the valley's culture, had built the highest per-capita concentration of home-based solar installations in the country, according to a federal study. 
 But at the nonprofit energy utility, the San Luis Valley Rural Electric Co-op, John R. Villyard, the company's chief executive, said that solar power -- whoever produces it -- does not really help with the reliability troubles he faces. In peak irrigation season, he said, farmers with thirsty crops cannot be at risk of having a cloudy day that does not produce enough electricity. 
 A truly dependable system requires more so-called base-load production, he said -- power plants producing a constant stream of electricity, which in Colorado mostly comes from burning coal or natural gas. Paradoxically, Mr. Villyard said that reducing solar's role -- if it leads to a smaller, less controversial electricity line that could actually get built -- might in fact help bring in the base-load supply he needs. 
 Meanwhile, complications of self interest, aesthetics and politics continue to swirl. Some farmers are negotiating to sell land for solar development, or eyeing their neighbors who already have. Mr. Kirkpatrick sold 320 acres to the SunPower Corporation, based in California, which is building the project near his home -- the $880,000 from the sale, he said, provided his mother with a retirement plan 
 A spokeswoman for SunPower said the project -- 19 megawatts, or enough to power about 14,000 average American homes -- would not be affected by delays or changes in the proposed power transmission line because the company had contracted to sell its electricity into existing lines. 
 But the crosswinds are still twisting the lives of people like Debbie and Sean Canada. The Canadas are not farmers, and so have no land to sell. Their neighbor, though, is selling land where he currently cultivates carrots, yards away from their back porch. This could reduce the value of their home by as much as 50 percent, according to a recent appraisal, Ms. Canada said.
 But she had heard in the last few weeks that the project had been delayed for financial reasons.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Offers Workers Aid for College

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Now on sale at Wal-Mart: college degrees for its employees.
 The purveyor of inexpensive jeans and lawnmowers is dipping its toe into the online-education waters, working with a Web-based university to offer its employees in the United States affordable college degrees.
 The partnership with American Public University, a for-profit school with about 70,000 online students, will allow some Wal-Mart and Sam's Club employees to earn credits in areas like retail management and logistics for performing their regular jobs. 
 The university will offer eligible employees 15 percent price reductions on tuition, and Wal-Mart will invest $50 million over three years in other tuition assistance for the employees who participate.
 Executives at Wal-Mart, the nations' largest retailer, said the company was not interested in entering the online-education field in a broader way. The point of the program, they said, was to help employees get more education and to build a better work force. 
 Even so, because of its size, Wal-Mart's internal changes often turn into industry standards, as with its efforts involving environmental sustainability. And with 1.4 million employees in the United States, even an employees-only program could have widespread implications.
 ''If 10 to 15 percent of employees take advantage of this, that's like graduating three Ohio State Universities,'' said Sara Martinez Tucker, a former under secretary of education who is now on Wal-Mart's external advisory council. ''It's a lot of Americans getting a college degree at a time when it's becoming less affordable.''
 Wal-Mart estimates that about 50 percent of its employees in the United States have a high school diploma or the equivalent but have not earned a college degree. With the average full-time employee being paid $11.75 an hour, it was unclear how many of them will be able to take advantage of the new program. With the work credits and tuition discount, an associate's degree for a Wal-Mart or Sam's Club cashier would cost about $11,700 and a bachelor's degree about $24,000.
 Wal-Mart made the announcement at an early morning meeting at the Bud Walton arena here, where about 4,000 employees were invited to attend events scheduled around the chain's shareholders' meeting on Friday.
 ''It's important because it reflects the kind of company we are,'' Eduardo Castro-Wright, who heads Wal-Mart's operations in the United States, told the employees. ''A company that says, 'Anyone who wants to learn, who wants to grow with us, who is willing to work hard to get a college degree, can do that.' ''
 The employees clapped and nodded as Mr. Castro-Wright explained the program (though cheers seemed to be louder earlier, when Mr. Castro-Wright said that gas prices finally seemed to be dropping).
 Jaymes Murphy, 24, a wireless salesman in a Wal-Mart based in Victoria, Tex., said he had been trying to take college classes while working, but found the scheduling difficult. But he said the program ''gives me the confidence that I can go and not have to worry about sacrificing one thing or another.''
 ''I can get my education,'' he said, adding that he would pursue his bachelor's degree online. ''The way the economy's working, the way all the companies are working, you've got to go bachelor's.'' 
 The program will initially allow about 200,000 employees in positions like cashier, department manager and distribution center unloader to accrue credits for training they already receive in their jobs. 
 For instance, a department-level manager, who receives training from Wal-Mart in areas like pricing, inventory management and ethics, would be eligible for 24 on-the-job credits, at no charge, toward a 61-credit associates' degree. A cashier would be eligible for six credits toward a 61-credit associate's degree or a 120-credit bachelor's degree.
 ''It came out of an awareness that the jobs in our stores are really good jobs,'' Tom Mars, executive vice president and chief administrative officer of Wal-Mart U.S. said in an interview, ''but if we want to make them great jobs, we really have to do something different to distinguish those jobs and our company from everyone else in retail.''
 When asked if Wal-Mart wanted to enter the online-education industry Mr. Mars said ''no, no.'' 
 Even so, Wal-Mart appeared to acknowledge its wide influence in a letter about the program to the secretary of education, Arne Duncan. 
 ''While there is broad agreement about the need for more Americans to attain college degrees, we recognize that there is a healthy discussion under way about the best way to get there,'' wrote Leslie Dach, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for corporate affairs and government relations. ''One of our aims with this program is to try some innovative approaches that seem promising, grounded in what is already known in the field.''
 He added: ''We hope in this way to expand the education and employer communities' knowledge of what works most effectively, so that policy makers, other companies and other stakeholders can continuously improve such offerings.''
 Wal-Mart executives said it decided to work with an online university instead of a brick-and-mortar school after surveying more than 32,000 of its employees and learning that most of them wanted the scheduling flexibility afforded by online classes. 
 American Public University, which is based in Charles Town, W.Va., is reviewing all jobs at Wal-Mart to determine which ones will qualify under the agreement. By January 2012, some 70 percent of United States employees will be in jobs that have been reviewed by the university, Wal-Mart said. 
 To be eligible for the program, employees must have been in the job at least one year full time, or three years part time, and must also score ''on target'' or ''above target'' on their most recent evaluation.

HEADLINE: Lehman Plans Auction Of Its Modern Artworks

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
 When it comes to untangling bankruptcy situations, art is often collateral damage. That's the case with Lehman Brothers, which declared bankruptcy in 2008, and its money management company Neuberger Berman. That unit's senior team has since bought it, but Lehman's creditors still retain a 49 percent interest.
 Lehman and Neuberger Berman had put together an art collection valued at more than $10 million: paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and installations by high-octane names like Damien Hirst, Gerhard Richter, Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami and John Currin. Now the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York is expected to approve a sale of artworks at Sotheby's in New York on Sept. 25. The proceeds will go toward paying off Lehman's creditors. 
 Lehman has sold some of its art since declaring bankruptcy but has held onto much of it until now. ''There was no need for a fire sale,'' said Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman Brothers. ''The economy is better, and this is a good time to maximize the value of the art.''
 The Sotheby's auction will include more than 400 works, many bought in the early 1990s. ''It's almost as if they had a crystal ball,'' said Gabriela Palmieri, a contemporary art expert at Sotheby's in New York. Citing Mr. Currin, Mark Grotjahn and Julie Mehretu as examples, she said, ''These artists were neither well known nor did they enjoy the celebrity status they do today.''
 Among the highlights of the sale is Mr. Hirst's ''We've Got Style (The Vessel Collection -- Blue),'' a 1993 wood cabinet filled with glass and ceramic objects. The work predates his famous cabinets filled with cigarette butts or skulls or dead animals or diamonds. ''This was a more poignant statement for what Damien's cabinets would become in the future,'' Ms. Palmieri said. She estimates it will sell for $800,000 to $1.2 million.
 The auction will also include paintings like Mr. Currin's ''Shakespeare Actress,'' a 1991 portrait based on a photograph of an anonymous woman that was included in a show at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York titled ''7 Women.'' It is expected to bring in $500,000 to $700,000.
 There are also photographs by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, including a group of five framed gelatin silver prints (from an edition of two) showing birds that seem to disappear into the sky, the artist's comment on the fleeting nature of life. The work is estimated at $350,000 to $450,000. And with ''Pure Beauty, a retrospective of the California artist John Baldessari opening this month in Los Angeles and in October at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, works by Mr. Baldessari may be in demand. So it is good timing that the sale also includes ''Stares (With Lamps),'' a 1986 installation. It is estimated at $350,000 to $450,000.
 MEL GIBSON TO SELL 'PIETa'
 Despite the absence of blood, guts or gore, ''Pieta,'' a large painting by the 19th-century French academic artist William-Adolphe Bouguereau, is owned by the action star Mel Gibson. And now it is a highlight of Christie's old masters and 19th-century art auction in New York on Wednesday. Although Christie's has not designated Mr. Gibson as the seller, art experts familiar with his holdings have confirmed that he is parting with the painting because he is in the middle of a messy divorce. Christie's experts estimate that the 1876 canvas, which depicts a haunting Mary clutching Jesus' lifeless body, surrounded by a chorus of angels, will bring $1.5 million to $2.5 million.
 After being overlooked by collectors for about a decade, the works of French academic painters like Bouguereau are once again popular. ''They are undervalued, and they are clearly very beautifully composed,'' said Nicholas Hall, an international director of old master and 19th-century art at Christie's. ''There are a significant number of people, particularly in America, who collect both old master and 19th-century paintings. These are no neophyte collectors.''
 ''Pieta'' has had a string of notable owners as varied as Prince Demidoff, a Russian collector who lived in 19th-century Italy, and Sylvester Stallone. It has also been on loan to several museums, including the Dallas Museum of Art and the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.
 Mr. Hall said he would not be surprised if an institution bought the painting. ''Some of the museums that have a painting by Bouguereau have an image of a pretty young girl by a pond,'' he said. ''This is a more serious work, the kind a museum would prefer to have.''
 MORGAN GOES MODERN
 It will be difficult to miss the Morgan Library & Museum's latest attempt to embrace contemporary art. From June 16 through Sept. 12 three large steel sculptures by Mark di Suvero will dominate its lobby and glass-enclosed atrium.
 This is a big step for the Morgan: the first time it has shown contemporary sculpture. ''It's an extension of our efforts in the area of modern and contemporary literature and art,'' said William M. Griswold, the Morgan's director.
 The genesis of the installation, however, can be traced to Renzo Piano, the architect who designed the Morgan's 2006 expansion. Shortly after that project was unveiled, Mr. Piano had said that some day he would like to see how sculpture by Mr. di Suvero looked in the new atrium. The sculptor and the architect are longtime friends, and last year they participated in a panel at the Morgan about the relationship between art and architecture.
 ''It's an opportunity to see these powerful, bold and somewhat brutal sculptures within the refined elegance of Renzo's architecture,'' Mr. Griswold said. ''This is as much an installation about art as architecture.''
 The Morgan is treating the installation as an exhibition and publishing a brochure. It is also planning to light the sculptures so that they will be visible to passers-by at night. ''It will look very dramatic,'' Mr. Griswold said.

HEADLINE: Cleopatra's Underwater Kingdom

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- It may be best to dispel any illusions immediately. The only certain images we seem to have of the last queen of Egypt, Cleopatra VII, have no discernible resemblance to the painted faces of Elizabeth Taylor or Claudette Colbert or Sarah Bernhardt. Those visages can be contemplated with far more sensuous contentment than the Egyptian queen's bulbous, knotty and eroded features stamped on gold coins from the first century B.C.
 But by the time we see the cinematic, romanticized faces of Cleopatra from films and paintings in the final gallery of the new exhibition ''Cleopatra: The Search for the Last Queen of Egypt,'' opening Saturday at the Franklin Institute here, we are prepared to acknowledge the virtue of at least some idealization. The wonder we feel is not at Cleopatra's beauty (which Plutarch reports was ''in itself not altogether incomparable'') but at the extraordinary cultural universe that preceded her and surrounded her before Egypt submitted to the Romans in 30 B.C. and Cleopatra -- Egypt's last pharaoh and the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty -- committed suicide. 
 The exhibition is powerful. But that is not really because of Cleopatra; it is because a lost world is resurrected here. There are some 150 artifacts on display, and the vast majority were found buried in the silt and clay of the Bay of Aboukir, off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. Since 1992 those waters have been explored by Franck Goddio and his European Institute of Underwater Archaeology. Using a nuclear magnetic resonance magnetometer, Mr. Goddio mapped the geographic fault lines beneath the clouded waters and has brought to the surface a small fraction of what lies below. 
 He has identified the relics and ruins as remnants of the ancient cities of Canopus and Heracleion, submerged by tidal waves, earthquakes and wars; he has also discovered palaces and temples of the nearby eastern port of Alexandria, the city that the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great made his capital, and that Cleopatra imagined could rival Rome. The first half of the exhibition shimmers in atmospheric blue light, the artifacts accompanied by videos of their excavation by red-suited divers maneuvering through opaque waters. 
 The sense of a lost and mythical world brought into the half-light would be irrelevant, though, if the resurrected objects didn't live up to the promise -- and they do. We are led through a sequence of discoveries, coming to learn along the way how the Ptolemaic heirs to Alexander's conquest created a hybrid religion and culture, Greek styles overlaying Egyptian allusions, transformed gods worshiped in new temples, ancient ideas given fresh, sensuous form. 
 Here, for example, from Canopus, is a great life-size head of the god Serapis that was mounted in his most famous temple; the Egyptian god Osiris with his healing powers is transmuted into a Grecian deity, his eroded face framed by flowing locks. The glories of Heracleion can be glimpsed in two towering 16-foot figures of pink granite: images of Ptolemaic royalty. And, even if we are not prepared to testify to Cleopatra's beauty, here is a third century B.C. statue of a queen, whose draped garment is sculptured to seem translucent, clinging to the textured stone flesh, posing an unmatchable challenge to even the most idealized image of Cleopatra. 
 Mr. Goddio has also put these objects into a geographic and cultural context, assisted by the University of Pennsylvania Egyptologist and guest curator David Silverman (who is also curator of the Egyptology section of the Penn Museum, which is offering a ticket tie-in with the Franklin show). Mr. Goddio has found stone pieces that nearly complete earlier finds (one of which was acquired by the Louvre in 1817). When fit together, as is shown here, they form a naos -- a stone shrine or ark that once held the temple god. Their carvings contain what may also be the world's first astrological chart, along with a creation myth not found elsewhere. 
 Mr. Goddio has also mapped the submerged harbors of these once thriving cities and found that a canal linking Canopus and Heracleion that, he suggests, would have been used in a ritual watery journey paying homage to Osiris's powers, connecting the newer religious celebrations with older beliefs in the centrality of the Nile. This was the realm within which Cleopatra (along with Julius Caesar and then Mark Antony) moved. 
 But because this exhibition, like the King Tut show now in New York, is a production of Arts and Exhibitions International, which has specialized in large-scale cultural attractions, it is meant to attract big audiences both here and in other cities in the United States it is expected to visit after it leaves the Franklin Institute on Jan. 2; the National Geographic Society is also involved. So there is a certain amount of slick packaging that comes along with the substance. My biggest misgiving is a sense that Cleopatra herself is a lot less important to these discoveries than it seems here. 
 There are some traces attributed to her, of course, aside from gold coins with her less-than-sensuous profile. We see fragments of a papyrus, on loan from the Neues Museum in Berlin, that we are told shows Cleopatra's own signature to a royal decree; she has written the Greek word ''ginesthoi'': ''make it happen.'' 
 Every visitor also gets an audio tour in which an actress speaking as Cleopatra recounts the oft-retold tale of her life and death while trying to explain the artifacts before us. Here too the temptation is to silence the story, which can end up distracting from the sights. It seems imposed on the actual objects rather than growing directly from their importance.
 Cleopatra's role also seems to be a bit overbearingly insisted upon in the last part of the exhibition, which is devoted to the excavations overseen by Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, whose patronage is required for any exploration of Egyptian antiquities. 
 Convinced by the arguments of the archaeologist Kathleen Martinez, Mr. Hawass says he believes that the tomb holding the remains of both Mark Antony and Cleopatra may lie not in Alexandria but in a temple near the city at Taposiris Magna. In a video he is far more definitive about the excavations there than the evidence we are shown fully justifies; more explanation is needed. But by that time there has already been enough justifiable excitement in the show, so suspicions of its inflation here do not really interfere. (Mr. Hawass may also be proven correct.)
 Besides, though Cleopatra is the selling point, the catalog for the exhibition, along with Mr. Goddio's discoveries, make it clear that notions of her beauty and power, and even Shakespeare's imagining of her clasping the slithering poisonous adder to her breast, lulling her to sleep like a nurse sucking an infant, are representations not just of an individual but of something larger. 
 Cleopatra saw herself as the incarnation of a god, in this case of Isis, the sister of the murdered Osiris. She finds his body parts, which have been dispersed through Egypt's waterways, pieces them together, brings him back to life, and ultimately gives birth to his child. It is an act combining creation, resurrection and procreation, and something of that creative spirit seems evident throughout the artifacts here. They are relics of an energetic hybrid culture that still inspires idealization. 
 In this show Mr. Goddio and his team have done something similar. Like Isis they have pieced together the scattered remnants of a long-lost world, resurrecting them from watery depths. In the process they have very nearly brought them back to life. 
 ''Cleopatra: The Search for the Last Queen of Egypt'' runs Saturday through Jan. 2 at the Franklin Institute, 222 North 20th Street, Philadelphia; (215) 448-1200, fi.edu

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Urges Banks to Do More for Small Business

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Thursday that banks needed to increase lending to small businesses to reduce unemployment and help the economic recovery.
 Outstanding loans to small businesses declined to $660 billion in the first quarter of 2010, from almost $700 billion two years ago, Mr. Bernanke said, adding that it was difficult to tell whether the decrease was a result of reduced demand or tightened credit standards. In any case, he said, increasing the flow of capital to small companies was crucial to the recovery. 
 ''While maintaining appropriate prudence, lenders should do all they can to meet the needs of legitimate, creditworthy borrowers,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's branch in Detroit. ''Encouraging lending to small businesses that are well positioned to pay is a positive, not a negative, for the safety and soundness of our banking system.''
 Healthy small businesses are critical to job growth but have a harder time expanding payrolls than large companies without sufficient access to credit, Mr. Bernanke said. He said only 40 percent of small businesses that tried to borrow in 2009 had all of their needs satisfied.
 In response to complaints from small-business owners, the Obama administration has proposed a $30 billion fund that would encourage community banks to increase lending.
 Thursday's event was one of 40 being sponsored by the Federal Reserve across the country. Findings from the meetings will be discussed at a conference this summer.
 Mr. Bernanke did not discuss monetary policy or his outlook on interest rates as he gave brief remarks and responded to several questions from local bankers and business owners. He later listened in on a discussion about the financing needs of automotive suppliers, a sector heavily populated with small and medium-size companies.
 Despite four consecutive quarters of economic growth, Mr. Bernanke said unemployment was still one of his ''important concerns.'' He spoke in a state with a 14 percent jobless rate, the highest in the nation. The national jobless rate was 9.9 percent in April. 
 Among the reasons that unemployment has not fallen more is that credit standards are in many cases still ''so restrictive that good loans are not getting made,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 He urged banks to examine loan applicants' businesses thoroughly and to ''avoid mechanical, automatic rejections'' based solely on the companies' industry, location or other negative factors.
 ''We've still got a long way to go, but I'm hopeful that we'll see improved conditions for credit going forward,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''The Federal Reserve views this as being absolutely central to the recovery.''

HEADLINE: Tennis Channel Starts to Get Noticed

BYLINE: By STUART MILLER

 BODY:
ROGER FEDERER, Justine Henin and the Williams sisters have all been upset at the French Open, but one major player seems to be on something of a winning streak -- the Tennis Channel. 
 The tournament begins the network's biggest quarter, with Wimbledon and the U.S. Open up next. For an independent channel that is trying to get the public's attention, these Grand Slams are vital, especially because many cable operators provide free distribution during each tournament, lifting the network to at least 50 million homes, from its typical 28.7 million homes.
 The Tennis Channel's ratings have continued to grow this year, both for its ''French Open Tonight'' programming, which is up 10 percent over 2009, and its live coverage, which was up 2 percent over Memorial Day weekend compared with the previous year, according to Nielsen. 
 ''A year and a half ago, we'd still get comments from people saying, 'Gee, I didn't know there was a Tennis Channel,' '' said Ken Solomon, the network's chairman and chief executive, who has aggressively pursued the four Grand Slam tournaments since arriving in 2005. Mr. Solomon, who had been president of the Fine Living Network, landed the French Open for 2007, added the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and last year the U.S. Open. ''The Slams get us a lot of awareness, and when our ratings hold up in that bigger universe, it can turn into more distribution,'' he said. 
 Enhanced distribution gets the network Nielsen ratings to show potential advertisers. Each Slam is showing year-to-year growth, and despite the recession, ad revenue grew 85 percent in 2009 and was likely to increase by a similar amount this year, the network said. ''We've added $100,000 sponsors, $200,000 sponsors and $500,000 sponsors, and we just broke through with our first million dollar advertiser,'' Mr. Solomon said.
 The free distribution that the network gets during the Slams is ''very important for its penetration,'' said Adam Arnegger, media director at Merkley & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group, which handles the Mercedes-Benz account, the network's first seven-figure sponsor.
 ''The acceleration of advertising sales mirrored the rights deals,'' said Gary Herman, senior vice president for advertising at the Tennis Channel. The watchmaker Longines, for example, signed with the channel when it became the French Open's official timekeeper in 2007. Mercedes began advertising on the network after becoming the official car of the U.S. Open in October. Besides Mercedes, other new advertisers include the racquet maker Babolat, Gillette, the Nook reader from Barnes & Noble and K-Swiss, the footwear and apparel company. 
 ''You can tell a lot about someone by the company you keep,'' Mr. Herman said. The small overall ratings might turn off low-margin, bulk sales advertisers, but the affluent audience appeals to high-end sponsors, he said. Other current sponsors include I.B.M., Capital One, Lacoste, ING and Pfizer. 
 According to Mendelsohn Media Research, a unit of Monroe Mendelsohn Research, the average Tennis Channel viewer's household income is $233,000, the highest of any network; the average home value is $541,000, second to Bloomberg Television.
 ''They are a perfect fit for us,'' said Jennifer Judkins, Longines's United States brand president. ''They absolutely deliver on demos, drawing both men and women.'' Longines has expanded to Tennis Channel programming, especially shows focusing on the stars' philanthropy, like a program about Serena Williams's work in Africa that will make its debut in July. 
 ''These are companies that are selective -- they're not advertising 15 to 20 channels deep -- and when they buy here, it helps create a snowball effect,'' Mr. Herman said. 
 But to keep that ball rolling, homes must be added. ''Success is all a function of distribution,'' said Derek Baine, senior analyst for SNL Kagan, a research firm. Distribution of the channel grew about 27 percent over the last two years, but 40 million homes is the next significant level, Mr. Herman said.
 Getting picked up by cable operators isn't enough, however. Tennis Channel executives have been vocal about not being relegated to the sports tiers of cable systems. ''They are right to resist,'' Mr. Baine said. ''The sports tier is the kiss of death.'' 
 But Mr. Baine said that a small network is a low priority for cable operators. ''There's room for growth, but it is a very niche network in a crowded field,'' added Brad Adgate, senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, pointing to new single-sport networks like MLB, NFL and NBA. ''It's not impossible, but especially for an independent network, it's harder and harder to do,'' he said. 
 Mr. Solomon said the network could increase awareness and revenue in the meantime by innovating -- as an early user of 3-D, for example -- and by focusing on other platforms. 
 Tennis is also well suited to the Internet, Mr. Herman said, because tournaments have so much simultaneous action. The network's Web site offers five live feeds of different matches during early rounds. Now, the goal ''is to figure out the best way to monetize content without hammering people over the head,'' he said. 
 A new partnership with the digital firm MediAnd offers one avenue. Alexander Taub, head of business development for MediAnd, said that after watching a segment on a player, viewers could scroll the cursor over a special toolbar for a link to buying that player's style of racquet or shirt. ''We share the revenue but don't charge for our service, and it doesn't cannibalize their other streams, so it has a lot of upside,'' Mr. Taub said.
 Mr. Solomon said that MediAnd's approach worked well for the Tennis Channel, because 75 percent of the channel's audience plays the sport. He said he was also exploring a new online business model melding advertising and ''micropayment subscriptions.'' While live matches would remain ad-supported and free, customers would pay a minimal fee, perhaps $1, for a package of every interview from a tournament or every Wimbledon practice section. The network would generate extra revenue by having one presenting sponsor for each package. 
 ''This way our sponsors online can get exclusivity,'' he said. ''This could be a serious revenue generator down the road.''

HEADLINE: She Has a Mayor by Her Side, But Politics Is Wooing Her, Too

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The two Republican political operatives had come from Washington to see whether Diana L. Taylor would consider running for the United States Senate. It did not take much prodding. 
 Ms. Taylor, the companion of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was not only intrigued by the idea, but also eager to delve into the details of a potential campaign and future career in the Senate. She mused about how much influence she could have as a freshman Republican in a Democratic-controlled Congress, and the kind of relationship she would have with the state's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer. 
 ''She was very serious about it,'' said Bill Paxon, a Republican former congressman from New York, who participated in the previously undisclosed meeting in March at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manhattan. 
 Ms. Taylor, 55, a woman known best not for what she has done, but for whom she lives with, is beginning to make unmistakable forays into New York politics, shedding her reputation as a glamorous sidekick and becoming closely watched in her own right. Her actions suggest that as Mr. Bloomberg enters the twilight of his mayoralty, the heir to his political legacy may be the woman he has dated for a decade. ''If she wants it, she has a political future,'' said John J. Faso, the Republican candidate for governor in 2006. 
 Not everyone was enthusiastic about the Senate idea: Mr. Bloomberg expressed reservations about her running, according to those close to the couple, in part because of the inevitable awkwardness that would accompany a senator and a mayor living under the same roof.
 Ms. Taylor ultimately decided to forgo the campaign against Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, though she intensely debated it with friends and advisers and quietly traveled to Washington to talk it over with the Republican Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, before making up her mind.
 She is now advising a young Democratic upstart, Reshma Saujani, in her campaign to oust an 18-year incumbent congresswoman, Carolyn B. Maloney, who represents the Upper East Side.
 Republican lawmakers, consultants and operatives continue to describe Ms. Taylor -- a former investment banker and state banking regulator -- as a ''perfect candidate,'' a ''grand-slam home run'' and a ''shoo-in'' for offices ranging from governor to mayor of New York. 
 Their enthusiasm, as overheated as it may seem, can be traced to her eclectic resume and a personal warmth that seems to stand out all the more against Mr. Bloomberg's sometimes chilly demeanor. (Even now, the mayor seems to recognize her popularity as a humanizing force. To demonstrate how safe city parks had become under his leadership, he told reporters this week: ''My girlfriend goes and walks the dogs at 1 in the morning'' in Central Park.)
 The daughter of a biochemist, who grew up in Old Greenwich, Conn., Ms. Taylor attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, Dartmouth College and Columbia University; started her career as an investment banker at Smith Barney; and decided, midcareer, to try government work. As an aide to Gov. George E. Pataki, she oversaw New York state's sprawling public authorities system, and in 2003 was named superintendent of banking, with authority over thousands of financial institutions.
 She has mixed with global leaders in the fight against poverty as the chairwoman of Accion, a leading microfinance lender, which has disbursed more than $23 billion around the globe. Speaking before her group in Ghana, the rock star and human rights activist Bono once cooed: ''Diana, you know how I feel about you. But don't tell the mayor.''
 Despite her ties to Wall Street, she emerged as an exacting watchdog as banking superintendent. Many of her crusades now seem prescient: She vigorously opposed a 2004 decision that allowed banks like J. P. Morgan and HSBC Holdings to escape state supervision. Her argument was that local authorities could spot abuses that their federal counterparts missed. 
 In 2006, two years before the housing market imploded, Ms. Taylor gave a speech warning that mortgage brokers were peddling exotic products to unsophisticated consumers that ''hide or bury information about the real terms of the loan.'' 
 Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions in the Obama administration, said, ''She was one of the early people pointing out the need to take action.''
 By day, Ms. Taylor hounded wayward check-cashing firms and money-transfer agents. By night, she inhabited the glittery world of black-tie charity balls, appearing on red carpets in body-hugging gowns by Oscar de la Renta and Ralph Rucci, and drawing the admiration of the Vogue editor Anna Wintour. 
 ''She has a wonderful style, which everyone notices, but underneath it, she is a very tough woman -- fair, but tough,'' said John P. Cahill, a former top aide to Mr. Pataki. 
 Her work for Mr. Pataki drew the attention of Republican insiders; both candidates who sought the party's 2006 nomination for governor, Mr. Faso and William F. Weld, confirmed in recent interviews that they separately asked her to be their running mate. That same year, the Bush administration considered nominating her to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 She left the Pataki administration in 2007, but her credibility with regulators has helped her navigate a new role she took on last July, as a member of the board of directors at Citigroup, where she has helped repair the bank's relationship with F.D.I.C. officials.
 Neither Ms. Taylor nor Mr. Bloomberg agreed to comment for this article, and details of her flirtation with a Senate run have remained hidden. 
 It began, according to those involved in the discussions, around the end of February, when Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from New York, raised the idea during a telephone call to Ms. Taylor. 
 Washington Republicans were convinced that Ms. Gillibrand, who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. David A. Paterson, was vulnerable, and they were determined to recruit a formidable challenger. Ms. Molinari, the wife of Mr. Paxon, had no doubt: Ms. Taylor could win. She had seen her work the crowds at parades in Brooklyn and Staten Island and charm the city's biggest donors at the mayor's town house. 
 Ms. Taylor agreed to travel to Washington, to meet with Senator Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Mr. McConnell, the Senate minority leader. Both senators encouraged her to run, pointing to her background in finance and her experience as a banking regulator. 
 Republican-sponsored polling revealed her potential attraction to both New York's upstate conservatives and its downstate liberals, and her place at the top of the city's social pyramid seemed to bode well for fund-raising. 
 Back in New York in March, Ms. Taylor arranged to speak with Mr. Paxon and his former chief of staff, Michael Hook, now a Republican political consultant. She impressed them with her command of the state's byzantine political system, rattling off the names of local party officials and far-flung flyspeck towns ''This wasn't a situation where you would have to introduce her to that world,'' Mr. Paxon said. 
 He recalled assuring her that, if elected, she would immediately become a national Republican figure. 
 Ultimately, however, Ms. Taylor decided that it was not the right time. She was not ready to disentangle herself from a long list of corporate and nonprofit roles, to crisscross the state campaigning nonstop for months or to expose herself to the unforgiving scrutiny of the national news media, which would surely descend on the race. 
 And there was the Bloomberg factor: The two have dated since before he became mayor, and though friends say they have no plans to marry, Ms. Taylor lives with him at his Upper East Side town house and travels with him regularly to his retreats in places like Bermuda and Paris.
 The mayor expressed misgivings about her running, according to two people who have spoken with the couple and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were intended to be private. A spokesman for the mayor declined to comment. But those close to the couple say that having a mayor of New York romantically involved with a senator who could influence the flow of billions of dollars to the city would create a potentially problematic situation. 
 Furthermore, the mayor, who prides himself on his political independence, might suddenly find himself asked about matters like his companion's policy positions and whether her campaign donors were seeking to influence city government.A registered Republican, Ms. Taylor embraces a philosophy that closely mirrors that of the mayor. She is socially progressive and fiscally conservative. She is fond of invoking Abraham Lincoln on the role of government (which she has paraphrased as ''to do for those who cannot do so well for themselves''), and she is infuriated by those who complain about Washington but do not have the stomach to become involved in public life. 
 She also shares Mr. Bloomberg's suspicions of career politicians. She has privately grumbled that some members of Congress have been in place too long and have ''forgotten why they are there,'' according to a colleague who speaks with her on a regular basis. That complaint seemed to spill into public view when she endorsed Ms. Maloney's opponent, Ms. Saujani, and wrote her a $1,000 campaign check this spring -- Ms. Taylor's first donation to a candidate. Since then, she has spoken regularly with Ms. Saujani about economic policy and campaign strategy.
 Her advice: ''Don't be a politician. Be a leader,'' the candidate said in an interview. 
 Friends suspect she will eventually take her own advice. Mr. Bloomberg is scheduled to leave office in three years, clearing the way for Ms. Taylor, who would still be under 60, to run for office. ''I get the sense,'' said Mr. Cahill, the former Pataki aide, ''that she would really like to do it.''

HEADLINE: A Star Regulator at the Fed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As finishing touches are put on the most comprehensive rewriting of financial rules since the Depression, a 57-year-old former law professor is emerging as one of the most influential financial regulators in the United States.
 For all the criticism of the Federal Reserve for failing to anticipate and prevent the financial crisis, the central bank and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, are emerging with vast new responsibilities to safeguard the financial system. 
 Alongside Mr. Bernanke is Daniel K. Tarullo, who was President Obama's first appointment to the central bank's board of governors, and who believes that re-engineering the regulatory system could soften the blow of a future crisis.
 ''I would characterize my aspiration as follows,'' Mr. Tarullo says in his characteristically professorial tones. ''That the regulatory and supervisory reforms we undertake will significantly reduce the incidence and severity of financial crises.'' 
 That is hardly a modest aim. Then again, the legislation on Capitol Hill envisions the Fed as a kind of supercop for the financial system, a backstop against the kind of extreme risk-taking that produced the financial crisis that reached a peak in 2008. 
 ''We need to do more than adjust our regulatory system,'' Mr. Tarullo said in an interview at the Fed's headquarters. ''We really need to redesign the system, but in doing so, to draw on regulatory tools that have developed over the years.''
 Mr. Tarullo, who blends an expertise in economic regulation with a passion for Faulkner and Eliot, took office eight days after Mr. Obama did, as the economy was reeling from the aftershocks of the crisis. He quickly won the confidence of Mr. Bernanke. 
 He helped oversee stress tests of the 19 largest bank holding companies, which helped them to raise capital and regain investor confidence. And then he set out to tighten the way the Fed's 2,800 bank regulators and supervisors around the country oversee 5,800 financial institutions, large and small.
 The effects of Mr. Tarullo's influence are rippling through the Fed and the banking industry. Within the 12 Fed districts, there is a greater awareness of scrutiny from Washington. 
 Mr. Tarullo is overseeing a review of bonuses and pay practices at 28 banks that is expected to be released shortly. And he has put in place two new regulatory approaches: reviews that look at risk-taking across banks, not just individual institutions; and quantitative surveillance, which marshals the Fed's statistical powers to ''identify developing strains and imbalances'' across the financial sector.
 The new faith in regulation, which is shared by the Obama administration, has its skeptics, even within the Fed. On Thursday evening, Richard W. Fisher, the outspoken president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, warned that regulation could do only so much. 
 ''The industry is unfortunately evolving toward larger and larger bank size with financial resources concentrated in fewer and fewer hands,'' he said, adding, ''We must cap their size or break them up -- in one way or another shrink them relative to the size of the industry.''
 But for now, the Fed and the Obama administration are siding with Mr. Tarullo's approach, which sees breaking up banks only as a last resort. Last year, after the Fed's director of supervision and regulation, Roger T. Cole, retired, Mr. Tarullo replaced him with a longtime Fed economist, Patrick M. Parkinson, who had been helping the Treasury Department devise the regulatory overhaul the administration would present to Congress. 
 The blueprint was the basis for the legislation approved by the House and Senate, which is about to be merged by a conference committee.
 Mr. Tarullo is also crucial in talks over the updating of the international rules that set out the minimum levels of capital large banks must hold. How those requirements, known as the Basel standards, are determined and enforced, will have a big effect on global financial stability.
 It all amounts to a greater role for regulators, whose failings were apparent in the last crisis.
 ''Understandably, there is some hesitancy to leave too much to the discretion of regulators, because regulators did not do a great job before the crisis,'' Mr. Tarullo said. ''But that consideration is balanced to some degree by a concern that if you specify rules or outcomes based solely on current circumstances, then three or five years from now, they may not be effective.''
 Mr. Tarullo said that a ''macroprudential perspective on financial regulation'' -- that is, a view of the financial system as a whole, not just a narrow focus on individual banks -- requires ''broad expertise in economic and financial markets.'' He added, ''There is no other agency in the United States government that has that breadth of relevant experience.'' 
 So for Mr. Tarullo, coming to the Fed after serving as an adviser to the Obama campaign was ''an easy decision,'' he said.
 ''I felt then, and nothing in the intervening 16 months has changed by mind, that difficult as the task is, the Fed was by a substantial margin the institution best positioned to effectively supervise the integration of capital markets and traditional financial intermediation,'' Mr. Tarullo said. 
 Mr. Tarullo is likely to see his role enhanced even further, given that the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, a 40-year Fed veteran, is retiring later this month. In addition, the Senate version of the regulatory legislation would create a second vice chairman's position at the Fed, to focus on regulation. Mr. Tarullo would ''be a standout choice for that,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 Born in Boston, the eldest of three children of a salesman and a homemaker, Mr. Tarullo studied English at Georgetown and received a master's in the subject at Duke. During law school at the University of Michigan, he says he became deeply interested in economic and regulatory issues. 
 From 1981 to 1987, Mr. Tarullo taught law at Harvard; in an influential 1987 article he argued that workers displaced by trade should be entitled to financial compensation and help seeking or training for new work. 
 It was a time of ideological tumult, and Mr. Tarullo was denied tenure -- a rarity for an assistant professor. He returned to Washington and was chief employment counsel to the Senate labor committee, led by Edward M. Kennedy. He later served in economic roles at the State Department and at the White House in the Clinton administration before teaching law at Georgetown (which gave him tenure). 
 ''Effective, conscientious and enthusiastic,'' said Daniel H. Zelikow, who as a Treasury official worked with Mr. Tarullo and is now executive vice president at the Inter-American Development Bank. ''He's a classic good-government guy.'' 
 Tall, with white hair and an angular face, Mr. Tarullo shares with Mr. Bernanke a scholarly demeanor that comes from years of teaching. He recently finished rereading Hawthorne's novels. His wife, Louisa, does research in early childhood psychology; they have two grown children. 
 On a shelf in his office is the funeral program for Mr. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who died last August after 46 years in the Senate. 
 ''He taught me -- all of us -- that you can and should fight hard for your policy views, but that those commitments should never stop you from trying to work with those who disagree with you,'' Mr. Tarullo said. 
 Among some Democrats there is frustration over the decision not to break up giant banks. 
 ''I am intellectually open to the proposition that the only way to achieve the optimal balance between financial stability and the efficient intermediation of capital flows might be to break up some of the largest institutions,'' Mr. Tarullo said. ''But given the uncertainties, I would probably be inclined to begin with other measures, such as more stringent capital and liquidity requirements for the largest, most complex firms.'' 
 And while Mr. Tarullo favors letting the government ''stop mergers among financial firms that would increase systemic risk,'' just as the government can halt monopolistic mergers, he holds the view that regulatory improvements cannot wait. 
 The government needs to seize the ''momentum for reform, which eventually will attenuate because people's attention turns to other things,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Lakers Put '08 Behind, And Celtics In a Hole

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- This was the type of game Lakers Coach Phil Jackson relishes, in which Kobe Bryant is not employed as an escape valve with the ball in his hands and the outcome on his shoulders.
 Bryant picked his spots -- a free throw here, a layup there, 3-pointers everywhere and even a couple of dunks from his 31-year-old legs -- as if he were leisurely leafing through a magazine while his teammates steadily bludgeoned the Boston Celtics, 102-89, in Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals Thursday at Staples Center.
 In the span of two years and on the heels of one game, the more aggressive team in this matchup was decked in gold, not green, thanks to the addition of Ron Artest, the inclusion of Andrew Bynum and two years of Pau Gasol's bad memories.
 Bryant finished with 30 points and emptied 14 of them in the third quarter, as the Lakers outscored the Celtics, 34-23, in that quarter to break the game open. Entering the fourth, the Lakers enjoyed an 84-64 lead and four of their starters had scored in double digits. Derek Fisher, the other starter, had 9 points. 
 ''We got it from different places,'' Jackson said. ''Guys chipped in at different times, helped us out.''
 Redemption weighed heavily on both teams before momentum swayed strongly in the Lakers' favor. Even the Hollywood fans got up out of their seats whenever Bryant finished off an alley-oop or Gasol topped off a fast break.
 ''Just being aggressive and tonight I got the benefit of the whistle,'' said Bryant, who also had seven rebounds and six assists, while making 9 of 10 free throws.
 The performance served notice to a Celtics team that had beaten the Lakers in 2008 to win their 17th N.B.A. championship. In those finals, the Lakers never held a series lead. Gasol was deemed soft in the interior against Kevin Garnett and Kendrick Perkins.
 On Thursday, Gasol amassed 23 points and 14 rebounds.
 ''I knew it was going to be physical, that's a given,'' Gasol said. ''This being our third consecutive finals, we understand the nature of the game.''
 In one telling sequence in the third quarter, Gasol turned around for a hook shot and bumped into Perkins, while the ball careered off the rim. Gasol grabbed the rebound and gained his composure before missing again and scooping up the shot and elegantly laying it in.
 ''If you heard what you couldn't do for two years, you're probably going to come in and try to prove that,'' Celtics Coach Doc Rivers said.
 Bynum did not participate in the 2008 finals because of an injury but was effective Thursday, three days after having fluid drained from his right knee. He and Gasol outrebounded Garnett and Perkins, 20-7.
 Paul Pierce, who led the Celtics with 24 points, was cloaked by Artest, and he never found consistent offensive traction. Ray Allen was burdened by early foul trouble and scored 12 points.
 But the Celtics bemoaned their defense, a strong character trait throughout their playoff run that suddenly turned into a weak link. The Lakers owned all the power categories: 16-0 in second-chance points, 48-30 points in the paint and 42-31 in rebounding.
 ''It was horrible,'' Rivers said of Boston's defense, adding: ''That wasn't our defense tonight. I can tell you that.''
 Meanwhile, Bryant skated around Boston as the Celtics appeared to just be on skates.
 ''Everybody knows he's going to shoot the ball,'' Pierce said. ''Everybody knows he's going to be aggressive. So we've got to do a better job of getting the ball out of his hands.''
 The Celtics trailed by double digits much of the game and never pieced together a solid run. Garnett could have pulled the Celtics closer in the fourth quarter, but he missed badly on two close attempts to the basket, and the Lakers answered with a layup from Lamar Odom.
 The renewal of the rivalry after two years happened much faster than the previous series, which came 21 years after the teams had last met in the finals. In all, they have played 11 times for the title, with Boston holding a 9-2 advantage.
 When this series is over, the teams will have won 34 of the league's 65 titles. As long as numbers are discussed, the Lakers will enjoy the one they can take into Sunday's Game 2.
 Phil Jackson's teams are 47-0 in playoff series after winning the first game.
 ''We've got a lot of work ahead of us, but it's nice to know that that's on our side,'' Jackson said.
 With all the history included, most involved are appropriately staying in the present. Rivers is like a parent who will not say who his favorite child is when asked to compare his finals appearances of two years ago and now.
 ''In some ways,'' Rivers said when asked before the game if the paths were the same. ''We have the same starters, but our bench is completely different.''
 When asked if the series held added significance on Wednesday, Bryant responded even more economically. ''No,'' he said.
 They arrived in different ways. Rivers assumed the Lakers would carve a path to the finals. The Celtics' bid appeared flimsy at times through the regular season, although he believed. Rivers told ABC that he collected $100 from every player and stashed it in a ceiling panel when Boston visited the Lakers during the regular season in February. The players could only retrieve the money if they met the Lakers in the finals.
 They got their money on Wednesday, and the officiating staff got its money's worth in the first half. The first half dragged through 28 foul calls and both Rivers and Jackson were forced to employ their benches early.
 Artest made a quick introduction in his first finals and helped inspire an 11-2 run by igniting it with a 3-pointer and layup. Bryant followed with a layup, and Fisher made a floater.
 The Lakers surged to a 50-41 halftime lead, sliced into mildly when Rajon Rondo nailed a 22-foot buzzer-beater as the second quarter expired.
 Rondo scored 10 of his points in the first half by sneaking through creases in the Lakers' defense and mostly nullifying Jackson's decision to initially defend him with Bryant.
 It took only a few seconds for emotions to flare in one of the series' most anticipating matchup between Pierce and Artest.
 Rondo began the scoring with a layup and on the Lakers' possession, Pierce and Artest fought for positioning and dragged each other to the court. Both were tagged with technical fouls, the beginning of what is anticipated to be an emotional series.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Told to Save Billions for Use in War

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has ordered the military and the Pentagon's civilian bureaucracy to find tens of billions of dollars in annual savings to pay for war-fighting operations, senior officials said Thursday.
 His goal is $7 billion in spending cuts and efficiencies for 2012, growing to $37 billion annually by 2016. 
 Every modern defense secretary has declared war on Pentagon waste and redundancy. And there have been notable, but relatively narrow successes, in closing and consolidating military bases or in canceling a handful of weapons systems. 
 But if Mr. Gates's sweeping plan is fully enacted, none of the armed services or Pentagon civilian agencies and directorates would be immune from the pain of annual cost-cutting, which would become institutionalized across the Defense Department. 
 The spending guidelines were delivered orally to senior military officers and civilian officials before Mr. Gates's departure this week for an Asian security conference in Singapore, and the official signed guidance will be issued over coming days.
 The goal is to force all of the Defense Department agencies and organizations, and all of the armed services, to save enough money in their management, personnel policies and logistics to guarantee 3 percent real growth each year, beyond inflation, in the accounts that pay for combat operations.
 Current budget plans project growth of only 1 percent in the Pentagon budget, after inflation, over the next five years.
 ''Given the nation's fiscal situation, there is an urgency to doing this, rather than shifting more of the nation's resources toward national defense,'' William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, said in an interview.
 Mr. Gates's spending orders offer a considerable incentive to the armed services. Each dollar in spending cuts found by a military department would be reinvested in the combat force of that branch, and not siphoned away for other purposes.
 Senior officials acknowledge that powerful constituencies are expected to line up in opposition to cuts of favorite programs -- with criticism anticipated from the defense industry, Congress, military headquarters, Pentagon personnel and retirees.
 ''We will need to address the reasons things are in the budget in order to be able to reduce overhead,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''We are going to have to be engaged in dialogue with industry, with Congress, with other agencies, with the White House and inside the Pentagon -- all the stakeholders.''
 The new directives are aimed at three distinct areas of spending. 
 The first is management and personnel, overhead, logistics and base operations, and support missions. 
 The second is the war-fighting accounts themselves. Major targets for the next fiscal year already identified by the Pentagon leadership, and supported by the White House, include canceling a program to buy an alternative engine for the F-35 warplane and ending production of the C-17 cargo aircraft. Officials said a range of lower-priority programs would also be under review. 
 The third area is Mr. Gates's own Defense Department staff and agencies. 
 Pentagon agencies that handle specialized tasks like missile defense and commissaries, as well as Mr. Gates's directorates for such matters as personnel and readiness, policy, intelligence and public affairs, will be ordered to reduce costs by trimming personnel and streamlining business practices.
 Mr. Gates set a deadline of July 31 for receiving details on programs and personnel to be cut and a description of savings in management practices to be included in the budget proposal for the next fiscal year, 2012. Two-thirds of the ordered savings must be an actual money transfer from noncombat accounts to the war-fighting budget, while one-third can be found in efficiencies and eliminating redundancies and overhead.
 The specific instructions are included in three unclassified guidance documents signed by Mr. Gates -- one to the armed services, one to the Pentagon's primary agencies and directorates, and one to the global combatant commands.
 For fiscal year 2012, the departments of the Army, Air Force and Navy -- which includes the Marine Corps -- must each find $2 billion in savings, while the rest of the Defense Department must find $1 billion in savings. By 2016, each military department must have $10 billion in savings, with $7 billion across the rest of the Pentagon.
 ''You are not going to be able to do it just on pure efficiencies,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''You are going to have to eliminate lower-priority programs. You are going to have to find headquarters that you don't think you need. You are going to have to find staffs that you think you can cut.''
 The drive for finding savings to guarantee real growth in spending on combat missions was first laid out by Mr. Gates in a speech in early May at the Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Kansas.
 Among the vexing spending problems identified by Mr. Gates was the continuously rising cost of health care. Mr. Gates said the nation owed quality health care to those in uniform, their families and veterans, but pointed out that members of the military health care system had not been charged increases in premiums for 15 years -- even though the program's annual cost had risen to $50 billion from $19 billion a decade ago. 
 ''Health care costs are eating the Defense Department alive,'' Mr. Gates said. Officials said that changes to the military health care program would be considered, but that no decisions had been made.

HEADLINE: Save Us, Millennials

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Timothy Egan is a columnist for nytimes.com.

 BODY:
When an electorate is red-faced and fist-clenched, when the collective national blood pressure is 160 over 100, when the big issues of the day are mired in tired minds, it's time to turn to the great, renewable resource of any vibrant democracy: the kids.
 The millennials, that echo boomer generation born after 1982, have not been heard from of late, ever since proving that they could pull away from their Facebook pages long enough to help elect a president. 
 The young were Barack Obama's strongest supporters, and still are, though there's been some slippage. They were wise beyond their years and ahead of every other generation on the major issues - from offshore oil drilling (not so fast), to gays in the military (duh), to tolerance of the new American ethnic stew (you mean that's still a problem?).
 But having done their part for history, and now facing a job market that is forcing many of them to become reacquainted with their childhood bedrooms, the generation born to all those baby boomers has become somewhat invisible.
 We've been led to believe that the grumpy, the cranky and the bitter will drive the midterm elections in the fall. You would never know, with nightly images of jowly Tea Partiers and their inchoate discontents, that people ages 18 to 29 years old made up a larger percentage of the 2008 electorate than those over 65.
 Because they gave their hearts to Obama, by an overwhelming margin, the young have a proprietary interest in this president. And now, at Obama's moment of peril, when people who are losing their heads want him to lose his, we need the cooler minds of a generation that grew up with endless wars and color-coded terrorist alerts.
 If anyone should be complaining about deficits, it should be the 20-somethings who will have to pay for all those meds-popping boomers moving into the comfort of Medicare and Social Security.
 If anyone should be upset over two long wars that were put on the credit card, it should be the generation shedding the most blood in those conflicts.
 And if anyone should take personally the poisoning of a vast ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico, it should the one cohort of the electorate that showed the most skepticism of oil companies and the strongest desire for a new green economy.
 Instead, at a time when most Americans described themselves as ''angry,'' the generation now entering adulthood is keeping their trademark optimism. A recent, detailed survey of their attitudes done by the Pew Research Center was headlined: ''The Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change.''
 Those are precisely the character traits needed for this age, and all the more reason why Obama should engage these voters for the upcoming election.
 For starters, consider what it would be like to have Mitch McConnell, the dyspeptic Republican from Kentucky who emerges from his turtle shell every two weeks to say no, as the next Senate majority leader. Or John Boehner, who called expansion of health care for 32 million Americans ''Armageddon''- running the House.
 Let Boehner take away from millions of fresh-minted adults the provision in the new law that allows dependent children to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26.
 Or look at the exhausted fight over gays in the military. More than any other generation, millennials see this as a nonissue. But a week ago Senator John McCain threatened a filibuster to keep gay men and lesbians from being able to openly serve their country in uniform. He is a man of his age.
 Can we just press the fast-forward button a decade or so into the future, or have McCain debate his eminently more sensible daughter, Meghan?
 Nor are the millennials afraid of immigration - in part because it's a family issue. Nearly one in four Americans under the age of 18 have at least one immigrant parent, according to a recent national portrait put out by the Brookings Institution.
 ''This is the most diverse generation in history,'' said Heather Smith, the president of Rock the Vote, a nonpartisan youth political advocacy group. ''They're also optimistic, and don't participate in the all the fear-mongering.''
 Obama could rouse this generation to help save the oil-choked gulf, much the way Franklin Roosevelt did with his youthful Civilian Conservation Corps. While still holding BP accountable, the president could set up a millennial corps of workers, calling on their sense of service, their desire for change, their youthful belief in restoration.
 Besides, with news that George W. Bush is now on Facebook, what better time to leave the digital den?
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Two Health Care Adversaries Find a Need to Collaborate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 AFTER squaring off as political foes for more than a year, the Obama administration and the health insurance industry have suddenly discovered that they need each other. 
 Both have huge stakes in the success of the new health care law. The political fortunes of President Obama and Congressional Democrats depend on their ability to translate its promise into reality for voters, by reining in health costs and making insurance available to everyone at an affordable price.
 Likewise, the financial future, indeed the survival, of the health insurance industry depends on the government -- on regulations being written by federal officials and on hundreds of billions of dollars in federal subsidies to the insurance companies to cover low- and middle-income people. 
 Rarely has the federal government gained so much influence over so much of the economy in such a short time. 
 Friction between administration officials and insurance executives is sure to continue. But to make the law work, people on both sides say, they need to switch from confrontation to collaboration.
 Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, predicted ''hand-to-hand combat'' with the insurance industry when she addressed the American Hospital Association five weeks ago. 
 Now, after a meeting with insurance executives last week, she is seeking a public-private partnership to carry out the law. She said she would ''look for opportunities to work with insurance companies while also keeping a close watch to make sure they treat their customers fairly.''
 White House officials desperately want to demonstrate that the new law is succeeding, preferably before midterm elections this fall. To fulfill public expectations, they need the cooperation of health insurance companies, the same industry reviled by many Democrats as greedy and amoral. 
 If insurers do not deliver health care to consumers at a price they can afford, many Democrats will renew their push for a government-run health plan, or public option, to compete with private insurers. 
 If premiums continue to soar, the administration could blame the industry, as it has in the past. But Republicans could claim vindication for their view that ''ObamaCare'' was deeply flawed and would not solve the core problem, the rising cost of health care.
 Insurers are trying to develop a new business model. They will be regulated somewhat like a public utility. Starting in 2014, they must accept all applicants and can no longer make money by selecting healthy customers and excluding the sick.
 Mr. Obama and his team, which includes at least three former state insurance commissioners, also face a huge challenge: how to regulate and work productively with an industry they profoundly distrust.
 Major provisions of the law, including a requirement for most Americans to have insurance, take effect in January 2014.
 ''You can't beat up on the health insurance industry for three years and then tell everybody that you have to buy insurance from these guys,'' said Robert E. Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a lobby for the industry.
 Carmen L. Balber, director of the Washington office of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group, said: ''The success of health care reform depends, in part, on the cooperation of the insurance industry. Insurers have endless opportunities to throw up roadblocks. If they try to hold on to the old way of doing business, it will be much harder for the administration to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable care.''
 Insurers will take on millions of new customers when Americans are required to carry insurance in 2014. Until then, buying insurance will remain voluntary under federal law, but consumers will gain many rights in the interim. People with the greatest need for health care are more likely to take advantage of these rights.
 Accordingly, insurers see the transition to a new, tightly regulated market as a perilous period. They will be expected, by the administration and by many consumers, to provide additional benefits without significantly increasing premiums.
 Insurers will soon be required to offer coverage to children with pre-existing conditions; will have to allow many young adults to stay on their parents' polices up to age 26; and cannot impose lifetime limits or unreasonable annual limits on coverage of ''essential health benefits,'' to be defined by the government. 
 In addition, new private plans will have to offer free preventive care, without co-payments or deductibles.
 Each of these changes could add incrementally to premiums, which already reflect the trend of health costs rising at least 6 percent a year. 
 Administration officials say they will be closely watching insurance prices and will not hesitate to challenge rate increases they consider unreasonable. And they will soon have a powerful new tool. 
 Starting next year, the government will require insurers to devote at least 80 percent of every premium dollar to health care (and quality-enhancing activities), rather than administrative costs, profits or brokers' commissions.
 The American Academy of Actuaries, a 16,000-member professional group, said this requirement had the potential to cause ''disruption to consumers in the individual health insurance market.'' Some carriers, it said, ''may seek to exit the individual market'' out of concern about the impact of the requirement on their existing business and potentially on their solvency.
 ''Much depends on how the rules are written,'' said Cori E. Uccello, a senior fellow at the academy.

HEADLINE: The White House Employment Agency

 BODY:
With one questionable phone call to a Colorado Senate candidate, the White House has again found itself on the defensive over its maladroit political operation. If it does not want a reputation as a full-employment clearinghouse for unapproved candidates, or further invite an investigation, the administration needs to impose some common sense on that operation -- and soon. 
 Last week, the White House was fumbling to explain why it dangled a presidential appointment in front of Joe Sestak to get him to drop out of the Pennsylvania Senate primary. This week, the controversy is over Andrew Romanoff, the former speaker of the Colorado House.
 It is true that Mr. Romanoff applied for a job with the Obama administration shortly after the 2008 election. But it was a full nine months later that the White House suddenly ''remembered'' the application for a low-profile job and brought it up with Mr. Romanoff, right around the time he decided to enter the Democratic Senate primary against the administration's preferred candidate, Senator Michael Bennet.
 There is a difference between trying to clear the field for a preferred Congressional candidate and doing so in the context of a job offer. One is a legitimate ploy used by presidents of both parties. The other prompts legitimate questions of legality. There is a law against offering government jobs to influence elections. The White House said the job in Mr. Sestak's case was nonpaying. In this case, it says there was no quid pro quo.
 The White House appears to have been careful to walk right up to the line without crossing it. But it looks crude and thoughtless and breaks President Obama's promise to play by a different rule book that does not include seeing how much his aides can get away with.
 The Obama team has also given the Republicans an opportunity to look high-minded on the issue, no matter how hypocritical their protests may be.
 When Mr. Romanoff entered the race, the White House suggests we believe, Jim Messina, the White House deputy chief of staff, just happened to remember that he had sought work with the Agency for International Development nine months earlier. Mr. Messina mentioned that there were two mid-level openings at USAID, and a higher level one, but made clear there was no guaranteed position in exchange for leaving the race. 
 The goal, according to a White House statement, was to ''determine if it was possible to avoid a costly battle between two supporters.'' Mr. Romanoff said he preferred to stay in the primary, which is in August.
 President Obama was unaware of the circumstances of the discussions with Mr. Romanoff, the White House said. It would be a good idea for him quickly to become much more aware of what his political operatives are doing, and to make it clear that he does not tolerate even a hint of improper use of White House power.

HEADLINE: Call for Stress Test Lacks Credibility

BYLINE: By ROB COX, RICHARD BEALES and NEIL COLLINS

 BODY:
CORRECTION AND EDITORS' NOTE APPENDED
Timothy F. Geithner can't put his money where his mouth is. The Treasury secretary, who is to join G-20 finance ministers Friday and Saturday in Busan, South Korea, has lately been urging other countries to conduct bank stress tests. But his credibility falls short in at least one important respect: future tests are absent from America's financial regulatory overhaul.
Mr. Geithner's message is spot on. Subjecting America's 19 biggest banks to tough analysis, disclosing the results and requiring subsequent capital increases helped draw a line under the financial panic. The exercise gave comfort to customers and regulators about the health of the banking system and led to an increase of nearly $200 billion in new bank capital. 
Bank stocks, as measured by the KBW Bank Index, haven't looked back since the results of the tests were revealed just over a year ago. Even after recent market tumbles, the index is up 15 percent. By contrast, a comparable index of European bank stocks compiled by Dow Jones is down about 3 percent. Worries persist about the adequacy of their capital cushions, especially with Greece's finances in such a mess.
There are big institutional obstacles to replicating the stress tests in Europe. There's no central regulator like the Federal Reserve, which oversaw the American tests. Nor is there a reservoir of cash, like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to backstop any banks that do not attract private capital.
Beyond these problems with Mr. Geithner's exhortations, however, lies a potentially greater sticking point. Neither of the two versions of regulatory legislation now being reconciled in Congress requires last year's stress tests to be repeated. G-20 colleagues may suspect America doesn't want another dose of the medicine it is prescribing.
Meanwhile, the G-20's broader good intentions to coordinate regulation across borders are looking flaky, too. From the United States' plan to make it hard for banks to engage in proprietary trading to the European Union's tougher regulation of hedge funds and Germany's ban on certain kinds of short-selling, plenty of unilateralism is in evidence. Put it all together, and Mr. Geithner's stress test sermons may lack the moral force to stir his listeners.
Divide and Suffer
BP and Prudential are two of Britain's biggest and most respected companies. Both boast of their compliance with Britain's code of corporate governance, which encourages boardroom debate to avoid bad decisions, heightens the chairman's influence, and insists that he not also be the chief executive, lest one person become too powerful. But in neither case is it delivering the right results.
At the oil giant BP, a powerful chairman in the shape of Peter D. Sutherland was replaced in January by Carl-Henric Svanberg, formerly chief executive of Ericsson. Mr. Svanberg has turned out to be the invisible man at BP. In normal times, this might not matter much. But as the company's oil spill pollutes the gulf coastline of the United States, it's a public relations disaster. In a crisis, the chairman must be seen to be involved -- and to be supporting his chief executive.
Unfortunately the chief executive, Tony Hayward, is not media-friendly either. He is only starting to show that he grasps the severity of the crisis facing BP. The chairman and board seem to be further behind.
The governance failure at Prudential, the British insurance group (unrelated to Prudential Financial), has produced a different sort of corporate disaster. The chairman, Harvey McGrath, has indeed stood right beside the chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, throughout the doomed effort to buy A.I.A., the Asian insurance business of American International Group. The Pru's board is full of luminaries. Yet they allowed an untried executive team to offer too high a price for a business the Pru could not afford, and the deal collapsed.
There is no simple recipe. In the United States, where chairmen are usually also chief executives, there's no shortage of failures either. Think of Enron or Lehman Brothers, for example. Britain's division of responsibility can work -- but clearly hasn't for BP and the Pru. In a crisis, having a strong personality in charge can make all the difference. Unfortunately, chief executives and chairmen who are the right men for all seasons do not yet exist.

Correction: June 8, 2010, Tuesday
A report in the Reuters Breakingviews column on Friday about Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's urging of other countries to conduct bank stress tests misstated the prospects for such tests in the financial regulatory overhaul under consideration in the United States Congress. Bills passed by both the House and Senate envisage future stress tests, though their scope and level of public disclosure is not specified; such tests are not ''absent from America's financial reforms.''
Editors' Note: October 20, 2010, Wednesday
Reuters Breakingviews, a news service whose market analysis articles are published in the business pages of The Times, has identified several past articles in which a writer had a financial interest in the subject or traded in related investments before or after publication. Three of those articles appeared in The Times: on June 4, about BP; and on March 9 and last Dec. 28, involving Lloyds Banking Group. The Times prohibits staff reporters and editors from owning stock or having any other financial interest in a company that they cover, and Reuters said the articles in question also violated its own rules on conflicts of interest. The Times would not have published the articles if editors had known of the conflict.

HEADLINE: Salary Cap Is a Threat to Hawks' Continued Success

BYLINE: By DAN McGRATH

 BODY:
The Blackhawks hold a 2-1 lead over the Philadelphia Flyers going into Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals in Philadelphia tonight. If the Hawks end their 49-year championship drought and hoist the Cup in the next few days, their fans should take a picture of the celebration and cherish the memory. 
 The team could have a markedly different look in its pursuit of the National Hockey League's grand prize next season, and it will continue to change in years to come as the Hawks deal with the N.H.L.'s economic system, which discourages the creation of dynasties. 
''I wish we could keep this group together because they're really good kids as well as good players,'' said Stan Bowman, the Hawks general manager. ''But it's not possible under the current system. There will be changes.''
 Goaltender Antti Niemi, who has emerged as a star while backstopping the playoff run, is one of several Hawks with an expiring contract. Salary-cap restrictions will probably prevent the team from retaining all those players. ''There are hockey decisions and there are business decisions,'' Coach Joel Quenneville said. ''They don't always run together.'' 
 Player movement is a fact of life in professional sports. In recent seasons, the New England Patriots have lost the all-pros Richard Seymour and Ty Law and several other starters from their Super Bowl rosters. Marian Hossa jumped from the Pittsburgh Penguins to the Detroit Red Wings to the Blackhawks over the last three years and wound up in the Stanley Cup finals with each team.
 N.H.L. owners were seeking cost certainty when they endured a lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season. The resulting collective-bargaining agreement guaranteed the players between 54 percent and 57 percent of leaguewide revenue but imposed a strict cap on payrolls. The cap was $56.8 million this season, and it's not likely to grow much, if at all, next season, league officials said. The Blackhawks are right on it.
 ''If you have a good year, everybody gets a raise,'' said Bowman, who will work with team president John McDonough to try to keep the Hawks intact.. ''If you're at the salary cap, you can't give everybody raises. The system we're under allows for quick improvement but works against teams with a lot of talent because you can't pay everybody.''
 The Hawks were far-sighted in locking up young core players, like Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane and Duncan Keith with long-term, cap-friendly contract extensions in December. Hossa, Patrick Sharp, Dave Bolland and Kris Versteeg, all top-of-the-line contributors, are under contract for at least the next two years; Brent Seabrook and Dustin Byfuglien for another year.
 But they're at risk of losing Niemi and Niklas Hjalmarsson, a standout defenseman, and significant role players Andrew Ladd, John Madden, Adam Burish and Ben Eager unless they can create the financial flexibility to retain them. Collectively, they provide lineup depth few other N.H.L. teams can match.
 Niemi, 26, supplanted Cristobal Huet in March. ''He's given us a chance to win every night,'' Bowman said. A restricted free agent, Niemi made $826,875 this season. Under collective-bargaining rules, the Hawks have to offer him a 5-percent raise -- to $868,218 -- to retain the rights to him, enabling them to match any offer he receives on the open market. If they choose not to match, they will receive draft-choice compensation.
 Huet, 34, has two years at $5,625,000 per year remaining on the free-agent contract he signed before last season. The Hawks would love to find a taker for Huet, but N.H.L. rules don't allow them to pay part of his salary, as is frequently done in baseball when a team wants to move a bad contract. They could buy him out for roughly two-thirds of the contract's existing value, with the cap hit lingering for twice its remaining length.
 ''We'll dive in on that in the summer,'' Bowman said.
 Hjalmarsson, 23, made $660,000 this season. Like Niemi, he is a restricted free agent. A smaller base salary entitles him to a 10-percent raise in a qualifying offer, to $726,000. Ladd ($1,650,000 this season) and Eager ($950,000) also are restricted free agents. Madden ($2,750,000) and Burish ($725,000) are unrestricted, meaning they can sign elsewhere with no compensation to the Hawks.
 ''Some guys might take less money to play here because of what we've got going -- John Madden did,'' Bowman said. ''We take care of our players. Rocky Wirtz and John McDonough have given us the resources to become a destination franchise.''
 Jeremy Roenick, a hockey analyst for NBC and a former Blackhawk, agrees.
 ''Chicago has a good young team with a lot of talent and leadership, but keeping it together, they're in trouble there,'' he said. ''They have too much talent. There's no way they can keep it all unless the wise guys meet them in a back alley somewhere and convince them it's in their best interests to stay.''

HEADLINE: Daley Takes Center Stage As Patron of the Arts

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
Chicago's most theatrical politician must have wished he had been on stage at the Cadillac Palace Thursday morning, given how the A-list of the theater community convened to pay homage to an elected official.
 But that politician, former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, was stuck a few blocks away, preparing for jury selection in his self-produced legal drama. Instead, it was Mayor Richard M. Daley basking in the plaudits, a testament to the relevance of real performance, not mere acting.
The downtown Chicago Theater District honored Mr. Daley on its 10th anniversary, led by Broadway in Chicago, the potent operator of downtown theaters, as well as by the Goodman Theatre and the 250-theater Chicago League of Theatres. The celebratory tone came amid the mayor's difficult year, replete with an awful economy, budget travails, the suicide of a top ally and his lowest popularity ratings in years. 
 ''No one has worked harder and risked more than Mayor Daley,'' declared Lou Raizin, president of Broadway in Chicago. 
 Mr. Raizin alluded to the Loop's distinctly melancholy state not long ago -- before the refurbishing of several theaters like the Auditorium, the expansion of Loop university campuses, and new restaurants -- and the benefits of the revitalization for his firm. They include annual audiences of 1.7 million, a decade of payrolls totaling $100 million and the impact on other sectors, like hotels, with 6.7 percent of local hotel occupancy attributed to people coming to town to see his shows, like the musical ''Billy Elliott.''
 Some Daley critics might have winced upon hearing Mr. Raizin present the case for tax increment financing, or TIFs. They're a development tool, used nationwide, that Daley has relied on to, critics say, benefit developers at the expense of other public entities such as public schools and parks. They've been essential to the downtown theaters, he said.
 And if the activity in the Loop at night leaves a lot to be desired, you cannot deny the failure of previous mayors to turn matters around. Remember Jane Byrne's ignominious State Street Mall gambit?
 Roche Schulfer, executive director of the Goodman, called what has happened with the theater district ''a signal achievement in urban development and private-public partnerships,'' lauding the mayor's ''vision, tenacity and courage.''
 Mr. Daley's arts record is solid and goes well beyond the time he stood on the ''Jersey Boys'' stage and exhorted Chicagoans to go watch theater. For all the caricature of the monosyllabic, middle-brow politician, the mayor has been a force, in part due to his world travels and a propensity to borrow the ideas of others. 
 Whether it's fiberglass cows on street corners, the handiwork of world famous architects or teaching Chinese in the public schools, the mayor has a sophisticated sensibility akin to a plodding baseball pitcher's sneaky changeup -- it's frequently missed. 
 His wife is well-known as an important arts influence, partly explaining his choking up when mentioning her name yesterday. She has inoperable breast cancer and was not able to attend, but one of their daughters, Nora Daley Conroy, who is chairwoman of the Steppenwolf Theatre's board, was there. Steppenwolf's artistic director, Martha Lavey, cited to me the mayor's passionate cultural interests, and said she had been summoned to his City Hall office to discuss her institution's role. ''I admire his leadership,'' Ms. Lavey said.
 Speakers included Rocco Landesman, a successful Broadway producer and chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Mr. Landesman recalled his late-1980s production here ''of a little play called 'The Producers.' '' He spoke not just of the potent, job-producing economics of the arts but also their enhancement of a city's quality of life.
 The honoree talked eloquently about how ''life isn't about politicians, government and business'' but more about the books you read, the music you hear, the art you view. The worst thing schools can do is eliminate arts programs, Mr. Daley said, his one mildly confusing declaration since he is lord of a system where art and music are often first cut during a budget crises.
 Challenged on that point a bit later, he said that perhaps we should at least think of arts as central to after-school programs.
 Regardless, it was the one ambiguity in a seemingly heartfelt appearance by a man whose chief professional worry is whether to run again.
 It was distinctly different for the political performance artist a few blocks away. That artist has to wonder if his next great role will include a single costume: a prison jumpsuit.

HEADLINE: Public Financing Supports Growth of Online Charter Schools

BYLINE: By CAROL POGASH. 
cpogash@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Laura Drews has converted a corner of her San Jose dining room into a public school. Every weekday, she guides her first-, fifth- and eighth-grade children through their class assignments, delivered through textbooks and desktop computers. 
 The Drews' unorthodox education is paid for by taxpayers, but created and operated by a for-profit company based in Virginia. The California Virtual Academy at San Mateo is part of an expanding network of virtual public schools, including 10 in the Bay Area, that provide much of the instruction online with the help of a parent.
The schools are a manifestation of the charter school movement, which gives parents and students more choice in public education. Proponents say the virtual schools give students the intimacy of home schooling while maintaining the structure of a public school. Nationally, there are an estimated 200,000 full-time virtual charter school students, said Susan Patrick, chief executive of the International Association for K-12 Online Learning. 
 Behind the blue screen, however, is a host of unanswered questions about a system that seemingly requires little overhead. There are no libraries, cafeterias, playgrounds, coaches, janitors, nurses, buses or bus drivers -- but can cost taxpayers per student as much as or more than traditional public schools. 
 This year, the San Mateo virtual school attended by the Drews children is expected to receive $5,105 per student in state and federal money -- $375 more per student than what children in their authorizing school district of Jefferson Elementary in Daly City are expected to receive, said the district. 
 The school, California Virtual Academy at San Mateo, is a creation of K12 Incorporated, a publicly traded corporation started in 2000 by Ron Packard, an economist and engineer, and Bill Bennett, the secretary of education under President Ronald Reagan. Initial financing came from Knowledge Universe, a creation of the financier Michael Milken. Mr. Milken, who served time in prison in the early 1990s for securities violations, has bought or started dozens of for-profit education companies, including day care centers. 
 K12 operates virtual schools in 25 states and abroad. It lends students computers, printers, software and books and pays a part of their Internet connection costs. K12 materials include print as well as interactive learning.
 K12 signs 3-year-to-10-year management contracts with its charter public schools to provide virtual education. These contracts, according to the company's annual report, ''provide the basis for a recurring revenue stream as students progress through successive grades.'' The company protects its ''intellectual property'' by having teachers and students sign confidentiality agreements, according to information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 ''A virtual education is expensive,'' said Katrina Abston, the head of schools for CAVA, and a K12 employee.
 The nine K12 California schools share the cost of a 10,000-square-foot office and storage space in Simi Valley. ''There's back-end support and computers and the type of curriculum we use is expensive,'' Ms. Abston said. ''They make sure we're cutting edge.'' 
 More than half the San Mateo virtual academy's budget last year was owed to K12, including $642,304 for management fees to oversee the 900 students in their homes and $2.7 million for instructional materials and technology. 
 Diane Ravitch, a leading educational historian who until recently favored charter schools, is strongly critical of the virtual charter system. Ms. Ravitch said the system eliminated ''brick and mortar schools and it bypasses the unions,'' mainly for the benefit of for-profit companies.
 Twenty percent of California's 872 charter schools now conduct some or all of their classes online. CAVA has 11,000 students in California; 900 are students at CAVA San Mateo, where enrollment is growing at a rate of 20 percent per year, according to K12.
 The CAVA curriculum gives ''an adult a script on how to teach a student,'' Mrs. Drews said. She said she consulted with elementary teachers only about her children's compositions. K12 offers ''mastery-based curriculum,'' with assessment tests that must be passed before a student can move to the next lesson, though at the elementary level those decisions are left to the parents. 
 High school students can talk to their teachers in voluntary weekly online conferences -- but not in person, since their teachers are scattered across the state. They communicate through e-mail and through K12's Web sites, messaging and internal e-mail system. 
 Elementary school students learn at their own pace and are graded by their parents. They meet their teachers for a half-hour or longer, three or four times a year at a library or church.
 CAVA schools rely on the honor system because, short of fingerprint or facial recognition, there is no way to be sure who is tapping at the keyboard. Students in physical education classes -- a class that is required by the state -- are graded in part on self-reporting of regular exercise. 
 K12 reports that its students test ''near state averages,'' according to documents filed with the S.E.C. Last year, at CAVA's San Mateo school, 57 percent of students achieved proficiency or above in English; 33 percent were proficient or advanced in math. Nearly 30 percent of the high school students drop out, which is higher than the state average of 24 percent. 
 Many parents, especially those with younger children, have expressed satisfaction with the curriculum.
 ''CAVA is beautiful,'' said Leigh Austin-Schmidt, whose sixth and seventh graders attend school at their home in Pleasanton. ''There's a wonderful section on teacher tips, how to prepare for a lesson if I didn't know something.''
 The San Mateo school attracts families dissatisfied with their public school and seeking a more independent learning environment, flexible hours or more support for students. 
 Linda Brown said her ninth-grade son, who is in special education, ''is doing way better than he would have in public school.'' But she added that for her fifth-grade daughter, ''the social aspect is the thing we miss the most.''
 On their own, San Jose parents have organized and take turns teaching weekly art, music and science programs at a local church.
 Oversight for California public charter schools falls to the authorizing districts. Although the Jefferson Elementary School district reviews CAVA's curriculum and its budget, it lacks the manpower to verify the records.
 ''We have to take their word for it,'' said Enrique Navas, assistant superintendent of business services at the district. ''It's a paper review.'' 
 Despite the fact that K12 plans to open more schools in the state, Ms. Abston, CAVA's head of school, said all nine California schools operated at a loss. 
 ''K12 provides CAVA a full, turn-key education solution, a complete comprehensive education at a cost less than the average total cost of a student in traditional public schools,'' Jeff Kwitowski, K12's vice president for public relations, said in an e-mail message. He added that online public schools received about 30 percent less in total financing than traditional schools. 
 Luis Huerta, an associate professor of education at Teachers College, Columbia University and a nationally recognized scholar on charter schools and school finance who has researched virtual charters for 14 years, disputed that, saying of Mr. Kwitowski, ''he is unequivocally incorrect.'' 
 ''Nationally, cyber charters on average receive the equivalent amount of funding as traditional schools,'' Professor Huerta said.
 He added that there was minimal overhead and minimal accountability.
 If virtual charter school costs are lower, Professor Huerta said, ''then where is the money going?''
 ''It doesn't add up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Regulators Shut Down 3 Banks, Bringing Total Failures for the Year to 81

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators on Friday shut down a Nebraska bank that has struggled under the weight of soured loans and drawn scrutiny from federal authorities since early last year. 
 Two small banks in Illinois and Mississippi were also closed, raising the number of bank failures this year to 81.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over the TierOne Bank, based in Lincoln, Neb., with about $2.8 billion in assets. Great Western Bank, based in Sioux Falls, S.D., agreed to acquire the assets and deposits of the failed bank. In addition, the F.D.I.C. and Great Western agreed to share losses on $1.9 billion of TierOne Bank's loans and other assets.
 The failure of TierOne Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $297.8 million.
 On Friday, TierOne said it had agreed to a new set of rules imposed by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, giving it an additional six weeks to shore up its capital position. The thrift agency had said TierOne ''engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices,'' carrying too many bad loans on its books and lacking sufficient capital as a cushion against losses.
 The bank had losses in 10 of the last 11 quarters.
 TierOne suffered from high concentrations of construction, land and commercial real estate loans in markets hit by the real estate bust, including California, Florida and Nevada, according to the thrift regulators.
 The bank, established in 1907, had 59 branches in Nebraska, nine in Iowa and one in Kansas.
 The F.D.I.C. also seized the First National Bank, based in Rosedale, Miss., with $60.4 million in assets, and the Arcola Homestead Savings Bank in Arcola, Ill., with about $17 million in assets.
 The Jefferson Bank, based in Fayette, Miss., agreed to acquire the assets and deposits of First National Bank. The F.D.I.C. and the Jefferson Bank agreed to share losses on $43.5 million of the failed bank's loans and other assets.
 The F.D.I.C. was unable to find a buyer for Arcola, and it approved the payout of the institution's insured deposits. The agency said it would mail checks to depositors for their insured funds on Monday.
 The failure of First National Bank is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $12.6 million; that of Arcola Homestead is expected to cost $3.2 million.
 The closure of Arcola Homestead brought to 12 the number of bank failures this year in Illinois, a state with one of the highest concentrations of bank collapses and where the downturn in the real estate market brought an avalanche of impaired mortgage loans. California, Florida and Georgia also are high on the list of states with concentrated bank failures.
 With 81 closures nationwide so far this year, the pace of bank failures is more than double that of 2009, which was already a brisk year for shutdowns. By this time last year, regulators had closed 37 banks. The pace has accelerated as banks' losses mount on loans made for commercial property and development.
 The growing bank failures have sapped billions of dollars from the deposit insurance fund. It fell into the red last year, and its deficit was at $20.7 billion as of March 31.
 The F.D.I.C. expects the cost of resolving failed banks to grow to about $100 billion in the next four years.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley's Asia Chief To Take Teaching Post at Yale

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Morgan Stanley announced on Friday that Stephen Roach, the chairman of the bank's Asia operations and one of the region's most prominent economists, would relocate from Hong Kong to New York, in part to take up a teaching position at Yale University. 
 Mr. Roach, who has spent the last three years in Hong Kong, will remain with Morgan Stanley and assume the role of nonexecutive chairman of Asia on July 1. He will return to the region about once a month to work with Morgan Stanley clients, government policy makers and regulators. 
 A prolific writer and speaker, Mr. Roach has become recognized as a highly influential expert on global imbalances and on Asia's growing role in the world. 
 At Yale, he will teach upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, with a focus on Asia macroeconomic policy, Morgan Stanley said in a statement. Beginning this autumn, his first course, ''The Next China,'' will focus on the Chinese economy.
 ''While Steve has made the decision to return to the U.S. and join the faculty at Yale, we are delighted he will also remain with the firm,'' the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, said in the statement.
 ''After spending 28 years at Morgan Stanley, the last three of them in Asia, I wanted to spread my wings a bit,'' Mr. Roach said in an interview. ''There are a lot of misperceptions in the United States about Asia, and about China in particular, and I hope to be able to help open up the debate a bit.'' 
 ''We are very pleased that in his new role he will continue to be an active contributor to the firm's success in the region,'' Owen D. Thomas, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley Asia, said in a statement. ''During his three years based in Hong Kong, Steve has further cemented his reputation as a clear and original thinker, commentator and communicator on the world's major macro themes.'' 
 Morgan Stanley did not name a successor.

HEADLINE: A Political Survivor Inherits Japan's List of Troubles

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO
 SIX years ago, after resigning as the leader of his political party in a pension scandal, Naoto Kan saved his political career by making an unusual show of atonement, shaving his head and donning the plain white outfit of a Buddhist pilgrim to spend 11 days walking a famous circuit of temples.
 Now, as Japan's new prime minister, and the nation's fifth new leader in just four years, Mr. Kan will need that same knack for political survival to avoid the fate of his short-lived predecessors, and particularly the man he replaced, the unpopular Yukio Hatoyama. 
 Mr. Kan, who was elected prime minister on Friday by a vote in Parliament, inherits the same problems that drove Mr. Hatoyama to step down on Wednesday after just eight months in office, beginning with a series of political financing scandals and the still uncertain future of an American air base on Okinawa. He must also restore public faith in his governing Democratic Party, which has seemed to lose its way since taking power in an election last summer.
 And those are the easy parts. He must also deal with the huge problems facing this ailing Asian giant that his predecessors failed to resolve: an unresponsive political system, a ballooning national debt and a nearly two-decade economic slump that shows few signs of abating.
 While it remains far from clear whether he will be up to these tasks, one thing is certain: in turning to Mr. Kan, the Democrats have picked a seasoned political veteran who will most likely be a very different kind of leader from the ineffective Mr. Hatoyama.
 Indeed, Mr. Kan, 63, is cut from a very different cloth than most Japanese political leaders. While politicians here are often former elite bureaucrats or the scions of political families, Mr. Kan is a former civic activist who rose through the country's progressive opposition before becoming one of the Democratic Party's founding members. 
 As health minister in 1996, he gained a national reputation as a battler of Japan's powerful bureaucracy when he forced ministry officials to release documents showing they had knowingly allowed public use of blood products at risk of being tainted by H.I.V. He has also had his share of knocks. The Japanese media reported in 1998 that he had an extramarital affair with a television newscaster, and then in 2004 he was forced to step down as Democratic Party chief for failing to make mandatory payments into the national pension system.
 POLITICAL experts describe Mr. Kan as a straight talker who will be much more pragmatic than Mr. Hatoyama, who vacillated for months over whether to fulfill a campaign pledge to move a United States Marine air base off Okinawa. Mr. Kan is also expected to give his government a more clearly defined direction than did Mr. Hatoyama, whose inability to stop his cabinet members from airing contradictory opinions earned his government the nickname ''Hatoyama kindergarten.''
 ''He won't keep you on pins and needles, like Mr. Hatoyama did,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political expert and former president of the University of Tokyo. 
 During the brief campaign to become prime minister, Mr. Kan emphasized his different background, characterizing himself as a self-made man in contrast to Mr. Hatoyama, a fourth-generation lawmaker who hailed from one of Japan's most powerful political families.
 ''I come from a regular, white-collar household,'' said Mr. Kan, whose father was an executive at a glassmaking company. ''If a politician born in the political grass roots can rise to such a weighty post, I think this will be something new for Japan.''
 Even before winning Friday's vote, Mr. Kan was trying to distance himself from Mr. Hatoyama. He vowed to refocus the Democrats on issues closer to voters' hearts and pocketbooks, saying it was his top priority to reduce budget deficits and increase economic growth by creating jobs and reversing Japan's punishing deflation. 
 ''I want to create a government that can implement policies to break through Japan's 20 years of stagnation,'' he said.
 He is also expected to push forward with the Democrats' signature campaign promise of shifting power from Tokyo's elite bureaucrats, the country's de facto leaders since World War II, to elected politicians. 
 In the Hatoyama administration, Mr. Kan served as a point man in administrative reform, which was one reason he was placed at the helm of the Finance Ministry, the most powerful of Tokyo's central ministries. 
 What is less clear is how he will handle Japan's international relations, and particularly its postwar military alliance with the United States, having spent most of his career on domestic issues like health and welfare. 
 At least initially, he has seemed to stick close to the policies of Mr. Hatoyama. He echoed his predecessor in speaking of improving ties with China and establishing an East Asian Community. He also called the United States-Japan alliance the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy, and said he would honor Mr. Hatoyama's agreement with the Obama administration to relocate the base on Okinawa.
 STILL, questions remain about whether Mr. Kan can even carry out last month's agreement, when any attempt to construct a new base is certain to face fierce resistance by Okinawans. Nor is it clear how Mr. Kan, who is said to be short-tempered, would react if the Obama administration tried to pressure him as it did Mr. Hatoyama. 
 ''He wants a good relationship with the United States, but he also has much sharper elbows than Mr. Hatoyama,'' said Gerald Curtis, a professor of Japanese politics at Columbia University.
 Analysts describe Mr. Kan as not only a better public speaker, but also as having a flair for political performance that may also help him. The Buddhist pilgrimage won him days of sympathetic television coverage. During a food-poisoning scare in the mid-1990s, he went on TV and ate daikon radishes to prove that they were safe.
 ''More than anything else, what Japan wants now is someone who can take charge and exude a feeling of confidence,'' said Daniel C. Sneider, a researcher on East Asia at Stanford University. ''Kan has a reputation and track record as a decisive leader. Hatoyama proved himself to be anything but that.''

HEADLINE: With Backdrop of Glamour, Wal-Mart Stresses Global Growth

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Wal-Mart's past was as a humble five-and-dime store in nearby Bentonville, but at its shareholders' meeting here Friday, the retailer said its future would be in distant lands.
 ''I want all of you to be able to say that at this moment Wal-Mart committed to being a truly global company,'' Michael T. Duke, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told about 16,000 employees, shareholders and onlookers at the Bud Walton arena here, ''and began building the next generation Wal-Mart.'' 
 Last year, Wal-Mart International's sales surpassed $100 billion for the first time, providing about one-fourth of the company's $405 billion in revenue. 
 Just under half of its 8,300 stores are outside of the United States, and more than 60 percent of the new square footage Wal-Mart built last quarter was in its international division. 
 Doug McMillon, the head of Wal-Mart's international operations, told audience members that they could count on Wal-Mart International to drive growth, though the company has waved off questions about when or whether it expects international sales to outpace United States sales.
 As Mr. McMillon introduced employee delegations from Brazil, Mexico, China, Japan, Argentina, India, Britain and other countries, the groups roared, honked horns, rattled cowbells, whistled and waved their countries' flags. The company said it would add 500,000 jobs worldwide over the next five years. 
 Wal-Mart is emphasizing international growth as it tries to offset sluggish spending domestically. Its core customer in the United States continues to budget carefully and cut down on trips to stores because of unemployment and high gas prices. And Wal-Mart's chief financial officer acknowledged in the chain's most recent reporting period that the company might have lost some of the wealthier customers it gained during the recession as those customers returned to higher-price stores.
 For the three months that ended April 30, sales at United States stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, declined 1.4 percent from a year ago.
 Wal-Mart said it was taking steps in the United States to offset those declines, like offering some of the most aggressive price cuts in its history and leveraging its buying power to offer low prices. The chain known for its sprawling stores also said it planned to build smaller stores in all kinds of markets around the world, including the United States.
 ''We think the combination is the best,'' Mr. Duke said in a question-and-answer session with reporters. ''We'll build large stores for one-stop shopping and then we'll build small stores for the convenience and the fill-in.''
 Bill Dreher, senior research analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities who attended the shareholder meeting, said the shift toward international operations reflected the company's near build-out of its so-called supercenters in the United States.
 Mr. Dreher predicted that the profitability of Wal-Mart's international sales would surpass that of its domestic sales.
 ''We expect Wal-Mart will eventually be as big in China as they are in the U.S. now, and grow double- digit annual sales increases in Latin America,'' he said in a written response to questions. 
 Domestically, the company is also working on mending its struggling apparel business. Wal-Mart said that in the future it would focus on selling everyday basics like T-shirts, socks and jeans instead of name brands.
 Along the way, the company plans to compete in the global marketplace by improving its technology. ''Some of our competitors are ahead of us here,'' Mr. Duke said of Wal-Mart's e-commerce and mobile-phone offerings. ''We need an even deeper understanding of the role of mobile technology throughout the world, including developing countries.''
 ''Building the best Web site,'' he said, ''will be just as important as getting our store formats right.'' Currently, outside of the United States, only Britain, Brazil and Japan have e-commerce sites.
 Executives will emphasize mobile shopping, as well. Mr. Duke said Wal-Mart was well positioned to compete as retailing enters ''an era of price transparency,'' assuming it improves its technology. 
 Eduardo Castro-Wright, who leads the company's United States business, said that Wal-Mart could also ''use mobile as a productivity tool, where customers can shop in our stores and make their shopping experience easier,'' he said, such as with applications that help them find products. That was one reason the company acquired the online video service Vudu early this year, he said.
 The annual meetings here always mix business and pleasure. The entertainment lineup included Jamie Foxx, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, the ''American Idol'' winner Lee DeWyze, Josh Groban and Enrique Iglesias.
 When Mr. Iglesias jumped offstage to walk in the crowd, looking women in the eyes as he sang his love song ''Hero,'' he seemed to have some trouble disentangling himself from an adoring Wal-Mart employee. Afterward, the Wal-Mart chairman Rob Walton said, ''Man, he was hot.''
 Wal-Mart is a powerful sales outlet for the celebrities, who seemed duty-bound to pay homage to the retailer. That led to some strange moments, like Mr. Foxx, in character as Ray Charles, exhorting the group to ''Make some noise right now, shareholders!''
 The ubiquity of Wal-Mart was underscored at every turn. In a clip shown before he appeared onstage, Mr. Foxx was seen joking around in a Wal-Mart's makeup aisle alongside a blown-up photograph of the Revlon spokeswoman Halle Berry. ''You broke up with your man?'' he said to her image. ''Holler at me; I'll be at Wal-Mart.''

HEADLINE: STOCKS AND BONDS; Report on Jobs Dashes Investors' Hopes, and Shares Tumble

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled Friday in one of their sharpest declines this year, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average firmly below 10,000, as a disappointing jobs report cast a pall over the nation's economic recovery.
 New worries that the financial crisis in Europe may be spreading -- this time, to Hungary -- added to investors' anxiety.
The sell-off was swift and brutal, with the broad market losing roughly 3.4 percent. The slide left major indexes in the red for the first week of June. 
 All 30 of the Dow Jones industrials fell, some by more than 5 percent. After staying above 10,000 for days, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 323.31 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 9,931.97. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 37.95 points, or 3.44 percent, to close at 1,064.88. Both ended the week 2 percent lower, and are back to where they were in early February.
 For days, investors had awaited the monthly unemployment report from the Labor Department to help them gauge the pace of the economic recovery. They were sorely disappointed: The Labor Department's report showed that the private sector created a mere 41,000 jobs in April, far short of expectations of 150,000 to 180,000.
 And the number of long-term unemployed, Americans out of work for 27 weeks or more, remained at its highest level since the Labor Department began collecting such data in the 1940s.
 Adding to the unease were concerns that the financial troubles in Europe, particularly in Greece, Portugal and Spain, might be spreading to Hungary, after the government there sent worrying signals about its finances.
 Hungary's currency, the forint, sank in value, as did the beleaguered euro, which weakened to $1.1967 at the close in London, its lowest level since March 2006.
 ''That put all the weight on traders' shoulders,'' said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott. ''And they collapsed.'' The jobless numbers and the risk of European debt troubles spreading ''brings about a lot of worries for investors,'' said Dan Faretta, senior market strategist for LaSalle Futures Group.
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 83.86 points, or 3.64 percent, to 2,219.17. It ended the week about 1.6 percent lower.
 Amid the tumult, investors sought safety in United States Treasury securities. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1 12/32, to 102 16/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 3.20 percent from 3.36 percent late Thursday. The prospect that the jobs report would be strong had tempered some of the recent volatility in the market caused by the European debt crisis.
 ''I guess we set ourselves up for this,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. ''When people build up to it, it is a pretty big letdown.''
 ''I think the euro crisis is really behind this,'' he said.
 While Hungary is not yet inside the euro area, investors have been concerned that the problems of the European debt crisis could spill over into other countries, raising risks for institutions with high exposure and affecting the health of countries with economic ties to Europe, including the United States. Win Thin, a senior currency strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, said Hungary's economy was highly dependent on exports to Western Europe.
 ''This Hungary story has been around, but it is coming at a bad time when there are jitters about Western Europe,'' Mr. Thin said. ''That is a big reason why the euro took another downturn. The job reports did not help. I am not that worried about it, but the fact it happened now while markets are pessimistic is bad timing.''
 ''My point is that Hungary is not directly related to the E.U., the euro zone and the euro; it is just the reminder,'' he said. ''It is again another country having debt issues.''
 Among the hardest-hit sectors on the American market were financials, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks.
 General Electric closed down 74 cents at $15.71, 3M shed $2.24 to close at $76.10, Citigroup lost 17 cents to close at $3.79 and Bank of America closed at $15.35, down 46 cents.
 In Europe, investors expressed disappointment in the American jobs report but also faced concerns about Hungary.
 European stocks closed sharply lower. The CAC-40 in France was down 2.9 percent and the broad Euro Stoxx 50 shed 1.8 percent.
 The yields on the benchmark 10-year bonds of Greece, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland rose. By contrast, those of safer German bonds fell.
 Most commodity prices fell amid fears than an economic downturn would reduce demand for raw materials. Nymex crude oil for delivery in August fell $3.21, to $72.48 a barrel.
 Gold rose, however, with the contract for delivery in August up $7.70, at $1,217.70 an ounce.

HEADLINE: City Drops Plan to Charge Rent to Shelter Residents

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has abandoned a controversial decision to charge rent to working homeless families living at city shelters, officials announced on Friday. 
 Instead, under a new agreement that could start in September, such families would be required to set aside a part of their monthly earnings in a savings account that they can have access to once they leave the shelter system. 
 ''This plan will make it easier for homeless families to move into permanent housing with savings in the bank,'' said State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, who represents parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn and pushed for the new agreement, which had the support of city and state officials, as well as advocates for the homeless. 
 Steven Banks, attorney in chief at the Legal Aid Society, which was poised to sue the city if it had continued charging rent to the working homeless families in shelters, described the new plan as a ''huge step forward.''
 The city had the right to charge rent to homeless families under a 1997 state law, but it was not until last spring that it ordered shelter providers, who are paid by the city, to begin charging rent to income-earning families. Rents were to be calculated based on family size and the shelter they lived in, and were not to exceed half of a family's income. 
 The city pays providers $36,000 a year on average to keep a family in a shelter. That includes food, access to social services and counseling. 
 The rent plan unleashed a torrent of criticism for its timing -- during a recession -- and for what critics described as its uneven, unfair application: one working single mother said she was charged over 50 percent of her income. Collections were stopped after three weeks, but the city pledged to revive them this fall. 
 Now, under an article backed by Senator Squadron and Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright that would appear in the state budget, the law on rent contributions would be nullified in the city. 
 Families with incomes who live in shelters would be required to contribute a percentage of their income to a pooled savings account, managed by the city's Human Resources Administration, which would send invoices to the families each month. 
 Contributions would be calculated in proportion to income, with families earning incomes below the poverty level being asked to set aside only a ''modest amount,'' according to a statement from the mayor's office. It was not immediately clear how participation in the savings plan would be enforced, but failure to contribute to the plan would not in itself be grounds for eviction from shelters, officials said. 
 Directors of several city shelters welcomed news of the initiative, saying it represented a step away from a punitive approach to homelessness and a step toward helping people rebuild their lives. 
 ''Rather than collect rent, we're going to help people save money,'' said Ralph Nunez, president of Homes for the Homeless, a shelter provider. ''If we can get people to save, to put money away, to help jump-start people out, maybe they'll get some traction for a change.''

HEADLINE: Hoping to Do Better Abroad, the French Retailer Carrefour Focuses First at Home

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- The chief executive of Carrefour is staking the future of the giant French retailer on a simple strategy: strengthen at home, then either dominate or withdraw abroad. 
 The chief, Lars Olofsson, joined the company at the start of 2009, when it was going through a period of upheaval. Market share had slipped at home, shareholders were uneasy and the group had lost focus on core clients, while pursing a haphazard international expansion. 
 Mr. Olofsson, a Swede who speaks fluent French, was brought in to replace Jose Luis Duran by the retailer's largest shareholders, including the prominent businessman Bernard Arnault. Mr. Olofsson came from the Swiss food giant Nestle. 
 ''Carrefour had lost track of being client and consumer focused and lost a certain track of price competitiveness,'' Mr. Olofsson said during an interview this week. 
 Just after taking the helm, he initiated what he called a ''reset'' in the core markets of France, Spain, Belgium and Italy. 
 That meant focusing on re-branding and refurbishing stores, automating checkout lanes at hypermarkets, introducing recession-friendly value brands, overhauling the information technology systems and better leveraging its huge buying power to improve price competitiveness.
 The process was expensive and dented 2009 results: net profit plunged to 385 million from 1.3 billion a year earlier, and consolidated net sales slipped about 1 billion, to 86 billion. 
 Last year, market share in France crept up for the first time in three years. 
 ''In 2010 we should see the fruits of that work coming through -- in sales and profitability,'' Mr. Olofsson said in his office overlooking the Seine. ''All this puts us in a better position for the future.''
 As the ship steadies, he plans to invest further in China, Brazil and India. But where prospects are less certain, the group may scale back. 
 ''If you cannot become leader, sooner or later you will have a competitive problem,'' he said. ''If ever I have an offer in markets where I don't believe we can become leader, I'm prepared to have a look at it.'' 
 Carrefour did this before Mr. Olofsson took over, leaving Japan, Switzerland and Mexico. Under his leadership, it has also pulled out of Russia, and scaled back in southern Italy, Portugal and Belgium, where he has just signed a deal with unions to allow for job cuts and the sale of some stores. 
 Next up could be Thailand, where, ''we were the pioneer, but we didn't concentrate our efforts, and we lost leadership,'' he said. 
 Created in 1959, Carrefour is synonymous with hypermarkets, having opened the first such store in Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois, south of Paris, in 1963.
 The company has expanded through acquisitions, mergers -- notably with the French group Promodes in 1999 -- and organic growth. 
 Now, it really does have scale. It is the second-largest retailer globally by sales, behind Wal-Mart Stores, and the largest in Europe, with a range of formats from hypermarkets to hard discount and local convenience stores. 
 It has more than 15,500 stores -- company-owned or franchises -- employing 475,000 people, and it operates in 34 countries. More than 57 percent of its sales come from outside France. 
 ''There's no distributor in the world that has that kind of geographical footprint,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Olofsson still has plenty of work to do. 
 In a recent opinion poll by Posternak-Ipsos, which tracks the image perception of the largest French companies among consumers, Carrefour ranked 19th, behind its main rivals Intermarche, Auchan, Leclerc, Casino and Systeme U.
 ''It's fair to say their position as a national treasure has diminished,'' said Bryan Roberts, head of research at Planet Retail in London. That, he said, was mainly the result of rivals' aggressive pricing.
 Mr. Roberts emphasized that, befitting its huge size and the continued slow recovery in Europe, Carrefour's improvement would be gradual.
 Mr. Olofsson was also cautious in his optimism.
 ''France has been a stable market in terms of consumption for quite some months,'' he said. ''I don't see any reason why this should change significantly in the six coming months.'' 
 In the longer term, the revenue driver will be emerging markets.
 Carrefour opened in China in 1995 and has experienced almost seamless growth even though some stores were affected by a backlash after the Paris leg of the Olympic torch relay for the 2008 Beijing Games was disturbed by pro-Tibetan demonstrators.
 ''That crisis is very much behind us, and Carrefour has probably come out even stronger than we were before,'' Mr. Olofsson said. ''We have a solid profitability and we'll open as many stores as we can, keeping the quality that we offer.'''
 He described himself as ''open'' to acquisitions in China and unperturbed by fears about a downturn driven by a weaker real estate market. The company leases most of its sites.
 Like Wal-Mart, Carrefour has also been trying to weave its way through labyrinthine regulations for a toehold in India. 
 It is set to introduce a cash-and-carry store there in weeks or months, and a second around the turn of the year. It will then seek to open its own stores with an Indian partner.
 How important could that market become? ''Short term: not important at all. Medium term: very little. Long term: might be very important. It's a huge market but modern retail is new to India,'' he said. 
 Mr. Olofsson can also see the day when Brazil overtakes Spain as the company's No.2 market, behind France. 
 What of the largest overall market, the United States? Carrefour opened a handful of hypermarkets there, notably in Philadelphia and New Jersey, around the early 1990s. But the plug was pulled quickly as U.S. consumers spurned the hypermarket model. 
 Tesco, the largest British grocer, entered the United States in 2007 and has also had a tough time penetrating the competitive market. 
 ''They have a lot of courage, I wish them good luck,'' Mr. Olofsson said. ''I'm not excluding the U.S. market one day. However, today my absolute priority is France and the countries around us -- we still have synergies to capture.'' 
 ''Once our home base is in order and strong -- like Wal-Mart in the U.S. -- that's when you can start thinking really about your strategy on a large scale.'' 
 Toward the end of the interview, Mr. Olofsson took a moment to reflect on a European passion: the impending soccer World Cup. Carrefour, sponsor of the French team, has started a promotion to refund the cost of some flat-screen televisions here if the national team wins. 
 A calculated risk? France appears to be struggling for form, while the team of Spain, Carrefour's next market, is looking sharp.
 ''Our people in Spain said: 'There's no way we can do the promotion in Spain, it will cost us too much, Spain's going to win,''' he joked. ''So that's why the promotion is only for France.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Nearly Perfect in Detroit

BYLINE: By PAUL CLEMENS. 
Paul Clemens is the author of the memoir ''Made in Detroit'' and the forthcoming ''Punching Out: One Year in a Closing Auto Plant.''

 BODY:
Detroit
 DURING the eighth inning of the Detroit Tigers-Cleveland Indians game Wednesday night -- the inning in which Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga recorded his 22nd, 23rd and 24th consecutive outs -- I tried to recall who it was who'd compared the sensation of watching a nail-biting baseball game to having the flu. Sitting in front of my television, I diagnosed, at worst, a bad cold. The flu arrived in the ninth, followed, post-game, by what felt like pneumonia. Awaking the next morning, I wondered if I'd had a high fever and hallucinated the whole thing. 
 For those unaware, Galarraga threw a perfect game on Wednesday night at Comerica Park in Detroit, though the record books won't acknowledge it. The first-base umpire, Jim Joyce, called the 27th Cleveland hitter, Jason Donald, who'd hit a soft infield grounder, safe at first base, though replays -- and it may be the most replayed play in baseball history -- showed Donald to be out. Galarraga went from becoming only the 21st pitcher in Major League history to throw a perfect game (and the third in four weeks, a convergence of perfection that can be expected to recur with Halley's Comet-like regularity) to one of the countless in Major League history to throw a one-hit shutout. 
 I'd talked on the phone to my father during the game's late innings, doubting the evidence of my eyes. Was Galarraga -- by no means the staff ace -- really throwing a perfect game? And was it me, or was Galarraga getting close calls at the corners? My father -- who called a tough strike zone back when I was a kid and practiced pitching behind the garage of our house in Detroit -- agreed. Giving Galarraga the benefit of the doubt was only just. If you want to spoil a perfect game, the home-plate umpire, Marvin Hudson, seemed to be telling Cleveland, get a hit. Don't expect me to call ball four.
 And then Joyce called Donald safe at first.
 Then the replays -- soon to be baseball's Zapruder film -- began. Each angle shows the same thing: Donald was out. And each time, Jim Joyce signals safe. ''Why is he safe?'' Rod Allen, one of the Detroit TV announcers, asks once, twice, three times. Though most iconic announcing calls are bellowed when repeated (''The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!'' and ''Havlicek steals it! Havlicek stole the ball!''), Allen's question is, by announcer standards, barely above a whisper, his tone poised between heartbreak and incomprehension. The scale of the error sinks in. ''Jim Joyce -- no,'' Allen says.
 Rather than watch baseball Wednesday night, I should have been reading up on local news reports. The problem was that I didn't really understand the numbers in any of them. Newt Gingrich told the state's business and political leaders that the City of Detroit should attract business by charging zero tax on new investment for 10 years. It wasn't clear to me how those all those zeroes would tally up to equal prosperity.
 Mayor Dave Bing and the City Council differed on the numbers in the city's budget cuts; the council was after the bigger number. Sales at the Big Three automakers were up, but I hadn't really understood any auto numbers since the bailouts and bankruptcies. The national economy was said to be improving, but long-term unemployment was now at its highest level ever. How did that square? 
 Nope, 27 up and 27 down: those were numbers I could comprehend, at least until Joyce made the safe sign. The only story I seemed able to get my head around was Ford's announcement that it would drop its Mercury brand -- a sound decision by Detroit's soundest carmaker. 
 By the morning after the game, the blown call had become big news nationally and internationally, and Jim Joyce was being unfairly lumped in with BP executives and the Israeli Defense Ministry. And yet the absolute class displayed in the call's aftermath by Galarraga, Joyce and Tigers manager Jim Leyland -- nobody's perfect, I made a mistake, these things happen -- seemed to put the matter to rest. 
 Then Michigan's politicians -- overseers of the state with the country's highest unemployment rate -- got involved, issuing proclamations, resolutions, strongly worded this-and-thats. One, Representative Thaddeus McCotter, wrote a letter to baseball commissioner Bud Selig saying that ''only the truth will uphold and honor the integrity of the game; and the truth is that this game was perfect.'' He told an ESPN reporter, ''When this happened, the feeling here in Detroit was this could only happen to us; this was just one more thing on top of everything else.''
 How much special pleading can a city, a region, a state sustain? When I saw my father on Thursday afternoon -- less than a day after Galarraga's perfect non-perfection, though it seemed much longer -- we agreed that everyone should let it go, as the primary participants already had. (Selig eventually declined to overturn the call.) ''It was a win,'' my father said. ''Maybe it'll give them some momentum.''
 It did: the Tigers won Thursday afternoon's game in a blowout. Before that contest began, General Motors gave Galarraga a Corvette.
 ''They should have given him a Saturn, or a Pontiac,'' my father said, mentioning two of G.M.'s defunct brands. He meant no disrespect to Galarraga, or to Saturns or Pontiacs. He owns a Pontiac. It was merely his Detroit practicality reasserting itself, part of the collective return to earth the day after something that had been, briefly, so elevating. ''They need to clear out all those discontinued models,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Elections Aren't For Sissies

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Loads of exciting primaries next week! Although it'll be hard to top the one in South Carolina, where two Tea Party candidates are fighting about a lie detector test and a state senator has argued that racist comments he made over the radio don't really count since the interview occurred in a bar.
 I've been paying a disproportionate amount of attention to Republicans this election cycle, but it's not my fault. Most of the Democratic primaries are incredibly boring. There are a couple of bitter battles, like the one Tuesday that will determine the fate of Senator Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas. But it's hard to combine the phrases ''Senator Blanche Lincoln'' and ''really exciting story'' in the same sentence. 
 Meanwhile, the Republicans sniff blood, and the smell has gotten them so excited that they are all jumping into the ring and hitting each other over the head with mallets. 
 In Nevada, voters seemed to be suffering from Harry Reid exhaustion -- a sentiment not improved by the fact that while the Senate majority leader is up for re-election, his son is running for governor. But the Reid camp has come up with a canny campaign strategy that involves hoping the Republicans kill one another.
 The early front-runner, Sue Lowden, hasn't really recovered from the day she suggested that the solution to health care costs might be to return to the barter system so people could pay their doctor bills with livestock or produce. Now one of her opponents, the Tea Party candidate Sharron (I Have an Extra R) Angle, seems to have surged into the lead with an innovative media strategy that involves refusing to tell reporters where she will be campaigning.
 Lowden has been savaging Angle with wildly overblown ads that claim she once introduced a bill to provide massage therapy to prison inmates. The squabbles are so fierce that they are at least temporarily overshadowing anti-Reid commercials that feature his unfortunate choice of words about visitors to our nation's halls of government. (''You can literally smell the tourists coming into the Capitol.'')
 Over in California, voters are deciding whether the $81 million spent by Meg Whitman, the ex-eBay chief, on her campaign will be enough to win the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Really, for somebody who made her fortune creating bargain-hunting opportunities, this seems wrong. You could buy entire states for $80 million. Whitman could probably have snapped up North Dakota for half that amount, and it doesn't even have a deficit.
 The winner of the primary will take on Jerry Brown, who has already been governor twice but is running as an outsider because all that happened before most Californians were born.
 Yet everything else pales next to South Carolina, where State Representative Nikki Haley and Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer are fighting over who is the true Tea Party candidate. Recently, two political consultants came forward and claimed that they had had sexual encounters with Haley, whose campaign puts quite a bit of stress on God and her happy marriage. Haley says she smells a Bauer plot. 
 Indeed, one of the consultants, Larry Marchant Jr., was working for Bauer until this week when he announced that he and Haley had hooked up during a school choice conference in Utah in 2008.
 Marchant spun his saga of vouchers and lust. (''We'd gone to dinner. I had some drinks. Things happened.'') Much harder to believe was the part where he kept the story secret until the last week of the gubernatorial primary when he suddenly felt compelled to confess to his pregnant wife, his employer and the world.
 I am a very credulous person. There was a minute there when I believed that John Edwards's married gofer was the father of the lusty videographer's love child. But this one is a reach.
 One of Bauer's other supporters, State Senator Jake Knotts, managed to unite the state in a moment of mass revulsion when he went on the radio to say he opposed Haley, who is Indian-American, because ''we already got one raghead in the White House. We don't need another in the governor's mansion.'' 
 Knotts seemed to feel as if it was unfair for anyone to quote him since he made his remarks on ''a freewheeling, anything-goes Internet radio show that is broadcast from a pub. It's like local political version of 'Saturday Night Live.' '' He is possibly the only person in America who is unaware that 1) ''Saturday Night Live'' has a script, and 2) it is never a good plan to appear on a talk show that takes place inside a saloon. 
 When Bauer was last heard from, he was demanding that Haley take a lie detector test about her sex life, while Haley was vowing that if elected, she would resign from office if it was ever proved that she had had extracurricular sex. This seems like a terrible idea. South Carolina has big economic problems, and you do not want the next governor fending off adultery challenges 24-7. Been there. Done that.

HEADLINE: Luring a Star: Big City Beckons, Cleveland Begs

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER; Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In the front row, Ted Strickland, the governor of Ohio, croons into the microphone, shoulder to shoulder with Dick Goddard, the ageless Cleveland weatherman. Around them on a soundstage, a chorus chimes in plaintively: city clerks, radio personalities, blues musicians, the ponytailed Norton Furniture pitchman Marc Brown. 
 Everyone is swaying to the music, Live-Aid style, and offering a heartfelt videographic plea. It is sung to the tune of ''We Are the World'': ''Please stay LeBron/We really need you!'' 
 Cleveland, a city that has lost its share of celebrities to New York -- John D. Rockefeller and George M. Steinbrenner come to mind -- is desperate to keep LeBron James, the N.B.A. All-Star who is up for free agency next month. So a group of local boosters has produced a homespun three-minute video begging him to stay.
 But New York City, the capital of advertising, is fighting back. On Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg released his own appeal to Mr. James: a 49-second pitch in which he cited Clyde Frazier and Willis Reed and beseeched Mr. James to ''come write the next chapter in N.Y.C. basketball history.'' 
 The somewhat stilted video -- the mayor looks as if he has never held, let alone shot, a basketball before -- is part of a media blitz that will eventually include a Facebook page, a live Twitter feed, professionally silk-screened ''C'mon LeBron'' T-shirts, digital messages in Times Square (and in taxicabs), even fan kits available for download on the Internet. 
 All of which raises the question: Will Mr. James, who hails from Akron, Ohio, remain at home, persuaded by his landsmen's earnestness and self-deprecating humor? 
 Or will he be lured to New York City by, among other things, a highly packaged and somewhat excessive advertising campaign?
 ''Based on the videos alone, there's no way LeBron is coming to New York,'' said Andy Borowitz, a humor writer for The New Yorker and a former Clevelander. ''There was so much more effort put in the Cleveland video. Mayor Bloomberg's looked like it was produced for, and rejected by, Taxi TV.''
 Cleveland's attitude is understandable. Mr. James, 25, has been playing for the Cavaliers since graduating from high school, and he is not only among the premier players in the N.B.A., but also perhaps the city's only marquee celebrity. 
 At the same time, one could make the argument that the ''C'mon LeBron'' onslaught in New York is only the latest example of the city's puzzling descent into boosterish antics that are perhaps better suited to less sophisticated towns.
 There was, for instance, the overt begging for the Super Bowl and the subsequent tabloid glee (front-page pictures of the Statue of Liberty!) when the big game was obtained. There was the Little League-ish appearance of a beaming Yankees squad on the steps of City Hall. It sometimes seems as if so many keys to the city have been handed out of late that no locked door is safe.
 The city's Economic Development Corporation recently declared that the economic impact of Mr. James's arrival in New York could be as much as $57.8 million a year. Still, it can seem a little silly for the city to bat its schoolgirl eyes to attract a big star, even one as big as LeBron James. Do we really -- seriously -- care about this stuff?
 Apparently, we do. The city claims that Bartle Bogle Hegarty, its full-time advertising firm, concocted the idea for the media blitz, devising the ''C'mon LeBron'' logo and ordering the special T-shirts. The city says it cannot break down exactly how much is being spent on the effort, because the firm is on a yearly retainer. 
 The advertising firm appears determined to give the campaign a grass-roots feel. Bartle Bogle Hegarty went so far as to track down an authentic-looking street performer to sing on camera for its Facebook page.
 The performer, Laurence Woodson, 35, said he was playing last week at his preferred spot, outside a Prada store in SoHo, when two men in their 20s, wearing slacks and button-downs, approached him, ''C'mon LeBron'' T-shirts in hand, and explained that they worked for an advertising agency hired by the mayor's office.
 Mr. Woodson recalled that one of them asked, ''Dude, can I get you to put on one of these shirts and film you playing?'' Mr. Woodson, currently living in a camper, agreed. Turns out, he arrived in New York only 9 or 10 days ago (he is from Washington). He said he improvised fresh LeBron lyrics as he went along.
 At least, the performance did not cost much. Mr. Woodson said one of the men reached in his pocket and made what he called a ''nominal'' donation to his kitty.
 Of course, if you are looking for a somewhat more vigorous expression of LeBron fever, consider Brandon George, a college student from Middleburg Heights, on Cleveland's west side, who is studying advertising in Atlanta.
 Mr. George made a two-minute YouTube video in which a succession of 23 women (Mr. James wears No. 23) slapped him in the face. Hard. He followed that effort with another video in which he had his chest hair ripped off with strips of hot wax. 
 The real question, of course, is whether Cleveland can withstand the geared-up New York publicity machine. Governor Strickland thinks it can.
 ''I understand the skill and talent of the advertising world in New York City,'' he said. ''But what we have in Cleveland is genuine, deeply felt love.''

HEADLINE: Luxury Car As a Gift Stuns a Few

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- A free sports car for a Detroit Tigers baseball player was not among the reasons the government saved General Motors from financial collapse. Nor was a year's supply of diapers and other gifts for a Minnesota woman who gave birth behind the wheel of a Chevrolet Cobalt.
 General Motors has given away both in recent weeks -- marketing ploys that would have barely raised an eyebrow in the past. But now that American taxpayers collectively own a majority of the carmaker, executives are learning that there are more than 300 million potential second-guessers out there. 
 ''Until G.M. has repaid the taxpayers in full for the money they have borrowed, every action that G.M. takes should advance them in that direction,'' said Kurt Bardella, a spokesman for Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican of California who is a visible G.M. second-guesser.
 Last month, Mr. Issa was among a multitude of critics who took issue with another G.M. marketing effort -- the running of self-congratulatory advertisements about having repaid a government loan. (Taxpayers still own $2.1 billion in preferred stock of G.M. and 61 percent of its common equity.)
 So how did the Detroit pitcher, Armando Galarraga, end up with a free Chevrolet Corvette on Thursday?
 After an umpire's mistake destroyed Mr. Galarraga's perfect game on Wednesday, a G.M. employee proposed that the company give the Tigers pitcher a car.
 Within hours, G.M. executives agreed, and Mr. Galarraga received the sparkling cherry-red convertible on the Comerica Park field, courtesy of the automaker whose headquarters dominate the skyline over right field.
 ''It was probably some of the best dollars invested in publicity in Chevrolet and Corvette,'' Klaus-Peter Martin, a Chevrolet spokesman, said Friday as the giveaway was debated on talk radio here and elsewhere. 
 Mr. Martin said executives understood that they operated with the government support as a constant backdrop and examined marketing and other activities more closely now, to ensure that every dollar spent was justified. But he and other G.M. officials said cutting marketing too much, particularly as the company was gaining momentum, would be ill-advised.
 ''The best way we can pay taxpayers back is to increase our revenue, and the only way we can do that is to sell more vehicles,'' Ryndee Carney, a G.M. corporate spokeswoman, said. ''We have to spend money to do that.''
 In the case of Mr. Galarraga's $53,000-plus consolation prize, G.M. is certain that it has hit a home run. The 28-year-old's near-perfect game has been among the top stories across the country for days, and coverage Thursday and Friday highlighted G.M.'s presentation of the Corvette.
 ''Vroom replaces gloom for Galarraga,'' read a Denver Post headline.
 G.M. resumed its sponsorship of the Tigers this year, after skipping 2009 as it went into and out of bankruptcy protection. The Chevrolet logo and several of its vehicles are displayed in the ballpark's center-field fountain, and executives jumped at the chance to reward Mr. Galarraga for his performance and good sportsmanship.
 ''The leadership thought it was an excellent opportunity,'' Mr. Martin said. ''We looked into the cost-benefit ratio and decided to go for it.''
 G.M. executives have repeatedly said they will not fall back on the old habits -- including unbridled spending -- that helped the carmaker to fail.
 Mr. Bardella, the spokesman for the congressman, said he hoped that was true and noted that many people would be watching.
 ''If you were to ask the majority of taxpayers -- outside of the city of Detroit, probably -- if they thought that giving a $50,000 car away for free was a good use of money, I'm sure that most people would say no,'' he said. ''If it creates the perception of good will and a solvent company and encourages people to buy their cars, then great. Is it something they should do every day? Probably not.''

A shadow fell across America's economic recovery on Friday, as the Labor Department's monthly report showed that job growth was weak in the private sector, provoking a precipitous sell-off in the stock market. 
 The headline numbers for May suggested reason for optimism -- employers added 431,000 jobs and the jobless rate fell to 9.7 percent, from 9.9 percent in April. But the underlying numbers showed that almost all of the growth came from the 411,000 workers hired by the federal government to help with the Census. Most of those jobs will end in a few months. 
 By contrast, the private sector created 41,000 positions, far short of expectations for 150,000 to 180,000 jobs. And the number of long-term unemployed, those Americans out of work for 27 or more weeks, remained at its highest level since the Labor Department began collecting such data in the 1940s.
 The ailing American labor market and continued threatening economic news out of Europe -- this time from Hungary, where a government spokesman raised the prospect of default -- set the stock market on edge, as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 323.31 points, or 3.2 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 3.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.6 percent. 
 Currency and commodity prices fell in tandem. The euro spiraled downward, dropping below $1.20 for the first time since early 2006. And the price of oil dropped to $71.51 a barrel.
 The financial world has cast a wary eye at Europe for months, with attention fixed on the southern tier stretching from Greece to Spain and Portugal. But Friday offered a reminder that Eastern Europe was a frail reed, as a spokesman for the Hungarian prime minister said that the previous government had manipulated economic figures and that Hungary was in ''a very grave situation.''
 President Obama tried to put a gloss on the jobs report, telling workers at a trucking company in Hyattsville, Md., that the numbers showed an economy that was ''getting stronger by the day.'' Mr. Obama mentioned that Census Bureau hiring accounted for most of the new jobs, but he added that the nation had added jobs for each of the last five months. ''These numbers do mean that we are moving in the right direction,'' he said. ''There are going to be ups and downs.''
 In fact, the May figures suggested a job market wheezing after months of more vigorous growth. The economy must add more than 100,000 jobs a month just to absorb new workers entering the market. Those entrants -- including a large batch of high school and college graduates -- will join a labor pool swollen with 15 million Americans looking for work. As well, the report showed that hard-pressed city and state governments had begun to cut budgets and shed employees, a process that could accelerate sharply in coming months.
 ''It's a very, very grudging labor market,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist for MFR Inc. ''A growing amount of evidence now points to this recovery taking a long time.'' 
 Several economists expressed concern about the shape of a future constrained by a weakening Europe and slow consumer spending. Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary for President Bill Clinton, placed the chance of the United States slipping back into recession at 50 percent; while his is a minority view, Mr. Reich gave voice to the more bearish take.
 ''The consumers are tapped out, we've got a fiscal drag from cities and states which are just beginning to lay off people in great numbers, and most of the buying has been consumers replacing household items -- I just don't see the oomph,'' he said, in a view that drew some private assents from within the Obama administration Friday. 
 A sliver or three of hope could be found in the report. Manufacturers hired 29,000 workers last month, and both hours worked -- 40.5 hours a week -- and wages rose. Factory employment has risen steadily, by 126,000 jobs over the last five months, with fabricated metals and machinery particularly strong.
 ''Nothing in this report suggests that the recovery is in trouble -- the markets need to get a grip,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in New Jersey.
 Growing numbers of Americans who had worked part time have found full-time work. And the Census jobs will put money into the pockets of the nation's hard-pressed working and lower-middle class. As these workers have little margin for error, they will spend these dollars quickly.
 But that, other economists said, described the limit of good news Friday. The number of long-term unemployed remained at about 6.7 million, accounting for 46 percent of the jobless rolls. And the number of ''discouraged workers,'' which is to say people not looking for work because they see no prospect of employment, rose by 291,000 from a year earlier.
 William Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business, had forecast private-sector job growth would be nearly flat in May. He said that, unlike stock bubbles, which pop quickly and often reinflate quickly, housing bubbles offer lingering downturns and slow recoveries. He says he does not believe the economy is so weak that it will fall into the ditch of a second recession.
 But that is not to suggest he is particularly optimistic.
 ''We won't have a second down, but it's going to be grimly slow,'' he said. 
 And, save for the hiring of Census workers and the rise in work hours, Heather Boushey, senior economist at the liberal Center for American Progress, saw little cause for cheer. Consumers account for 70 percent of American economic activity, she said, and people cannot spend what they cannot earn. 
 ''At this point, it looks like the labor market is stabilizing into an L-shaped pattern, without sufficient job creation to bring unemployment down,'' she said. ''This would not only be devastating for workers and their families, but also threaten the path of the economic recovery over all.''
 For now, the nation has more workers like Robert Mucha than at any time since the Depression. A Chicago-based engineer, the 43-year-old Mr. Mucha has been looking for work since losing his job in 2008. After putting in resume after resume, Mr. Mucha finally took a job as a Census worker. 
 He has no illusions about his future.
 ''I keep hearing about how there's a job waiting around the corner, but I never seemed to get it,'' he said. ''And when I'm finished with the Census, I'll be looking again.''

HEADLINE: In California, Immigration Debate Defines the G.O.P. Race for Governor

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
IRVINE, Calif. -- Meg Whitman was almost at the end of a 30-minute town hall-style meeting here, responding to questions about taxes and spending, schools and unemployment. But one topic had not come up, so Ms. Whitman, a Republican candidate for governor, raised it herself, serving up a stern attack against illegal immigration and a promise that she would protect California's borders.
 ''I am 100 percent against amnesty,'' Ms. Whitman proclaimed. ''My Republican opponent says I'm for amnesty. That is absolutely not true.''
 For almost a year, Ms. Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, has campaigned on three issues: jobs, education and government spending. But as her contest for the Republican nomination for governor against Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner, enters its final days, she has found herself drawn into a loud and caustic argument over immigration policy. ''It is the only issue,'' said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Poizner's chief campaign consultant. 
 The primary here on Tuesday will be the highest-stakes electoral contest since Arizona approved a tough immigration law, and that has allowed Mr. Poizner to reshape the campaign, focusing a series of stark attacks on Ms. Whitman. The extent to which immigration has, in the view of many Republicans, hijacked this contest has stirred worry that the nominee chosen next week will be weakened in the general election against Jerry Brown, a Democrat and former governor.
 ''There's a difference between talking about a problem and trying to exploit the problem as a wedge issue to try to get scared white voters,'' said Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican analyst here. ''I'm not speaking as a lone wolf on this in the Republican Party. It's concerning a lot of us.''
 Hispanics are becoming increasingly influential in California politics. One in six voters this November is expected to be Hispanic -- a proportion that is likely to grow in coming years -- and Southern California has been at the forefront of efforts to boycott Arizona for enacting tough anti-immigrant legislation in late April.
 In many ways, California's primary race offers a worrisome preview of what many Republicans say are the political perils for the party nationally in being identified with tough immigration policies. Mr. Poizner has enthusiastically endorsed such policies in his campaign. His series of stark television advertisements portraying Ms. Whitman as an advocate of permissive immigration began three weeks ago. 
 The emphasis on immigration is striking in a state that is reeling from the economic downturn and saddled with what officials in both parties view as a dysfunctional government. At 12.5 percent, the unemployment rate here is far above the national average. The state has been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis, its public education system is a shambles, and disapproval of the Legislature and of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican barred by term limits from seeking re-election, are at near-record highs. The election is playing out against the backdrop of the latest battle in Sacramento over proposed cuts in spending to balance the budget.
 One strain on the state's finances is providing social services to a large population of illegal immigrants, which is one reason the issue has political resonance. Still, it is hardly clear that the tough-on-immigrants stance has universal appeal among Republican voters; in the Central Valley, for instance, many farmers use undocumented farm workers.
 A Los Angeles Times/U.S.C. poll published on Sunday showed Ms. Whitman leading Mr. Poizner by 53 percent to 29 percent; other polls taken last month, after Mr. Poizner began his advertising assault against Ms. Whitman, showed that he had significantly tightened the race, until she started pushing back.
 In an interview, Ms. Whitman -- who has been running advertisements promising to be ''tough as nails'' on illegal immigration -- said that she thought voters were concerned about other things besides immigration, and that she was raising the issue only in response to what she asserted were Mr. Poizner's distortions of her record. She said Mr. Poizner had hurt himself as a general election candidate because of the tenor of his attacks.
 ''I think he's damaged in the general because he's only talked about one issue,'' Ms. Whitman said. ''And I think that's a big mistake.'' 
 Mr. Poizner said that illegal immigration was ''part and parcel of our message from the get-go'' and that he always viewed it as the No. 1 issue for Republican primary voters, and a point of contrast with Ms. Whitman.
 ''It's huge: everywhere I go, people burst out into applause when I start talking about it,'' Mr. Poizner said after appearing at a town hall-style meeting in El Segundo flanked by bright red screens with white lettering proclaiming, ''No Amnesty: Stop Illegal Immigration.''
 ''Our positions are just different,'' he continued. ''Meg Whitman opposes Arizona. I fully support it. In fact, I don't see how you can be a Republican running for high office in the United States and be taken seriously if you oppose what's going on in Arizona.''
 Both candidates are independently wealthy and together have spent more than $100 million -- about $80 million for Ms. Whitman, and $25 million for Mr. Poizner -- which has guaranteed a wide audience for the back-and-forth volley of television advertisements, radio spots and mailers. The demonstrated willingness of Ms. Whitman and Mr. Poizner to tap their own political fortunes to win the governorship is one of the key reasons Republicans are hopeful about defeating Mr. Brown.
 Even without immigration, candidates this primary season face a politically daunting task in trying to navigate an increasingly conservative Republican base and emerge as a viable candidate in the general election. Mark Baldassare, president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California, a policy study and polling group, said that 75 percent of Republicans statewide disapproved of President Obama in a poll earlier last month, compared with 39 percent of all registered voters in California. 
 ''The Republican primary voters are not representative of the overall mood of Californians,'' Mr. Baldassare said. ''This is really a unique slice of the electorate.''
 One sign of this is the extent to which both Ms. Whitman and Mr. Poizner are critical of Mr. Schwarzenegger. Mr. Poizner said he would not want the governor to campaign with him should he win the nomination. ''I think it would be better if he just stays out of the primary and the general election,'' he said. 
 Ron Nehring, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said the severity of the economic problems facing California would overshadow the immigration stances taken by the Republican candidate during the primaries. ''The Democrats are always trying to paint Republicans as anti-immigrant,'' he said. ''But the first, second, third and fourth issue in the race for governor is jobs and the economy.''
 Ms. Whitman's advisers said that if she won the nomination, she would move away from immigration to broaden her appeal. But Mr. Poizner said he would not change his campaign a bit. 
 ''This is important for everyone to know: What you see is what you get,'' he said. ''The campaign I'm waging now in the primary is exactly the same campaign I'll be waging in the general against Jerry Brown. I think it's a myth that independents, Democrats, these groups that supposedly would object to my strong positions on illegal immigration -- uh-uh.''

HEADLINE: With Drilling Stopped, Losses Could Multiply

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.; Jackie Calmes, Rob Harris and Robbie Brown contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Chett Chiasson, the executive director of Port Fourchon in Louisiana, has a message for President Obama -- and any Americans who have applauded the administration's decision to halt deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico: You just don't get it.
 ''I don't know that this country realizes the cascading impacts of this moratorium,'' said Mr. Chiasson, whose estimates that his port handles 90 percent of the traffic servicing the deep-water oil and gas industry in the gulf. ''It's going to have an impact for years to come.'' 
 The Interior Department's six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling most directly affects 17 oil companies, including multinational giants like BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron. The order, issued May 27, forced 33 rigs to shut down operations.
 Every one of those rigs is serviced out of Port Fourchon, according to Mr. Chiasson, so the drilling ban could end up slashing the incomes of thousands of other workers -- from welders and divers to caterers and drivers -- who depend on the industry.
 One oil industry group, the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, has estimated that each exploration and production job represents four supporting jobs in and around the region. If that is the case, thousands of jobs -- and millions of dollars in wages -- could be affected by the work stoppage, the group said. 
 With that in mind, a growing chorus of residents, business owners and local politicians in the gulf region are imploring the Obama administration to reconsider the deep-water drilling ban. 
 ''We need to know what you are prepared to do to prevent catastrophic damage to our battered economy,'' said an editorial addressed to the president that appeared in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans on Friday. ''It is not clear, Mr. President, why it will take six months to determine what went wrong on Deepwater Horizon and how to remedy safety deficiencies.''
 In a separate letter Wednesday to Mr. Obama and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana said: ''During one of the most challenging economic periods in decades, the last thing we need is to enact public policies that will certainly destroy thousands of existing jobs while preventing the creation of thousands more.'' 
 During a visit to Louisiana on Friday, Mr. Obama said he is sympathetic to the concerns and has urged his bipartisan commission investigating the spill to take less than six months to make their recommendations, if at all possible. However, the president added, ''I'm not going to cut corners on it.''
 ''If we don't do it right, then what you could end up seeing is an even worse impact on the oil industry down here, which is so important to so many jobs,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Under a legislative proposal put forth by the White House, workers who lose their jobs as a result of the moratorium would be eligible for unemployment assistance, and new jobs would be created in cleanup, restoration, renovation and recovery. 
 But for Mr. Chiasson and the myriad businesses clustered around Port Fourchon, that is likely to be cold comfort. 
 ''I have 37 employees, and I have to look at how I'm going to protect those jobs,'' Mr. Chiasson said. 
 When the Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20, releasing a still-continuing torrent of oil into the gulf, representatives from at least 13 different companies were on board. Besides high-level engineers and managers from Transocean, which operated the rig, and BP, which held the lease on it, the workers included cooks, tank washers and laundry workers employed by a medley of subcontracted companies.
 A long-term pause in deep-water work could be devastating to local economies already struggling with fishing restrictions, frightened tourists and other effects of the spill. 
 The biggest concern, said Larry Wall, a spokesman for the regional oil and gas group, is that rig owners and operators will ultimately cancel their contracts and move operations to the coastal areas of Africa, Brazil or other points abroad, rather than let rigs sit idle. 
 Should that happen en masse, it is unlikely that deep-water work in the gulf would resume quickly even after the moratorium is lifted, given the time and expense involved in relocating rigs.
 ''The owner of the rig, once he goes overseas, it's two years minimum before he comes back,'' Mr. Wall said. ''And there's a fixed number of those things in the world. If they keep moving, we're going to have a big problem in the gulf.'' 
 In some instances, oil companies are invoking what is known a ''force majeure'' clause in their drilling contracts with rig owners. Typically used in the event of hurricanes or other natural disasters, it allows the operator a way out of its contract when a major, unexpected event occurs. 
 Anadarko, one of the oil companies affected by the moratorium, said on Thursday that it had notified three of its drilling companies -- Noble, Transocean and Diamond Offshore Drilling -- of its plan to invoke the clause. 
 Diamond said that a different oil company also canceled a contract to use another one of its rigs, the Ocean Monarch. 
 Larry Dickerson, the president and chief executive of Diamond, said in an e-mail message that the future of that rig was ''uncertain, with a move to international waters the most likely outcome.'' 
 Mr. Dickerson said that while his company had not yet reduced staff, if the rig were forced to relocate, it would normally use local workers. ''I am sure our roustabouts and floor hands are worried,'' he said.
 Michael A. Pontiff, the sales manager for Gator Equipment Rental in Houma, La., a company that rents welding machines and air compressors to offshore drilling companies, said that he was not waiting for the worst, and that he had written letters to state leaders and Mr. Obama. 
 ''I'm a simple person,'' Mr. Pontiff said. ''I just want to know that our politicians are doing the right thing and that they know a lot of people's lives and livelihoods depend on it.''

HEADLINE: The Spill and Energy Bill

 BODY:
The nation's political leaders have had a lot to say in recent years about America's addiction to fossil fuels and the need to find cleaner, more climate-friendly alternatives. In recent weeks, they have had a lot to say about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. On Wednesday, President Obama put them together. 
 In a speech at Carnegie Mellon University, he invoked the spill to pound on Congress about its duty to pass a comprehensive energy bill that addresses oil dependency and global warming. The House has passed such a bill, but a companion measure in the Senate languishes, hostage to solid Republican opposition, exaggerated fears about its costs and timidity on the part of the Democratic leadership. ''I will work with anyone from either party to get this done,'' he said. 
 Mr. Obama's task is to follow up that vow with action. We are not optimistic that his implacable Republican opposition will work with him on anything. But perhaps the spreading nightmare on the waters of the gulf will get a few to break with the party line.
 The Senate bill is far from perfect. It coddles the coal companies, and its provisions for off-shore drilling will now have to be revised or at least tightened up with multiple safeguards. But for the first time, the bill would set a price on carbon-dioxide emissions, which are now dumped without penalty into the atmosphere. This is an essential prerequisite for shifting private and public investment to cleaner energy sources. 
 The oil savings would be substantial. According to a new study by the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, the bill's mandates for alternative fuels and more efficient vehicles would reduce oil imports one-third by 2035. 
 But instead of embracing this positive bill, the Senate is expected to vote soon on a measure that would move the country in exactly the wrong direction -- a resolution sponsored by Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, that would undercut the government's authority to regulate greenhouse gases and reduce the anticipated oil savings from the tough new fuel economy standards the White House announced last April. 
 As this page has noted before, persuading the Senate to act is not only a matter of leadership, but a matter of international obligation. At the Copenhagen climate conference in December, Mr. Obama committed the United States to a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 -- the minimum that scientists believe necessary to begin steering the world away from the worst impacts of a warming planet.
 Delivering on that pledge is even more urgent now than it was then. As he demonstrated at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Obama knows how to hit all the right notes rhetorically. Passing a comprehensive bill would be good for the economy, by creating new jobs; good for the environment, by reducing emissions; and good for national security, by reducing our dependence on unstable oil-producing countries. The president's task now is to convert that rhetorical fervor into actual, filibuster-proof votes.

HEADLINE: The Long Reach of a Gulf Coast Disaster

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY, WILLIAM YARDLEY, ABBY GOODNOUGH and MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
As BP continues to struggle to plug the leak at the bottom of the sea, the president tries to convince the country that he is on top of the crisis, and the first oil laps the coasts of previously untouched states, Americans far from the gulf are feeling touched by the disaster. A sampling:
 WYOMING
 An 'Oil City' Fears for Its Future 
 CASPER, Wyo. -- The lobby of the elegant old Casper Petroleum Club is filled with suggestions of its pro-oil ethos: a sign listing current crude and natural gas prices; a wall of plaques recognizing local companies in the business; and dozens of photographs of beaming engineers and executives who have served on the board of the private club over the years.
 But in recent weeks, some club members' smiles have been replaced by more fraught expressions as worries have grown not only about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but also about the potential blowback to Casper's No. 1 industry.
 ''Honestly, the first concern is the problem it is causing the Gulf Coast, because a lot of us have spent time down there,'' said Jimmy E. Goolsby, a geologist who lived in Texas before decamping to Casper some 35 years ago.
 ''But secondary to us, and very important to all of us, is what impact it's going to have on the oil and gas industry in the U.S.,'' Mr. Goolsby said. ''Is it going to be what Three Mile Island was to nuclear?''
 In Casper, a city of 52,000, oil and natural gas production and refining are as central to the lives of many residents as pick-up trucks and big sky. That concern spreads all the way from the white-tablecloth confines of the petroleum club to the white-bibbed customers at the Rialto Barber Shop.
 Ed Heatherington, who wields the razor beneath the watchful gaze of a stuffed pronghorn antelope at the Rialto, was measured in his response. ''It's a shame it happened,'' he said. ''But we're not living in an accident-free world.''
 But some of Mr. Heatherington's patrons were less forgiving Thursday morning as they chided President Obama for what they saw as a slow, haphazard response, as well as for his remarks Wednesday that he intended to roll back tax credits for the oil industry.
 ''He's just on another campaign trip,'' said Dee Beardsley, a 81-year-old retiree who worked for years as an operations manager in the energy industry. ''They're brain dead.''
 That Mr. Obama would be unpopular in this red state stronghold -- this is Dick Cheney's hometown, after all -- is not surprising. But BP, the London-based oil giant, also drew an angry response from some local residents.
 ''We kicked the British out of here 200 years ago,'' said Ken Melder, a drilling consultant from Glenrock, Wyo., in a neighboring county. ''And we ought to do it again.''
 Oil and gas have long been a part of life in Wyoming, where the first oil well was drilled in 1884, six years before the territory joined the union. Casper is no exception; sometimes known as ''the Oil City,'' it has a refinery on one edge of town, with gigantic oil reserve tanks on the other. Rail tracks, where piping and tanker cars are a constant presence, run through the center of town, not far from one of its tallest structures -- the six-story Petroleum Building.
 Most of those in the oil and gas business here are not big, multinational companies, Mr. Goolsby said. ''Most people here are like farmers: they just produce product,'' he said, meaning oil and natural gas. ''They don't have pipelines. They don't have refineries. They don't have outlets. They just produce.''
 Residents here are used to boom and bust cycles. In 2008, the oil and gas industry employed about 30,000 people and poured nearly $3 billion in Wyoming's coffers in taxes, royalties and other fees, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But local residents say the current oil scene is in a slump, and some said they feared more scrutiny from the government could prolong the slump.
 ''Back in the '80s, when the bubble burst, you'd go to lunch and come back and the doors would be locked,'' Mr. Beardsley said. ''I just hope that doesn't happen again.''
 Others -- particularly the young and able -- were not concerned that all that much would change because of the current slump, caused in part by the recession, or the gulf spill.
 Lucas Strawn, 21, had come to Casper to train for oil work after four years of working methane gas rigs north of here. He had more fear of dying on the job -- ''everything on a rig has a potential to kill you'' -- than his job dying on the vine.
 ''People still want to drive their cars,'' said Mr. Strawn, a Wyoming native, as he played pool in a local hall Thursday night. ''And if we don't drill, they don't drive.'' --JESSE McKINLEY

 Grief After Another Kind of Oil Disaster
 ANACORTES, Wash. -- Hershel and Bonita Janz say they have been struck by how little media attention has been given to the 11 people who died in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20.
 They understand that the nation is consumed with the environmental consequences of the spill, and they understand the worries Gulf Coast residents have over losing a way of life. But what about the loss of life?
 ''Today is the day, you know,'' Mrs. Janz said, the evening news on the television as the couple sat down for dinner. ''Two months today.''
 It was June 2, two months to the day after an explosion at the Tesoro oil refinery killed seven people. The Janzes' son, Lew, died after clinging to life for 11 days in a hospital burn unit, all but his eyes swaddled in blood-soaked bandages.
 ''It was a terrible, terrible way to die,'' Mr. Janz said.
 Will Lamphiear, an operator at the refinery 80 miles north of Seattle, said that having the gulf spill constantly in the news at the same time Anacortes has been holding memorial services for the Tesoro victims had made him realize that news coverage, however omnipresent, is not necessarily intimate. ''That's noise, that's a news story,'' he said. ''We feel this.''
 ''These were people you saw every day,'' he said. ''It's a balancing act, doing your job and dealing with the grief.''
 Homes here rattled with the explosion that night. The plant is still shut down and investigators are still at work. Yet even though the accident had much in common with what would happen in the gulf three weeks later -- the oil industry, a fiery explosion, tragic deaths, a pristine setting on the water, hard questions over what happened -- there was no oil spill here, no seemingly unsolvable environmental disaster. Grief is what people are trying to contain.
 But they remain committed to the industry.
 ''These things happen,'' Mr. Janz said, invoking the spill in the gulf as well as the 29 people who died in the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia in April. ''But we're not going to stop using coal and we're not going to stop using oil. Bad things happen to good people, and Lew was one of the best.''
 Officials say the refinery will reopen. Mr. Lamphiear and as many as 500 other employees and contractors are working to repair the facility. While the Tesoro plant had been fined for serious safety violations in the past, there has been no prominent effort to shut it down.
 ''I think things are really going to be up to snuff when they reopen,'' Mr. Janz said.

 NEW ENGLAND
 Far Away, Fishermen Watch: 'If It Was Us, That Would Be It'
 CHATHAM, Mass. -- The fishermen unloading thousands of pounds of cod from weathered boats Thursday in Chatham, Mass., appeared untouched by the crisis in the Gulf of Mexico; it was business as usual, and some predicted it would stay that way.
 ''We won't feel it,'' Peter Taylor, a native of Cape Cod who has spent his life fishing its waters, said as seals hungrily circled his boat at the Chatham Fish Pier. ''The only long-term outcome is there'll never be any drilling up here on Georges Bank.''
 But others suspect the spill might affect their livelihood, for worse or even for better. It depends partly on whether the spill kills the hatchlings of bluefin tuna, a prized New England catch that spawns in the gulf before migrating to Cape Cod.
 ''That's first and foremost on everyone's minds,'' said Rick Thompson, who was packing the day's catch in ice for shipment to markets and restaurants, ''but that's not going to be felt right away -- probably down the road.''
 Some are also wondering whether, in the shorter term, a shortage of seafood from the gulf might increase demand -- and prices -- for their own catch.
 ''If markets open up for ground fish to be shipped down there,'' said Neil Kelly, operations manager at the Nantucket Fish Company, a wholesaler, ''that would be great for the guys around here.''
 Mr. Kelly's boss, Andy Baler, said typical New England species like haddock, pollock and cod were not popular in the South, so people there would not be likely to turn to New England for replacement fish.
 ''It's hard to change appetites,'' he said, ''but we'll keep working on it.''
 The one exception could be oysters, Mr. Baler said, adding that the cold-water varieties are far more expensive than those caught in the gulf.
 ''We'll probably start seeing calls from down South,'' he said. ''We'll probably see a little jump in price there.''
 So far, Mr. Baler said, the biggest impact on Cape Cod fishermen has been the stress of imagining what would happen if they ever had a similar spill.
 ''The main effect is all of us losing sleep at night,'' he said, ''thinking about what's happened down there. If it was us, that would be it -- we'd be done as an industry. We'd fold.''
 Still, New England fishermen are facing a legion of problems themselves, from depleted fish stocks to what they consider overly burdensome regulations governing when, where and how much they can fish. Those obstacles feel far more threatening than an oil spill more than a thousand miles away, Mr. Taylor said.
 ''If the oil companies had the kind of government oversight that the fishing industry has to deal with,'' he said, ''there would never have been a spill.''

 PROTEST
 Environmental Groups Stage 'Citizen's Arrest' of BP Leader
 WASHINGTON -- BP's embattled chief executive, Tony Hayward, was placed under ''citizen's arrest'' by a coalition of environmental advocates Friday in front of the company's Washington offices. Not surprisingly, Mr. Hayward did not show up.
 But 70 or so demonstrators did, along with about half as many reporters and photographers.
 In sweltering midday heat, the protesters waved homemade signs ( ''Crude Awakening'' ), brandished pictures of oil-soaked birds and delivered megaphone speeches next to a 20-foot-high inflatable yellow oil drum.
 ''BP, you're under citizen's arrest,'' declared Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth. ''And it will be us, the U.S. citizens, who will be your judge and jury.''
 According to the demonstrators, everyone wants clean energy, and they want it right now. There was also a motley cry of ''Hey hey, ho ho, BP's negligence has got to go.''
 In the scene's emotional crescendo, Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, one of the organizers of the gathering, led the protesters to the front entrance of the glass building that houses BP's offices on the seventh floor. But a beefy security guard denied them entrance.
 Standing nearby, a spokeswoman for Public Citizen, Barbara Holzer, tried to speak over the din of a ''Spill, baby, spill'' chant. ''I think Mr. Hayward should turn in his pinstripes for prison stripes,'' she said.
 The Obama administration did not escape indictment. Activists described the White House reaction to the spill as ''uneven,'' ''lackluster'' and ''insufficiently tough'' on BP, and some expressed frustration that the administration had not seized on the spill as a chance to promote a bolder energy agenda.
 ''Until recently, the administration has not used this as a chance to talk about clean energy or reducing dependence on oil,'' said Nick Berning of Friends of the Earth. ''You don't have moments like this often in the energy debate. And it seems like the administration could be using this more.''

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Hit a Brooklyn Area Over and Over

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Christina Nieves's life revolves around a handful of blocks in Brooklyn: Drop off her 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son at the Strong Place day care center. Make sure her 75-year-old grandmother, who uses a wheelchair, makes it to lunch at the Gowanus Senior Center. Then, on too many occasions to count, take her son, who is asthmatic and prone to seizures, to the Wyckoff children's clinic. 
 And with warm days now here, watch her children frolic at the Douglass and DeGraw pool. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to close all four places. 
 ''My doctor, my school, my grandmother's senior center -- wow, what else is left?'' said Ms. Nieves, 25, who sometimes volunteers at the day care center. ''I understand one thing -- but come on, all these things happening at the same time? This is crazy. Crazy.''
 When Mr. Bloomberg unveiled his budget a few weeks ago, he warned that no neighborhood would be spared in his struggle to plug a $5 billion gap. But in making steep across-the-board cuts to dozens of agencies and programs, it was almost inevitable that they would fall heaviest on some neighborhoods. 
 And if there is one place that for sheer density and variety of affected services is the epicenter of budget pain, it is a tiny slice of Brooklyn covering six blocks by eight blocks, straddling Gowanus, Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill, according to an analysis by The New York Times of the location of the facilities already singled out for closing.
 Within a 10-minute walk, three day care centers, one senior center, one swimming pool, one after-school program and a health clinic are to close. Venture 20 minutes more, and six additional facilities -- two day care centers, two after-school programs, a senior center and a health clinic -- are also to shut down on July 1, the start of the new fiscal year. Making matters worse, the nearest public transit option -- the B37 bus along Third Avenue -- is being eliminated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 How dire the final picture ends up being is murky, because the City Council must weigh in on the mayor's proposal, and a new state budget that could yield more money for New York is nowhere in sight. But with the city and the state in their worst financial shape in decades, the Bloomberg administration says there may be no way to avoid carrying out its menu of cuts. 
 ''Budget choices are made in each area through this lens: how can we reduce spending while having the smallest impact on the most essential services, and impact the fewest number of New Yorkers, particularly the fewest number of vulnerable New Yorkers,'' said Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg.
 Advocates for programs whose survival is threatened acknowledge the city's dilemma, but they argue that the Bloomberg administration failed to truly appreciate how cutting a potpourri of programs might damage individual neighborhoods. 
 ''I worry that the various agencies are making their decisions in a vacuum, and I worry that there could be a domino effect for families,'' said Allison Sesso, deputy executive director of the Human Services Council of New York City, an umbrella group of nonprofit social service agencies. ''People get used to these services being in their community, and these services have connections to other services in their community, and once they disappear, people don't know where to be referred to.''
 But city officials defended their decisions, arguing that the lingering economic downturn coupled with the budget stalemate in Albany left them no option. They said they tried to spread the pain as evenly as possible while taking into account changes in the neighborhood, like gentrification, that may affect local needs.
 Still, even more alarming to advocates is that the city has yet to identify the dozens of libraries and the fire companies it plans to close. Beyond ending programs wholesale, the city is also considering steep cuts to adult literacy programs, child welfare services and the corps of school nurses. 
 In Brooklyn, the streets around Gowanus bustle with chic restaurants like the Black Mountain Winehouse and handsome brownstones with immaculate gardens. But the area also features two large public housing complexes, rising numbers of food stamp recipients and five public schools that provide free or reduced-cost lunches to most of their students.
 The Gowanus Senior Center, one of 50 scheduled to close, serves 30 meals a day in a room painted bright yellow and orange, its walls adorned with masks made by the people who use it. The clients -- 60 percent of them Latino, and 40 percent African-American -- are fiercely loyal, and are worried about relocating to the next-closest center, a walk of 20 to 25 minutes even for the most able-bodied.
 Carmen Zayas, 58, a nurse's aide who is retired, spends several hours a day at the center and helped paint the room and hang the flags of a dozen countries from Latin America and the Caribbean on the wall. ''This is a happy place because we're like family here, so if Bloomberg shuts us down, it would be like me losing a child,'' she said.
 Ms. Nieves's grandmother, Rose Garcia, is another regular. ''She's been going there ever since my grandfather died,'' Ms. Nieves said. ''It's like she gets her mind occupied. 
 ''But what's she going to do now? It's not like these streets are O.K. all the time,'' Ms. Nieves said, noting the fatal shooting in May of a 16-year-old girl a couple of blocks away.
 Visiting the center, on Baltic Street, Councilman Stephen Levin, who represents the neighborhood, said, ''When I saw this center on the list, it broke my heart.'' 
 Around the corner, the Bethel Baptist and Strong Place day care centers on Hoyt Street are 2 of 16 around the city that are closing. Housed in the same building, they serve 95 children, ages 2 to 5, from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Parents, many of whom are single mothers, rave about the academic preparation (the children are currently studying Langston Hughes) and artistic inspiration (Miro and Pollock are in vogue), and alumni have gone on to colleges like Barnard and the University of Pennsylvania.
 But city officials say that the annual rent of $624,000 is too high and that the increasingly upscale neighborhood no longer needs as many slots for children from low-income families. Families pay a minimum of $5 a week, based on a sliding scale of income.
 But Joan Morris, director of the Bethel Baptist day care center, said city officials misunderstood the neighborhood's dynamics. ''We have families in shelters, homeless,'' she said. ''For the city to snatch things without -- I don't know, due process? -- is a callous disregard for families.''
 Stephanie Barry was so impressed by the academic program and fresh meals at Strong Place that she kept her 3-year-old daughter, Zya, home until a slot opened up in January. 
 ''It's been great,'' said Ms. Barry, 36. ''She's around other kids, socializing; she's doing great art projects; she's learning so much.'' About four blocks away, an after-school program at New Horizons Middle School 442, run by Good Shepherd Services, is closing, as well.
 Carline Clerge, a social worker employed by the city's Human Resources Administration, credits the program with giving her son, Sharod, 14, structure and nurturing, with sports, drama, financial literacy and other programs. Never was that support more vital, she said, than in 2008, when her daughter, Sashanna, spent the last months of her life hospitalized with bone cancer.
 As Sharod chooses a high school next year, one factor, Ms. Clerge said, is proximity to the middle school, because he wants to be a counselor in the after-school program. Ms. Clerge worries about what he might do if it closes, and where he might go once classes end.
 ''My heart will not be still,'' she said. ''Maybe he can go to the library. If the library is still open.''

HEADLINE: The Long Reach of a Gulf Coast Disaster

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY, WILLIAM YARDLEY, ABBY GOODNOUGH and MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
As BP continues to struggle to plug the leak at the bottom of the sea, the president tries to convince the country that he is on top of the crisis, and the first oil laps the coasts of previously untouched states, Americans far from the gulf are feeling touched by the disaster. A sampling:
 * Wyoming: An 'Oil City' Fears for Its Future * Washington: Grief After Another Kind of Oil Disaster * New England: Fishermen Watch From Far Away * Protest: Environmental Groups Call for Alternative Energy
 WYOMING 
 An 'Oil City' Fears for Its Future
 CASPER, Wyo. - The lobby of the elegant old Casper Petroleum Club is filled with suggestions of its pro-oil ethos: a sign listing current crude and natural gas prices; a wall of plaques recognizing local companies in the business; and dozens of photographs of beaming engineers and executives who have served on the board of the private club over the years.
 But in recent weeks, some club members' smiles have been replaced by more fraught expressions as worries have grown not only about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but also about the potential blowback to Casper's No. 1 industry.
 ''Honestly, the first concern is the problem it is causing the Gulf Coast, because a lot of us have spent time down there,'' said Jimmy E. Goolsby, a geologist who lived in Texas before decamping to Casper some 35 years ago.
 ''But secondary to us, and very important to all of us, is what impact it's going to have on the oil and gas industry in the U.S.,'' Mr. Goolsby said. ''Is it going to be what Three Mile Island was to nuclear?''
 In Casper, a city of 52,000, oil and natural gas production and refining are as central to the lives of many residents as pick-up trucks and big sky. That concern spreads all the way from the white-tablecloth confines of the petroleum club to the white-bibbed customers at the Rialto Barber Shop.
 Ed Heatherington, who wields the razor beneath the watchful gaze of a stuffed pronghorn antelope at the Rialto, was measured in his response. ''It's a shame it happened,'' he said. ''But we're not living in an accident-free world.''
 But some of Mr. Heatherington's patrons were less forgiving Thursday morning as they chided President Obama for what they saw as a slow, haphazard response, as well as for his remarks Wednesday that he intended to roll back tax credits for the oil industry.
 ''He's just on another campaign trip,'' said Dee Beardsley, a 81-year-old retiree who worked for years as an operations manager in the energy industry. ''They're brain dead.''
 That Mr. Obama would be unpopular in this red state stronghold - this is Dick Cheney's hometown, after all - is not surprising. But BP, the London-based oil giant, also drew an angry response from some local residents.
 ''We kicked the British out of here 200 years ago,'' said Ken Melder, a drilling consultant from Glenrock, Wyo., in a neighboring county. ''And we ought to do it again.''
 Oil and gas have long been a part of life in Wyoming, where the first oil well was drilled in 1884, six years before the territory joined the union. Casper is no exception; sometimes known as ''the Oil City,'' it has a refinery on one edge of town, with gigantic oil reserve tanks on the other. Rail tracks, where piping and tanker cars are a constant presence, run through the center of town, not far from one of its tallest structures - the six-story Petroleum Building.
 Most of those in the oil and gas business here are not big, multinational companies, Mr. Goolsby said. ''Most people here are like farmers: they just produce product,'' he said, meaning oil and natural gas. ''They don't have pipelines. They don't have refineries. They don't have outlets. They just produce.''
 Residents here are used to boom and bust cycles. In 2008, the oil and gas industry employed about 30,000 people and poured nearly $3 billion in Wyoming's coffers in taxes, royalties and other fees, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But local residents say the current oil scene is in a slump, and some said they feared more scrutiny from the government could prolong the slump.
 ''Back in the '80s, when the bubble burst, you'd go to lunch and come back and the doors would be locked,'' Mr. Beardsley said. ''I just hope that doesn't happen again.''
 Others - particularly the young and able - were not concerned that all that much would change because of the current slump, caused in part by the recession, or the gulf spill.
 Lucas Strawn, 21, had come to Casper to train for oil work after four years of working methane gas rigs north of here. He had more fear of dying on the job - ''everything on a rig has a potential to kill you'' - than his job dying on the vine.
 ''People still want to drive their cars,'' said Mr. Strawn, a Wyoming native, as he played pool in a local hall Thursday night. ''And if we don't drill, they don't drive.'' -JESSE McKINLEY
 WASHINGTON
 Grief After Another Kind of Oil Disaster
 ANACORTES, Wash. - Hershel and Bonita Janz say they have been struck by how little media attention has been given to the 11 people who died in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20.
 They understand that the nation is consumed with the environmental consequences of the spill, and they understand the worries Gulf Coast residents have over losing a way of life. But what about the loss of life?
 ''Today is the day, you know,'' Mrs. Janz said, the evening news on the television as the couple sat down for dinner. ''Two months today.''
 It was June 2, two months to the day after an explosion at the Tesoro oil refinery killed seven people. The Janzes' son, Lew, died after clinging to life for 11 days in a hospital burn unit, all but his eyes swaddled in blood-soaked bandages.
 ''It was a terrible, terrible way to die,'' Mr. Janz said.
 Will Lamphiear, an operator at the refinery 80 miles north of Seattle, said that having the gulf spill constantly in the news at the same time Anacortes has been holding memorial services for the Tesoro victims had made him realize that news coverage, however omnipresent, is not necessarily intimate. ''That's noise, that's a news story,'' he said. ''We feel this.''
 ''These were people you saw every day,'' he said. ''It's a balancing act, doing your job and dealing with the grief.''
 Homes here rattled with the explosion that night. The plant is still shut down and investigators are still at work. Yet even though the accident had much in common with what would happen in the gulf three weeks later - the oil industry, a fiery explosion, tragic deaths, a pristine setting on the water, hard questions over what happened - there was no oil spill here, no seemingly unsolvable environmental disaster. Grief is what people are trying to contain.
 But they remain committed to the industry.
 ''These things happen,'' Mr. Janz said, invoking the spill in the gulf as well as the 29 people who died in the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia in April. ''But we're not going to stop using coal and we're not going to stop using oil. Bad things happen to good people, and Lew was one of the best.''
 Officials say the refinery will reopen. Mr. Lamphiear and as many as 500 other employees and contractors are working to repair the facility. While the Tesoro plant had been fined for serious safety violations in the past, there has been no prominent effort to shut it down.
 ''I think things are really going to be up to snuff when they reopen,'' Mr. Janz said.

 Far Away, Fishermen Watch: 'If It Was Us, That Would Be It'
 CHATHAM, Mass. - The fishermen unloading thousands of pounds of cod from weathered boats Thursday in Chatham, Mass., appeared untouched by the crisis in the Gulf of Mexico; it was business as usual, and some predicted it would stay that way.
 ''We won't feel it,'' Peter Taylor, a native of Cape Cod who has spent his life fishing its waters, said as seals hungrily circled his boat at the Chatham Fish Pier. ''The only long-term outcome is there'll never be any drilling up here on Georges Bank.''
 But others suspect the spill might affect their livelihood, for worse or even for better. It depends partly on whether the spill kills the hatchlings of bluefin tuna, a prized New England catch that spawns in the gulf before migrating to Cape Cod.
 ''That's first and foremost on everyone's minds,'' said Rick Thompson, who was packing the day's catch in ice for shipment to markets and restaurants, ''but that's not going to be felt right away - probably down the road.''
 Some are also wondering whether, in the shorter term, a shortage of seafood from the gulf might increase demand - and prices - for their own catch.
 ''If markets open up for ground fish to be shipped down there,'' said Neil Kelly, operations manager at the Nantucket Fish Company, a wholesaler, ''that would be great for the guys around here.''
 Mr. Kelly's boss, Andy Baler, said typical New England species like haddock, pollock and cod were not popular in the South, so people there would not be likely to turn to New England for replacement fish.
 ''It's hard to change appetites,'' he said, ''but we'll keep working on it.''
 The one exception could be oysters, Mr. Baler said, adding that the cold-water varieties are far more expensive than those caught in the gulf.
 ''We'll probably start seeing calls from down South,'' he said. ''We'll probably see a little jump in price there.''
 So far, Mr. Baler said, the biggest impact on Cape Cod fishermen has been the stress of imagining what would happen if they ever had a similar spill.
 ''The main effect is all of us losing sleep at night,'' he said, ''thinking about what's happened down there. If it was us, that would be it - we'd be done as an industry. We'd fold.''
 Still, New England fishermen are facing a legion of problems themselves, from depleted fish stocks to what they consider overly burdensome regulations governing when, where and how much they can fish. Those obstacles feel far more threatening than an oil spill more than a thousand miles away, Mr. Taylor said.
 ''If the oil companies had the kind of government oversight that the fishing industry has to deal with,'' he said, ''there would never have been a spill.''

 PROTEST
 Environmental Groups Stage 'Citizen's Arrest' of BP Leader
 WASHINGTON - BP's embattled chief executive, Tony Hayward, was placed under ''citizen's arrest'' by a coalition of environmental advocates Friday in front of the company's Washington offices. Not surprisingly, Mr. Hayward did not show up.
 But 70 or so demonstrators did, along with about half as many reporters and photographers.
 In sweltering midday heat, the protesters waved homemade signs ( ''Crude Awakening'' ), brandished pictures of oil-soaked birds and delivered megaphone speeches next to a 20-foot-high inflatable yellow oil drum.
 ''BP, you're under citizen's arrest,'' declared Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth. ''And it will be us, the U.S. citizens, who will be your judge and jury.''
 According to the demonstrators, everyone wants clean energy, and they want it right now. There was also a motley cry of ''Hey hey, ho ho, BP's negligence has got to go.''
 In the scene's emotional crescendo, Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, one of the organizers of the gathering, led the protesters to the front entrance of the glass building that houses BP's offices on the seventh floor. But a beefy security guard denied them entrance.
 Standing nearby, a spokeswoman for Public Citizen, Barbara Holzer, tried to speak over the din of a ''Spill, baby, spill'' chant. ''I think Mr. Hayward should turn in his pinstripes for prison stripes,'' she said.
 The Obama administration did not escape indictment. Activists described the White House reaction to the spill as ''uneven,'' ''lackluster'' and ''insufficiently tough'' on BP, and some expressed frustration that the administration had not seized on the spill as a chance to promote a bolder energy agenda.
 ''Until recently, the administration has not used this as a chance to talk about clean energy or reducing dependence on oil,'' said Nick Berning of Friends of the Earth. ''You don't have moments like this often in the energy debate. And it seems like the administration could be using this more.''

HEADLINE: Obama Warns BP on Paying Big Dividends Amid Oil Spill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Michael Cooper reported from New Orleans, Peter Baker from Washington and Henry Fountain from New York. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- President Obama visited the Gulf Coast on Friday and chastised BP for paying billions of dollars in dividends to shareholders and on advertising to save its image while some people whose livelihoods were wrecked by the company's oil spill were reporting difficulties in getting their claims paid.
 ''My understanding is that BP has contracted for $50 million worth of TV advertising to manage their image during the course of this disaster,'' President Obama said after meeting with local and federal officials at the airport near here.
 ''In addition, there are reports that BP will be paying $10.5 billion that's billion, with a B in dividend payments this quarter,'' he continued. ''Now I don't have a problem with BP fulfilling its legal obligations, but I want BP to be very clear they've got moral and legal obligations here in the Gulf for the damage that has been done. And what I don't want to hear is, when they're spending that kind of money on their shareholders, and spending that kind of money on TV advertising, that they're nickel-and-diming fisherman or small businesses here in the Gulf who are having a hard time.'' 
 The president's stern words for BP came after he faced a barrage of criticism for not showing enough anger, or emotion, in the face of an environmental disaster that is now nearly seven weeks in the making. 
 On this trip he made sure to meet with people directly affected by the disaster, paying a visit to Camardelle's Live Bait and Boiled Seafood on Grand Isle to visit with an oysterman, a shrimper, and some local business owners and officials. And officials announced that President Obama would meet at the White House next Thursday with relatives of those killed on the Deepwater Horizon rig to offer his condolences.
 Officials reported tentative signs of progress in their latest efforts to contain the spill, which has pumped millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Obama, however, cautioned that ''it is way too early to be optimistic.''
 The failure to stop the leak has fed concern about the administration's powerlessness in the face of this crisis, and the White House, hoping to keep an environmental disaster from turning into a political one, has been determined to show that it is fully engaged.
 Federal officials have been assigned to look over the claims process to make sure that BP pays valid claims, the president said. ''They say they want to make it right that's part of their advertising campaign well we want them to make it right,'' he said.
 ''The fact that BP could pay a $10.5 billion dividend payment is indicative of how much money these folks have been making,'' he said. ''Given the fact that they didn't fully account for the risks, I don't want somebody else bearing the costs of those risks that they took.''
 Many local officials have expressed concern that the moratorium on some drilling operations that the president declared could end up harming the Gulf Coast economy as it reels from the oil spill. President Obama said that if a commission he has appointed to study the safety of offshore drilling is able to reach conclusions about how such drilling can be done safely, he would be open to allowing drilling to resume sooner.
 ''We discovered that companies like BP, who had provided assurances that they had failsafe, back-up, redundant systems, in fact not only didn't have failsafe systems but had no idea what to do when those failsafe systems broke down,'' he said.
 In response to the president's comments, BP said later on Friday that it would be sending another payment this month to people and businesses who lost income due to the oil spill. With the second payment, it said, it will have spent $84 million reimbursing people for their loss of income.
 ''We deeply regret the impact the oil spill has had on individuals and businesses, and understand the need for quick and reasonable compensation,'' Doug Suttles, its chief operating officer, said in a statement.
 As for efforts to stanch the flow of oil from the leaking well, Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, who is commanding the federal response to the disaster, said earlier in the day that some oil had been collected in a cap that was placed over the well and that it was beginning to be funneled up to a ship on the surface. But he noted that a great deal of oil was still escaping, by design, through vents in the cap. The vents were intended to let some oil out in order to keep cold Gulf water from rushing in and forming icy hydrates that could block the flow of captured oil to the surface. 
 Until those vents are closed, it will not be clear whether the cap is seated tightly enough on the cut end of the well's riser pipe to prevent large amounts of oil from continuing to pour into the Gulf of Mexico, Admiral Allen said. He said that current plans call for closing those vents on Friday. 
 He said that a rough estimate of the rate at which leaking oil was being captured by the cap was 1,000 barrels a day, a small fraction of the estimated 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil a day that is gushing into the Gulf. But he said that as the vents on the cap are progressively closed, more oil should be captured, as long as the seal continues to hold.
 The president traveled here to assess the situation and meet with officials responding to the crisis on Friday, after the White House announced late Thursday night that he would be cancelling a trip he had planned to Australia, Indonesia and Guam.
 President Obama made the decision to postpone his trip to Indonesia and Australia, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told pool reporters traveling here with the president. ''The president made the decision that with all that's going on, particularly on the response right now, it would be difficult to go,'' he said. 
 Mr. Obama has called the spill his ''highest priority'' and the White House understands it will absorb a considerable portion of the president's time this summer. 
 The president arrived at the New Orleans airport in Kenner, La., at 1:07 p.m., and went into a field house at the airport for a briefing from local, state and federal officials. He was greeted at the airport by Admiral Allen and Gulf Coast officials, including Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama and Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida.
 From here, the president planned to travel on to Grand Isle, La., officials said.
 BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, told investors on Friday that ''the financial consequences of this incident will undoubtedly be severe,'' but that BP's current finances give it ''significant flexibility in dealing with the costs of this incident.'' He declined to estimate how much it would cost to stop the leak and clean up the spill.
 In his first address to BP investors since the April accident, Mr. Hayward apologized for the damage the company caused to American citizens, to the gulf region, and to the company's employees, investors and other stakeholders.
 ''Everyone at BP is heartbroken by this event, by the loss of life and by the damage to the environment and to the livelihoods of the people of the Gulf Coast,'' Mr. Hayward said on a call with investors. ''It should not have happened, and we are bound and determined to learn every lesson to try and ensure it never happens again.''
 BP plans to set up a separate organization to manage the response once the well is no longer leaking oil. That would allow some BP employees to focus exclusively on the situation in the Gulf rather than being sidetracked to run the daily operation of the company, Mr. Hayward said. The unit will be led by Robert Dudley, the former chief executive of BP's Russian venture.
 Mr. Obama's decision to cancel his Asia trip underscored the way the oil spill is forcing the White House to recalibrate plans for this summer. BP and the government have given up trying to plug the leak and are focusing now on siphoning or containing it until relief wells can be completed, perhaps by August. As a result, the president faces another two months in crisis management before he can even turn his focus exclusively to cleanup and recovery.
 On Thursday, the White House announced that it had sent a $69 million bill to BP for the first installment of clean up costs. The White House has made a point of criticizing BP lately and the Justice Department has opened criminal investigation into what caused the April 20 explosion that ultimately sank the Deepwater Horizon rig, killed 11 workers and touched off the leak.
 Mr. Obama, who has also been confronted by questions about his cool public reaction, said Thursday night that he is ''furious at this entire situation'' but does not show it because it does not accomplish anything.
 ''I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people,'' he said on ''Larry King Live'' on CNN. ''But that's not the job I was hired to do. My job is to solve this problem and ultimately this isn't about me and how angry I am. Ultimately, this is about the people down in the Gulf who are being impacted and what am I doing to make sure that they're able to salvage their way of life.''

HEADLINE: At Issue in Gulf: Who Was in Charge?

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from New Orleans, and Tom Zeller from New York.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Over six days in May, far from the familiar choreography of Washington hearings, federal investigators grilled workers involved in the Deepwater Horizon disaster in a chilly, sterile conference room at a hotel near the airport here. 
 The six-member panel of Coast Guard and Minerals Management Service officials pressed for answers about what occurred on the rig on April 20 before it exploded. They wanted to know who was in charge, and heard conflicting answers. 
 They pushed for more insight into an argument on the rig that day between a manager for BP, the well's owner, and one for Transocean, the rig's owner, and asked Curt R. Kuchta, the rig's captain, how the crew knew who was in charge. 
 ''It's pretty well understood amongst the crew who's in charge,'' he said. 
 ''How do they know that?'' a Coast Guard investigator asked. 
 ''I guess, I don't know,'' Captain Kuchta said. ''But it's pretty well -- everyone knows.'' 
 Looking annoyed, Capt. Hung Nguyen of the Coast Guard, one of the chief federal investigators, shook his head. The exchange confirmed an observation he had made earlier in the day at the hearing.
 ''A lot of activities seem not very tightly coordinated in the way that would make me comfortable,'' he said. ''Maybe that's just the way of business out there.'' 
 Investigators have focused on the minute-to-minute decisions and breakdowns to understand what led to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon, killing 11 people and setting off the largest oil spill in United States history and an environmental disaster. But the lack of coordination was not limited to the day of the explosion. 
 New government and BP documents, interviews with experts and testimony by witnesses provide the clearest indication to date that a hodgepodge of oversight agencies granted exceptions to rules, allowed risks to accumulate and made a disaster more likely on the rig, particularly with a mix of different companies operating on the Deepwater whose interests were not always in sync.
 And in the aftermath, arguments about who is in charge of the cleanup -- often a signal that no one is in charge -- have led to delays, distractions and disagreements over how to cap the well and defend the coastline. As a result, with oil continuing to gush a mile below the surface in the Gulf of Mexico, the laws of physics are largely in control, creating the daunting challenge of trying to plug a hole at depths where equipment is straining under more than a ton of pressure per square inch. 
 Tad W. Patzek, chairman of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas, Austin, has analyzed reports of what led to the explosion. ''It's a very complex operation in which the human element has not been aligned with the complexity of the system,'' he said in an interview last week.
 His conclusion could also apply to what occurred long before the disaster.
 Exceptions Are the Rule
 Deepwater oil production in the gulf, which started in 1979 but expanded much faster in the mid-1990s with new technology and federal incentives, is governed as much by exceptions to rules as by the rules themselves.
 Under a process called ''alternative compliance,'' much of the technology used on deepwater rigs has been approved piecemeal, with regulators cooperating with industry groups to make small adjustments to guidelines that were drawn up decades ago for shallow-water drilling. 
 Of roughly 3,500 drilling rigs and production platforms in the gulf, fewer than 50 are in waters deeper than 1,000 feet. But the risks and challenges associated with this deeper water are much greater.
 ''The pace of technology has definitely outrun the regulations,'' Lt. Cmdr. Michael Odom of the Coast Guard, who inspects the rigs, said last month at a hearing. 
 As a result, deepwater rigs operate under an ad hoc system of exceptions. The deeper the water, the further the exceptions stretch, not just from federal guidelines but also often from company policy.
 So, for example, when BP officials first set their sights on extracting the oily riches under what is known as Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico, they asked for and received permission from federal regulators to exempt the drilling project from federal law that requires a rigorous type of environmental review, internal documents and federal records indicate. 
 As BP engineers planned to set certain pipes and casings for lining the well in place in the ocean floor, they had to get permission from company managers to use riskier equipment because that equipment deviated from the company's own design and safety policies, according to internal BP documents obtained by The New York Times. 
 And when company officials wanted to test the blowout preventer, a crucial fail-safe mechanism on the pipe near the ocean floor, at a lower pressure than was federally required, regulators granted an exception, documents released last week show.
 Regulators granted yet another exception when BP sought to delay mandatory testing of that blowout preventer because they had lost ''well control,'' weeks before the rig exploded, BP e-mail messages show. 
 The Minerals Management Service, which regulates offshore drilling, went along with these requests partly because the agency has for years had a dual role of both fostering and policing the industry -- collecting royalty payments from the drilling companies while also levying fines on them for violations of law. 
 Its safety inspections usually consist of helicopter visits to offshore rigs to sift through company reports of self-administered tests.
 Even Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, who oversees the minerals agency, has said that oil companies have a history of ''running the show'' at the agency, a problem he has vowed to correct. 
 The minerals agency shares responsibility for oversight of drilling in the gulf with many others. The Environmental Protection Agency and others review offshore drilling for potential damage to wildlife and the environment. The Coast Guard inspects vessels for seaworthiness and licenses crew members to work on the rigs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration monitors dangerous weather conditions over deep seas. 
 And regulatory duties extend even past the federal government. Foreign countries, or ''flag states,'' where many oil rigs are registered, have their own sets of safety requirements and inspections.
 Regulations have not kept up with the risks that deepwater drilling poses.
 On the Deepwater Horizon, for example, the minerals agency approved a drilling plan for BP that cited the ''worst case'' for a blowout as one that might produce 250,000 barrels of oil per day, federal records show. But the agency did not require the rig to create a response plan for such a situation. 
 If a blowout were to occur, BP said in its plan, the first choice would be to use a containment dome to capture the leaking oil. But regulators did not require that a containment dome be kept on the rig to speed the response to a spill. After the rig explosion, BP took two weeks to build one on shore and three days to ship it out to sea before it was lowered over the gushing pipe on May 7. It did not work. 
 (The rig's ''spill response plan,'' provided to The Times, includes a Web link for a contractor that goes to an Asian shopping Web site and also mentions the importance of protecting walruses, seals and sea lions, none of which inhabit the area of drilling. The agency approved the plan.) 
 More broadly, regulators have not required technology and strategies for dealing with deepwater spills to be improved.
 Engineers trying to control the blowout are using the same tactics they used in 1979 when the Ixtoc I well blew up in the Bay of Campeche off the coast of Mexico. In the earlier blowout, they first tried lowering a containment dome over the leak. When that failed, they unsuccessfully tried to inject golf balls and other material in a move called a junk shot, which was also tried and abandoned for the Deepwater Horizon. 
 Questions of oversight also came up in the New Orleans hearings last month. For example, Michael J. Saucier, an official with the Minerals Management Service, said that his agency ''highly encouraged'' -- but did not require -- companies to have backup systems to trigger blowout preventers in case of an emergency. 
 ''Highly encourage?'' Captain Nguyen of the Coast Guard asked. ''How does that translate to enforcement?'' 
 ''There is no enforcement,'' Mr. Saucier answered.
 Problems Early On
 In some ways it was jinxed from the start.
 As early as June 2009, BP engineers had expressed concerns in internal documents about using certain casings for the well because they violated the company's safety and design guidelines. But they proceeded with those casings. 
 Mechanical problems started in March with the Deepwater, setting the stage for the April 20 explosion. 
 More than five weeks before disaster, the rig was hit by several sudden pulsations of gas called ''kicks'' and a pipe had become stuck in the well. The blowout preventer, designed to seal the well in an emergency, had been discovered to be leaking fluids at least three times. 
 Dealing with these problems required teamwork, a challenge to the throng of different companies with responsibilities on the rig. Of the 126 people present on the day of the explosion, only eight were employees of BP. The interests of the workers did not always align. 
 In testimony to government investigators, rig workers repeatedly described a ''natural conflict'' between BP, which can make more money by completing drilling jobs quickly, and Transocean, which receives a leasing fee from BP every day that it continues drilling.
 Halliburton was also on hand to provide cementing services, while a subsidiary monitored various drilling fluids. A different company provided drilling fluid systems, another provided technicians to operate the remote-control vehicles that are they eyes of the rig crew deep underwater, and yet another provided the well casing. 
 Amid this tangle of overlapping authority and competing interests, no one was solely responsible for ensuring the rig's safety, and communication was a constant challenge. 
 ''I don't have a feeling that there is somebody who has a handle on the coordination of all the activities on this vessel, going from routine to crisis,'' Captain Nguyen said during one hearing. ''BP is in charge of certain things, Transocean is in charge of certain things.''
 Financial concerns added pressures on the rig.
 BP had fallen behind schedule and over budget, paying roughly $500,000 a day to lease the rig from Transocean. The rig was 43 days late for starting a new drilling job for BP by the day of the explosion, a delay that had already cost the company more than $21 million.
 With the clock ticking, bad decisions went unchecked, warning signs went unheeded and small lapses compounded. 
 On April 1, a job log written by a Halliburton employee, Marvin Volek, warns that BP's use of cement ''was against our best practices.'' 
 An April 18 internal Halliburton memorandum indicates that Halliburton again warned BP about its practices, this time saying that a ''severe'' gas flow problem would occur if the casings were not centered more carefully.
 Around that same time, a BP document shows, company officials chose a type of casing with a greater risk of collapsing.
 Despite noticing cementing problems, BP skipped a quality test of the cement around the pipe. Federal regulators also gave the rig a pass at several critical moments. After the rig encountered several problems, including the gas kicks and the pipe stuck in the well, the regulators did not demand a halt to the operation. Instead, they gave permission for a delay in a safety test of the blowout preventer.
 An initial investigation by BP points to a range of missteps.
 Tests shortly before the well blew out found a buildup of pressure that was an ''indicator of a very large abnormality,'' BP concluded and disclosed to Congress in a preliminary report last month. Yet, the rig team was satisfied after another test was deemed successful, and it proceeded. 
 About 10 hours before the explosion, the challenges of trying to keep the pressure in the well under control led to an argument among the workers about how best to finish the well and move the rig to the next site.
 Douglas Brown, a Transocean mechanic on the rig, told investigators that an unnamed BP official whom he called ''the company man'' had instructed rig workers to execute a new plan for removing the riser and sealing the well. Mr. Brown testified that workers thought the plan was too risky. But he could not hear details of the argument that ensued.
 ''The company man was basically saying, 'Well, this is how it's going to be,' '' Mr. Brown told investigators at a hearing on May 26 near New Orleans, adding that the Transocean rig workers ''reluctantly agreed.'' 
 When the explosion occurred around 9:50 p.m. on April 20, there was pandemonium on the rig. Most workers headed for lifeboats. Others rescued shipmates trapped under equipment. On the bridge, Captain Kuchta gathered with at least eight other managers and crew members to decide on an emergency plan.
 Steve Bertone, the chief engineer for Transocean, wrote in his witness statement that he ran up to the bridge where he heard Captain Kuchta screaming at a worker, Andrea Fleytas, because she had pressed the distress button without authorization.
 Mr. Bertone turned to another worker and asked him if he had called to shore for help but was told he did not have permission to do so. Another manager tried to give the go-ahead, the testimony said, but someone else said the order needed to come from the rig's offshore installation manager.
 A Strained Partnership
 After the spill, the government and BP were supposed to cooperate, partly a consequence of laws written after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill that were intended to make polluters more accountable for cleaning up their own messes.
 One example of what was supposed to be a unified front was the Joint Information Center. Housed in a Shell-owned training and conference center in Robert, La., the center includes roughly 65 employees, 10 of whom work for BP. Together, they write and issue news releases and coordinate posts on a Web site, Facebook and Twitter.
 But the partnership between BP and the government has strained along with the failure of efforts to plug the well. Mr. Salazar, for example, assured the public on May 2 that the administration was keeping its ''boot on the neck'' of BP. Next he was being publicly chastised by President Obama for using antagonistic language.
 BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, told reporters at one point that the spill was ''relatively tiny.'' Federal officials soon released estimates indicating that the spill had far outpaced the Exxon Valdez disaster. 
 Under intense media scrutiny, at least a dozen federal agencies have taken part in the spill response, making decision-making slow, conflicted and confused, as they sought to apply numerous federal statutes.
 In one stark example of government disputes, internal e-mail messages from the minerals agency obtained by The Times reveal a heated debate over whether to ignore some federal environmental laws about gas emissions in an effort to speed the drilling of relief wells. 
 One agency official, Michael Tolbert, warned colleagues on April 24 that emissions of nitrous oxide from the well were ''pretty far over the exemption level,'' an issue that his colleague Tommy Broussard said could result in ''BP wasting time'' on environmental safeguards in a way that would be ''completely stupid.''
 But a third colleague, Elizabeth Peuler, intervened to demand that the agency take ''no shortcuts.''
 ''Not even for this one,'' she said. ''Perhaps even especially for this one.'' 
 Debates over the speed -- or lack thereof -- of the government response have also played out in Louisiana, where state officials spent much of May repeatedly seeking permission from the federal government to construct up to 90 miles of sand barriers to prevent oil from reaching the wetlands.
 For three weeks, as the giant slick crept closer to shore, officials from the White House, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Environmental Protection Agency debated the best approach.
 They ultimately approved the use of only one barrier, called a berm, to be paid for by BP.
 Comparing the federal government's response to ''telling a drowning man to wait,'' Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana asked: If one berm is safe, then why not the 23 others that he had requested? Slowly, the federal government approved more berms. 
 From the start, BP had played down the extent of the problem in miscalculating the rate of the leak and in denying the existence of underwater oil plumes. By deferring to the company, federal officials underestimated the problem they were facing and thus what was needed to respond to it. 
 It took more than a week after the explosion for the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, to declare, on April 29, ''a spill of national significance'' a legal categorization that was needed before certain federal assistance could be authorized.
 Because of such delays, critics have charged, more coastline will be hit, more animals will die, more habitats will be ruined and more money will be lost in tourism, fishing and real estate. 
 And yet, the administration is limited in its ability to divorce itself from BP, because federal officials rely on the company for technology, personnel and financing for the cleanup. The relationship reached a turning point last week when the administration said the national incident commander, Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, would start giving solo briefings. He will no longer share a podium with BP, which will offer its own briefings. 
 That move, however, does not resolve the matter of who is actually in charge in the gulf -- of ensuring safety and regulating the dangerous extraction of vast riches under the deepest waters there, as well as of handling the continuing emergency.
 The question is proving equally vexing as investigators try to place blame for events on the rig the day of the explosion-- as was clear on Tuesday when Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that he had begun a criminal investigation. 
 Citing ''a wide range of possible violations,'' Mr. Holder declined to specify the target of the investigation, because, he said, the authorities were still not clear on ''who should ultimately be held liable.''

HEADLINE: We'll Make You a Star (if the Web Agrees)

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
THE new Bravo reality show ''Bethenny Getting Married?'' is ready to tape, and its star, an outspoken brunette named Bethenny Frankel, is right on time. She walks into Fig & Olive, an airy Manhattan restaurant, and exchanges cheek kisses with Bravo producers and cameramen. They tell Ms. Frankel, who had a baby just over two weeks earlier, how good she looks.
 Bravo and its new star then temporarily put reality on hold so they can film a reality show. Ms. Frankel stops chatting; she has been on ''The Real Housewives of New York City'' for three seasons and knows by now how to handle a scene. Without being told, she retreats to a glass foyer so she can be filmed as if she's entering the restaurant for the first time. Then she sits down, reintroduces a friend and an events planner who have already met off-camera, and doesn't flinch as two cameras zoom in for close-ups over her shoulder. 
 ''Bethenny Getting Married?,'' which will have its premiere on Thursday night, follows Ms. Frankel, 39, through her surprise pregnancy, her baby's birth and her wedding, all as she juggles moving in with her fiance and tries building her own natural-foods business. The show has moments of glitz at parties and fashion shows, but most of it features Ms. Frankel being open and imperfect, wandering around in pajamas, arguing with her fiance and talking in therapy about her troubled relationship with her parents.
 Bravo isn't simply guessing that the more exposed and personal aspects of Ms. Frankel's life will appeal to its audience. The network, which finds and tests stars in much the same way that consumer products companies develop and market shampoos and mascaras, has done its homework. And it is confident that this is exactly what viewers want out of a show starring Ms. Frankel, one of its ''Bravolebrities.'' 
 Viewers' opinions, carefully observed and culled on the Web and pinpointed through more traditional market research, tend to dictate which Bravo stars graduate from ensemble reality shows to their own programs. The thinking is that they've already been vetted by the Bravo audience and the research team, and that they've already built brand awareness -- so Bravo is, in marketing terms, just extending its product line.
 ''The barrier to entry is reduced if people know and like that character,'' says Frances Berwick, Bravo's president. ''I don't know how many original series are launching over the summer on cable, but I'm going to make a rough guess, between 50 and 100. So you need every hook you can get to really attract people's attention.''
 Of course, television programmers have relied on market research for decades, testing dramas and comedy pilots. And political campaigns have long packaged some candidates to maximize mass appeal. More than a half-century ago, John F. Kennedy's wealthy father famously made it known that he would market the budding politician and future president ''like soap flakes.'' 
 But Bravo, aiming to minimize creative risks and maximize profits, is now taking these business practices to their logical extremes. Shows on the network aren't introduced on a hunch about a strong creative concept. Instead, Bravo begins by studying its audience's lifestyle and preferences -- what is the market need? -- and then creates shows and stars that reflect them.
 Over the last year, Bravo has also begun relying heavily on social media to fine-tune story lines in its programs, so that each episode is even more efficiently tailored to its audience's taste. The network asks its stars to blog, encourages viewers to comment on its Web site and post to Twitter during episodes, deploys text-message campaigns and Facebook pages for shows, and even studies search terms that viewers use, collected by research firms like Hitwise, to parse what viewers are most interested in. 
 ''We get a lot of information about story lines, and the different people, and what they want to see more of,'' says Ms. Berwick. ''We're very, very research-oriented, and there's a degree of the creative process which is scientific, and we will use every single bit of insight which we can generate.''
 It's hard to imagine, say, David Simon, creator of ''The Wire,'' replacing drug-selling plots with romantic ones because HBO, its network, conducted research showing that was what audiences wanted. But some analysts say Bravo's rather superficial programs are just as innovative as HBO's esteemed lineup. 
 Rather than presenting what screenwriters or producers felt that audiences should see, Bravo ''really found out what people wanted in cable,'' says Douglas Gomery, resident scholar at the Library of American Broadcasting at the University of Maryland. ''It's a real expression of what people want. It's a different kind of television.''
 BACK before NBC acquired it in 2002, Bravo offered up a steady menu of serious culture -- and potential yawners -- like chamber-music recitals, dance festivals and art-house films. That changed once it came under NBC's wing. The executive then overseeing Bravo also ran NBC's reality-show programming, and his influence was clear in Bravo's first slate of shows under NBC, with titles like ''The Reality of Reality.'' 
 One of those shows, ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' permanently altered Bravo's programming strategy after it started in 2003. It featured five gay guys performing good-natured makeovers on straight men. Each gay man was an expert on one of five subjects: food, fashion, beauty, home decor and pop culture -- such as what music to listen to or what events to attend. 
 ''Queer Eye'' was a surprise hit, giving Bravo record ratings and landing on the top-10 lists of many television critics. It provided Bravo with a template for success: develop shows in the five advice genres favored by ''Queer Eye's'' guys and make almost all of those shows reality-based, to minimize production costs. 
 So, food: ''Top Chef.'' Fashion: ''Project Runway.'' Beauty: ''Shear Genius.'' Home decor: ''Flipping Out.'' Pop: ''The Real Housewives of Orange County.'' 
 This strategy was, in part, a response to the fragmentation of the traditional network television audience that the cable industry had been taking advantage of well before Bravo came along. Bravo just made consumer preferences the entire centerpiece of its programming mojo as it traded art for commerce. 
 ''Bravo targets a niche audience rather than the mass audience of the old broadcast days,'' notes Lynn Spigel, a professor at the School of Communication at Northwestern University. ''Bravo is an example of the high degrees of standardization and consolidation cable networks need in order to compete.''
 Adding to that standardization, Bravo took a cue from consumer products companies by offering shows aimed at its audience's needs, wants and lifestyles by segmenting the audience four ways. 
 For one, there are ''Wills and Graces'': the ''true cosmopolitan, Upper West Side man or woman, very into food, very into fashion, also very upscale -- not all gay, but we know we have a strong following among gay men,'' says Tony Cardinale, a research executive at Bravo. Then there are the ''P.T.A. Trendsetters,'' suburban moms who are ''relatively stylish and trendy,'' he says. ''Metrocompetitors'' are ''more male, young, urban social climbers who like pop culture.'' And the ''Newborn Grown-Ups'' are ''20-somethings who are fully out of college mode, buying their first couch, establishing what's going to be their house wine.''
 Bravo doesn't cast its net any wider than that. ''We only talk to those very specific groups,'' says Mr. Cardinale. ''We want to make sure that what we do is important to them.'' 
 Once a year or so, in cities like Seattle, Miami, New York and Los Angeles, Bravo's researchers interview viewers in their homes. ''We ask them to tell us about what's going on in their lives, what's in their wardrobe, what they do at night when they go out,'' says Mr. Cardinale. ''Bringing that back and sitting with the management team so we can all listen to our viewers talk not about our shows but about their lives is great management intel for us.'' 
 After accumulating days upon days of footage for each reality show, Bravo must decide which story lines and characters to feature. It surveys chatter on social media sites -- inviting live comments during shows in what it calls the ''talk bubble'' -- to see what audiences think. Researchers also scrutinize Bravo's message boards and Web boards at other entertainment sites, writing reports on their themes. 
 ''We do a lot of passive listening, lurking on the Web, interpreting the themes we see on our message boards, etcetera,'' says Mr. Cardinale. ''There's more information we have now than we've ever had before.''
 Bravo also takes more direct routes to find what characters are popular on reality shows, such as asking viewers to vote for a ''fan favorite'' on the competition shows at the end of each season. The favorite gets $10,000, and Bravo gets television gold: real data on who audiences prefer to see.
 ''We definitely look at the research to see what parts of those characters people are responding to,'' says Amy Troiano, a Bravo executive who oversees on-the-air promotions. ''If viewers like when they're yelling at someone, we'll use them yelling.'' 
 And if a certain reality-show character is popular or hated, that character will dominate the promotions that week. ''Over all, especially in the shows where it's an ensemble cast, learning who the viewers are connecting with can be surprising, and definitely influential in how we promote the show,'' says Ms. Troiano. 
 TABATHA COFFEY was an early Bravo standout. Eliminated by the judges on the hairstyling competition show ''Shear Genius,'' Ms. Coffey was still voted the fan favorite as the season ended. She was blunt and humorous, and that seemed to resonate with fans. So Bravo developed ''Tabatha's Salon Takeover'' for her. The story line: She visits hair salons that she thinks need whipping into shape -- and tells everyone exactly what's on her mind.
 The show isn't a runaway success: its second season had an average viewership of about one million, according to Nielsen, or about half that of the most recent season of ''The Real Housewives of Orange County.'' But because production costs are low and Ms. Coffey doesn't command the salary of a network actress, it's a keeper for Bravo, which has renewed the show for a third season. 
 OTHER efforts, like the cooking show ''Chef Academy,'' have been less successful, in part, says Ms. Berwick of Bravo, because the audience was unfamiliar with the star -- a European chef -- and because it deviated from Bravo's standard format, leaving viewers confused about whether it was a ''Top Chef''-like competition or a reality show about the chef. 
 Some projects never get off the ground. Fabio Viviani, a charismatic Italian cook who was a fan favorite on ''Top Chef,'' was a potential Bravolebrity, but a program featuring him as a caterer was abandoned because of the ''Chef Academy'' problems.
 Like any other consumer products company that redesigns a familiar brand to revivify sales, Bravo gives existing stars a little refresher when their shows are dragging. That's what happened with Jackie Warner, a trainer and gym owner who starred in ''Work Out,'' a documentary drama series about her gym. By the third season, her personality had become a bit too abrasive, research indicated. 
 ''She was running a business through the recession and having to deal with all kinds of management things, not always to the benefit of some of the characters who the audience had come to love,'' Ms. Berwick says. 
 And Bravo's viewers -- often avid gym-goers themselves -- wanted to hear advice from Ms. Warner. ''The elements we found our audience was absolutely liking were the tangible tips about nutrition and weight loss, packaged with an emotional story line,'' says Ms. Berwick.
 So Bravo decided to show the softer side of Ms. Warner on ''Thintervention With Jackie Warner,'' starting this fall, which will show the trainer whipping out-of-shape people into shape, but supportively. 
 Like most members of Bravo ensemble casts, Ms. Frankel was relatively unknown when she first appeared on ''The Real Housewives of New York City.'' A fledgling health-food chef, she had been on ''The Apprentice,'' but, she says, money had grown so tight that ''I couldn't pay my rent.''
 While the rest of the cast members of ''Housewives'' were married with children and lush lifestyles, Ms. Frankel was not a ''housewife'': she was single, without kids, and renting a small apartment on the Upper East Side. But ''the producers were desperate,'' she says. Even so, ''when they offered it to me, I turned it down twice,'' Ms. Frankel says. ''I said, 'If this show is a train wreck, I will be a train wreck on it.' ''
 But Ms. Frankel proved popular from the start. While some of the women seemed to have grandiose notions of themselves -- one insisted on being called ''the countess'' since she was a model-turned-fourth-wife-of-a-count -- Ms. Frankel was self-deprecating. 
 ''I don't know, I was the homely one-legged woman that couldn't get a date,'' she says during one ''Housewives'' episode, describing the other women's interpretations of her love life. On the show, she opened up about problems like her boyfriend's refusing to discuss cohabitating and her father's apparent lack of affection for her. And she issued forked-tongue comments about her fellow cast members. 
 When she scored highly among both ''Wills and Graces'' and ''P.T.A. Trendsetters,'' Bravo looked a bit further to see exactly what viewers wanted to see from her. ''It was really about matching the things about her life to the things that are viewers are most interested in,'' says Mr. Cardinale.
 In Ms. Frankel's case, it was her single-girl struggles. At the time, she was trying to find the right guy, working like crazy and wondering about whether she'd get married or have children.
 ''We thought that was an interesting life stage to follow,'' says Ms. Berwick. ''When we picked up the show, it was the idea of single girl in the city, which was what we liked about her, in addition to the fact that she's prepared to share her emotions and daily travails.'' 
 By the time Ms. Frankel's show began filming this spring, though, her life had changed. 
 ''When we picked up the show she was neither engaged, pregnant, any of those things -- so, you know, we just adapted it,'' says Ms. Berwick. ''It is fun and funny and relatable and has all these great ingredients, but she's just prepared to show it all. She's a refreshingly open character, and you really feel like you know her. It's like watching your friend going through life and dealing with all these things.''
 AS the cameras roll in Fig & Olive, Ms. Frankel lives up to her billing as the frank, funny one. She talks about eating like a madwoman during her pregnancy, being unprepared when the baby arrived a month early and navigating breast-feeding. ''It was like bringing a panda home from China,'' she says, her mouth full of salad, about her experience with her newborn daughter.
 If Ms. Frankel appears to be losing touch with her viewers as the season progresses, Bravo will most likely use its market research to quickly shift focus -- reassembling footage of Ms. Frankel's life into a different reality, one that the audience wants to see. 
 ''A lot of creative people hate this kind of approach and still believe -- or want to believe -- creativity is in the gut,'' says Professor Spigel at Northwestern. ''Research is more a business strategy to, once again, minimize risk.''

HEADLINE: Health Spending vs. Results

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
The United States spends much more on health care than countries with similar kinds of economies. So costs are sure to be examined closely as federal officials shape regulations under the new health care law. Americans have abundant access to high-tech diagnostic tools like CT and M.R.I. scanners, and to life-saving surgical procedures like angioplasties. 
 Yet Americans don't see doctors more often or live longer, healthier lives, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And Americans' cancer survival rates are not markedly better. In fact, the population of the United States has about the same prevalence of disease as that of other developed countries.
 So where does the money go?
 Doctor visits, medical procedures and prescription drugs cost vastly more, on average, in the United States than in other countries. The United States also spends more money on health care administration, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute.
 ''We have known for a long time that health care is a market failure,'' said Colleen M. Grogan, a professor of health administration and policy at the University of Chicago. ''We have a system where there is an enormous incentive to charge higher prices, and no accountability to control those prices.''

HEADLINE: Harnessing the Power Of the Pothole

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WE already harvest the power of the sun and the wind. Soon we may also harvest the power of potholes. A new type of shock absorber under development by the Levant Power Corporation converts the bumps and jolts of vehicles on rough roads into usable electricity. 
 Usually, shock absorbers dissipate the energy of bouncing vehicles as heat. But the new shocks can use the kinetic energy of bounces to generate watts, putting the electricity to use running the vehicle's windshield wipers, fans or dashboard lights, for example. 
 The devices, called GenShocks, can be installed both in ordinary and hybrid vehicles, lowering fuel consumption by 1 to 6 percent, depending on the vehicle and road conditions, said Shakeel Avadhany, chief executive of the company, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. 
 The new shocks look like ordinary shock absorbers with an electrical power cord at one end. They plug into a power box that regulates the electricity they produce, putting it out at a voltage required by the truck, car or bus.
 GenShocks will cost slightly more than conventional shock absorbers, Mr. Avadhany said, ''but you will get those dollars back through improved fuel economy.'' He projected that the products would be on the market in the second quarter of 2011.
 In May, the National Science Foundation awarded a small-business innovation research grant of $150,000 to Levant to test its shock absorbers with hybrid trucks.
 Juan E. Figueroa, a program director at the foundation, said that the economic impact of the new shock absorbers could be immediate if owners of truck fleets installed them. ''Driving in the city,'' he said, ''they could save a tremendous amount of energy and fuel.'' 
 Other designs for electricity-producing shock absorbers are also being developed, Dr. Figueroa said, but many will require redesign or adaptation of vehicles' suspension systems. He says Levant's product will be easy to install in existing suspension systems. 
 GenShocks are among many innovations in a field known not as energy ''conservation,'' but as energy ''harvesting.'' 
 ''Harvesting refers specifically to collecting energy that would otherwise be wasted,'' said Michael C. McAlpine, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Princeton who is developing a rubbery, energy-harvesting piezoelectric material that creates voltage when it bends.
 Much useful energy could be harvested on roadways, said Ted Bergman, a program director at the National Science Foundation. Dr. Bergman is administering a new program, undertaken jointly with the Department of Energy, to research ways to harvest waste heat in vehicles and thus reduce reliance on foreign sources of oil. 
 ''Seventy-five percent of the energy in vehicles with combustion engines is lost to waste heat,'' he said. ''Instead of losing that energy, we want to convert some of it into kilowatts of electric power.'' 
 Levant Power, founded in 2008, owes part of its origins to the legendary potholes of Boston, said Edwin L. Thomas, a professor of materials science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former teacher of Mr. Avadhany when he was an undergraduate there. 
 When you hit a pothole, he explained, your car moves vertically as well as horizontally. That costs more gasoline per mile because energy is wasted when the forward velocity of the car is converted to vertical motion.
 ''It's like a sprinter who has to also run hurdles,'' Professor Thomas said. 
 Many research groups have tried using shock absorbers to generate electricity, he said, but in his opinion GenShocks have an advantage over earlier models. ''This shock has a clever mechanical design,'' he said, one that pushes hydraulic fluid through the piston head in an unusual way.
 Mr. Avadhany said Levant Power has had two rounds of financing. The company would not disclose the names of investors, the amounts they have put into the company or the names of auto parts makers currently testing its shock absorbers.
 One market that the company is pursuing is military vehicles, said Lt. Gen. John Caldwell, who retired from the Army and now consults for the Spectrum Group in Alexandria, Va. He has assisted Levant in its discussions with the Army and said that some of the energy created by the new shocks could be used to power radios and communications and weapons systems on combat vehicles. 
 In hybrid vehicles, Mr. Avadhany said, the new shock absorbers could complement regenerative brakes, which can harvest energy otherwise lost in stopping and return it to the battery.
 Other researchers are developing different types of energy-producing shock absorbers. Lei Zuo, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., has built two prototypes that generate electricity with electromagnets, producing potential fuel efficiency gains of 2 to 10 percent, he said. One prototype already matches standard dimensions of shock absorbers, and the second will do so, too, he said. 
 Several companies, he said, have contacted him about licensing the technology or developing it collaboratively. ''I was surprised,'' the professor added, ''at how much interest there is.''

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Sub Shop

 BODY:
I GREW up at the Jersey Shore and played football at Point Pleasant Beach High School as a running back and a defensive back. We always had a big rivalry with Point Pleasant Borough High, in the next town. 
 In summer 1971, when I was 14, I planned on working at Hoffman's Ice Cream or Mike's Subs. My brother had worked at the sub shop the previous summer, so I decided to work there.
 The population of our town swelled in the summer. We probably made 1,000 subs a day in that 1,000-foot-square store; there were lines out the door. The whole season was crazy. 
 The kids who worked there developed a great camaraderie, and Victor and Frank Merlo, the brothers who owned the shop, treated us like adults. 
 At 17, I moved on to lifeguarding in the summer. In the spring of my senior year, I learned that the brothers wanted to sell the sub shop. My mother suggested that I buy it, so the next day I skipped school and knocked on doors trying to raise money. One guy offered me 100 percent financing if we could be partners. I declined; it wasn't the way I wanted to go. I was able to raise quite a bit of money that week, and that Sunday I called Rod Smith, a banker who had been my football coach in a Pop Warner program when I was 13. He helped me get a bank loan. 
 I had planned to attend the University of North Carolina and try out for the football team. I also thought I'd attend law school. All that changed when I bought the sub shop that March. A few months later, I realized that I wasn't making money, and found out that the former owners hadn't raised the prices in five years. I worried after I increased prices, but people still bought our subs. It was a good lesson. 
 One of our older customers, who suffered from diabetes, grew increasingly ill. First he lost his vision, and afterward his legs. I'd pick him up and bring him to the store to spend time with us. I think he appreciated getting out.
 I learned from local businesses about giving back to the community on a larger scale. Many of them, like Jack Baker's Lobster Shanty and Hoffman's Ice Cream, always supported the local sports teams and causes.
 Over the years, our summer customers would ask us to wrap subs for them to take cross-country and even overseas. That gave me the idea to sell franchises. We started in 1987 and now have over 400 locations. 
 Potential buyers spend time in one of our stores so they can see what it's like to run a Jersey Mike's. It also gives us a chance to get a sense of whether they're a good match. Occasionally, people have an impressive business background and are qualified financially, but something is missing. They have to pull the staff along with their energy, not push them. It's difficult to describe what I'm looking for. I've seen what works and what doesn't; it's a gut feeling I have. 
 When I bought the company at 17, I didn't think I could fail. Over the years, I've learned how critical the right location is for a retail store, and that it's important to find out the revenues of other businesses in the area. I've also learned how important training is. A lot of franchise companies may have cut training in this economy, but we've doubled it.
 I've been able to slow down somewhat after all this time, but aspiring entrepreneurs should know that running a business will be more work than they ever realized. 
 I may not have gone to law school, but I read a lot of contracts and leases in this business. People sometimes ask me, seriously, what my goal is in life. I tell them it's to get back to Bay Head beach and to be a lifeguard again.

HEADLINE: A Glimpse From Paris

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Arriving in Paris the other morning on assignment, I did what most of the bleary-eyed do: I immediately checked my Blackberry to see what I had missed over the Atlantic. According to a press release, VIP guests at the Marina Abramovic dinner-the subject of Eric Wilson's diverting dead snake thread-were dressed by Givenchy, the host, with the letters RTW or HC after each name to denote a ready to wear or haute couture wearer.
 What instead? An OBE after your name? No, perhaps not. I studied the list as my fellow passengers gathered their things from the overhead, the three young women in my row just gathering looks for their beauty and height-three lanky black girls with fades or honey-blonde curls and an air of here-we-come confidence-and I wondered at the expense, on top of the dinner, and if the publicity justified it. There were two dozen names on the list, including Bjork (RTW) and Courtney Love (HC). 
I then noticed that Prada will come out with a new bag this month, a $295 print tote called the B.Y.O. The price stopped me. That wasn't much money for a designer bag, even if you have a million totes hanging in the closet. As I've started to look at resort collections (a preview of Saint Laurent the other day: prints, second-gen cape collars from Stefano Pilati's fall collection) I've noticed cloth bags that validate the cautious spender. But cloth bags, however fresh they look in the store, tend to quickly look like a magazine in a doctor's office. Still, I thought the timing of the Prada B.Y.O. was interesting-the start of a summer, when you don't want to be bothered with a clunky bag or decisions.
 The reliable Monsieur Alloux met me and we tooted off into the Paris traffic. It had been rainy and cold, he said, but now summer had returned and people in the streets were responding. I could have sat for several hours in a cafe, for indeed there was something to look at-summer clothes that were inventively and lightly arranged, an abundance of flat sandals and ballet flats. In general I thought the view was more rewarding than what I've seen lately in New York, and the stores-on the Avenue Montaigne, Rue Saint Honore-were crowded, despite the still heavy economy in Europe. Near Dior, I saw a slim woman in her forties dressed in black leggings, flats, a black silk slip of a skirt with lace at the hem and a funny old cropped jacket in faded black cotton. The best part of her self-possession was her hair, which she wore in a roll along the nape of her neck.
 On Friday morning, on Boulevard St. Germain, I walked behind a young woman in a pair of black polka dot shorts (not too short, either) with a loose white linen shirt and a cute pair of scuffed, brown flat boots. Before I knew it I was outside of Ralph Lauren's new restaurant, Ralph's, which The Moment, the T Magazine blog, had just written about. I looked into the courtyard, set for lunch, with his prints on the chairs. I wanted to stay but the hostess very nicely said they were fully booked until June 21.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: On Niese's Bright Day, Perez's Cloud Grows Darker

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; David Waldstein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
First, the Mets witnessed a veteran left-hander being run out of town for being too hittable. Then they watched his young replacement, whom few on the Florida Marlins seemed able to hit.
 Nothing could have been clearer Saturday at Citi Field than the way the careers of the 23-year-old Jon Niese and the 28-year-old Oliver Perez were going in different directions. On the day that Perez packed his bags for a stint on the disabled list -- and an uncertain future beyond that -- Niese returned from the D.L. and gave his team something to look forward to.
 Niese's approach was textbook. He worked quickly, threw strikes and let his defense do its job. And in barely more than two hours, the Mets had a stress-free 6-1 win and one more reason to have confidence in their rotation. 
 ''It was an impressive outing,'' Manager Jerry Manuel said. 
 Niese (2-2), who was activated from the 15-day D.L. on Saturday after injuring his right hamstring last month and said after the game that he was pain-free, allowed one run and six hits in seven innings. He struck out six and walked one, throwing an economical 90 pitches, and deployed his curveball for first-pitch strike after first-pitch strike.
 ''It sets up every pitch, from the strikeout curveball to the fastball up in the zone,'' Niese said. ''It forces them to swing at pitches that I want them to swing at, and that was the case today.''
 Niese was assisted by a Mets offense that wasted no time providing him with a cushion, taking a 5-0 lead after three innings and forcing Marlins starter Nate Robertson (4-5) out of the game in the fifth.
 Leadoff doubles by Ike Davis in the second and Angel Pagan in the third led to multirun rallies, capped by a towering two-run home run by David Wright that slipped inside the left-field foul pole in the third.
 Wright and Davis had been struggling at the plate. For Wright, the difficulties have been season-long; for Davis, who had four hits in his last 32 at-bats, they have been more recent.
 But both players had breakout games Saturday. Davis had a career-high four hits in four at-bats, including two doubles, and drove in a run and scored three. Wright, who went 2 for 3 with a walk, drove in three runs and scored two.
 It was Wright's home run in the third, on an inside pitch he turned on and pulled down the line, that thrilled the crowd at Citi Field more than anything else. For the fans, it was an unusual sight; the home run was Wright's 10th of the year, but only his second at home. His other home run at Citi Field also came against the Marlins, but two months ago, in his first at-bat of the season April 5.
 Wright matched his home run total from all of last season, a point that -- perhaps not surprisingly -- he was not particularly excited to discuss.
 ''It's just a number, and home runs don't really mean that much to me,'' he said. ''So it's really no big deal.''
 A bigger deal, perhaps, was the home run's timing. The Mets' early offensive outburst allowed for an afternoon free of suspense, a pleasant distraction from the off-the-field situation that had drawn most interest heading into the game: the team's standoff with Perez, the embattled starter who was banished from the starting rotation -- and then all but banished from pitching at all -- but who refused to accept a minor league assignment, as was his contractual right as a veteran.
 But on Saturday, the Mets and Perez finally found a mutually agreeable solution, if a suspiciously convenient one. Within hours of when the Mets needed to make a roster move to make room for Niese, Perez was put on the 15-day disabled list with right knee tendinitis. (He had surgery on the same knee last year.)
 Manuel said Perez, who is 0-3 with a 6.28 earned run average and last pitched Monday in San Diego, did not complain of any discomfort until Friday, when he ran into Perez while making his rounds in the training room.
 ''He said, 'My knee is bothering me,' '' Manuel said. ''And I asked, 'When did this start?' He said after the three innings that he had in San Diego. And that was that.''
 Perez had a magnetic imaging resonance test Friday night and was expected to travel to Port St. Lucie, Fla., on Saturday to begin rehabilitation. Soon after, he will begin what was presumed to be the real purpose of the trip: finding a solution to his pitching woes.
 Teams are not allowed to place players on the disabled list without a legitimate medical reason, so Major League Baseball could investigate the circumstances.
 The Mets must submit documentation, which is usually a report from a physician and sometimes a copy of tests performed. It is highly unusual for the league office to reverse a move to the disabled list. Often, especially in cases with tenuous circumstances, teams confer with the commissioner's office before making a move in order to ensure they can do it.
 Manuel acknowledged that the timing of Perez's injury would raise suspicions, but he defended the legitimacy of the injury, going so far as to coin a new word.
 ''In my years that I have been here, the Wilpons, Saul Katz, Omar Minaya, they have had similar situations where they could have used what I would say would be a less integrious option,'' Manuel said, referring to the Mets' management. ''But they never chose that.''
 INSIDE PITCH
 Jerry Manuel said that the backup catcher Henry Blanco's sore neck, which prompted the Mets to add Omir Santos to the roster Friday, had improved to the point that Blanco would have been available Saturday in an emergency. ... Carlos Beltran played in his second extended spring training game in Port St. Lucie, Fla., going 1 for 5 and driving in a run with a single.

HEADLINE: Hotels: Fewer Deals but Low Rates

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
IF you haven't booked a hotel for your summer vacation, don't expect to see the same types of recession specials that hotels were offering last year.
 Instead of generous ''stay two nights, get one night free'' offers, hotels are offering more modest, targeted promotions, often with lots of fine print attached. But the good news is that hotel rates haven't really risen from last year's lows -- at least not yet. 
 ''The average daily rate this summer will be almost exactly what it was last summer,'' said Bjorn Hanson, associate professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. ''So although the percentage discount might be less, the actual rate is still low.''
 According to Smith Travel Research, which tracks hotel rates, the average daily rate in the United States this summer will actually drop 2 percent compared with last summer, to $95 a night. Because that's a national average, it's a lot lower than what most guests pay in popular vacation destinations -- but even in those cities, prices dropped a lot during the recession. In the top 25 United States markets, average hotel rates peaked at $133 a night in 2008; the average so far this year is $116, about what it was in 2006. 
 Since hotels have been making less money and cutting back on services and staff, they are less likely to offer the rock-bottom discounts they rolled out during the worst of the economic crisis, when they were trying to entice anxious consumers to keep traveling. That means this summer's deals feel less like a fire sale, and have more restrictions buried in the fine print.
 For instance, Hilton's ''Great Getaway'' sale promises 20 to 30 percent off some rates at 2,800 hotels worldwide if you book by July 15 for stays through Sept. 6. The main caveat is that you have to prepay for your reservation and that payment is nonrefundable. Another hitch is that the discount does not necessarily apply to each hotel's best available rate; at some hotels, it can only be used with the ''bed and breakfast'' rate, which may be higher. 
 The lesson: always compare a sale price with the hotel's ''best available rate'' before booking. You may have to call the reservations number and ask for the lowest price, since hotel rates can be cryptic online.
 Other summer sales are more geographically targeted, like Marriott's ''Sand Dollars'' package, which offers a free night, daily free breakfast and a $100 resort credit (subject to minimum-night stay and other booking conditions) at participating properties in the Caribbean and Mexico. These are both destinations where travelers are more likely to find deals this summer, hotel watchers say.
 Independent hotels and resorts and smaller chains are also doing more targeted offers, such as Kimpton's ''Ride the Rails'' deal. Guests who book in advance with the RAILS code and present a train ticket at check-in can get 15 percent off the best available rate at more than 30 Kimpton hotels, and yes, tickets on trains from the airport into the city count.
 Most hotels post these types of promotions on their Web sites, but HotelChatter.com is a good one-stop source to learn about which chains and properties are offering deals. Mark Johnson, HotelChatter's founder, said Miami and Las Vegas are two United States cities where he's still seeing lots of discounts. The site also tracks new hotels offering special opening rates -- typically, around 20 percent off -- but you have to act fast to score a bargain, since the best deals can disappear quickly. 
 ''I saw an opening rate for $179,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I went two days later to book it, and it was up to $300.''
 The faster pace of sales has meant that Twitter is becoming a more important way to track deals. By following sources that stay on top of specials, like HotelChatter, you can sometimes find out about sales before a hotel's e-mail subscribers get the message. Booking agencies like Quikbook.com, which specializes in independent and boutique hotels in big cities -- with some prices under $200 in Manhattan this summer -- are also turning more to Twitter to spread the word about special rates.
 Brian Hendricks, Quikbook's marketing director, said that once or twice a month, he announces sales on Twitter and Facebook that don't appear on Quikbook's Web site until later in the day -- or not at all if the discount applies to a limited number of rooms.
 ''Sometimes they sell out and we never put them on our Web site,'' he said.
 Although he was skeptical at first about using Twitter to entice customers to book hotel rooms, Mr. Hendricks has found that tweeting judiciously is the best strategy to reward loyal followers, and keep them from getting annoyed. ''If they get a tweet from us, they know it's going to be good,'' he said. ''We don't inundate them with mediocre stuff.''
 Quikbook has also joined the ranks of hotel agencies that are putting their own spin on Priceline's blind booking model -- without the bidding process.
 With Quikbook's ''secret sale'' collection, you don't find out the name of the hotel until after you book. You just see the price (usually between $149 and $169 a night, Mr. Hendricks said), a detailed list of amenities and a description of where the hotel is located (for example, the ''Eastside of Manhattan's Murray Hill neighborhood''). The drawbacks are that you have to prepay and that reservations can't be changed or refunded.
 Travelocity is another agency now playing the we-can't-tell-you-the-name game. If you book any of its ''Top Secret Hotels,'' you get up to 45 percent off, but you can't change or cancel your reservation, and you find out only the price and basic details about the hotel -- such as whether it has a pool or a free breakfast -- before you book. 
 Paying attention to which hotels are offering free amenities is another way to save, particularly since fees for things like parking, breakfast, gyms and Internet access can add a lot more than small change to your final bill.
 HotelChatter does a yearly round-up of hotel chains that have free Wi-Fi, and this year found that more companies are courting their gadget-toting guests by including free Internet access. Among the big names on the free Wi-Fi list: Holiday Inn, Peninsula Hotels, Standard Hotels, Hotel Indigo, Courtyard by Marriott, Residence Inn, Best Western, Four Points by Sheraton, Hyatt Place, Element, Aloft, Red Roof Inn and Hampton Inn.
 Other brands, like Omni, Fairmont, JDV, Wyndham and Kimpton, offer complimentary Internet access to guests who are members of their loyalty programs, which are free to join. Even if you don't think you'll ever earn enough points for a free stay, it's worth signing up. Hotels often give members perks, like the two free snacks Kimpton lets its InTouch guests raid from the minibar, and free Internet access. 
 ''Wi-Fi is just becoming more like a utility,'' said Michael Depatie, Kimpton's chief executive. ''Do guests pay to plug into an electrical outlet?''
 Not yet, but with free versus fee shaping up to be the big battle in the travel industry, let's not give anyone any ideas.

HEADLINE: The Forces of Decline

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 For the distinction of most fatuous statement ever to appear in the Book Review, I nominate Niall Ferguson's concluding comment on Richard A. Posner's ''Crisis of Capitalist Democracy'' (May 9): ''It seems not to have struck'' Posner ''that British decline and the rise of Keynesianism went hand in hand.'' Should a defense of Catholicism be flippantly dismissed because the decline of the Roman Empire ''went hand in hand'' with the rise of Christianity? 
 Did ''British decline'' owe nothing to the debilitating losses of wealth and lives resulting from two world wars? Did the erosion of British comparative advantage owe nothing to the spread of industrial technology to other nations? Did the loss of the British Empire owe nothing to the rise of nationalism and the decline of the moral respectability of colonialism? Was Keynes really more responsible than Gandhi for the fact that Elizabeth II never became Empress of India?
 If British socialism is Ferguson's real target, the ideologue in him should allow the historian in him to note that Keynes was a Liberal, not a Labourite. ''Keynesianism'' is not about the size of government. It is about the timing of government policies on taxes, expenditures and money -- expansionary to counter recessions, contractionary to counter inflations. In the postwar years it has strengthened rather than undermined the British, American and many other economies -- and even saved today's Great Recession from plummeting into another Great Depression.

HEADLINE: As World Cup Goes to Africa, Don't Bet on Home Continent

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- The World Cup opens Friday, and this host city is draped in the flags of the 32 participating nations. With the world's biggest sporting event coming to Africa for the first time, hope wafts across the continent that one of the six African teams might win.
 ''The talent is there, certainly,'' Bob Bradley, the United States coach, said.
 Yet history says that disarray in preparations, desperate coaching changes, poverty, official corruption and vagaries of the draw will conspire against Africa's chances. And injuries have afflicted two of the continent's best players. The prospects for forward Didier Drogba of Ivory Coast are uncertain after he broke an arm Friday, and midfielder Michael Essien of Ghana is out of the monthlong tournament with a balky knee. 
 Of course, winning the World Cup is a formidable task for any country. Soccer's governing body ranks more than 200 national teams. In the 18 World Cups played since the tournament's inception in 1930, only seven countries have won the title, and all have been from Europe or South America.
 Pele once predicted that an African team would win the World Cup by the turn of the century. And the host country, South Africa, wants to use the World Cup to unite the country and to rebut the stereotype of Africa as a place of conflict, poverty and disease. 
 Yet South Africa risks becoming the first host nation to fail to reach the second round.
 And only two African teams have advanced as far as the quarterfinals -- Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002.
 This year, Cameroon, at 19th in the world the highest-ranked African team in the tournament, faces odds of 100 to 1 to win the title. Ivory Coast, ranked 27th, is 50 to 1, the best odds of any team from the continent. 
 ''The African teams have tended to destroy themselves in their own environments,'' said Jurgen Klinsmann, who won a World Cup playing for West Germany in 1990 and coached a reunified Germany to third place in 2006. ''Bonus payments are not paid to players, but administrators cash the checks. There is corruption. Then they eat each other up.''
 Uruguay, which won the inaugural tournament and won again in 1950, has been the smallest victorious country to date. Brazil, Italy and Germany have won two-thirds of the titles. Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, another two-time winner, have faced some of the obstacles -- namely corruption and poverty -- that hamper African squads.
 Africa's recent problems have been well documented.
 Cameroon's players holed up in a hotel in Paris for several days and declined to leave for the 2002 World Cup in Japan until each player was paid a promised bonus of about $41,500.
 For this World Cup, Nigeria booked a hotel north of Durban that was later determined to be too loud and mosquito infested. So its soccer federation paid a reported fine of $125,000 to break its contract and find a more suitable hotel.
 ''Everything counts -- hotels, food, travel, bonuses,'' Samuel Eto'o, Cameroon's captain, recently told Agence France-Presse. ''Some of our nations remain too amateurish in their approach.''
 On the eve of the 2006 World Cup, Otto Pfister, a German, quit as coach of Togo because his players had not been paid promised bonuses of $200,000 each. He returned to coach Togo's opener against South Korea but did not gain any popularity with the country's soccer federation in a 2-1 defeat.
 After the match, a reporter asked Assogbavi Komlan, secretary general of the Togo federation, if Pfister would remain as coach. Komlan called him a ''bad man'' and said Pfister drank too much. Pfister threatened to sue, saying he was a teetotaler. Meanwhile, Togo scored only one goal while losing all three group matches.
 Odd occurrences happen regularly to African teams. Fawzi Chaouchi, an Algerian goalkeeper, will be suspended for his team's first two World Cup matches after head-butting a referee in January at the African Nations Cup.
 South Africa's career leading scorer, Benni McCarthy, was cut last week after being called overweight and out of shape. Lyrics of a song that once noted ''Benni's in the 18 area'' -- lauding his scoring ability in the penalty area -- were amended to ''Benni's in the cafeteria.''
 The African coaching carousel spins incessantly before each World Cup, with Europeans favored over homegrown managers. Lars Lagerback and Sven-Goran Eriksson, Swedes hired a few months ago to coach Nigeria and Ivory Coast, did not meet their full teams until late May. Essentially for them, the World Cup will be a blind date. This cannot be comforting, especially for Ivory Coast, which is in the so-called Group of Death with Brazil, Portugal and North Korea. 
 ''The talent of African players is at least as great as that of players from other countries, including Brazil and the Americas,'' Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, said at a news conference in April. ''What is missing is tactics. But how can they have this if they change the coach just a few months before the start of the biggest competition in the world?''
 As elsewhere, soccer in Africa can summon consuming passion. Algeria's team bus was pelted with stones before a World Cup qualifying match against Egypt in Cairo and several players had to be treated for cuts, apparently as part of a soccer feud that has lasted 20 years.
 In January, Togo's team bus was attacked by gunmen on the way to the African Nations Cup in Angola; two soccer officials and the driver were killed. Ten years earlier, the Ivory Coast team was briefly detained at home by military officials after failing to win the African Cup, reportedly to prevent reprisals from fans.
 South Africa's black players grew up under the poverty and brutal racial policies of apartheid, only 16 years removed. The team captain, Aaron Mokoena, was camouflaged in a dress by his worried mother to escape township violence. Steven Pienaar, a slightly built star midfielder who plays for Everton in the English Premier League, learned to watch television on the floor, never on the couch, because a stray bullet might pierce the window.
 ''The ghost of apartheid will bug the Bafana at the World Cup,'' Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski wrote in ''Soccernomics,'' a book that applies economic principles to the sport, referring to the South African team nickname. ''One reason South Africans are so bad at soccer is that most of them didn't get enough good food.''
 Even Pienaar does not believe an African team will win the World Cup, telling CNN: ''I think if it was somewhere in West Africa, with the heat, you could have said an African nation could win. But in South Africa it will be winter, so it will be more in the favor of the Europeans.''
 That reflects common wisdom. But no one is accustomed to playing a World Cup in winter at altitude in a developing nation. Klinsmann predicts a tournament of surprises.
 ''Anything can happen,'' he said. ''It's going to come down to the nerves of the players. Who can stay focused and patient? They will be dealing with real life. They won't always be in five-star hotels. Maybe the bus doesn't come for three hours.
 ''The African players don't represent their own country, they represent a continent. If they can keep their emotions under control, they have the strength and quality to go all the way.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Some G-20 Nations to Stimulate Domestic Demand

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
BUSAN, South Korea -- The American Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told his counterparts at a Group of 20 conference on Saturday that they should not rely on spending by American consumers for their economic recovery, and he urged Japan, Germany and China to bolster domestic demand. 
 ''We discussed how the ongoing shift toward higher saving in the United States needs to be complemented by stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and in the European surplus countries, and by sustained growth in private demand,'' Mr. Geithner said.
 He spoke at the end of a two-day conference of finance ministers and central bankers from the world's 20 leading economies, who gathered to discuss ways of shoring up a fragile global recovery in the face of the European debt crisis.
 At the same time, the participants also haggled over the thorny issue of reforming supervision of banks and other financial institutions to prevent a re-run of the 2008-9 recession.
 The finance minister of Canada, Jim Flaherty, said there was ''no agreement'' on a global bank levy to pay for future bailouts. European countries and the United States generally favor some type of levy, while countries like Canada, whose banks suffered less harm during the recession, oppose it.
 The representatives also continued to work, with more success, on new rules that would require banks to keep more capital in reserve as protection against a future crisis.
 The discussions on fiscal policy focused on striking a balance between two conflicting strategies: continuing to stimulate recovery, which the Americans prefer, and reining in deep deficits, the primary concern in Europe.
 The United States wants countries with trade surpluses, like Germany and China, to stimulate domestic demand, fearing that tighter fiscal policy will impede growth and endanger the still-nascent recovery. 
 ''Fiscal consolidation should be 'growth-friendly,' '' Mr. Geithner told reporters, saying the ''pace and composition of adjustment'' should vary across countries.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the International Monetary Fund said that euro zone countries saddled with huge debts ''have to consolidate strongly even if it has some bad effect on growth,'' Reuters reported.
 In a joint statement, the finance ministers and central bank governors said: ''Those countries with serious fiscal challenges need to accelerate the pace of consolidation.'' But in a nod to American concerns, the statement said, ''Within their capacity, countries will expand domestic sources of growth.''
 Their statement will serve as an outline when the national leaders of G-20 countries meet in Toronto on June 26 and 27.

HEADLINE: Lessons of the Season

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN and STU HACKEL

 BODY:
The N.H.L. season is concluding with what is turning out to be a memorable clash between Chicago and Philadelphia for the Stanley Cup. It is a fine finish, but what did the league and the rest of the hockey world learn in the 12 months leading to this moment? Below, a brief examination of some of the major lessons. 
 Increased InterestTelevision ratings, news media interest and revenue have grown steadily over the past three years, despite difficulties in the economy at large. Game 2 of the Blackhawks-Flyers series on NBC attracted 5.89 million viewers, the largest American audience for an N.H.L. game since records were first kept in 1975. 
The common thread: traditional cities. The last three Stanley Cup finals have involved Detroit, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Philadelphia, all northern cities with deep hockey roots, and this postseason's strong TV ratings and merchandise sales were boosted by strong runs in Montreal and Boston. In contrast, Cup victories by Tampa Bay, Carolina and Anaheim in the mid-2000s did little to attract audiences either in the Sun Belt or in hockey's traditional northern strongholds. 
 This spring's upsurge in fan interest coincided with an almost total absence of playoff teams from the N.H.L.'s financially troubled Southern tier. Of the nine teams in that group, only Nashville, Phoenix and Los Angeles reached the postseason, and all were gone after one round.
 The N.H.L. can work in warmer climates, like Washington and San Jose. But the last three seasons have shown that the N.H.L. does best when its teams in Canada and the northern United States dominate. 
 Beware the Exurbs
 Commissioner Gary Bettman and the N.H.L. owners cannot have failed to notice that some of the clubs with the biggest financial problems skate at new arenas that were built as anchors for exurban real-estate developments. The Coyotes and the Panthers are the most visible examples. The Coyotes are in a money-losing situation at a partly built retail development in Glendale, Ariz., outside Phoenix, and the Panthers are in a similar setting in Sunrise, Fla. To a lesser extent, the Ottawa Senators are having problems at their building, located in what used to be farmland in a remote part of suburban Kanata, Ontario. 
 Every club's finances, whether strong or weak, are affected by many unique factors. But Bettman and the owners would do well to discourage any future arena deals involving exurban real estate developments, which have had a dismal record in the N.H.L. 
 International Play
 Bettman and other league and club executives - primarily Brian Burke - have grumbled publicly over the supposed drawbacks to N.H.L. participation in the Olympics and other international hockey tournaments at the senior level. They have suggested that the N.H.L. may no longer take part.
 Some of that grumbling is for leverage, to gain concessions for the N.H.L.'s participation at the 2014 Winter Games at Sochi, Russia. But the complaints, especially Burke's, sound increasingly absurd as it becomes clearer that the Vancouver Games have helped drive the N.H.L.'s current surge. So do calls from Burke and others to curtail the annual world championship - spurred by their contrived outrage over a single article on the tournament's Web site criticizing Sidney Crosby for not playing this year. 
 However unwilling N.H.L. officials might be to concede the point, the league's future financial health is bound inextricably to participation in international hockey, including the Olympics and the world championship. 
 Action, Finally
 It took a long time for the league's general managers to do something about the rising number of concussions, but this season, they finally acted against checks to the head. The last straw was the serious concussion sustained by Florida's David Booth in October on a legal blind-side hit delivered by Philadelphia's Mike Richards.
 At their meeting last week, the general managers formally proposed that referees assess a five-minute major and game misconduct for a ''lateral, back-pressure or blind-side hit to an opponent where the head is targeted and/or the principal point of contact.'' The rule is expected to be approved by the league and the N.H.L. Players' Association before going into effect next season.
 Still, it falls short of junior and international hockey standards banning all contact with the head, even those coming from straight ahead. A controversy awaits the first concussion legally delivered under the league's new rule next season. 
 Defense Still Wins
 Five years after adopting rules designed to speed up the game by cracking down on obstruction tactics, the N.H.L.'s faster and more open style of play led to a first-place finish for the Washington Capitals, whose 318 goals were the most scored in 15 seasons.
 The Capitals of Alex Ovechkin, Niklas Backstrom and Mike Green epitomized the run-and-gun excitement the N.H.L. has promoted.
 Other offense-oriented teams with young stars did well, like the Pittsburgh Penguins of Sidney Crosby and the Blackhawks with Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane.
 But when the playoffs rolled around, the tilt toward offense proved a liability. Both the Capitals' and the Penguins' defensive corps faltered against Montreal.
 The Blackhawks emphasized offense and defense, which is why they have been able to win three series and are playing for the Stanley Cup. Regardless of how the regular season is played, it remains true that real Cup contenders must have a strong all-around game.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Unruly Sports Fans Sending Some Officials to the Sideline

BYLINE: By MARK HYMAN. 
Mark Hyman is the author of ''Until It Hurts: America's Obsession With Youth Sports and How It Harms Our Kids.''

 BODY:
Carl Wilkinson stopped officiating high school football games in Eugene, Ore., about five years ago -- after irate spectators chased him and the rest of the crew from the field to the locker room, then pounded on the door demanding that they open it. 
 ''It was just getting horrible,'' he said of the fans' behavior. 
 Bill Srna recently decided to hang up his whistle after about 30 years as a referee at high school basketball games in Salina, Kan. He said he had grown weary of the hysteria over every backcourt violation and charging call. 
 ''It gets old night after night,'' he said, adding that he prefers the relative calm of his full-time job as a firefighter. 
 Looking for part-time employment in a field in which hundreds of onlookers can raise a ruckus over one's honest mistake or no mistake at all? There are plenty of openings. 
 Around the country, it has become harder to find youth sports officials and to keep experienced ones on the job. The situation has forced some games to be postponed and others to be played with short-handed crews. In some places, it is not unusual for football referees to work two games on long and exhausting Friday nights. Spot shortages are also common in soccer and volleyball. 
 ''Are we desperately short? No,'' said Jack Folliard, the executive director of the Oregon Athletic Officials Association. ''But we are struggling to get enough officials.'' 
 The cause of the problem is not a mystery to those in striped shirts, who are growing weary over abuse from agitated fans, most of them adults. 
 ''I have officials specifically tell me that's why they're not renewing their licenses anymore,'' said Fran Martin, the assistant executive director of the Kansas High School Athletic Association. ''They're tired of putting up with the behavior.'' 
 The same concerns keep potential recruits from considering the job, said Henry Zaborniak, the assistant commissioner of the Ohio High School Athletic Association. He says he speaks with young athletes about becoming officials someday, and they ask a standard question: Why would I want to take that abuse for $35? 
 Despite surprisingly long hours and modest pay -- about $40 for a junior high basketball game in Oregon -- officiating has a lot to offer, youth sports officials say.
 ''It's like a friend once told me,'' Srna said. '' 'I love the game of basketball, but I ran out of eligibility. This is the way I can stay in it.' '' 
 Two years ago, the Ohio association asked officials to name the worst part of their jobs. Poor fan behavior was the No. 1 answer. In another poll, the National Association of Sports Officials asked high school administrators in every state to choose the biggest reason officials do not reregister from a list of 14. The most frequent answers were poor sportsmanship among spectators, and poor sportsmanship among coaches and players.
 To complicate matters, disputed calls that inflame parents and other adult spectators now live forever in cyberspace. Type ''controversial call'' and ''high school'' into YouTube's search engine, and it returns dozens of videos. (One titled ''Ref Ruins Finale to a Great State Championship Game'' had about 38,000 views.) 
 ''It isn't like 30 years ago when the game was over, it was over,'' Zaborniak said.
 How the numbers of officials nationally have been affected is hard to measure. A sampling of state high school associations suggests the count has been relatively unchanged the past few years. 
 ''When the economy tanks, our numbers go up,'' said Mary Struckhoff, the assistant director of the National Federation of State High School Associations. ''When times are good again, the same people ask, 'Why the heck would I do that?' '' 
 Officials in basketball and soccer need the thickest skin. Folliard, who referees high school basketball in Oregon, recalled leaving the court after a close game when he heard someone call out, ''Hey, ref.'' As he looked up, a fan doused him with a full cup of soda. 
 At an Ohio high school soccer game last fall, Kathleen Dolan issued a red card to a player for taunting. That call stirred one parent to deliver to her door a DVD of the YouTube video showing the disputed play and a letter explaining that she had misinterpreted the situation. 
 ''All I can say is I found it excessive and intrusive,'' said Dolan, who is also the president of the Ohio Collegiate Soccer Officials Association. 
 Many state associations offer classes to help officials deal with unruly fans. The best defense, though, may be a witty retort.
 Wilkinson, who is still an umpire for girls' softball, explained how he handled one hotheaded fan. He removed his mask and calmly said: ''Sir, I'm going to try very hard to allow you to stay at this game. I want you to try very hard to stay here too.''
 Wilkinson added, ''I didn't hear another word out of him after that.''

Taylor Antrim is the author of a novel, ''The Headmaster Ritual.''

 BODY:
ALONE WITH YOU
 Stories
 By Marisa Silver
 164 pp. Simon & Schuster. $22
 Marisa Silver is one of California's most celebrated contemporary writers, but she's never done much for its glamorous, good-life image. Her debut in The New Yorker in 2000 -- gold rush days on the West Coast -- was a grim story about a young Los Angeles limo driver discovering a near-suffocated baby in an abandoned suitcase. Her skillful, moving 2008 novel ''The God of War'' gave us an impoverished family in a desolate, sun-blasted trailer park near the Salton Sea.
 Today, a widening state deficit and double-digit unemployment make Silver's take on down-market California especially timely. ''Alone With You,'' her new collection, doesn't pretty the picture but patiently and empathetically reveals the complexities of feeling -- anger, longing, hope -- that accompany misfortune. 
 Silver's best stories are prickly and nimble, satisfyingly acute. ''Alone With You'' isn't depressing, but don't expect much in the way of uplift either. In the graceful opener, ''Temporary,'' a young woman with two years of community college temps at a Los Angeles adoption agency, transcribing interviews in a windowless room. Her ineffectual attempts to moor herself to her world (sex with her roommate's boyfriend, a small cruelty at work) are piercingly sad.
 Cruelty figures in ''The Visitor'' as well, in which Candy, a flinty nurse's aide at a V.A. hospital, tends to the grievously wounded. One in particular provokes her adversarial side: a soldier who has lost both legs and one arm and now refuses to speak. She pinches him under the covers and holds back his food. Silver makes such hostility comprehensible, even human, by incrementally revealing the source of Candy's own grief and bottled rage. The twin of anger is lust, an idea conveyed in a striking scene in which Candy cleans the soldier's naked body by hand, stirring his aggression.
 Fans of Silver's work will recognize a pair of familiar motifs throughout this slim volume: irresponsible mothers and disloyal men. They recur with a frequency that suggests hard experience on Silver's part; yet she is generous to even the most flawed among them. I was floored by the sensitivity on display in ''Pond,'' a story that so easily could have turned mean-spirited. Julia's 24-year-old daughter, Martha, hasn't developed properly. She is childlike, un-self-conscious, hypersexual -- and pregnant after an encounter at an adult care program with a young man with Down syndrome. Julia's husband, Burton, suggests intervening to end the pregnancy, and Julia, an ex-lawyer, builds a legal argument for doing so: Martha isn't mature enough to be a mother; Julia and Burton would have to shoulder the burden. But Julia ultimately recoils at the notion of forced abortion, and little Gary is born healthy.
 Afterward Burton has an affair and moves out of the house while Julia strains in the role of surrogate mom. The story culminates in a suspenseful swimming scene involving Burton, Martha and Gary on the bank of a fast-moving river. Burton approaches the precipice of an unconscionable act, and at the last moment, pulls away.
 Miraculously, Silver makes philandering Burton sympathetic even as she compassionately conveys the ambivalence Julia feels, at once insulted and relieved by her husband's infidelity. Likewise, in ''Leap,'' a woman recovering from heart bypass surgery feels drawn to her husband after his affair: ''Colin's adultery exposed her desire, turned it into something both pornographic and banal, private and essential.''
 Lust can be all of those things, but to me the sentences' abstractions pull the idea out of focus. It is, alas, a habit of Silver's. She's capable of satisfyingly precise description, as when one character crunches fresh snow between her teeth. But she seems drawn over and over again to a generalized language of feeling, even lazy cardiology prose: ''His heart split open''; ''Helen felt as though her mother had . . . squeezed her heart''; ''Connie felt her heart fill with gratitude for her sister''; ''Connie's heart shrank''; ''His heart tossed this way and that.'' Silver deploys other forms of shorthand too: ''The cat was already out of the bag''; ''Her mother threw caution to the wind.'' Using the occasional cliche isn't a mortal sin; still, in the demanding confines of the short story, generic language stands out.
 Silver's stylistic lapses don't diminish her talent for revealing the frayed bonds of relationships, for harnessing our sympathy toward characters who fall short. And when she escalates the tension and conflict, ''Alone With You'' reaches another level. The story ''Three Girls'' starts slowly, but the final scene, in which the protagonist encounters a wealthier family's disdain for her own, is so good it might give you vertigo. And my favorite moment in the book appears late in the title story, set in Morocco, a rare and successful foray from Silver's home turf. Marie, a mother suffering from mental illness, has a moment of clarity after a mean-spirited exchange with her son's sexy girlfriend. They're all on a family vacation: Marie, her husband, her son and the girlfriend, Elise. The two men have been dancing around Marie's panic disorder and depression; Elise demands to know what it feels like to consider suicide.
 How plausible and surprising it is that a dose of rudeness and hostility would knock some life into Marie. The story doesn't end happily -- Silver is too smart for that -- but it resonates with authorial empathy and cautious hope.

HEADLINE: What New York Needs: More Water Taxis

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER. 
E-mail: citycritic@nytimes.com

 BODY:
From water's edge you can cross the Hudson River -- or the East River, as you prefer -- in less time than it often takes to wait for the subway. Even at the height of rush hour, you'll get a seat, quite likely one near a window. From out on the water, the city you think you know will seem taller, more glamorous, more cinematic. 
 You may pass under a bridge or two, or even three, and as you do, your mental soundtrack may switch to Gershwin -- or Jay-Z, as you prefer. You might even imagine a burst of fireworks off the starboard bow. The buildings will grandstand for your attention, beckoning you to their shore, until they grow bigger and bigger and you draw nearer and nearer and suddenly there you are, standing at their feet, windblown and a bit giddy. Why doesn't New York have more ferries? 
 Countless thousands of apartments have recently been built along New York's rivers, but the rivers themselves are relatively uncrowded. Other cities have ferry lines sprouting out of every pier like weeds from a crack in the pavement. Why not New York? 
 This week is the unofficial start of ferry season. Routes to Mets and Yankees games are up and running. The Governors Island Water Taxi Beach (a summer fun party zone with siblings in Long Island City, Queens, and the South Street Seaport) just welcomed its first visitors of the year. And a new weekend line that goes from Manhattan to Brooklyn Bridge Park and, on Fridays, to Governors Island just made its debut. 
 Just in time for all this activity, the question of what role ferries might play in the future life of the city is about to come into sharper focus. 
 Three public entities have been considering it from different angles. The Economic Development Corporation is soon to release its ''Comprehensive Citywide Ferry Study.'' The Department of City Planning is interested in how ferries could revitalize the waterfront. And the Office of Emergency Management is looking around for mass-evacuation plans. (In a crisis, you wouldn't want to be left hailing a taxicab.) Put all that together, and there's a chance that a decade from now, ferries could be mentioned along with buses and subways as main-course options on New Yorkers' transportation menu. 
 An estimated 100,000 people a day ride New York's ferries. The options are pretty good if you want to commute between Lower Manhattan and either Staten Island or New Jersey. They're not bad if you want to shop at Ikea. They get thinner if you want to go between Manhattan and the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Dumbo, or Long Island City. If you're commuting from the Rockaways, in Queens, you have one shot a day. And beyond that, nothing. 
 It's not a simple matter to expand mass transit. Planners typically divide the city into tiny ''transportation analysis zones,'' then connect all the trips made in that zone to all their destinations. They break it down by time of day and type of vehicle, then factor in cost of travel, duration of travel, number of transfers and so on. Then they do the same thing for potentially thousands of other zones. The result is a precise mathematical model that indicates who is going where and how, and therefore what new options they might need or use. It can take months to get it right. 
 Which is several decades and a few billion dollars less than it will take to get a Second Avenue subway (may your grandchildren live long enough to see its inaugural run). 
 Ferries are a growth opportunity. To add new routes, you don't need to dig a tunnel or lay a track. You don't need to reroute traffic, build bridges or add lanes. And in many parts of New York, unlike almost every other city, you wouldn't need to build big parking lots where riders could leave their cars. What cars? 
 What you need is a viable pier and a boat. You need a convenient way to get from water's edge to people's ultimate destinations. And you need someone to be in charge of it all. 
 Right now, with the major exception of the Staten Island Ferry, all the city's routes are privately operated, mostly by the NY Waterway (which gets a boost from Goldman Sachs, whose employees commute in from New Jersey) and the New York Water Taxi (which receives subsidies from the city).
 It's hard to imagine ferry service expanding very far unless it becomes a public initiative, an integrated system with coordinated schedules and MetroCard access. But who would lead such an initiative? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority? The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey? The Department of Transportation? No one seems to know. 
 Whatever value these public agencies ultimately assign to reducing car traffic, easing interborough transit, supporting waterfront development or other such civic goals, New Yorkers have a personal reason to care. Ferries are fun. They tend to cost a few dollars more than other forms of mass transit, but you can think of the difference as an inexpensive form of mental health care. 
 Bike over the Brooklyn Bridge, through streets lined with brownstones and over to the Red Hook ball fields. Stuff yourself on empanadas and pupusas. Too tired to bike all the way home? Stop at Fairway for a limeade, then catch the Ikea ferry to Lower Manhattan, where a half-dozen subways can whisk you wherever. That's a very good day. 
 If a few hundred thousand more New Yorkers could commute to work with the sun on their faces and the wind in their hair, we might be so much less stressed that we wouldn't even recognize ourselves. We might be Seattle, for Pete's sake. Maybe that's why New York doesn't have more ferries.

HEADLINE: The Message Is the Message

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER

 BODY:
By the late 1940s, the art gods (gallery impresarios) had decreed that commercial artists be banished from galleries and museums unless they hid their tainted pasts. Of course, this changed when Andy Warhol, who started his career as a fairly successful editorial and advertising illustrator-designer, turned the art world on its soup can. Since then, the list of crossover artists has increased to the point where, arguably, it is difficult to be a contemporary artist without having an applied or commercial art pedigree -- or at least without once having designed a T-shirt. Yet one of today's most celebrated artists, Barbara Kruger, who began as a graphic designer for Conde Nast and helped pioneer (along with Lawrence Weiner, Ed Ruscha and Jenny Holzer, among others) a genre that liberally employs typography and advertising techniques, met with initial resistance not from myopic art pundits but from shortsighted fellow designers. 
 In Barbara Kruger (Rizzoli, $65), by Alexander Alberro, Martha Gever, Miwon Kwon and Carol Squiers, Squiers notes, ''To make the leap from designer to artist, Kruger had to reject the advice of people who had been instrumental to her magazine success.'' Among the most fervent naysayers was her friend and mentor Marvin Israel, who was an art director at Harper's Bazaar and also a painter; he insisted that to be an artist, one had to paint. ''I remember asking him,'' Kruger recalls here, ''can't I just be an artist using photographs, cutting them up, using Magic Markers? And he said no.''
 That didn't stop her. Kruger started making art in various media (including sewing) in the late '60s, while working as an assistant art director at Mademoiselle; in the '70s, after a period when she intensely studied postmodern theory, she attempted to define her relationship to politics and the art world. In an interview I conducted with her for a 1999 monograph, ''Barbara Kruger: Thinking of You,'' she told me that Patti Smith's early performances at St. Mark's Church in New York City gave her permission to be a female artist in a male world. By extension, her art, influenced by editorial design and typography, ''began to pose questions about the construction of everyday life and the social mechanisms of consumption, seduction and control,'' Squiers writes, ''which flowed as much from her experiences in fashion and lifestyle publishing as they did from the critical theory she read.'' She developed a graphic vocabulary that still routinely attacks economic and commercial power, and appeals to those who ''read'' and follow her critical messages.
 Among other things, Kruger is a masterly usurper and lampooner of manipulative advertising codes. And the current book, which spans 30 years, shows just how smartly she has appropriated design and typography in many formats and media: from tote bags with provocative slogans like ''I Shop Therefore I Am'' to billboards that proclaim ''We Don't Need Another Hero'' to her now famous pro-abortion-rights poster, ''Your Body Is a Battleground,'' to the mammoth outdoor earthworks installation ''Imperfect Utopia'' at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh.
 Kruger has never shied away from the grand statement and large gesture. In the early '90s, she filled rooms from floor to ceiling at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York with supergraphics that bombarded the visitor with slogans in her signature Futura Italic typeface, like ''All violence is the illustration of a pathetic stereotype.'' Her installation for ''Desire Exists Where Pleasure Is Absent'' simulates our exaggerated media-consumption experience through gigantic, claustrophobic typographic environments that relentlessly assault the viewer. Curiously, the work in this monograph, which for me recalls (and exploits) Fascist and Communist propaganda spectacles, shows how easy it is to grab public attention by blowing messages up to a mammoth scale. Size does matter!
 Kruger's vocabulary borrows manipulative tropes from right and left. Her bold black-and-white type against black-and-red fields derives from Bauhaus reductionism. Her appropriation of collage imagery owes a debt to the German Dadaist and Communist satirist John Heartfield. Yet she has achieved total dominance in this metier.
 What is vividly evident from this book is how many international patrons (notably art institutions) are willing to provide Kruger with significant space for her messages. Very impressive is ''Between Being Born and Dying,'' a typographic extravaganza that filled every window, corner and column of Lever House in New York with commentaries like ''Plenty Should Be Enough.'' The photographs are excellent documents, but I could kick myself for not having seen the original exhibition.
 After leaving the design world, Kruger became a model for many graphic designers who envied her for developing a personal voice. She is still called on to do one-off designs for commercial media. This monograph, which includes several essays by Kruger herself, features her so-called fine art as well as her commercial art. A great example of the commercial is her March 24, 2008, cover for New York magazine, which showed exactly where former Gov. Eliot Spitzer's brain resided. It is Kruger at her most perceptive.
 One of my favorite multisyllabic words -- because it sounds and feels as if I were gargling when I say it -- is the German Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art. It implies a holistic approach involving the integration of a variety of artistic forms. Barbara Kruger creates total works in many media, but Ryan McGinness seems to make his art in all media. He's a graphic designer, painter, printmaker, skateboard designer, logo maker, environmental signologist, identity strategist and button maker. For Art Basel Miami Beach in 2007, he produced coffee cups, coasters and napkins. He is a man of many patterns, including fanciful and psychedelic graphic musings. He's a master of silk-screen, letterpress and mirror-polished stainless steel. He even makes Rorschach inkblots.
 McGinness is a highly successful and widely embraced artist, but his roots, like Kruger's, are in the commercial world. ''I went through a rigorous graphic design program,'' he says in an interview in Ryan McGinness Works: Paintings, Sculptures, Sketches, Drawings, Installations, Editions, and Other Stuff (Rizzoli, $55).This ''other stuff'' has included ''decorating skateboards'' and ''making cassette covers and posters for a band I was in.'' Like Kruger, he studied postmodern criticism (at Carnegie Mellon) and recognized that all media could be art and all art could be mass media. However, while he was studying, he says, ''I soon realized the design industry has nothing to do with all the things that I loved in design school -- how to actually communicate visually, how to use semantics and how to build a picture plane.'' So McGinness created a studio, a ''laboratory'' for ideas, that brought together all the things he loved about design and art.
 All of that ''stuff'' is found in this career-defining monograph, which contains a short but illuminating interview (by the artist Peter Halley), a breathless insider's essay by a former assistant (Greg Lindquist), an indulgent conversation between McGinness and David Byrne, a serious study of McGinness's ''ontology of color'' (by Jonathan T. D. Neil) and another Q. and A., consisting of 500 speed questions (asked by Tom Greenwood, a neighbor of McGinness's in Chinatown). Sprinkled throughout are quotations by curators and other colleagues, and descriptions of various projects. In short, the book is typical of career catalogs that jam everything in, presuming the world will end before the next monograph.
 And yet, as overdesigned as the book is, it is appropriate for an artist who has crammed a lifetime of aggressively colorful and subversively political work into his 38 years. Actually, this is not McGinness's first monograph, but it is the one I will pore over more than once.
 Monographs used to be filled with art-historical texts justifying, categorizing and immortalizing the respective artists. In the age of Gesamtkunstwerk, in which the old art-world verities have disappeared, the new monographs are less structured but are often just as predictable. Sure, there are some amusing elements in Pop Touched Me: The Art of Rob Pruitt(Abrams, $50), like a poem by Mia Fineman on the colorful endpapers and a printed handwritten inscription saying ''I'll always love you -- Rob Pruitt'' on the title page. But there is something cloying about the strained efforts to ensure that the book is never boring.
 Jeffrey Deitch, the former New York gallery owner who has catapulted many postmodern artist-designers to prominence, writes in his essay ''The Story of Rob Pruitt'': ''Many artists today have very boring biographies: an M.F.A. from a prestigious art school and then a series of solo and group exhibitions at well-regarded galleries. . . . Rob Pruitt, in contrast, has a remarkable story that encompasses a great network of ongoing friendships and 20 years of contemporary art history. Rob is not just making art; he is living it.''
 In 1992, Pruitt was one half of the duo Pruitt-Early (the other half was Jack Early). They became notorious that year because of the exhibition ''Red, Black, Green, Red, White and Blue,'' which attacked race prejudice and corporate America. According to Deitch, ''everything about the project went terribly wrong. It was probably the most reviled, the most embarrassing and the most disastrous exhibition in the history of the downtown art world.'' Years later, Pruitt's ''Cocaine Buffet,'' a 16-foot-long line of cocaine running down the center of two mirrors, put him back on the art map.
 This book's problem is not the art or the installations. Indeed, Pruitt's ''Evian Fountain,'' using Evian cartons as a rim around a pool of fresh water, is terrific; his Warholization of ''Un Carton de Duraflame,'' decked out in glitter, is fun; and the ''iPhotos'' exterior installation at Gavin Brown's gallery in New York is incredible. But the self-promotion and narcissism -- excessive quotations, like Eva Prinz's ''Rob is the best artist in the whole wide world,'' appear everywhere -- become very boring very fast.
 All these artists might once have been called ''guerrillas,'' but the fact that they have expensive monographs suggests emergence from the jungle. Conversely, Robbie Conal, who for over two decades has been attacking the streets with guerrilla posters (well before Shepard Fairey), is still fighting the good fight, and has yet to have a monograph of comparable size and heft.
 In Not Your Typical Political Animal: Animal Drawings and Paintings by Guerrilla Poster Artist Robbie Conal (Art Attack, paper, $24.95), this New York-born ''red-diaper baby'' turned Southern California art activist reveals his skill at transforming nature into propaganda. ''Animals are the only consistent positive metaphors I've been able to muster in my political paintings, drawings and posters,'' Conal writes. ''Somehow -- for me at least -- they function as opposites, even antidotes, to willfully exploitive and abusive human behavior.''
 This is a much thinner book than the others, but it concentrates on a single passion. Conal uses a brutish representational style (nothing cute or cuddly here); nonetheless, some of the imagery, like ''Midnight Jellyfish,'' is painted in a futuristically exquisite manner. In Conal's universe, the politicians he frequently skewers serve as foils for their animals. In ''President Lyndon Johnson and His Dog 'Him' '' and ''President Richard Nixon and Checkers,'' his pairings of humans and dogs celebrate one over the other (guess who comes out on top?). He imagines some remarkable likenesses: J. Edgar Hoover looks like his Boston terrier on one page, and on another resembles a frog. Is this an insult to the frog?
 Art and design enjoyed a symbiotic relationship long before these late-20th-century crossovers. A good example of this can be found in Chinese Graphic Design in the Twentieth Century (Thames & Hudson, paper, $19.95), by Scott Minick and Jiao Ping. Their richly illustrated book introduces the European-influenced modernist graphics of the ''Shanghai Style,'' dominated by Art Deco, and the ''Progressive Movement,'' influenced by Russian Constructivism, de Stijl and the Bauhaus. In this amalgam of avant-gardes imported to China before World War II, it's possible to see similarities with Kruger's and McGinness's work in terms of color, type and pattern.
 There is a stark contrast between the modern approaches and the Maoist heroic realism; the modern is commercial art and much more aesthetically appealing than the turgidly detailed heroic realism. And yet, that fact should not lead us to cast aspersions against all Maoist graphic design. Truly amazing craftsmanship often made up for the concepts that could not be presented because of censorship. After all, kitsch, like art, is in the eye of the beholder.

HEADLINE: Un-Innocents Abroad: The Drubbing

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
''HOW the hell did we get into this mess?'' When Sarah Jessica Parker asked that question on the first episode of the HBO series ''Sex and the City'' in 1998, it came in the midst of an opening monologue that signaled the end of one kind of pop cultural heroine (''No one has breakfast at Tiffany's'') and the birth of a new one (''Welcome to the age of un-innocence''). Her name was Carrie Bradshaw, a New York writer and wit whose search for true love with a man never got in the way of her sex drive or close female friendships. Romance was dead, the show announced, but female desire was alive and kicking, usually in $400 designer heels. 
 Fast forward to ''Sex and the City 2,'' the sequel to the hit 2008 movie, written and directed by Michael Patrick King, that has generated some of the most hostile and outraged reviews in recent memory. ''The horror, the horror,'' wrote one critic. ''Nothing says putrefying, rotten and vile quite like this sequel,'' wrote another. Everything about the film has been faulted, even its enthusiastic embrace of flamboyant conspicuous consumption, an ethos, nay, a philosophy, that often inspired little more than indulgent chuckles in the past. In 2008 Vanity Fair estimated that the first movie name-dropped more than 20 designers. This time few are paying attention to the clothes: they're too busy fulminating over the movie's other perceived sins.
 The gravest of these sins in my unscientific survey are behavioral: the women act like ugly Americans and debase every aspect of Muslim culture they come in contact with. Also: they're women. And middle aged. Girlish. Have had bad work done. Or maybe not enough. ''A cross,'' David Edelstein wrote in New York magazine ''between (late) Mae West and (dead) Bea Arthur.'' ''Like a plastic surgeon,'' Tom Maurstad wrote in The Dallas Morning News, ''storyteller King keeps trying to find new ways to lift and tighten his characters, but they have become garish caricatures of themselves.'' ''What's not to loathe?'' Richard Roeper asked. Apparently nothing. At rottentomatoes.com, which compiles reviews, the first ''Sex and the City'' movie earned a 53 percent approval rating from top critics, while the sequel received -- eek -- just 9 percent.
 To borrow a tactic from the TV show, which invariably featured Carrie posing the week's Big Question to her readers: Was ''Sex'' actually 50 percent worse the second time around? Not from where I was seated, though I happily concede that the sequel is about as bad as the original. They're just lousy in different ways. The new sex puns (''Lawrence of my labia'') are as wince inducing as the old, and Mr. King's direction remains strictly small screen. What has changed are the locations: in the first film, the friends visit Mexico (funny!), but this time, they yuk it up in the Middle East (not funny!). But what has really changed? The characters, the critics, the context: how quickly yesterday's pleasure can pop, just like an economic bubble. 
 The new film's sex-capades turn on Carrie's restlessness in her new marriage to Big (Chris Noth), an agitation she quiets during a junket to Abu Dhabi with ''the girls'': Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis). After flying first-class-ultra in separate compartments, they are picked up at the airport in their own white Maybach sedans (which start at $417,000, in case you were wondering) and whisked to a hotel that's a stand-in for the Emirates Palace, an haute-decadent Abu Dhabi hotel with amenities like a gold-dispensing ATM (''gold to go''). In 2008 the real hotel initiated a ''million dollar package'' for guests that included seven nights in a suite, use of a Maybach and a ''day trip in private jet to Iran to create your own Persian carpet from the most exclusive and well-renowned hand-maker.'' 
 The four friends don't visit Iran, alas, where they might have seen some Muslim women fighting the powers that be; they don't even make it to the real United Arab Emirates. The production couldn't shoot in Abu Dhabi because authorities apparently denied it access after reading the screenplay. (Morocco played the role instead.) It's anyone's guess how far they read before the objections started flying, but I bet they didn't dig the swans and men's choir at the wedding of one gay sidekick, Stanford (Willie Garson), to another, Anthony (Mario Cantone) early in the story. Same-sex marriages are illegal in New York, but homosexuality is illegal in the United Arab Emirates. Liza Minnelli belting out ''Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'' at the wedding probably sealed the deal. 
 The excesses of the gay wedding might be forgivable (they are sure eye-popping), but whatever good will the women retained dissolved for many critics when they hit the Middle East. It was swell when the women went south to indulge in cultural cliches in Mexico or, rather, at a ritzy Mexican resort. There they drank margaritas, listened to a mariachi band, joked about the water and laughed uproariously when Charlotte, after accidentally slurping the water, soiled her pants while a maid silently cleaned nearby. I don't think Mr. King was engaging in some stealth political commentary with the maid's presence. She was just part of the scenery. 
 That kind of breezy entitlement is nothing new for ''Sex and the City,'' which after all pivots on four white professionals, most of whom barely work yet manage to enjoy all the pleasures of a narrowly demarcated city that bears next to no resemblance to the New York in which most people live. As it does with a lot of romance fiction, fantasy constituted a large part of the show's appeal. But unlike many bewitching romantic figures, including Holly Golightly, Carrie and her friends paid their own way. In the first season, in an episode coyly titled ''The Power of Female Sex,'' a rich man whom Carrie beds leaves a thousand bucks on the nightstand the morning after, and she briefly contemplates and rejects going Golightly. 
 Granted, shopping for Manolos might seem an inane form of female empowerment, but when a woman pays for those shoes herself, it means something. The problem was that the show's creators appeared to take Barbara Kruger's brilliant slogan ''I shop therefore I am'' without the requisite irony, and, over time, couture idolatry became a form of identity politics for the characters. (Given this, it's no surprise the show embarrassed itself whenever it attempted to take on race and class.) The failure to grow up as the characters aged and began to lead adult lives, at times painfully adult lives with disappointing husbands and fertility issues, signaled that the party was long over before the show, after six seasons, mercifully ended. 
 The first movie continued in this same giddy vein, exemplified by montage sequences of Carrie modeling clothes, and when it opened critics generally embraced it and its materialistic esprit. Two years -- and the worst economy since the Great Depression -- later, critics, whose numbers are thinning rapidly, no longer see the joke, any joke. As a passionate takedown by my friend (and occasional New York Times contributor) Matt Zoller Seitz at IFC.com made clear, I wasn't the only viewer taken aback by Miranda's impulsive decision to quit her law firm in a climate in which a powerhouse like Latham & Watkins lays off hundreds. ''They should have ended the scene,'' he wrote, ''by having a giant bag of money fall out of the sky and land at her feet.''
 Instead, Mr. King sent the women to Disneyland, oops, the Middle East, which clearly is no laughing matter, however hard he tried to invoke the Hope and Crosby road movies and, more subtly, Frank Capra's ''Lost Horizon,'' about a utopia. Initially Abu Dhabi appears like a paradise to the characters, who stay in a $22,000-a-night suite complete with butlers. But Eden has its price, and, during a visit to a souk, a torrentially sweating Samantha, in the midst of a hot flash, brandishes a fistful of condoms at an increasingly large, enveloping crowd of unsmiling men. The friends escape the crowd with the help of some local women in niqabs, who soon drop their black veils to show off their designer outfits. 
 Mr. King's sartorial sisterhood might not recognize cultural divides, but American critics are having none of it. At Hollywood.com, Thomas Leupp, under a headline that read, ''This Is the New Torture Porn,'' wrote that it ''could become an effective inspirational video for suicide bombers -- provided they can endure the film's two-and-a-half-hour running time, of course.'' Responding to another scene, in which Samantha is arrested for making like Deborah Kerr on a beach, Steve Persall, of The St. Petersburg Times, wrote: ''I can't say I blame the authorities. Sorry, but when in Rome or Abu Dhabi (or Morocco), you do as the locals do, especially in these times.'' Gee, it's a good thing that Stanford and Anthony decided to stay home. 
 The scene of Samantha in the souk has been branded insulting to Muslims. Certainly it's insulting to comedy lovers and to the character, a shrewd number sold out by her director for an unfunny gag about the unruly female body. This and other scenes of the women with Muslims are often awkward, though that's partly a function of Mr. King's direction. Yet there's also something touching about a few of these encounters, as when the women wonder how you eat fries when you're wearing a veil, a question that strikes me as an uncharacteristically honest admission of difference in a mainstream American movie. Too bad the women weren't guys and went to Las Vegas, where they could have indulged in the kind of critically sanctioned masculine political incorrectness that made ''The Hangover'' such a darling.

HEADLINE: In a Gadfly's Campaign, Winning Isn't the Point

BYLINE: By JANELLE BROWN

 BODY:
Los Angeles
 ''THIS is the throbbing heart of the Kaus for Senate campaign,'' says Mickey Kaus, throwing open the door to his two-bedroom apartment in the Venice neighborhood here. Inside, there are no campaign posters to be seen, no army of clean-scrubbed interns, no banks of phones or red-white-and-blue bunting or stacks of voter registration forms. Instead, there's just Ikea furniture buried under a flurry of political tomes, magazines, printouts, cellphone manuals, and two-year-old Christmas card photos starring his friends' children. A red laptop balances on a stool. A small TV sits on a table. In the kitchen, spilled coffee grounds share counter space with a spread of vitamins and nonalcoholic beer.
 No, this is not your typical Senate campaign command center; but then again, Mr. Kaus is not your typical Senate hopeful. His lair speaks more to his career of the last 10 years -- prolific blogger and professional curmudgeon -- than the one he's currently aspiring to. As the one-man show behind Kausfiles on Slate, Mr. Kaus was one of the first political bloggers, after a print career that included stops at publications like Newsweek and Harper's. 
 More than a decade on, he's legendary for being a gadfly, an irritant and a provocateur, a so-called ''neoliberal'' who is loathed by many Democrats (see: Ezra Klein) and befriended by an equal number of conservatives (see: Ann Coulter). His blog drew up to 40,000 daily readers.
 ''Drew'' being the operative word. In March, Mr. Kaus unexpectedly stepped out from behind his laptop, quit his job at Slate, and announced that he was running for Senate in the California Democratic primary on June 8 against the incumbent, Barbara Boxer. His slogan: ''Common Sense Democrat.'' The announcement was greeted with equal parts amusement, enthusiasm and scorn. (In Vanity Fair, James Wolcott suggested Mr. Kaus ''run for mayor of Margaritaville'' instead.)
 ''If you'd asked me is he ever going to run for Senate, I'd say, 'Are you crazy?' '' says Michael Kinsley, editor at large of The Atlantic Wire and a longtime friend. ''He seems like a classic blogger -- someone who is happier in front of his computer than he is out kissing babies.''
 But Mr. Kaus has thrown himself into his quixotic campaign with surprising earnestness, undeterred by his prospects (grim) and general diagnosis (insane). He is the first person to admit that he has absolutely no chance of becoming California's next Senator, but contends that this is not really the point. He says he is running as a protest candidate in order to draw attention to his pet issues.
 ''My readers already know what I think,'' Mr. Kaus explains. ''I think they're sick to death of hearing it. This is a chance to reach a new audience.'' He offers his guest water in a disposable plastic cup (''I hate doing dishes,'' he apologizes). ''I was at the point of diminishing returns. This seemed like a huge opportunity to make an impact.''
 Or as his longtime friend Ann Louise Bardach, the author of ''Without Fidel,'' puts it: ''Mickey's getting to a certain age, he's been doing this a long time. At this point you look back, and you've done hundreds of pieces, thousands of stories -- I think that rather than talking about politicians, you say to yourself, I'm going to do it myself.'' She laughs. ''What do you call it, a midlife crisis?''
 Here are Mickey Kaus' issues, in a nutshell: labor unions (which he blames for the destruction of the California educational system, the auto industry and assorted government institutions) and illegal immigration (which he thinks can't be solved with a general amnesty). He has opinions on everything from health care to marijuana legalization, but these tend to hew closer to the Democratic party platform, while the former issues are where he differs from what he calls the ''lock-step Democrats.''
 ''We need a government that works, an economy that's hot, and people have to make enough money to live a life of dignity,'' he argues. ''That's what the unions and the Latino lobby are getting in the way of.''
 Nicholas Lemann, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, whose relationship with Mr. Kaus goes back to their Harvard Crimson days, describes the Kaus philosophy thusly: ''Mickey sees himself as a liberal whose mission in life is to correct the flaws of liberalism.''
 Not everyone sees it quite that way. Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos, for one, calls Mr. Kaus's campaign the desperate act of an irrelevant blogger. ''Suddenly, he decides to run for Senate, and lots of people think it's absolutely hilarious,'' he says. ''I mean, it's as if Emmanuel Lewis suddenly announced he was running for Senate. First of all, you'd be like, 'Whoa, I forgot that guy existed!,' then you'd wonder, 'What the heck is he thinking!,' and then you'd laugh.''
 THE son of the former California Supreme Court Justice Otto Kaus, Mickey Kaus grew up in Beverly Hills. His only previous political office was as student body president of his high school, a post he won on a promise of banishing the school uniform. Harvard led to Harvard Law, a passion for Marxism, and a clerking job at the California Supreme Court, before he renounced law for a job in journalism, joining the Washington Monthly. Other magazine jobs followed -- as did occasional breaks to work on political campaigns (including for the doomed presidential hopeful Ernest Hollings in 1984). By 1992, he'd published the well-received tome ''The End of Equality,'' which argued in favor of welfare reform and social equality, and was working for The New Republic.
 ''I seemed to be on my way to adulthood,'' he recalls. ''I even bought a house in Georgetown. But it turns out I'm completely allergic to Washington, D.C. I was literally developing asthma.'' (When it's pointed out that, as a senator, he'd have to spend a fair amount of time there, he grimaces. ''I'll invest in a lot of air-purifying technology.'')
 Instead, he headed west again and took a stab at a novel (''it was awful''), before realizing the Web was the perfect outlet for his many opinions. He began writing the Chatterbox column on Slate, before starting Kausfiles in late 1999. ''In a way, he invented political blogging,'' Mr. Kinsley says.
 A daily outpouring of links, one-liners and long-form analysis, Kausfiles is known for its biting tone and contrarian take on popular Democratic canards. For a decade, he has opined to his heart's content. Even as the political blogging universe exploded, the so-called commentariat went into overdrive, and Mr. Kaus became just one of the countless voices clamoring to be heard. Ultimately, there was not much further to go, even for someone who argued that the Net could have a real impact on politics.
 ''The Kaus blog speaks to a very smart and important influential niche, but it's still just a niche,'' says the conservative blogger Jonah Goldberg, who has supported Mr. Kaus's campaign in the National Review Online. ''The universe of bloggers is a hell of a lot smaller than a lot of bloggers like to think.''
 Which is how the surprise candidacy eventually came about: The professional naysayer, it turns out, wanted to have a real-world impact: ''It's the honorable calling,'' Mr. Kaus says. ''To make the world a better place.''
 FOR a solitary blogger, Mickey Kaus is astonishingly social and well connected: It's difficult to find a writer or politico in Los Angeles who hasn't knocked elbows (or opinions) with Mr. Kaus at a party, or at the monthly mixers he hosts at Yamashiro restaurant and a supper club jokingly called Morons. With his growling voice, unruly hair and expansive brow, he is as dominating a physical presence as an intellectual one. Perpetually single at 58 -- ''I see myself as a bachelor who will get himself together very soon, in the same way Internet companies will be profitable next year'' -- he's also dated a fair number of the eligible literati of Los Angeles, including Arianna Huffington in 2005.
 Still, his coffers aren't exactly overflowing with donations. His campaign remains as modest as one would expect for a $36,000 budget -- money mostly spent on Google ads, YouTube videos, and radio and TV spots. His campaign manager is a 25-year-old postgrad who manages his Twitter and Facebook accounts. His campaign trail has involved stunt events, like his recent ''debate'' at a San Francisco Holiday Inn (featuring an audience of six and a cardboard box standing in for Senator Boxer) on the same night the senator held a star-studded fund-raiser at the Fairmont. He was denied a speaking spot at the Democratic State Convention, thanks to his own blunt honesty about his dismal prospects. (''It turns out you're not supposed to say that,'' he says.)
 Press coverage of his campaign, while fairly widespread, isn't always kind. And the senator has barely acknowledged him. When asked about Mr. Kaus, her press officer questioned whether he was worth a profile in The New York Times, then declined further comment.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Kaus perseveres with fund-raisers up and down the state. One Saturday night, he held court at the modernist Venice home of Nancy Griffin, a journalist, and Steven Ehrlich, an architect. A crowd of four dozen west-side creatives (writers, bloggers, entertainment industry professionals) nibbled on crackers and sat on Moroccan poufs while trading quips with him. (Q: ''Why didn't you just run for mayor or governor?'' A: ''I'm more qualified to be senator. Those other jobs are hard.'')
 Having traded in his trademark leather bomber for a blazer with jeans, Mr. Kaus expounded on Reaganism, economic determinism, labor markets and the new Tesla factory before remembering he needed to do a fund-raising pitch. ''If you ever wanted to buy my loyalty, I'm cheap,'' he announced. So cheap, that said loyalty could be bought with a $10 raffle ticket, a Kaus-curated iPod the prize. ''Don't buy more than four tickets,'' he warned, ''or we get into all kinds of F.E.C. regulations.''
 ''He's a wiseacre, yet there's a part of him that's really sincere and wants a heartfelt conversation,'' observed the event's moderator, the journalist Steve Oney, comparing Mr. Kaus' campaign to the failed writer-candidates Upton Sinclair and Gore Vidal. Ms. Griffin passed out buttons and called her guest ''provocative.'' ''I'm not sure he would be a good senator,'' she laughed. ''But I think he's a good candidate.''
 After June 8, he will, in all likelihood, be an ex-candidate. If this concerns him, he hides it well. ''The worst thing your enemy can do is ignore you, and I don't feel I've been ignored,'' he says. ''To win I just need to get more votes than I'm expected to get. And since I'm expected to get zero, the threshold for success is low.''

HEADLINE: The 20-Year Alternative

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MOST people who took out jumbo mortgages during the financial crisis got hit with high interest rates as lenders and investors recoiled from anything that seemed even remotely risky. Now that market conditions have improved, some of these borrowers are looking to refinance into lower-rate mortgages, but they may not want to start over with a 30-year loan. 
 One possible solution might be to refinance into a 20-year loan. Right now, rates on these mortgages are low enough that someone in the third year of a 30-year loan can shave years off the payment term without increasing the monthly payment much, if at all. 
 ''The benefit to the borrower is saving thousands of dollars in interest, because of the shorter term,'' said Thomas Pinkowish, a mortgage industry consultant in Essex, Conn. ''The drawback is the higher payment.''
 But sometimes the increase is small, said Stephen Habetz, the president of the Threshold Mortgage Group in Westport, Conn.
 For instance, a borrower who took out a $1 million loan four years ago at the prevailing rate of 5.875 percent, Mr. Habetz said, would have a monthly payment of $5,915. The remaining balance today would be $945,000. That same borrower could now, with a good financial profile, qualify for a 20-year mortgage at 4.75 percent with no points, he said. 
 Assuming refinance charges of $5,000 were added into the new loan, the new payment would be $6,139, or $224 more than the old loan. But, Mr. Habetz added, ''with a 15-year loan, at the current rates, the payment is $7,251, which is a lot more painful.'' 
 By switching to a 20-year loan, the borrower would pay off the mortgage six years sooner than the current schedule, saving nearly $380,000 in interest payments. Even if the borrower sold the home in five years, he or she would still have built $66,000 more in equity with the new loan than the old one, Mr. Habetz said. 
 He said that since interest rates on 20-year loans dropped to current levels about a month ago, the mortgages have grown in popularity among borrowers of jumbo mortgages -- loans of more than $729,750 in areas with the highest-cost housing.
 Demand has been especially strong, he said, among borrowers with loans of more than $1 million, because that is the threshold beyond which borrowers cannot deduct mortgage interest from their federal income taxes.
 Mr. Pinkowish noted that 20-year loans mainly appeal to people financially comfortable with the payment, and those who want a mortgage-free retirement and plan on staying in their homes. 
 To find the loans, borrowers can contact brokers like Mr. Habetz or use an online service like Lendingtree.com, which last week offered 20-year mortgages in Manhattan from Sterling National Bank and Block Financial Resources. A borrower with a 20 percent down payment and a 720 FICO score would qualify for a loan (of less than $417,000) with a 4.75 percent rate at Sterling National.
 Meanwhile, Hudson City Savings Bank, which serves parts of the tristate area, offered a 20-year mortgage for 4.75 percent last week. Thomas Laird, the bank's chief lending officer, said that three years ago these loans accounted for about 1 percent of mortgage business. This year, that figure has reached 6 percent.
 Hudson City does not lend in Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens, because of the high concentration of multifamily housing and co-ops. Borrowers should be prepared to make down payments of at least 20 percent, and their housing debt should generally not exceed 34 percent of their gross income, Mr. Laird said. Total debt, he added, should not exceed 42 percent of income.
 Hudson City does not review a borrower's credit score. Rather, Mr. Laird said, the bank looks at the borrower's ''overall track record, their income, their assets.''
 ''Anybody taking a 20-year loan typically has stronger income, and more ability to service the debt,'' he said, ''so they're not first-time home buyers struggling to get in.''

HEADLINE: High-End Sales Canter; Prices Walk

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN Westchester, well known for its pricey homes and estates in sought-after locales like Bedford and Chappaqua, many buyers and sellers are wondering whether the high-end sector of the real estate market is rebounding -- or still mired in the downturn that took hold two years ago and has been slow to let go. 
 The answer is some of both, market watchers say. 
 Comparing this April with last, the New York State Association of Realtors reported a 60 percent jump in the number of single-family home sales, to 284, with 18 percent selling for $1 million or more. That is an improvement, if far under the highs reached in 2005, 2006 and 2007, when sales of a million dollars and over represented more than 30 percent of all single-family transactions, according to the group's statistics. In 2007, 418 single-family homes sold for $1 million or more. The next year that number was down to 214, and last year it fell to 154.
 Also in April, the median sales price of a single-family home in the county finally reversed its free fall and rose to $590,000, according to the real estate group. That compares with $532,000 in the first quarter of 2009 and $635,000 for the first quarter of 2007. The increase in the median -- the number at the middle, with half of sales higher and half lower -- is a direct reflection of more sales at the high end, the association said.
 One factor contributing to the uptick is a more-vigorous market for co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan, which in turn is ''stirring the luxury market here,'' said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester-Putnam Association of Realtors and the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Buyers relocating from New York City generally make up about a quarter of Westchester's sales activity, he said. 
 In the current market, well-heeled bargain-hunters are focusing on properties that languished last year and as a result have undergone significant price cuts, said Robert Kesten, a sales agent with Vincent & Whittemore Real Estate in Bedford. At the same time, because competition among sellers is stiff and because there is an excess of inventory, even upscale houses that are new to the market are priced far lower than they would have been several years ago.
 As an example, Mr. Kesten cited a Bedford contemporary with four bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths on six acres, with a pool, a tennis court and a private lake, listed for $3.625 million. ''Two years ago,'' he said, ''that property would have been listed for $5 million, easily.''
 These days, there is a contingent of buyers, financial types among them, who are able to pay cash and thus are relatively immune to the vagaries of the market, Mr. Kesten said, adding, ''Those are the ones who can seriously close a deal.'' 
 But even with reduced prices and an infusion of new buyers, many houses remain unsold for a long time, which is why an argument can be made that the recession still has a firm grip on the market. The 6,568 units for sale at the end of the first quarter was 4 percent greater than last year at that time, and 11 percent greater than in 2008, according to the Westchester-Putnam Realtors' association. 
 Some of the increase in inventory is caused by homeowners who perceive conditions to be improving. Other sellers, feeling the persistent pain of a slow economy, sell because they can no longer afford to maintain an expensive property.
 The inventory glut has prompted the expansion of a previously Manhattan-centric auction company called Bid on the City, which is seeking to siphon off the excess in Westchester and the Hamptons as well.
 Vlad Sapozhnikov, one of the service's founders, said that from his perspective, the housing market ''remains under massive stress.'' He describes Bid on the City as ''the new eBay for real estate.''
 Anxious owners sometimes list their house with an agency and also put it up for bid with Mr. Sapozhnikov's company. 
 Live bidding takes place in Bid on the City's 4,000-square-foot headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Bids can also be made online with video and audio streamed in real time. 
 In Scarsdale, Ed Ferguson, a senior vice president for Westchester of Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty, said he was skeptical of Bid on the City. ''We're watching to see if it works,'' he said, citing his concern that the bidding service could force prices to drop even further. 
 In the words of Mark J. Seiden, a broker-owner in Briarcliff Manor, a ''market valuation crush'' at the top end is compressing prices all down the line. For example, what used to be a $1.2 million house in Chappaqua can now be had for $899,000.
 Left to the effects of supply and demand, Mr. Ferguson predicted, the market will recover, albeit ''ever so slowly.'' 
 ''The numbers indicate that buyer demand is improving, that the market is coming back,'' he added. ''But the recovery is still in the early stages and therefore still vulnerable.''

HEADLINE: A Reunion of Le Mans Corvettes As New Version Heads to France

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
Salinas, Calif.
 ''I didn't think I'd ever see this car again,'' said Dick Thompson, the roadracing dentist who in 1960 had co-driven the white No. 2 Corvette in the 24 hours of Le Mans with Fred Windridge. 
 With Thompson at the wheel, the 290-horsepower fuel-injected car was first off the line when the race started, and it managed a speed of more than 161 m.p.h. on the Mulsanne straight. But Thompson, running among the leaders, spun off the track and into a sand pit. By the time he dug himself out, the leaders were many laps ahead. 
 Thompson's reunion with the No. 2 car took place here at the Laguna Seca track last month, where Chevrolet had gathered veteran Le Mans Corvettes -- the 1960 racecar; a '67 driven by Dick Guldstrand and Bob Bondurant; and a John Greenwood car that competed in 1973 -- on the weekend of an American Le Mans Series race. 
 At the 2010 Le Mans race, which takes place next weekend about 130 miles southwest of Paris, Corvettes will again compete. But before the green flag flies, a tribute to tradition: pre-race activities on the schedule include a parade of 50 Corvettes on ''un tour d'Honneur'' around the eight-mile circuit, to be led by the No. 3 car of the 1960 Corvette team, which won its class and finished eighth over all. 
 At the wheel will be John Fitch, now 92, who co-drove it a half-century ago with Bob Grossman. Alongside, in the passenger seat, will be the car's present owner, Lance Miller.
 The Corvettes in this year's 24-hour race, which Chevrolet designates as C6.R models, are survivors of the cost-cutting under which General Motors eliminated most of its racing programs during last year's financial crisis. It helped that the rules in the Le Mans GT2 class emphasize production-based vehicles like the factory-backed Corvettes, which will do battle with entries from BMW, Ferrari, Jaguar, Porsche and other marques. 
 The appearance of Fitch and the 1960 racecar started with Lance Miller's desire to fulfill a last wish of his father, Chip, who organized collector-car events. The elder Miller had acquired the car and restored it to its Le Mans trim two years before his death in 2004 at age 61. 
 ''My father never had the opportunity to go to Le Mans,'' Mr. Miller wrote in an e-mail message. It was his father's dream, he said, to return the car -- with Fitch driving -- to the site of what he called ''Corvette's grandest victory.''
 The class win did not come easily to the Fitch-Grossman Corvette. It suffered engine overheating in the final hour, but under the Le Mans rules it could not make stops to replenish fluids. The car was able to make it to the end of the race only by packing ice from the team's soft drink coolers into the car's engine compartment during pit stops.
 Things went worse for the No. 2 car. Thompson remembers it as a death-defying experience. 
 ''We knew before the race the brakes would fail before halfway, and they did,'' he said. ''I asked Ed Cole, the head of Chevrolet then, why they didn't put disc brakes on such a sporty car. He said, 'No, not on a production car.''' 
 ''He also said that he had heard that, in the Northern states, ice was a problem on discs,'' said Thompson, relating a myth of the era. ''Can you beat that? That Corvette had everything you could want except brakes! The car had great potential. But G.M. didn't want to spend the time and the money on it.''
 In a nod to Thompson and other Corvette racing pioneers, Jan Magnussen, a driver on today's factory C6.R team, wise-cracked, ''They started the complaining, and things are just about getting fixed now.'' 
 Mr. Magnussen and five other drivers on the two-car Corvette factory team will be campaigning for Le Mans glory in next weekend's race. The C6.R Corvettes are production-based but not nearly as stock as those 1960 Corvettes -- perhaps best remembered as one of the models to star in the ''Route 66'' television show -- whose list of modifications included little more than oversize gas tanks with quick-fill caps, magnesium wheels, racing seats and heavy-duty suspensions. 
 When asked how well-prepared the Corvette racecars of '60 were, Thompson replied: ''It was strictly a styling exercise. Its roadracing ability was limited. It had a solid rear axle, bias-belted tires and drum brakes. They were heavy, but they were fast.''
 The owner of the 1960 Corvette team, Briggs Cunningham, was a wealthy sportsman who had procured three new Corvettes from dealerships and brought them with him to Le Mans that year. To save on air freight, he booked passage for himself on an ocean liner and had the Corvettes checked as his baggage, Thompson said in an interview. After the race, the cars were shipped back to the United States by the same method. 
 Thompson said he had expected the cars would go into a museum, as Chevrolet officials had told the drivers these were special Corvettes now, and would never be raced again. Instead, Cunningham had the cars returned to a dealership, where all the racing equipment was stripped off. The cars were repainted and sold to the public! (''Low miles, driven only on weekends'')
 The whereabouts of the No. 1 car are unknown. Thompson's No. 2 was found in 1978 in an Irwindale, Calif., junkyard, where a sharp-eyed collector bought it for $300. The No. 3 Corvette driven by Fitch changed hands numerous times before the Miller family acquired it in 2000. 
 That any of the cars survive, much less the drivers, is something of a miracle. Fitch, an Indiana native, a World War II fighter pilot and a former prisoner of war, went on to other racing successes during a long career; he eventually became general manager of the Lime Rock Park racetrack in Connecticut. Thompson, a dentist in Washington, decided he could not safely make a decent living behind the wheel. So he quit racing and continued practicing dentistry until retiring at age 75. He now lives in Florida.
 The No. 2 Corvette now leads a pampered life with Bruce Meyer, a well-known West Coast collector. The No. 3 Corvette will be featured at the Corvettes at Carlisle show in Pennsylvania on Aug. 27-29. (Chip Miller was a co-founder of Carlisle Events in 1973.)
 Lance Miller said he still considered No. 3 his father's car. ''I have a feeling this will always be dubbed 'Chip's '60 Le Mans racer.'''

HEADLINE: Corvette Plays Dress-Up: Now Isn't That Special?

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
TESTED: 2010 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport
 WHAT IS IT? An All-American sports car, available as coupe or convertible.
 HOW MUCH? Coupe base price, $55,720 (convertible $59,530); as tested, $69,855 including $1,750 navigation system, $7,705 Premium Equipment Group (leather wrapped interior, upgraded audio system, heads-up display and more) and $1,195 Grand Sport Heritage Package (fender stripes, two-tone seats, embroidered headrest logos).
 WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 6.2-liter V-8 with 430 or 436 horsepower; 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. 
 IS IT THIRSTY? Considering its muscularity, the Corvette drinks with surprising restraint. With the manual transmission, the E.P.A. rating is 16 miles per gallon in town and 26 on the highway.
 ALTERNATIVES:Porsche Cayman and 911, Nissan GT-R, Ford Mustang GT 500. 
 SOME good news for Chevrolet: of all the high-end sporty cars sold in the United States last year, nearly one in six was a Corvette. 
 Now, the bad news: Corvette sales nonetheless plunged in 2009 to depths unmatched since 1961, two years before the Sting Ray was born. 
 Between anxious consumers and a flight from impractical sports cars that began well before the recession bushwhacked the economy, what J. D. Power calls the ''premium sporty'' class -- two-seaters, coupes and convertibles above $40,000 -- withered to a paltry 89,000 sales last year from 230,000 in 2003. In 2009, Corvette sales tumbled by half, to just under 14,000, despite offering what is surely the broadest and most desirable lineup in its history. 
 That roster already features the tail-kicking, 505-horsepower Z06 and the bank-breaking, 638-horse ZR1. But those Ferrari-baiters cost a respective $75,000 and $109,000.
 The basic Corvette coupe starts just under $50,000. Yet that model has been around since 2005, and its been-there, done-that status has fans pining for the next all-new 'Vette. 
 In the past, to break that holding pattern, Chevy has trotted out ''commemorative'' editions. These have included Indy Pace Car Corvettes with paint treatments lurid enough to make a Nascar sponsor gag on his corn dog. 
 The new Grand Sport is nothing like those skin-deep screamers: it borrows just enough of the Z06's looks and performance to let buyers feel special. Yet the price is several floors below the penthouse of the Porsche 911. The GS is offered as a targa-roof coupe or convertible and you can get a 6-speed automatic. The Z06 comes only as a fixed-roof coupe with a manual gearbox. 
 The standard Corvette is handsome but tends to disappear in traffic. The GS's eye candy alone -- including the Z06's bulging fenders, gill-like side louvers, gaping front air splitter and rear spoiler -- is worth a good chunk of its $5,800 premium. The GS appears more streamlined, the wide hips drawing your eye along the slender waist. This is a great-looking Corvette. 
 On my test car, chromed aluminum wheels reflected enough sunlight to incinerate anthills at 20 paces; those $1,995 wheels were the sole hint of vestigial cheesiness. I would divert that cash to the $1,195 dual-mode exhaust: it adds 6 horsepower (to 436) and opens valves under hard acceleration to let the V-8's cri de coeur be heard for blocks. 
 Corvettes are rare on the streets of New York, where enthusiasts seem to prefer the troika of ''Beamer, Benz or Bentley'' -- not to mention Porsche -- currently popularized by the rapper Lloyd Banks. Burbling through the hip East Village, my searing red Grand Sport test car seemed as conspicuous as a flying mountain banshee from ''Avatar'' alighting on Avenue C. 
 The GS is also roughly as fun to pilot as those computer-generated creatures, its swooping and diving aided by a stiffened suspension and hulking wheels and tires that let it exceed 1g in cornering force -- a supercar level of grip -- before the tires break loose.
 With its pushrod V-8, the GS scoots from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in about four seconds. As on the Z06, six-piston front brake calipers snare enormous 14-inch cross-drilled brake rotors, with four-piston brakes mated to 13.4-inch rotors in the back. The manual coupe also gets the fancy dry-sump lubrication system from the Z06 to make sure the car doesn't starve for oil during hard cornering. Don't faint when the mechanic rings up 10.5 quarts of oil -- that's how much the GS holds. 
 As with the Z06's larger 7-liter engine, the GS's dry-sump V-8 is assembled by hand by a single technician. 
 On winding country roads north of New York City, the GS projected wave upon wave of Yankee power. The wide-bodied 'Vette can make a driver tentative as it hogs every inch of its lane, with steering that falls short of the platonic ideal of a Porsche. Yet the GS's tremendous roadholding and braking quickly build up a driver's confidence.
 As with any Corvette, the enormous cargo hatch, the surprisingly tolerable ride and the respectable fuel economy improve what is already a top value.
 There are flaws. The Corvette's plasticky interior has always been graded on a curve, achieving a ''C'' only when scored with the remedial students -- meaning older Corvettes. 
 True, the interior did improve significantly when the sixth-generation Corvette arrived as a 2005 model. Five years on, there is no excusing the uncomfortably thin seats, wrapped in leather so bachelor-pad chintzy that Chevy should include a Nagel print with every purchase. 
 With its volatile, lock-up-your-daughters personality, the Z06 is still my favorite Corvette. (As for the ZR1, don't tell me how many Italian exotics it eats for breakfast -- $109,000 is too much for a car with so much Chevy-ness oozing from its fiberglass pores.) For many buyers, the GS is the ideal compromise. 
 Sad sales numbers don't lie. Buying a sports car now can seem like the ultimate in irrational exuberance. But as two-seat splurges go, the Corvette is more like rational exuberance. And if not, there's always a second mortgage.

HEADLINE: With U.S. Aid, Warlord Builds Afghan Empire

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Sangar Rahimi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TIRIN KOT, Afghanistan -- The most powerful man in this arid stretch of southern Afghanistan is not the provincial governor, nor the police chief, nor even the commander of the Afghan Army. 
 It is Matiullah Khan, the head of a private army that earns millions of dollars guarding NATO supply convoys and fights Taliban insurgents alongside American Special Forces.
 In little more than two years, Mr. Matiullah, an illiterate former highway patrol commander, has grown stronger than the government of Oruzgan Province, not only supplanting its role in providing security but usurping its other functions, his rivals say, like appointing public employees and doling out government largess. His fighters run missions with American Special Forces officers, and when Afghan officials have confronted him, he has either rebuffed them or had them removed.
 ''Oruzgan used to be the worst place in Afghanistan, and now it's the safest,'' Mr. Matiullah said in an interview in his compound here, where supplicants gather each day to pay homage and seek money and help. ''What should we do? The officials are cowards and thieves.'' 
 Mr. Matiullah is one of several semiofficial warlords who have emerged across Afghanistan in recent months, as American and NATO officers try to bolster -- and sometimes even supplant -- ineffective regular Afghan forces in their battle against the Taliban insurgency. 
 In some cases, these strongmen have restored order, though at the price of undermining the very institutions Americans are seeking to build: government structures like police forces and provincial administrations that one day are supposed to be strong enough to allow the Americans and other troops to leave. 
 In other places around the country, Afghan gunmen have come to the fore as the heads of private security companies or as militia commanders, independent of any government control. In these cases, the warlords not only have risen from anarchy but have helped to spread it. 
 For the Americans, who are racing to secure the country against a deadline set by President Obama, the emergence of such strongmen is seen as a lesser evil, despite how compromised many of them are. In Mr. Matiullah's case, American commanders appear to have set aside reports that he connives with both drug smugglers and Taliban insurgents.
 ''The institutions of the government, in security and military terms, are not yet strong enough to be able to provide security,'' said Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, commander of NATO forces in southern Afghanistan. ''But the situation is unsustainable and clearly needs to be resolved.''
 Many Afghans say the Americans and their NATO partners are making a grave mistake by tolerating or encouraging warlords like Mr. Matiullah. These Afghans fear the Americans will leave behind an Afghan government too weak to do its work, and strongmen without any popular support. 
 ''Matiullah is an illiterate guy using the government for his own interest,'' said Mohammed Essa, a tribal leader in Tirin Kot, the Oruzgan provincial capital. ''Once the Americans leave, he won't last. And then what will we have?''
 Building a Fortune
 Mr. Matiullah does not look like one of the aging, pot-bellied warlords from Afghanistan's bygone wars. Long and thin, he wears black silk turbans and extends a pinky when he gestures to make a point. Mr. Matiullah's army is an unusual hybrid, too: a booming private business and a government-subsidized militia. 
 His main effort -- and his biggest money maker -- is securing the chaotic highway linking Kandahar to Tirin Kot for NATO convoys. One day each week, Mr. Matiullah declares the 100-mile highway open and deploys his gunmen up and down it. The highway cuts through an area thick with Taliban insurgents. 
 Mr. Matiullah keeps the highway safe, and he is paid well to do it. His company charges each NATO cargo truck $1,200 for safe passage, or $800 for smaller ones, his aides say. His income, according to one of his aides, is $2.5 million a month, an astronomical sum in a country as impoverished as this one. 
 ''It's suicide to come up this road without Matiullah's men,'' said Mohammed, a driver hauling stacks of sandbags and light fixtures to the Dutch base in Tirin Kot. The Afghan government even picks up a good chunk of Mr. Matiullah's expenses. Under an arrangement with the Ministry of the Interior, the government pays for roughly 600 of Mr. Matiullah's 1,500 fighters, including Mr. Matiullah himself, despite the fact that the force is not under the government's control. 
 ''The government tried to shut him down, and when they couldn't, they agreed to pay for his men,'' said Martine van Bijlert, a co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, an independent organization here. NATO commanders say they reluctantly pay Mr. Matiullah (and others like him) for his services because they have no other way of moving their convoys across dangerous territory. Having their own men do it, they say, would take them away from other tasks. 
 American Support
 But Mr. Matiullah's role has grown beyond just business. His militia has been adopted by American Special Forces officers to gather intelligence and fight insurgents. Mr. Matiullah's compound sits about 100 yards from the American Special Forces compound in Tirin Kot. A Special Forces officer, willing to speak about Mr. Matiullah only on the condition of anonymity, said his unit had an extensive relationship with Mr. Matiullah. ''Matiullah is the best there is here,'' the officer said. 
 With his NATO millions, and the American backing, Mr. Matiullah has grown into the strongest political and economic force in the region. He estimates that his salaries support 15,000 people in this impoverished province. He has built 70 mosques with his own money, endowed scholarships in Kabul and begun holding weekly meetings with area tribal leaders. His latest venture is a rock-crushing company that sells gravel to NATO bases. 
 This has irritated some local leaders, who say that the line between Mr. Matiullah's business interest and the government has disappeared. 
 ''What law says that a police officer can have a private security company?'' said Juma Gul Hemat, the Oruzgan police chief, whose office is a few hundred yards from Mr. Matiullah's. 
 ''Many times I have confronted Matiullah over his illegal business,'' Chief Hemat said. ''But as long as the Americans are behind him, there is nothing I can do. They are the ones with the money.'' 
 Both General Carter and Hanif Atmar, the Afghan interior minister, said they hoped to disband Mr. Matiullah's militia soon -- or at least to bring it under formal government control. Mr. Matiullah's operation, the officials said, is one of at least 23 private security companies working in the area without any government license or oversight.
 General Carter said that while he had no direct proof in Mr. Matiullah's case, he harbored more general worries that the legions of unregulated Afghan security companies had a financial interest in prolonging chaos. In Mr. Matiullah's case, he said, that would mean attacking people who refused to use his security service or enlisting the Taliban to do it. Local Afghans said that Mr. Matiullah had done both of those things, although they would not speak publicly for fear of retribution. 
 ''Does he make deals and pay people to attack?'' General Carter said. ''I'm not aware of that.''
 Last fall, Mr. Atmar summoned Mr. Matiullah to his office and told him he wanted to give Mr. Matiullah's army a license and a government contract. The warlord walked out. 
 ''I told him that it's my men who are doing the fighting and dying,'' Mr. Matiullah said. ''The guys in Kabul want to steal the money.'' 
 Mr. Matiullah is causing other problems, Mr. Atmar said, alienating members of Afghan tribes not his own. He has also begun charging Afghans to ride on the highway.
 ''Parallel structures of government create problems for the rule of law,'' Mr. Atmar said. Along the highway linking Kandahar and Tirin Kot, many of Mr. Matiullah's soldiers drive Afghan police trucks and wear Afghan police uniforms. Posters of Mr. Matiullah are plastered to their windshields. 
 ''There is no doubt about it -- the people of Oruzgan love Matiullah!'' said Fareed Ayel, one of Mr. Matiullah's officers on the route. ''The government people are not honest.'' 
 Like many of Mr. Matiullah's men, Mr. Ayel quit the police to join his militia, which paid him a better salary. 
 Indeed, many people in Tirin Kot praise Mr. Matiullah for the toughness of his fighters and for keeping the road open. Mr. Matiullah claims to have lost more than 100 men fighting the Taliban. Recently, he and several of his fighters followed an American Special Forces unit to Geezab, where the Taliban had been expelled after six years.
 Persistent Suspicions
 But doubts persist about Mr. Matiullah, especially about what he does when Afghan and American officials are somewhere else. An American intelligence report prepared for senior American commanders last spring listed a number of associates of Ahmed Wali Karzai, President Hamid Karzai's brother and the chairman of the provincial council of Kandahar Province, who were suspected of involvement in the country's opium trade. The report listed Mr. Matiullah as one of the suspects, but provided few details. 
 A former senior official in the Kandahar government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by Mr. Matiullah and the Karzais, said he believed that Mr. Matiullah was facilitating the movement of drugs along the highway to Kandahar. 
 ''I was never able to look inside those trucks, but if I had, I am fairly certain what I would have found,'' he said.
 Despite his relationship to the Special Forces, Mr. Matiullah has been suspected of playing a double game with the Taliban. Asked about Mr. Matiullah earlier this year, an American military officer in Kabul admitted that Mr. Matiullah was believed to have a relationship with insurgents. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing intelligence matters.
 Asked again recently, the same officer said that Mr. Matiullah was suspected of drug smuggling. He provided no details. The next day, after consulting intelligence officers, the officer said Mr. Matiullah was a trusted ally. ''Their assessment about him has changed,'' he said. 
 Mr. Matiullah denied any contact with either insurgents or drug smugglers. ''Never,'' he said. 
 Like many Afghan leaders close to the Americans, Mr. Matiullah got his start after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, when the Americans were in desperate need of allies. Within a few years, Mr. Matiullah was the head of the Highway Police in Oruzgan Province. 
 In 2006, out of concern that legions of officers were working with drug traffickers, the entire agency was abolished. 
 ''The highway police was one huge drug smuggling operation,'' said a former Western diplomat, who was based here at the time of President Karzai's order. 
 Mr. Matiullah's army is part of a constellation of militias and security companies, many of them unregistered and unregulated, that claim at least some loyalty to Ahmed Wali Karzai, who is widely acknowledged to be the most powerful man in southern Afghanistan. ''Ahmed Wali is my friend, my close friend!'' Mr. Matiullah said earlier this year, offering to put him on the telephone for this reporter. 
 In a second, more recent, interview, Mr. Matiullah said he and Mr. Karzai had no relationship at all. 
 Both Ahmed Wali Karzai and Mr. Matiullah are associates of Jan Mohammed Khan, a former governor of Oruzgan Province and Mr. Matiullah's father-in-law. Mr. Khan was removed from Oruzgan Province at the insistence of the Dutch in 2006 because of concerns that he was close to the drug trade. He is now an adviser to President Karzai. 
 Those relationships, Mr. Matiullah's detractors say, allow him to flourish. 
 ''Matiullah is not part of the government, he is stronger than the government, and he can do anything he wants,'' said Mr. Essa, the tribal elder in Tirin Kot. ''He is like the younger brother of Ahmed Wali. He is protected in Kabul.'' 
 At a recent meeting inside the American Special Forces compound here, Mr. Matiullah was approached by an elderly Afghan beggar who hobbled up and then stood at attention and saluted in military fashion. Without hesitating -- indeed, without even looking -- Mr. Matiullah pulled a wad of money out of his pocket and pressed it into the man's withered hands. 
 ''Long live Matiullah, you are the best,'' the old man said.
 ''O.K., O.K.,'' Mr. Matiullah said. ''Now I am busy.''

HEADLINE: From Boys to Pros

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOKOLOVE. 
Michael Sokolove, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author of ''Warrior Girls,'' about the injury epidemic among young female athletes.

 BODY:
The youth academy of the famed dutch soccer club Ajaxis grandiosely called De Toekomst -- The Future. Set down beside a highway in an unprepossessing district of Amsterdam, it consists of eight well-kept playing fields and a two-story building that houses locker rooms, classrooms, workout facilities and offices for coaches and sports scientists. In an airy cafe and bar, players are served meals and visitors can have a glass of beer or a cappuccino while looking out over the training grounds. Everything about the academy, from the amenities to the pedigree of the coaches -- several of them former players for the powerful Dutch national team -- signifies quality. Ajax once fielded one of the top professional teams in Europe. With the increasing globalization of the sport, which has driven the best players to richer leagues in England, Germany, Italy and Spain, the club has become a different kind of enterprise -- a talent factory. It manufactures players and then sells them, often for immense fees, on the world market. ''All modern ideas on how to develop youngsters begin with Ajax,'' Huw Jennings, an architect of the English youth-development system, told me. ''They are the founding fathers.'' 
 In America, with its wide-open spaces and wide-open possibilities, we celebrate the ''self-made athlete,'' honor effort and luck and let children seek their own course for as long as they can -- even when that means living with dreams that are unattainable and always were. The Dutch live in a cramped, soggy nation made possible only because they mastered the art of redirecting water. They are engineers with creative souls, experts at systems, infrastructure and putting scant resources to their best use. The construction of soccer players is another problem to be solved, and it's one they undertake with a characteristic lack of sentiment or illusion.
 The first time I visited De Toekomst happened to coincide with the arrival of 21 new players -- 7- and 8-year-olds, mainly, all from Amsterdam and its vicinity -- who were spotted by scouts and identified as possible future professionals. As I came upon them, they were competing in a series of four-on-four games on a small, artificial-turf field with a wall around it, like a hockey rink, so that balls heading out of bounds bounced right back into play. It was late November and cold, with a biting wind howling off the North Sea, but the boys skittered about in only their lightweight jerseys and baggy shorts. Their shots on goal were taken with surprising force, which kept the coaches who were serving as goalkeepers flinching and shielding themselves in self-defense. The whole scene had a speeded-up, almost cartoonish feel to it, but I certainly didn't see anyone laughing.
 After a series of these auditions, some players would be formally enrolled in the Ajax (pronounced EYE-ox) academy. A group of men standing near me looked on intently, clutching rosters that matched the players with their numbers. One man, Ronald de Jong, said: ''I am never looking for a result -- for example, which boy is scoring the most goals or even who is running the fastest. That may be because of their size and stage of development. I want to notice how a boy runs. Is he on his forefeet, running lightly? Does he have creativity with the ball? Does he seem that he is really loving the game? I think these things are good at predicting how he'll be when he is older.''
 Like other professional clubs in Europe and around the world, Ajax operates something similar to a big-league baseball team's minor-league system -- but one that reaches into early childhood. De Jong, a solidly built former amateur player, is one of some 60 volunteer scouts who fan out on weekends to watch games involving local amateur clubs. (He works during the week as a prison warden.) His territory includes the area between The Hague and Haarlem -- ''the flower district, which is also a very good hunting ground for players'' is how he described it. He'll observe a prospect for months or even years, and players he recommends will also be watched by one of the club's paid scouts, a coach and sometimes the director of the Ajax youth academy. But for some families, the first time they realize their boys are under serious consideration is when a letter arrives from Ajax requesting that they bring their sons in for a closer look, an invitation that is almost never declined. To comprehend the impact of a summons from Ajax, imagine a baseball-crazed kid from, say, North Jersey arriving home from school one day to learn that he has been asked to come to Yankee Stadium to perform for the team brass.
 One player there was de Jong's discovery, an 8-year-old who, he said, had ''talent that is off the charts.'' But if this boy were to be accepted into the academy, it would mean he had completed just the first of a succession of relentless challenges. Ajax puts young players into a competitive caldron, a culture of constant improvement in which they either survive and advance or are discarded. It is not what most would regard as a child-friendly environment, but it is one that sorts out the real prodigies -- those capable of playing at an elite international level -- from the merely gifted.
 About 200 players train at De Toekomst at any given time, from ages 7 to 19. (All are male; Ajax has no girls' program.) Every year, some in each age group are told they cannot return the following year -- they are said to have been ''sent away'' -- and new prospects are enrolled in their place. And it is not just the children whose performances are assessed. Just before my second trip to Amsterdam in March, several longtime coaches were informed that they had not measured up and would be let go. One of them was the coach of a boy I had been following, Dylan Donaten Nieuwenhuys, a slightly built, soft-featured 15-year-old who began at Ajax when he was 7.
 Dylan's father, Urvin Rooi, served as a sort of guide for me. Gregarious and opinionated, he introduced me to other parents, made sure I came inside for hot drinks at the cafe and even gave me lifts on his scooter from the training grounds back to the transit station. He was particularly useful in translating a culture that was nothing like I had ever seen in many years of reporting on American sports. When I observed that for all the seriousness of purpose at De Toekomst, I was surprised that the players did not practice more hours or play more games, Rooi said: ''Of course, because they do not want to do anything to injure them or wear them out. They're capital. And what is the first thing a businessman does? He protects his capital.''
 When the boys start at the youth academy, Rooi said, they are attached to the ideal of Ajax, whose senior team packs in 50,000-plus fans for its home games and still occupies a mythic place in world soccer because of the innovative style it established in the 1960s -- a quick-passing, position-shifting offensive attack that became known as Total Football. ''The little boys drink their tea out of Ajax cups,'' he said. ''They sleep in Ajax pajamas under Ajax blankets.'' As spring approaches, he continued, they get nervous about whether they will be permitted to stay for another year. ''This is when they sometimes start to get bad school grades. They don't sleep. They wet their pants.''
 Over time, though, the academy hardens them mentally as well as physically. I asked Dylan how he felt about his coach's being fired. He shrugged. ''The football world is a hard world,'' he replied. ''He has made the decision to send boys away. Now he knows how it feels.''
 LATE ONE AFTERNOON in the cafe at De Toekomst, I was talking with a coach, Patrick Landru, who works with the academy's youngest age groups, when he asked if he could take my writing pad for a moment. I handed it over, and he put down five names, then drew a bracket to their right. Outside the bracket, he wrote, ''80 million euros.'' The names represented five active ''Ajax educated'' players, as he called them, all of whom entered the academy as children, made it through without being sent away and emerged as world-class players. Eighty million euros (or even more) is what Ajax got in return for selling the rights to the players to other professional clubs. Once a team pays this one-time transfer fee, it then negotiates a new, often very large, contract with the player.
 Wesley Sneijder, the first name on the list and probably the most accomplished young Dutch player at the moment, started at the academy when he was 7. At 23, Real Madrid acquired him for 27 million euros. (He now stars for Inter Milan, the current Italian champion and the winner of this year's Champion's League tournament, Europe's highest club competition.) The other four players named on my pad were, like Sneijder, highly paid pros for clubs outside the Netherlands and prominent members of the Dutch national team that will compete in the World Cup beginning this week in South Africa.
 An emerging national-team star, Gregory van der Wiel, was not among the names on the list, because he still plays for Ajax, but it is widely assumed that he will be the next big sale. A heavily tattooed rap aficionado who likes to spend his downtime in Miami's South Beach, van der Wiel, now 22, was sent away from Ajax at 14 because of a poor attitude -- ''I was an angry little boy who had not yet learned to listen,'' he told me -- then was invited back after spending three years in the academy of another Dutch pro club, now defunct, which he recalls as having had inferior facilities, coaching and even uniforms. I asked Martin Jol, the coach of Ajax's first team, if it was difficult for him to nurture young players knowing he would lose them just as their talent blossomed. ''I think that is the purpose of Ajax, to develop players and bring them up to the first team as young as possible,'' he answered. ''And then we sell them, not for peanuts but for a lot of money.''
 In the U.S., we think of money as corrupting sport, especially youth sport. At Ajax, it is clarifying. With the stakes so high -- so much invested and the potential for so much in return -- De Toekomst is a laboratory for turning young boys into high-impact performers in the world's most popular game.
 The Ajax youth academy is not a boarding school. The players all live within a 35-mile radius of Amsterdam (some of them have moved into the area to attend the academy). Ajax operates a fleet of 20 buses to pick up the boys halfway through their school day and employs 15 teachers to tutor them when they arrive. Parents pay nothing except a nominal insurance fee of 12 euros a year, and the club covers the rest -- salaries for 24 coaches, travel to tournaments, uniforms and gear for the players and all other costs associated with running a vast facility. Promising young players outside the Ajax catchment area usually attend academies run by other Dutch professional clubs, where the training is also free, as it is in much of the rest of the soccer-playing world for youths with pro potential. (The U.S., where the dominant model is ''pay to play'' -- the better an athlete, the more money a parent shells out -- is the outlier.)
 Ajax makes mistakes, plenty of them. It sends the wrong boys away, and some of them become stars elsewhere with no compensation returning to the club. As a production line, it is grossly inefficient; only a small percentage of its youngsters become elite players. But the club does not throw money after pure fantasy, encouraging visions of pro careers that never have a chance of materializing for children who do not have the foundational talent to reach such goals. The club decides which boys have potential -- ''Please note,'' its Web site advises, ''Ajax's youth academy cannot accept individual external applications'' -- and then exposes them to scientific training and constant pressure.
 The director of the Ajax youth academy is Jan Olde Riekerink, an intense man with piercing blue eyes who spends much of his day walking from field to field, observing. He usually stands in the background, out of sight, before coming forward to urge better effort or correct some fine point of technique. ''He is always watching, like a spy,'' Urvin Rooi told me.
 One Sunday in March, I was on the sideline of a game -- Ajax's 15-year-olds matched up against the youth academy of another Dutch professional club -- when I noticed Riekerink behind me. He was by himself, bundled into his parka and writing in a small notebook. With the Ajax boys up two goals and dominating the action, I told him I was impressed by their skill. (I was always impressed by the quality of play at De Toekomst.) ''Really?'' he responded. ''To me this is a disaster. They are playing with the wrong tempo, too slow.''
 During training sessions at Ajax, I rarely heard the boys' loud voices or laughter or much of anything besides the thump of the ball and the instruction of coaches. It could seem grim, more like the grinding atmosphere of training for an individual sport -- tennis, golf, gymnastics -- than what you would expect in a typically boisterous team setting. But one element of the academy's success is that the boys are not overplayed, so the hours at De Toekomst are all business. Through age 12, they train only three times a week and play one game on the weekend. ''For the young ones, we think that's enough,'' Riekerink said when we talked in his office one day. ''They have a private life, a family life. We don't want to take that from them. When they are not with us, they play on the streets. They play with their friends. Sometimes that's more important. They have the ball at their feet without anyone telling them what to do.''
 By age 15, the boys are practicing five times a week. In all age groups, training largely consists of small-sided games and drills in which players line up in various configurations, move quickly and kick the ball very hard to each other at close range. In many practice settings in the U.S., this kind of activity would be a warm-up, just to get loose, with the coach paying scant attention and maybe talking on a cellphone or chatting with parents. At the Ajax academy, these exercises -- designed to maximize touches, or contact with the ball -- are the main event. ''You see this a lot of places,'' a coach from a pro club in Norway, who was observing at Ajax, said to me. ''Every program wants to maximize touches. But here it is no-nonsense, and everything is done very hard and fast. It's the Dutch style. To the point and aggressive.''
 Gregory van der Wiel's description of the detail-oriented routine at De Toekomst struck me as dead on: ''You do things again and again and again, then you repeat it some more times.''
 I HEARD A LOT OF misconceptions about American soccer in the course of reporting this story. Many people seemed to believe that the sport is still a novelty in the United States, a game that we took up only in the last couple of decades and that is not yet popular or perhaps is even disdained by our best male athletes -- an understandable view given the much greater international success of the U.S. women's teams. I had lunch one day with Auke Kok, a historian and Dutch soccer journalist, who offered up his own hypothesis. He talked of the ''brute force'' of American football as opposed to the elegance and flair of great international soccer. ''I've always wondered if our football is too stylish, too feminine,'' he said. ''Am I right that it's too girlish for Americans?''
 I told him that I was pretty sure that that is not the case. But it is no surprise that the rest of the world might be flummoxed -- and come up with some offbeat theories -- trying to explain why a nation as populous, prosperous and sports-loving as the United States still does not play at the level of the true superpowers of soccer.
 More than three million boys under age 18 play organized soccer in the U.S., but we have never produced a critical mass of elite performers to compete on equal terms with the world's best. The American men are certainly improving. After finishing a surprising second to Brazil in last summer's Confederations Cup, the U.S. qualified with relative ease to be among the 32 teams competing in the World Cup finals in South Africa, starting June 12 against England. Few would be surprised if the U.S. emerged from group play into the second round. But it would be a shocking, seismic upset if the Americans somehow leapt past traditional powers like Germany, Italy or Argentina -- to say nothing of the favorites Brazil and Spain -- to capture the championship.
 The other nation that shows up on any list of World Cup favorites is the Netherlands, a perennial contender widely considered to be the best team never to win the championship. Drawn from a nation of fewer than 17 million, with a core of stars who trained at Ajax, the Dutch national team plays in the Total Football tradition that relies on players who know what they want to do with the ball before it reaches them and can move it on without stopping it. The British author David Winner, in his book ''Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Soccer,'' calls this approach ''physical chess,'' and the Dutch can be quite haughty about it. They abhor the cloying defensive tactics associated with the Italians and the boot-and-chase way the English played for years, and it has been observed that they sometimes appear more intensely interested in the artfulness of a match than in the result.
 The Dutch style (indistinguishable from the Ajax style) even has its own philosopher-king -- Johan Cruyff, an Ajax star in the 1970s, considered just one step down from Pele in the pantheon of playing greats, who can sound like a more erudite Yogi Berra. ''Don't run so much,'' he once said, meaning that players often cover lots of ground but to no effect. ''You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late.''
 In March, I had a seat at the Amsterdam Arena, just across the highway from De Toekomst, to watch the U.S. national team play the Dutch in a ''friendly,'' a pre-World Cup tuneup and test. Thanks to a late goal by the U.S., the final score was only 2-1, in favor of the Dutch, but the match was a version of that old playground game: it's our ball, and you can't play with it. The Dutch zipped it from player to player and from one side of the field to the other while the Americans ran and ran, chasing the ball but rarely gaining control. When the Americans did get the ball, their passes too often flew beyond reach or directly out of bounds.
 Other nations and professional clubs around the world play in a manner similar to the Dutch -- including, not coincidentally, Barcelona, one of the most consistently successful clubs in Europe, and where Cruyff played after leaving Ajax and then coached for eight seasons. What this type of play demands is the highest order of individual skill: players with a wizardlike ability to control the ball with either foot, any part of the foot, and work it toward the goal through cramped spaces and barely perceptible lanes.
 After the U.S.-Netherlands friendly, the Dutch coach praised the Americans for having a ''well-organized'' defense -- which was true but seemed to be a case, unintentional perhaps, of damning with faint praise. But what else could he say? The Americans did a good job of backing up and closing ranks, a survival tactic that, along with several heroic saves by the goalkeeper Tim Howard, kept the Dutch from running up six goals or so.
 That was only one game, of course, but it seemed to bring into focus what I had been observing at the Ajax youth academy, as well as learning about American soccer. How the U.S. develops its most promising young players is not just different from what the Netherlands and most elite soccer nations do -- on fundamental levels, it is diametrically opposed.
 Americans like to put together teams, even at the Pee Wee level, that are meant to win. The best soccer-playing nations build individual players, ones with superior technical skills who later come together on teams the U.S. struggles to beat. In a way, it is a reversal of type. Americans tend to think of Europeans as collectivists and themselves as individualists. But in sports, it is the opposite. The Europeans build up the assets of individual players. Americans underdevelop the individual, although most of the volunteers who coach at the youngest level would not be cognizant of that.
 The American approach is the more democratic view of sport. The aspirations of each member of the team are equally valid. Elsewhere, there is more comfort with singling out players for attention and individualized instruction, even at the expense of the group. David Endt, a former Ajax player and a longtime executive of the club, told me, ''Here, we would rather polish one or two jewels than win games at the youth levels.''
 Americans place a higher value on competition than on practice, so the balance between games and practice in the U.S. is skewed when compared with the rest of the world. It's not unusual for a teenager in the U.S. to play 100 or more games in a season, for two or three different teams, leaving little time for training and little energy for it in the infrequent moments it occurs. A result is that the development of our best players is stunted. They tend to be fast and passionate but underskilled and lacking in savvy compared with players elsewhere. ''As soon as a kid here starts playing, he's got referees on the field and parents watching in lawn chairs,'' John Hackworth, the former coach of the U.S. under-17 national team and now the youth-development coordinator for the Philadelphia franchise in Major League Soccer, told me. ''As he gets older, the game count just keeps increasing. It's counterproductive to learning and the No. 1 worst thing we do.''
 The U.S. diverges all the way to the last stages of a player's development. In other places around the world, the late teenage years are a kind of finishing school, a period when elite players grow into their bodies, sharpen their technical ability and gain a more sophisticated understanding of game tactics. At the same time, they are engaged in a fierce competition to rise through the ranks of their clubs and reach the first team (the equivalent of being promoted from a minor-league baseball team to the big-league club).
 An elite American player of that age is still likely to be playing in college, which the rest of the soccer-playing world finds bizarre. He plays a short competitive season of three or four months. If he possesses anything approaching international-level talent, he probably has no peer on his team and rarely one on an opposing squad. He may not realize it at the time, but the game, in essence, is too easy for him.
 Of the 23 players chosen for the U.S. team going to the World Cup, 15 of them played at least some college soccer. Among the 8 who went straight into the professional ranks are several of the team's most accomplished performers, including Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley and Tim Howard, and promising players like Jozy Altidore and Michael Bradley (son of the head coach, Bob Bradley). Did they rise to the top of the American talent pool because they bypassed college? Or did they skip it because they were the rare Americans good enough as teenagers to attract legitimate professional opportunities? The answer is probably a little bit of both. But you will find no one in the soccer world who says they would have enhanced their careers by staying in school.
 No other nation has as comprehensive a college-sports system as exists here, and none assume that an elite athlete will seek (or benefit from) higher education. ''You have a major problem in the ages of 17 to 21,'' Huw Jennings, now the director of the youth academy at Fulham, in the English Premier League, told me when I visited him in London. ''The N.C.A.A. system is the fault line. I understand that it is good for a person's development to go to university, but it's not the way the world develops players.''
 ONE DAY AT AJAX, I stood beside an otherwise empty playing field and watched for 30 minutes as a coach tutored Florian Josefzoon, a lithe, dreadlocked 18-year-old who is being groomed for stardom. Bryan Roy, a former member of the Dutch national team, demonstrated a series of stutter-steps and pirouettes, then kicked the ball to Josefzoon, on the right wing, who trapped it and tried to match Roy's moves as he turned and headed up the right side. It was as if Roy were teaching him a dance. When Josefzoon mastered one set of steps, Roy showed him something new. ''He is one of the talents,'' Roy told me. ''He's a winger; I was a winger. He has been put into a special program in order to bridge the gap between the under-18s and the first team, so it is natural for me to be the one to help him.''
 On an adjacent field, Ruben Jongkind, a consultant who mainly works with Dutch track athletes, was altering the posture and gait of a 15-year-old recently acquired from another Dutch club. Jongkind told me that while the boy was actually quite fast, he did not have enough range of motion in his vertical plane. ''He was running like a duck, shuffling,'' Jongkind said. ''That takes more energy, which is why we have to change his motor patterns, so he can be as fast at the end of a game as the beginning.''
 Jongkind had been working with this player for several weeks and said he had progressed to ''consciously able but not subconsciously able'' to run with the desired form, meaning that in the heat of competition, he reverted to his old form. I pointed out that a fast but flawed runner in the United States would likely be left alone. ''Everything can be trained,'' Jongkind said. ''You should always try to make an improvement if it's possible.''
 Ajax keeps a detailed dossier on each player from the moment he enters the youth academy. I was in the office of Olav Versloot, the club's chief exercise physiologist, when a 14-year-old knocked on his door, eager for the results of his latest body-fat measurement, which was too high the last time. Boys in their midteens are permitted to have up to 13 percent body fat; by 17, the measure is supposed to be down to 12 percent. (The younger players, who are almost always lean enough, are monitored more loosely.) ''The first time limits are exceeded we are quite liberal,'' Versloot told me. ''Diet suggestions are made. But after that, we start a program with a dietitian. Parents are called in, and special exercise programs are started.''
 Versloot, with his spiky hair, longish sideburns and black-framed glasses, has a sort of hipster-geek look. In November, I observed him putting boys through some of their regular fitness tests. In one, a training group of 16-year-olds ran 30-meter sprints as sensors registered their times in five-meter increments. Versloot was most interested in their performances in the first 5 and 10 meters. ''That's football distance,'' he said. ''It's an acceleration that occurs multiple times a game.''
 When I came back in March, I watched several groups participate in a grueling shuttle run, similar to what basketball players refer to as ''suicides'' -- a series of back-and-forth sprints, with short rest, in which participants dropped out in exhaustion until only one was left. They wore monitors to measure their heart rates. Versloot explained why: ''If they say, 'I'm tired, I'm done,' we can look later and say to them: 'That's not what the heart monitor showed. It said you were only at 75 percent of maximum. So you have to do it again in a week.' They understand that it's not a punishment; it's an opportunity to do better.''
 De Toekomst is not where you come to hear a romantic view of sport. No one pretends that its business is other than what it is. ''We sold Wesley Sneijder for a ridiculous amount of money,'' Versloot said. ''We can go on for years based on what he was sold for.''
 David Endt, who as manager of the first team is in charge of travel and logistics, occupies a sort of unofficial role as the club's conscience and historian. His cubbyhole of an office atop the Amsterdam Arena is a mini-museum, its walls plastered with all manner of memorabilia. He proudly showed me a pair of scissors displayed above his desk, explaining that they were brandished by an Ajax player as he tried to attack a teammate in a famous locker-room incident a couple of decades ago. ''Now I have them,'' he said with an impish grin. The youth academy, Endt said, is where the heart of the club beats. ''You can feel the atmosphere of what is Ajax. People from clubs around the world come to visit, and they always want to know, 'What is the secret?' But it is a matter of earth and air. We are in Amsterdam, so we are a little bit adventurous, a little bit artistic, maybe a little bit arrogant. You can observe what we do, but it is something you cannot copy.''
 Ajax won the European club championship as recently as 1995, the same year that a decision in the European Court of Justice (the Bosman transfer ruling, named after the Belgian player who brought the case) gave players the power of free agency when their contracts end. It priced Ajax out of the top tier of competition and left the continental championships to be fought over by the big clubs in the English Premier League, Spain's Liga, Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's Serie A, which get vastly greater fees for television rights. Endt told me that the need to sell players -- just to keep the club going and to bring money in to help pay the salaries of players on the first team -- is well understood but regretted. ''We're realistic about it,'' he said, ''but the real Ajax man is crying inside.''
 Ajax is listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, but 73 percent of the shares remain in private hands and are not publicly traded. Just as no one sugarcoats the mission at Ajax, the demands placed on children are not minimized. ''One of the things we say is we are never satisfied,'' Endt said. ''That is both good and bad. It can be difficult to be in a situation where whatever you do, you are told you should do better.''
 Versloot said that, on average, one and a half products of De Toekomst per season will rise to the first team and go on to a significant, well-compensated pro career. Some of the others will gravitate to second- or third-tier pro circuits or the high amateur ranks in the Netherlands, where the best players make ''black money,'' under-the-table payments. The pressure to emerge from the academy as one of its top products -- and to produce them -- is immense. ''It is always a very tense atmosphere here, for everyone,'' Versloot said. ''You have to just get used to it.''
 EARLY IN EACH NEW calendar year, youngsters in the Ajax academy are given preliminary notice of their status. Some are told they are secure, others that they are in danger of being sent away in the spring. A current 16-year-old at Ajax said he still recalled this conversation from when he was 8. (Ajax discourages players who have not yet signed pro contracts from talking to reporters, so he agreed to talk only if his name was not used.) ''It was my second year, and they said: 'You are in doubt. We don't yet know if you'll be one of the boys who get to stay,' '' he recounted. ''They said I was a good technical player, but I was too passive and had to become more aggressive.''
 This player is now considered among the best in his age group, but like all boys who stay at Ajax for many years, he has seen many classmates leave. ''My best friend left two years ago,'' he said. ''I don't speak to him anymore. He thought I was not in touch enough, that I was not supporting him. He was furious. I realized he was just a football friend and that you can't have real friends at Ajax.''
 Ricardo van Rhijn, who just signed a pro contract and is captain of the Dutch under-19 national team, described the annual leave-taking in somewhat more benign terms. ''At a certain moment, we have to say goodbye,'' he told me. ''It's hard, but every boy knows the reality of the situation. They know they have to leave and close the chapter of Ajax.''
 Urvin Rooi's son, Dylan, said that in his current training group of 15-year-olds, several new boys had been brought in for tryouts, and one had already been told he was accepted. It sounded like being in a workplace in which your possible replacement had already been installed at the next desk and given your identical tasks, to see if he could do them better.
 Dylan's father is involved in a business that builds homes on the Dutch island Curacao. His mother is a psychotherapist. It is not unusual for players at De Toekomst to come from middle- or even upper-middle-class backgrounds, and virtually none come from poverty in a nation where the standard of living is high and literacy is 99 percent. The demographics are not much different from the soccer-playing population in the United States, where most players still come from suburban comfort. In the Netherlands, though, youth players may end up with less education than their parents in order to pursue professional soccer careers, starting with a less-demanding high-school curriculum than they otherwise might take.
 Dylan at first spoke to me on the condition that I would not use his name but then insisted that it be included, reasoning that he had related his ''personal thoughts, and people should know the name behind the thoughts.'' We spoke at a delicatessen in his neighborhood in central Amsterdam, where a picture of him in his uniform hung on the wall. (The contrast between his introspection and the unrevealing interviews given by most American athletes was striking.) He said he guessed that probably only two or three of the boys he began with when he was 7 would have pro careers in their sport. ''I would feel very bad if I'm not one of them,'' he said. ''I have tried everything I can do to make it. I haven't done as much in school as I could. I would feel like I've been wasting my time all these years. I would get very depressed.''
 I asked if some of what he learned at Ajax -- focus, perseverance, the ability to perform under pressure -- might benefit him no matter what he ends up doing. ''No,'' he said, shaking his head. ''We're training for football, not for anything else.''
 The Ajax development system has its critics. Some assume that because the first team is no longer a competitive force in Europe and does not even consistently finish first in the Eredivisie, the top Dutch professional league, it is no longer turning out top talent. But if all those who trained at De Toekomst now playing elsewhere were to come home -- Wesley Sneijder from Italy; Rafael van der Vaart from Spain; Ryan Babel, Johnny Heitinga and Nigel de Jong from their teams in England -- Ajax could compete with any club in the world. The more substantial criticism is that Ajax has become too mercantile and coldblooded. ''I feel like they've lost some of the spirit of the place,'' John Hackworth, the former U.S. youth coach, told me. ''What made them great, these heroes they create, now go on to stardom so quickly somewhere else.''
 I talked with Huw Jennings at the youth academy of Fulham, in London, as we watched a group of 10-year-olds train. They were louder and more physically animated than the boys I saw in Amsterdam. ''What they do at Ajax is a little rote for my taste,'' Jennings said. ''We are more apt to let the game be the teacher.'' He added that he believed Ajax ''had become a caricature of itself.'' The last time he visited, he sensed that the dealmaking had breached the complex itself. ''That dining area was crawling with agents,'' he said, ''right among the players and their parents.'' (I did not see this during my visits.)
 Jennings acknowledged that, based on the methods pioneered by Ajax, top clubs all over Europe were scouting very young kids and enrolling them in their academies. A book published in 2009 by the British journalist Chris Green, ''Every Boy's Dream,'' estimated that 10,000 were being trained by clubs in England. They are cheap investments for clubs wanting to scoop up every boy with even a remote chance of one day becoming a top footballer.
 Jennings said that his scouts, in response to the ''unsuitability of the indigenous population of Britain'' -- children who are too sedentary and spend their time with video games -- were increasingly focused ''on the inner city of London, among Africans, Eastern Europeans and Caribbeans.''
 Fulham, like Ajax, is often a seller of talent. It recently sold a 20-year-old to Manchester United for seven million pounds, or more than $10 million. ''It's a little ugly talking about the financial terms,'' Jennings said. ''I don't like to do it. It feels not too far off from the slave trade.''
 Everyone draws the line somewhere. Jennings told me that he recently received a call from a rival club asking if it could schedule a game against his ''elite 5s'' -- 5-year-olds. He replied, ''We don't have elite 5s, but we'll play your expectant mothers.''
 There are two ways to become a world-class soccer player. One is to spend hours and hours in pickup games -- in parks, streets, alleyways -- on imperfect surfaces that, if mastered, can give a competitor an advantage when he finally graduates to groomed fields. This is the Brazilian way and also the model in much of the rest of South America, Central America and the soccer hotbeds of Africa. It is like baseball in the Dominican Republic. Children play all the time and on their own.
 The other way is the Ajax method. Scientific training. Attention to detail. Time spent touching the ball rather than playing a mindless number of organized games.
 The more thoughtful people involved in developing U.S. soccer talent know that we conform to neither model. We are a much larger nation, obviously, than the Netherlands. Our youth sports leagues, for the most part, are community-based and run by volunteers rather than professionals. They have grown organically, sending out tendrils that run deep and are difficult to uproot. Change at the elite levels is more possible than at the stubborn grass roots.
 Efforts to change American soccer culture are largely occurring in the older age groups. Some of the most talented players are being extracted from a deeply flawed system, but only after they've been immersed in it for many years.
 I was at the youth academy of D.C. United -- one worn artificial-turf field, no locker rooms, a world away from De Toekomst -- on what turned out to be a moment of triumph for one of the bedrock franchises of Major League Soccer, the top U.S. professional league. Just the day before, the team announced that it signed its best youth player to a pro contract. Andy Najar, who was 17 and immigrated with his parents from Honduras as a teenager, was inserted straight into D.C. United's starting lineup right after dropping out of high school during his junior year. The signing drew only modest press coverage, probably a good thing for the team and an instance of pro soccer's still-under-the-radar status in the U.S. being of benefit to the league. (The parade of players graduating from high school and jumping straight to the N.B.A. proved controversial enough that it's no longer allowed.)
 Najar, considered an exceptional talent, will very likely be the rare player to go from high school right onto an M.L.S. roster. But the decoupling of soccer education from higher education is an avowed goal of executives at the top levels of the American game. M.L.S. has been signing about a dozen young players a year -- some from its teams' academies, others who have already played a year or two in college -- and putting them either on pro rosters or into development programs. (Under this setup, called Generation Adidas, money is put aside for players' future college tuitions.) The academies of M.L.S. teams have begun to abandon the pay-for-play model and are bearing nearly all costs, including travel, for their players.
 Also, dozens of top amateur soccer clubs around the country have been designated by the U.S. Soccer Federation as academies, with the intent that they will offer training on a European-based model -- more practices, fewer games, greater emphasis on technical skill. They have, however, already drawn criticism that their coaches can't break an old habit: trying, first and foremost, to win rather than focusing on the stated goal of developing elite individual talent.
 The way we approach youth soccer in the U.S. is no more thoughtless than how we groom talent in baseball or basketball. All the same syndromes apply. Overplay. Too little practice. The courting of injuries -- for example, the spate of elbow operations for pitchers in their midteens brought on by coaches who leave them on the mound for too many innings. The difference is that because these are, largely, our sports, we have a head start on the rest of the world and therefore a bigger margin for error.
 Ajax is a fulcrum of the worldwide soccer market, exporting top players to the world's best clubs, because they take very young players and shape them. The U.S., by comparison, is still a peripheral participant. In the past decade, increasing numbers of Americans have gone overseas to play for European clubs, many of them signing contracts as teenagers. But with just a couple of exceptions, they are complementary players, not the star-quality performers who make up the rosters of the World Cup favorites.
 How much does it matter for the U.S. to ascend to the top rung of worldwide soccer and become a serious threat to win a World Cup? The effort itself would bring some welcome changes. Players whose training was paid for by professional clubs, rather than by their parents, would likely be treated as investments and therefore developed with more intelligence and care for their physical well-being.
 But club-financed training is the entry level to a rough-and-tumble, often merciless worldwide soccer economy. Elements of it clash with American sensibilities. What Ajax pioneered, and still executes at a high level, can look uncomfortably like the trafficking of child athletes.
 Ronald de Jong invited me to go scouting with him one Saturday. He had his eye on a specific target -- ''a 2004,'' he said, referring to a birth year. A 5-year-old whom he had seen and was checking in with every month or so. This boy might not even be in school yet, I pointed out. ''I don't think he is,'' de Jong said with a slight smile, as if he recognized the absurdity. ''I believe he's in day care.''
 Ajax's success would not be possible if it did not draw from a well-organized, well-financed soccer culture. Any town of any size in the Netherlands has an amateur club, with highly trained coaches and an academy for its own top-level players. (It is said that Johan Cruyff was the only Dutchman ever granted his coaching license without having to go through a rigorous, yearlong course.)
 I met de Jong at the train station in Leiden, and we drove to a particularly well-heeled club called Quick Boys, in Katwijk. A spacious locker-room complex with a private club on top had been built with funds from benefactors connected with the tulip industry and local fishing interests. The bar in the private club was an elaborate wooden sculpture shaped like a herring boat.
 De Jong, whose only material benefit from his association with Ajax is free admission to the first team's games, showed a card that identified him as a scout and checked a schedule of games on a computer screen. As we approached the field where our 5-year-old was to play, he spotted him right away and said, ''There's the guy!''
 I couldn't tell for sure, but it seemed to me that the guy, Delano van der Heyden, born in September 2004, might actually be small even for a 5-year-old. The ball at his feet came up almost to his knees. He was ''playing up,'' competing against boys as old as 9. When the game started, he was exactly as advertised: remarkable. Delano kept up with the other boys, a few of whom fell on contact and had to be attended by coaches, which he never did. He showed the ability to kick with either foot. He could receive the ball with his back to his offensive end and turn, with the ball still in his control, and head toward the goal.
 De Jong kept up a running commentary as we watched, becoming increasingly excited. As Delano cleverly dribbled around a bigger boy who came charging at him: ''You see, they will try to physically dominate him, but he will always seek a football solution. He always has a plan.'' As the concentration of other boys drifted: ''He is not looking at planes in the sky; he is looking at the ball.'' At halftime, as Delano conferred with his father, who was coaching his team: ''You see how nicely they are talking? You can tell he comes from a good nest.'' Later, after Delano weaved through three boys and blistered a shot just wide of the goal: ''This is unbelievable! At this age, I've never seen a player like this!''
 Delano's team was visiting at Quick Boys; his own club was smaller, a concern for de Jong, who feared it might not fill his needs. He had already asked Delano's father to put him in a bigger club for the following season. But what if the family did not want to? ''Then I'll ask Jan Olde Riekerink to call his father,'' he said, referring to the stern director of De Toekomst. ''Usually people will listen to Jan Olde.''
 Even if Delano turned out to be a world-class prodigy, it would be at least a dozen years before he could play for Ajax's first team. He could not even enter De Toekomst for another two years. But I understood de Jong's interest. Delano was well worth this investment of time and attention, because one day he might be sold to Chelsea or Real Madrid or Juventus for millions.

HEADLINE: Imagining Life Without Oil, and Being Ready

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
As oil continued to pour into the Gulf of Mexico on a recent Saturday, Jennifer Wilkerson spent three hours on the phone talking about life after petroleum. 
 For Mrs. Wilkerson, 33, a moderate Democrat from Oakton, Va., who designs computer interfaces, the spill reinforced what she had been obsessing over for more than a year -- that oil use was outstripping the world's supply. She worried about what would come after: maybe food shortages, a collapse of the economy, a breakdown of civil order. Her call was part of a telephone course about how to live through it all.
 In bleak times, there is a boom in doom. 
 Americans have long been fascinated by disaster scenarios, from the population explosion to the cold war to global warming. These days the doomers, as Mrs. Wilkerson jokingly calls herself and likeminded others, have a new focus: peak oil. They argue that oil supplies peaked as early as 2008 and will decline rapidly, taking the economy with them.
 Located somewhere between the environmental movement and the bunkered survivalists, the peak oil crowd is small but growing, reaching from health food stores to Congress, where a Democrat and a Republican formed a Congressional Peak Oil Caucus. 
 And they have been resourceful, sharing the concerns of other ''collapsitarians,'' including global debt and climate change -- both caused by overuse of diminishing oil supplies, they maintain. 
 Many people dispute the peak oil hypothesis, including Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power'' and chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a company that advises governments and industry. Mr. Yergin has argued that new technology continues to bring more oil. 
 Andre Angelantoni is not taking that chance. In his home in San Rafael, Calif., he has stocked food reserves in case an oil squeeze prevents food from reaching market and has converted his investments into gold and silver. 
 The effects of peak oil, including high energy prices, will not be gentle, said Mr. Angelantoni, a Web designer whose company, Post Peak Living, offers the telephone class and a handful of online courses for life after a collapse.
 ''Our whole economy depends on greater and greater energy supplies, and that just isn't possible,'' he said. ''I wish I could say we'll quietly accept having many millions of people unemployed, their homes foreclosed. But it's hard to see the whole country transitioning to a low-energy future without people becoming angry. There's going to be quite a bit of social turmoil on the way down.''
 Transition US, a British transplant that seeks to help towns brace for life after oil, including a ''population die-off'' from shortages of oil, food and medicine, now has 68 official chapters around the country, since starting with just two in 2008. Group projects range from community vegetable gardens to creating local currency in case the national one crashes.
 Bleak books like James Howard Kunstler's ''The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century'' and Richard Heinberg's ''The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies'' have sold 100,000 and 50,000 copies, respectively, according to their publishers. 
 In Congress in 2005, Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, Republican of Maryland, and Senator Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat who was a representative at the time, created the Congressional Peak Oil Caucus. Web sites, online videos and numerous social networks connect adherents in ways that would once have been impossible. 
 Mr. Angelantoni, 40, came to his concern about peak oil from an interest in climate change, because he felt its impact would be more precipitous. ''The peak oil conversation is where the climate change conversation was 20 years ago,'' he said. He distinguished the peak oil crowd from the environmental movement. ''The Sierra Club tells people that if we use less energy, the underlying model is sound,'' he said. ''I don't think that's the case.'' 
 Like several people in the telephone class, he said his concern with peak oil had strained his relationship with his spouse, creating an ''unbridgeable'' distance between them. 
 ''It's very difficult for people to hear that this form of the economy is breaking down,'' he said. ''They think that because it hasn't happened yet that it won't ever happen.'' 
 Mrs. Wilkerson has now read two dozen books about peak oil and related topics. For a while, she became depressed at work and had trouble discussing her feelings with her husband because the conversations were so dire, she said. At work, her colleagues told her directly ''that they were tired of hearing about it,'' she said. ''They felt I was going to an extreme, thinking collapse was going to happen.''
 She added, ''I was ready to move out to the country and be an organic farmer, but I learned that's not the way to do it. You need a community.'' 
 Despite the rapid growth of Transition US, the movement was much easier to sell in England, said Raven Gray, who came to this country to found a branch here. While Americans embrace doomsday scenarios, they are less likely to work together on how to live afterward, she said. 
 ''There's lot of apocalyptic people in environmental circles,'' she said. ''A lot of those people were outraged that we presented an optimistic view of the future. There's a dark vision driving us, but we're about moving toward a positive picture of what can be done.''
 For Mrs. Wilkerson, who is now growing vegetables in her kitchen, the course, which cost $175, gave her encouragement to move in that direction. 
 ''Whether or not collapse happens, being able to teach other people to grow food so they can weather any adversity is a good investment of my time,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A War for Hearts and Minds, Economically Speaking

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, Ian Bremmer was invited to the Chinese Consulate in New York, along with a group of economists and scholars, to discuss the financial crisis. Shortly after he arrived, Mr. Bremmer, a political risk consultant who has been widely published, was surprised to hear a Chinese diplomat ask them, ''Now that the free market has failed, what do you think is the proper role for the state in the economy?'' 
 Mr. Bremmer was at a loss for words. He didn't agree with the first part of the question. As for the second part, he felt strongly that the correct response was: ''as minimal as possible.'' 
 But this was an inconvenient time to make such an argument. Only months earlier, President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus spending bill. Clearly, in America at least, the free market wasn't doing so well.
 Mr. Bremmer recounts this tale in the introduction of ''The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?'' (Portfolio, 230 pages) his well-crafted, thought-provoking book about the rise of state-controlled economies like China and Russia and the challenges they pose to American companies -- and, ultimately, to the United States itself. 
 The author stops short of calling this a new cold war -- well, just barely. The way he sees it, China and Russia are using what he calls ''state capitalism'' to advance the interests of their companies at the expense of their American rivals. But that is not the only battle he describes in his book. The other is the struggle for the hearts and minds of emerging-market giants like Brazil and India that are leaning toward the free market, but still haven't fully embraced it.
 The stakes could be enormous. Mr. Bremmer argues that if the United States and its allies can prevail, their leading businesses will have access to natural resources and growing numbers of middle-class consumers in these nations. But if they fail, the West could be shut out of the very markets where much of the world's economic growth is expected to occur in the next few years. 
 The problem, Mr. Bremmer says, is that state capitalists are in a very strong position at the moment. He's right. The world blames the United States -- as it should -- for hatching and exporting the 2008 financial crisis. And as the global economy finally recovers, guess which nation is leading the way? Not America, but China -- where the economy is still tightly controlled by the Communist Party.
 ''The lesson that many emerging-market governments took from the crisis is that free-market capitalism had ignited a wildfire,'' Mr. Bremmer laments, ''and that those who depended on it most had suffered the worst burns.'' 
 You probably won't be surprised to hear that a free-market evangelist like Mr. Bremmer isn't a liberal. He praises Margaret Thatcher of Britain for privatizing a slew of government-owned businesses. And he thinks China should take such steps, too. He feels the same about Russia, which privatized many of its state-run businesses in the 1990s only to reassert more control after the rise of Vladimir V. Putin.
 But neither is Mr. Bremmer a doctrinaire conservative. Refreshingly, he argues that the United States needs to stand shoulder to shoulder with its capitalist allies in Europe against the threat he sees. He doesn't deny that there are differences between American capitalism and the Scandinavian variety, to say nothing of the French, which the American right never tires of bashing. Yet he argues that the United States and Europe share a core assumption that the private sector, not government, should be a primary engine of growth.
 This, he says, is what the creation of the European Union creation was all about. ''It's the attraction of the free market that has brought Europe together as never before,'' he writes.
 The same cannot be said of the practitioners of state capitalism. Mr. Bremmer argues that the ruling elites of countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela use state-owned companies to further political agendas. 
 Often, he writes, leaders of some state-capitalist nations use profits of these businesses to dole out social-welfare goodies and thus stay in power. Sometimes, he says, they use the companies to make life hard for neighbors -- as Russia did when Gazprom, its state-controlled natural gas company, cut off supplies to Ukraine in 2006. Ukraine's offense had been to cozy up to the West and adopt a smattering of free-market measures.
 Mr. Bremmer's biggest fear is that the so-called BRIC nations -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- will do more business with one another, leaving the United States out in the cold. That would be devastating for the American economy. And it's not a paranoid fantasy, either. Last year, the four countries' leaders met in Russia and discussed ways to reduce dependence on America.
 What is to be done? The author makes a curious suggestion: that the United States raise military spending and act as the world's cop -- which no BRIC is yet equipped to do. That may seem a bit shortsighted. In many ways, American mistakes in the Iraq war were an invaluable gift to our state-capitalist foes who have used them, fairly or unfairly, to paint America as a rogue state. 
 Luckily, this isn't his only suggestion. He warns American politicians not to pander for votes by pushing anti-free-market initiatives like protectionism. He says many emerging-market nations -- like India, Brazil, South Korea, Turkey and South Africa -- have one foot in the free market and the other in state capitalism. They could go either way.
 Mr. Bremmer says their leaders are watching to see what the West truly believes when it comes to the economy. In other words, if we are going to preach free-market capitalism, we'd better practice it ourselves.

HEADLINE: The Doctor Payment Follies

 BODY:
The formula that is used to pay doctors who treat Medicare patients is producing increasingly absurd results. If it were to be followed this year, doctors would face a 21 percent cut in payments for the tests, procedures, office visits and other services they provide to elderly Americans. 
 That would be a disaster, driving many doctors to stop accepting Medicare patients. Luckily, nobody is seriously contemplating that. As it has done repeatedly in recent years, Congress is readying a short-term fix that would provide a modest increase in physician fees for the next 19 months. 
 There will likely be no real solution until the American health care system moves away from unfettered fee-for-service payments that encourage doctors to perform unnecessary and costly tests and procedures and pays them instead for better management of a patient's care over time. 
 The flawed reimbursement formula predates the new health care reform law by more than a decade. But its problems are a reminder that even with reform there is a lot of work ahead to rein in the cost of health care. 
 When first enacted in 1997, the ''sustainable growth rate'' formula looked liked a reasonable way to restrain Medicare spending. It set annual limits for the total amount of money to be paid to doctors in the traditional Medicare program. It also included allowances for inflation in the cost of operating a medical practice, for growth in the elderly population, and even a little extra money to pay for increases in the volume and complexity of services performed. 
 It worked well for the first five years. Starting in 2002 it began to hit a variety of problems. The fatal flaw in the formula was that it had no way to limit the array of services doctors provided or distinguish between valuable and needless treatments.
 If doctors in the aggregate drove expenditures above the limit, the formula called for fees in the following year to grow more slowly than medical inflation or be reduced. That aggregate punishment was not enough to persuade individual doctors to change behavior. 
 When Medicare doctors were faced with the prospect of actual rate cuts, they screamed for help. Congress provided repeated relief. Each time it postponed a scheduled cut, the meter kept ticking and the required cuts accumulated. That is why the system was due to cut doctors' reimbursement by 21 percent on June 1. 
 The Obama administration is holding off, the House has approved a 19-month fix, and the Senate is expected to concur this week. The bill would raise doctors' payments, in the aggregate, by about $1 billion over current rates -- and $23 billion over what they would get if the required cuts were imposed. That is probably the best that can be done for now. 
 Meanwhile, the experience suggests that there could be problems with at least one key element of the new health care reform law. To hold down the cost of Medicare, it sets target levels for per capita Medicare spending beginning in 2015. 
 Once again the formula sets targets that may be hard to reach -- and will require Medicare to find savings in the following year if they are not. The encouraging news is that a new independent board will have the power to recommend a much broader range of potential savings, not just cuts in doctor payments, to make up the difference. Congress will have the final say.
 The reform law also tries to cut costs by emphasizing primary care and setting up pilot programs to find better ways to organize and deliver high-quality care at lower cost and move the system away from fee-for-service payments. If these work well, they could finally put a real brake on Medicare spending.

HEADLINE: This Flight to Safety Wasn't Supposed to Happen

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
WHEN Treasury bonds are hotter than stocks, it's a sign that something is very wrong with the stock market. 
 That has been the pattern lately, though. In a reprise of the flight to safety that occurred during the financial crisis of 2008 and early 2009, people have been parking cash in Treasuries and fleeing stocks, which, of course, have had better long-term returns historically.
 ''It's classic risk-aversion,'' said Gregg S. Fisher, chief investment officer at Gerstein Fisher, a financial advisory firm in New York. ''We've seen this happen before.'' 
 This time around, the great cash migration started with the debt crisis in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, not in the United States, but the effects on the American stock and bond markets have nonetheless been severe. Last month, for example, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.9 percent, making it the worst May for stocks, in percentage terms, since 1940.
 For people holding Treasury bonds, it's been one of the best of times. In May, long-term Treasurymutual funds outperformed every traditional category of stock fund, according to Morningstar data, returning 5 percent. Ominously, only bear market funds -- those dedicated to bets on a stock market decline -- fared better. They returned 8 percent. These trends continued last week, with the Dow and the S.& P. 500 each falling more than 3 percent further.
 And as demand for Treasuries has risen, yields have plummeted, while prices, which move in the opposite direction, have soared. This price surge has turbocharged long-term Treasury mutual funds, despite the paltry yields of the underlying bonds. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dropped as low as 3.16 percent on May 25, down from 3.99 percent as recently as April 5, according to Bloomberg data. It stood at 3.20 percent on Friday. 
 People with cash in money market funds are getting a much, much lower yield than that -- only 0.07 percent annually for the largest funds, on average, according to Peter G. Crane, the president of Crane Data of Westborough, Mass. That's better than the 0.05 percent average of earlier this year -- but not enough to make a difference. 
 ''It's still awfully close to zero,'' he said. ''The amazing thing is that even at these rates, when you're getting virtually no return on your money at all, people are still moving cash into money market funds. It's sobering.'' 
 It is also sobering that a vast majority of economists and market strategists were forecasting a different chain of events. Treasury yields were universally expected to be rising, not falling, as the United States recovered from a deep recession. The domestic economy is, in fact, growing, and corporate profits have been rising, but the European crisis has overturned many expectations.
 Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays Capital, got some of the outlines right, if not the details. ''Sometimes, you're correct for other reasons,'' he said. He had predicted that after a long run upward, the stock market would fall in the first half of the year, and it has, putting stocks in ''correction'' territory. So far, so good. 
 But Mr. Knapp had thought that the stock market decline would be set off by a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has operated on an emergency basis since the onset of the financial crisis in the United States. The Fed hasn't tightened. Instead, to keep the economy stable in the face of Europe's problems, it has held short-term interest rates near zero. In addition, it reopened emergency swap lines with European central banks last month, to help maintain liquidity there.
 Similarly, Joseph H. Davis, Vanguard's chief economist, had said it was likely that long-term interest rates would be rising and that the Fed would be moving short-term rates up more dramatically. That will still happen eventually, he said, but the timing is far from certain. ''We got it wrong,'' he said cheerfully. ''Of course, we did warn that there was a good chance that might happen.''
 In a detailed 16-page analysis of the bond market in March, Mr. Davis and several Vanguard associates deconstructed Treasury yields and projected rates using the ''forward yield curve,'' a standard calculation of the market's assessment of future interest rate levels. This kind of analysis makes use of the information embedded in prices, but it won't tell you what will happen to the bond and stock markets if something unexpected arises -- like Greece suddenly running into a credit wall. 
 What comfort can be drawn from these uncertain markets? 
 First, the Vanguard study found that even a climb in Treasury yields needn't be devastating for well-run long-term bond portfolios, because higher yields can more than compensate for lower bond prices. Such management may not be easy to do on your own, but the study found that many mutual funds have handled the transition well in past market cycles.
 Second, at the moment, investment-grade bonds are very richly priced in comparison with stocks, several analysts said. Mr. Knapp says he expects that the S.& P. 500 will rise to 1,210 by the end of the year, or 13.6 percent from its current 1,064.88, and that the chances for strong longer-term stock returns are favorable. (The outlook for Treasuries is not positive, he said.)
 MR. DAVIS said that there is a very ''strong correlation'' between low Treasury yields and subsequent strong economic growth. And there is a weaker but still significant connection between low yields and high stock returns. 
 In short, at current prices, it would appear that there is some reason for long-term optimism for stock investors. 
 For the short run, alas, more volatility is probably in order. ''The problems in Europe, for one, aren't going away any time soon,'' Mr. Knapp said. 
 People seeking safety are likely to face very low yields for a while. Unless you're focused on a distant horizon, it may be a difficult summer.

HEADLINE: Sneakers in the Trash Were Made for Recycling

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''I know perfectly well,'' Cynthia Magnus said, ''that garbage is not glamorous.''
 Certainly not. But it can be famous.
 Last winter, as Ms. Magnus, a graduate student at the City University of New York, walked along 35th Street in Manhattan to get to class, she often spotted bags of unworn clothing left with the trash. Some of the garments had been thrown out by H & M, the retail chain, which has a branch on 34th Street. The clothes had apparently been deemed unfit for sale. 
 To make sure the items would never be worn or sold, H & M employees had slashed them. Outside another building on the block, Ms. Magnus found unworn clothes tagged with Wal-Mart labels and punched through with holes to make them unwearable. 
 When this column reported her discoveries, tens of thousands of people posted comments on Twitter, many of them appalled that on the coldest days of winter, perfectly good clothing had been destroyed. H & M said some unnamed employees had made mistakes, and it promised the practice would end. 
 Having seen something and said something, Ms. Magnus resumed her regularly scheduled life. She continued to walk down 35th Street. She also kept an eye on the trash.
 ''On the 24th of May, a Monday night, I discovered two Dumpsters filled with new children's sneakers on that same block,'' Ms. Magnus said last week.
 This was more than indifference to the poor on a single block in a wealthy city. Every year, millions of pounds of textiles that could be recycled wind up, instead, in landfills. The fabrication of shoes and clothing requires large amounts of energy. Risking catastrophe, we drill a mile under water to get to oil that ultimately will be used to make mountains of garbage.
 New York is considering sensible steps to recycle more textiles and other materials. Under legislation before the City Council, rigid plastics would be added to the list of items that are collected for reuse. 
 Another bill would require the city to put recycling baskets next to the regular trash cans in public places like parks and schools. There would be efforts to do more composting -- allowing food waste to naturally decompose -- without creating buffets for rats. (About 15 percent of the city's garbage is food, and about 70 percent of the weight of that food is water -- which means that the city is shipping tons of water to landfills, according to testimony before the Council last month.)
 As for textiles -- clothing, shoes and so forth -- the Department of Sanitation hopes to set up collection bins in the city in the next year, expanding piecemeal textile recovery efforts now available for residents. Under this plan, a not-for-profit group would collect the items and sell them to recyclers. Businesses would continue to make their own arrangements. 
 New York's commercial garbage has its own economic logic: Cardboard, certain grades of paper, scrap metals and food waste from restaurants are commodities, which means that sometimes they are quite valuable. 
 If textiles make up 10 percent or more of a company's waste, the city requires the business to separate them. Ms. Magnus found, however, that the law is toothless and commercial textiles are often sent to landfills. 
 The fine for companies that don't separate their textiles is $25, unchanged in the two decades that the city has been recycling. The recycling legislation before the City Council does not increase those fines. It calls only for a study of commercial waste.
 ''The quantities of textile that I have seen discarded regularly by the garment businesses in Herald Square exceed in a single day what a family of 10 would discard in an entire year,'' Ms. Magnus said.
 But if there's a recycling market for textiles, no matter what the law says, why aren't the businesses taking advantage of it? 
 ''People are often not aware that what they have is of value,'' said Robert Lange, the director of the city's recycling programs. He said the city needed a close study of commercial waste to see how it should change its laws. The low fines, Mr. Lange said, are a big flaw, but there has been little political interest in increasing them over the past 20 years. 
 On the day she spotted the piles of sneakers, Ms. Magnus said, she was running late for class, so she grabbed a few samples from the container, as well as a few yards of unused fabric. Her walks along 35th Street have convinced her that the city needs to look beyond the trash thrown out by individuals.
 ''One guy doing the right thing with his tuna cans does almost nothing to curb the impact of the steady stream of toxics that businesses abandon daily with near impunity,'' she said.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW; Underestimating Risk

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In retrospect, the pattern seems clear. Years before the Deepwater Horizon rig blew, BP was developing a reputation as an oil company that took safety risks to save money. An explosion at a Texas refinery killed 15 workers in 2005, and federal regulators and a panel led by James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, said that cost cutting was partly to blame. The next year, a corroded pipeline in Alaska poured oil into Prudhoe Bay. None other than Joe Barton, a Republican congressman from Texas and a global-warming skeptic, upbraided BP managers for their ''seeming indifference to safety and environmental issues.''
 Much of this indifference stemmed from an obsession with profits, come what may. But there also appears to have been another factor, one more universally human, at work. The people running BP did a dreadful job of estimating the true chances of events that seemed unlikely -- and may even have been unlikely -- but that would bring enormous costs. 
 Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to consider what BP executives must be thinking today. Surely, given the expense of the clean-up and the hit to BP's reputation, the executives wish they could go back and spend the extra money to make Deepwater Horizon safer. That they did not suggests that they figured the rig would be fine as it was.
 For all the criticism BP executives may deserve, they are far from the only people to struggle with such low-probability, high-cost events. Nearly everyone does. ''These are precisely the kinds of events that are hard for us as humans to get our hands around and react to rationally,'' Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard, says. We make two basic -- and opposite -- types of mistakes. When an event is difficult to imagine, we tend to underestimate its likelihood. This is the proverbial black swan. Most of the people running Deepwater Horizon probably never had a rig explode on them. So they assumed it would not happen, at least not to them.
 Similarly, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspanliked to argue, not so long ago, that the national real estate market was not in a bubble because it had never been in one before. Wall Street traders took the same view and built mathematical models that did not allow for the possibility that house prices would decline. And many home buyers signed up for unaffordable mortgages, believing they could refinance or sell the house once its price rose. That's what house prices did, it seemed.
 On the other hand, when an unlikely event is all too easy to imagine, we often go in the opposite direction and overestimate the odds. After the 9/11 attacks, Americans canceled plane trips and took to the road. There were no terrorist attacks in this country in 2002, yet the additional driving apparently led to an increase in traffic fatalities.
 When the stakes are high enough, it falls to government to help its citizens avoid these entirely human errors. The market, left to its own devices, often cannot do so. Yet in the case of Deepwater Horizon, government policy actually went the other way. It encouraged BP to underestimate the odds of a catastrophe.
 In a little-noticed provision in a 1990 law passed after the Exxon Valdez spill, Congress capped a spiller's liability over and above cleanup costs at $75 million for a rig spill. Even if the economic damages -- to tourism, fishing and the like -- stretch into the billions, the responsible party is on the hook for only $75 million. (In this instance, BP has agreed to waive the cap for claims it deems legitimate.) Michael Greenstone, an M.I.T. economist who runs the Hamilton Project in Washington, says the law fundamentally distorts a company's decision making. Without the cap, executives would have to weigh the possible revenue from a well against the cost of drilling there and the risk of damage. With the cap, they can largely ignore the potential damage beyond cleanup costs. So they end up drilling wells even in places where the damage can be horrific, like close to a shoreline. To put it another way, human frailty helped BP's executives underestimate the chance of a low-probability, high-cost event. Federal law helped them underestimate the costs.
 In the wake of Deepwater Horizon, Congress and the Obama administration will no doubt be tempted to pass laws meant to reduce the risks of another deep-water disaster. Certainly there are some sensible steps they can take, like lifting the liability cap and freeing regulators from the sway of industry. But it would be foolish to think that the only risks we are still underestimating are the ones that have suddenly become salient.
 The big financial risk is no longer a housing bubble. Instead, it may be the huge deficits that the growth of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will cause in coming years -- and the possibility that lenders will eventually become nervous about extending credit to Washington. True, some economists and policy makers insist the country should not get worked up about this possibility, because lenders have never soured on the United States government before and show no signs of doing so now. But isn't that reminiscent of the old Bernanke-Greenspan tune about the housing market?
 Then, of course, there are the greenhouse gases that oil wells (among other things) send into the atmosphere even when the wells function properly. Scientists say the buildup of these gases is already likely to warm the planet by at least three degrees over the next century and cause droughts, storms and more ice-cap melting. The researchers' estimates have risen recently, too, and it is also possible the planet could get around 12 degrees hotter. That kind of warming could flood major cities and cause parts of Antarctica to collapse.
 Nothing like that has ever happened before. Even imagining it is difficult. It is much easier to hope that the odds of such an outcome are vanishingly small. In fact, it's only natural to have this hope. But that doesn't make it wise.

HEADLINE: The Corporate Challenge

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI. 
Frank Bruni is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
On a cloudless spring afternoon,Carly Fiorina strode onto an outdoor stage in Pleasanton, Calif., with the happy, hungry expression of someone not just confident of an enthusiastic reception but counting on one. She surveyed a riot of signs artful and artless -- ''Give us liberty, not debt,'' ''Pelosi's gavel is the new health care colonoscopy'' -- and beamed. For the stemwinder on bloated government that she was about to deliver, there was probably no better audience than these thousands of angry rebels, spread across acres of fairgrounds near San Jose for a special Tea Party rally. And there was definitely no better date than this one: April 15. Tax day.
 Fiorina rattled off a slew of stratospheric numbers about the national debt, then example upon example of what she deemed federal overreach, proclaiming: ''The federal government does not create the American dream, although the federal government can surely destroy the American dream.'' The crowd applauded. 
 ''You know,'' she went on, her voice dropping, as if weighed down by emotion, ''I have lived the American dream.'' That was her segue into a condensed version of her professional biography: a liberal-arts degree from Stanford University that didn't qualify her for anything in particular; an abandoned stab at law school; secretarial work; and then, thanks to a late-blooming focus and a lot of ferocious effort, a dizzying climb up the corporate ladder, culminating in more than five years as the chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, by far the most prominent American company that a woman had -- or, to this day, has -- ever run. Fiorina, in a phrase, made history.
 And now she is trying to make a political career out of that, running for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat held for nearly 18 years in California by Barbara Boxer, a liberal Democrat who has long been at the top of the Republican hit list. Not just to the Tea Party but to all the Republicans and independents who will vote in the June 8 primary, Fiorina presents herself as a businesswoman, not a bureaucrat, capable of bringing private-sector savvy to a beleaguered economy. 
 The crowd in Pleasanton loved her, and as she left the stage, she was buoyant. Then she took a few questions from local reporters on hand. One asked about a federal probe into whether bribes greased Hewlett-Packard's access to the Russian market when she ran the company. In a tight, brittle voice, Fiorina said she knew nothing about that.
 Then came a question about H.P. and Iran. And then anotherquestion about H.P. and Russia. Fiorina stated emphatically that H.P. had never, at her direction, acted unlawfully, but her response didn't stop there. She chided the reporters, fuming that it would be nice ''if you would report on the big issues that matter.
 ''You have a huge story happening behind you,'' she snapped, referring to the rally and the voter anxiety it signaled. ''That's what you ought to be reporting on.'' Her smile was gone. And a second later -- poof! -- so was she, in a surrender of cool fascinating for several reasons. It served as both a reminder of how new she is to the political arena and a suggestion, echoed by the occasionally odd tone of her campaign, that she is still finding her way. And the trigger of her ire spoke volumes about why she got into the race and what she may hope, even need, to get out of it.
 Back in 1999, when Cara Carleton S. Fiorina took the helm of H.P., all the exhilarating talk was of trails blazed and ceilings shattered. That ended fast. She was soon pilloried for sweeping work-force cuts, unmet earnings projections and tumbling stock prices; disparaged by the Hewlett and Packard families, who staged a narrowly defeated proxy battle against her merger of H.P. with Compaq; and fired in February 2005, the climax of an exhaustively chronicled corporate melodrama. She still has her place in business history, but it is an entry with an asterisk. While she rose higher than any woman before her, she also fell harder and louder, and what she wanted to regard as a triumph was forever being turned into a taunt, with H.P. thrown at her -- as it was after the Pleasanton rally -- in ways meant to put her on the defensive.
 ''It's heartbreaking,'' says Deborah Bowker, a close friend who lived through the experience with Fiorina and now works as her chief of staff. Fiorina has seemingly had a hard time shaking it off: she tends to bring up H.P. at odd moments, apropos of nothing. I got the sense that her time there is always playing on a tape loop in her mind, like the high-school championship game that didn't turn out quite the way everyone on the team dreamed it would.
 For Fiorina, who is 55, a Senate seat would be more than a fresh challenge. It would be a new loop, a more upbeat ending, even a validation of her business know-how, because she would be winning election at a time when the economy is issue No. 1, in a state with an unemployment rate above 12 percent.
 ''Now, in politics, she can prove she was right all along,'' says Tom Perkins, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who was on the H.P. board when Fiorina led the company and who pushed for her ouster. He says that it was necessary at the time, but that on balance and in retrospect, she deserves credit for revivifying a logy leviathan. ''If she can go into a similar situation in Washington and bring order and make progress,'' he says, ''it's another opportunity for her to prove that she's got what it takes.''
 In a twist that makes California an especially intriguing story during this election cycle, Fiorina isn't the only well-known wealthy businesswoman from Silicon Valley running for statewide office. The favorite for the Republican nomination to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor is Meg Whitman, the former C.E.O. of eBay. Whitman and Fiorina make essentially the same promise: to do in government what they sought to do in business, which is create wealth. And they wear the same mantle: that of the political outsider with the kind of practical, no-nonsense perspective needed to root out waste, balance budgets and cut through government sclerosis.
 Fiorina is no shoo-in for the nomination. Until mid-May, polls showed her slightly behind Tom Campbell, a former California congressman, who is running to her left: he supports abortion rights and gay marriage and hasn't made an unequivocal pledge against new taxes. But as the contest draws to a close, she is using her more formidable war chest -- at least $5.5 million of it her own money -- to outspend him, and two polls in late May showed her far ahead. A third contender, Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, brands himself as the one true conservative in the race, but primary voters may make their decision based less on ideology than on which candidate they feel matches up best against Boxer, deemed to be more vulnerable than ever right now. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, along with John McCain and a roll call of other prominent Republican senators, are backing Fiorina, who has widespread name recognition, a Rolodex of affluent friends (and potential donors) and polish at the microphone. Campbell has already lost one Senate race, against Dianne Feinstein in 2000, and often speaks like the brainy law professor he is. DeVore would be hard-pressed to win over moderates, though that attribute has only endeared him to Tea Party groups, who have ebulliently (and effectively) bucked the establishment in their embrace of Republican candidates like Marco Rubio in Florida and Rand Paul in Kentucky. Like Rubio and Paul, DeVore has been endorsed by Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, the eager spoiler of his Washington colleagues' wishes.
 Fiorina entered the race without voters in California or Republicans in Washington knowing all that much about her politics, and the widespread assumption was that she was a moderate. After all, as a campaign surrogate for John McCain in 2008, she was used to woo independents and women who tended to vote Democratic, and she lambasted health insurers who covered Viagra but not birth control, creating an embarrassment for McCain, who voted against legislation that would have changed that. She also told voters -- erroneously -- that McCain had never called for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. 
 But during this campaign, she has assiduously courted the right, calling for the repeal of health care reform, taking a pledge to oppose new taxes of any kind and pointing to recent endorsements by Sarah Palin and by former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a longtime darling of abortion opponents. Palin reminded California voters that beating Boxer was goal No. 1 and told them that Fiorina would give them the best chance ''of putting an end to the Pelosi-Reid big-government agenda.''
 As the campaign has progressed, Fiorina has sounded ever more conservative. Months ago, she said she probably would have voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor's appointment to the Supreme Court; in more recent comments about Elena Kagan, she has come across as doubtful and wary. When the passage of the Arizona immigration law first made headlines, she deflected questions about it, trying to steer the conversation to what she said was the Obama administration's failure to patrol the border. It was a prudent dodge, given the high percentage of Hispanic voters in California. But as the days went by and the questions kept coming, she said that she supported what Arizona had done, though she wasn't recommending a similar measure in California.
 And during a Republican debate in Los Angeles on May 6, when the three candidates were asked if people on the no-fly list should be allowed to purchase a gun, only Campbell said no. Along with DeVore, Fiorina gave an instant, unequivocal yes.
 ''My goodness,'' Campbell sputtered, seeming genuinely taken aback.
 ''That's why Tom Campbell has kind of a poor rating from the National Rifle Association right there,'' Fiorina shot back. She told reporters after the debate that the no-fly list is overpopulated with individuals who are on it because of bureaucratic or clerical blunders. Their rights shouldn't be abridged because of that, she said.
 She has won endorsements from both the National Right to Life Committee and the California Pro Life Council, who see her as a trustworthy opponent of abortion, even though she says she would have no litmus test for a Supreme Court justice and believes abortion should be permitted in cases of incest, rape and danger to a mother's life. She is opposed to publicly financed abortions of any kind.
 Many of these positions could hinder her in the general election, her stance on abortion being a prime example. The last time a pro-life candidate won a majority of the votes in an election for president, senator or governor in California was in the 1988 presidential race, when George H. W. Bush outpolled Michael Dukakis. But that contest was part of a national landslide, and Bush's commitment to the pro-life cause was widely considered to be a shaky one.
 ''Barbara Boxer is good at a lot of things, but her single greatest talent is running against pro-life opponents,'' says Dan Schnur, who served as an aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and now teaches political science at the University of Southern California. ''She's run against three of them so far, and in each of those campaigns she's used this particular issue to great effect. On some things, she's shrill. On this one, she's not.''
 Fiorina, for her part, is ready with a poignant explanation for her position that goes beyond religious conviction -- she's an irregular churchgoer, not devoted to any denomination -- though she says that religion is part of it. She told me that painful years of unsuccessful efforts by her and her husband, Frank Fiorina, to add a child of their own to his two daughters from a previous marriage served as ''a reminder that life is a precious gift and not everyone is given that gift.'' In addition, she said, her husband's mother, when pregnant with him, was told that her health was in jeopardy and was encouraged to have an abortion. She chose not to, and survived. ''Frank turned out to be the joy of her life, and of my life,'' Fiorina said. ''When that's put into such vivid and personal terms, it makes you think.''
 Fiorina is deft at transforming personal experience into political revelation and at pressing her story into the service of her quest. She does this to especially rousing effect with yet another compelling dimension of this campaign: just 15 months ago, she found out she had breast cancer. She says that after surgery, radiation and months of chemotherapy, she was pronounced cancer-free; although she and her primary opponents have sniped at one another over almost everything imaginable, her health has at no point been an issue in this race.
 But in many speeches, she digresses to explain that her short hair is a vestige of the chemo. ''Having gotten through that experience,'' she went on to say onstage in Pleasanton, ''let me tell you this: a sharp-tongued senator with an invisible legislative record does not intimidate me one bit. I say: 'Bring it on. Bring it on, Barbara Boxer.' ''
 The Pleasanton speech wasn't the first, or last, time I heard her talk about intimidation and fear: what used to frighten her; what doesn't scare her; the importance of being intrepid. Fiorina seems almost obsessed with the topic, and with making clear how very dauntless she is.
 At a women's leadership banquet in San Jose just hours after the Pleasanton speech, she told her audience that she had had ''many fears in life,'' started out ''as a scared, shy child'' and learned that ''if you conquer your fears, you come out stronger and better on the other side.'' When the banquet's organizer asked her for her one best piece of advice for young businesswomen, Fiorina said: ''First, don't panic if you're a little scared. Everybody's scared at some point.''
 And during one of my interviews with her, when I pressed her to single out a favorite among the many oil paintings that her mother, an amateur artist, gave her, she picked a portrait of a transvestite whom her mother had once approached on the subway in San Francisco and invited back to her house to pose. Fiorina explained that the painting ''says a lot about my mother.'' Like what? ''That she was unafraid.''
 Fiorina's father, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor and a judge who served as a deputy attorney general in the Nixon administration and later on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. She was the middle of three children and, from the start, the family's diligent, obedient overachiever. In speeches, interviews and her best-selling 2006 memoir, ''Tough Choices,'' a chronicle principally of her business career, she says that one of the most difficult episodes of her early life was quitting law school at U.C.L.A. after one semester and having her father say, ''I'm not sure you'll ever amount to anything.'' 
 Around that time she married Todd Bartlem, a college sweetheart, and followed him to Bologna, Italy, where he did graduate work and she gave English lessons to Italian businessmen. When they subsequently moved to the Washington area, she got a graduate business degree at the University of Maryland, took a job with AT&T and threw herself into her work. For Bartlem, whom she divorced after a half-dozen years of marriage, the metaphor for that devotion was a beloved childhood piano of hers that he told me her parents sent cross-country, at great expense, and that sat unused in their Maryland home for years. ''She never sat down and played it,'' Bartlem said. ''Because at that point, her whole life and all of her passion had gone into her career.''
 As recounted in ''Tough Choices,'' she was forever turning situations that terrified her to her advantage, like a sales meeting with a bunch of arrogant men whom she disarmed by showing up with socks stuffed into her pants and crowing that her equipment matched theirs. The year after her divorce from Bartlem was final, she married Frank, a high-ranking colleague at AT&T. She went from AT&T to a spinoff, Lucent Technologies, where her spectacular success got her the cover of Fortune magazine and, less than a year later, the offer to lead H.P. That job brought her back to where her father, at this point a widower, lived. She told me, ''He was enormously proud.''
 Fiorina was hired to restore sparkle and edge to a staid institution that had lost both, and the cornerstone of her effort was the Compaq merger, designed to shake up H.P.'s culture and make the company a bigger player in the personal-computer market. But many critics deemed it unwieldy and unwise, and it didn't pay off as lucratively, in the short term, as she at times predicted it would. Her critics assailed her for that, and for pettier matters, like the expensive clothing she wore, the amount of flying in the company jet she did and the way she put her face and name front and center in advertising and promotional efforts. Not long after she was fired, there was an enormous scandal over the methods with which investigators operating under her successors tried to identify the board members and journalists behind news-media leaks that she had first set out to stop.
 H.P. today is robust, one of the largest technology companies in the world. But does the credit go to her or to the company's current C.E.O., Mark Hurd, who finished what she started, completing the Compaq merger? That question has been hashed out for years, in boardrooms and in books, with no real consensus on the job she did. Her Senate candidacy, predictably, has resurrected the debate.
 On April 4, Craig Barrett, the former chairman of the board of Intel, published an opinion piece in The San Jose Mercury News that stated that Fiorina brought ''exactly the right approach to a company that would have faced a more uncertain future otherwise.''
 On April 22, David W. Packard, the son of one of the company's founders, published a retort, using the same space in the same newspaper to note how low H.P.'s earnings per share fell on Fiorina's watch and how many employees were laid off. He said that personal glory, not good sense, had driven her ''relentless pursuit of size and market share.''
 After leaving H.P., Fiorina took high-paid speaking gigs around the world, started a charitable foundation, took seats on corporate boards and gave off glimmers of interest in government and politics. She and Frank bought a condominium in the Ritz Carlton in Georgetown and began spending more time in the Washington area, where Frank's daughter and two granddaughters, ages 13 and 5, live. Frank had another daughter who died, at age 35, last year. The obituaries don't mention the cause of death, and the Fiorinas and their friends decline to answer questions about it.
 But Fiorina's political ambitions became utterly clear only when she offered to campaign for McCain and stumped wide and far and hard for him, helping him to shore up his economic credentials. Her stumbles in the role included answering no to an interviewer's question about whether Palin could run a big corporation. Trying to do damage control, Fiorina compounded her mistake by clarifying that she didn't think McCain could run one either. McCain's aides made scarce use of her for a while thereafter.
 That didn't sour her on politics, and she seemed to be tilting heavily toward the 2010 Senate race when she found a lump under her arm in February of last year, putting the future in limbo for a while. Once all the tests were run, her prognosis for recovery was good, and she never really worried she would die, she says. But at times she doubted that she would ever get her former level of energy back. As her treatments ended and she did, the campaign commenced right away, just as Frank Fiorina always suspected it would.
 ''Carly's going to do what she wants to do,'' says Frank, who is five years older than she and took an early retirement in 1998 as her star rose, so he could advise her, travel with her and help out more at home. He conceded mixed feelings about the Senate race. The two of them could otherwise be enjoying a leisurely life, one that spared his wife the kind of withering scrutiny she has often endured. He's also not sure where or how he fits into this. He knows business, and when he accompanied his wife on business trips during the H.P. days, ''people were pleased to be able to talk to me,'' he says. 
 ''So I felt useful,'' he added. ''I worry, frankly, that I'll be involved, but I won't be able to be as involved as I was.''
 Their dynamic is tender but prickly. On a May morning in Bakersfield, as I idled with them after a campaign event, he held out his phone to show me an e-mail message he had just received from a supporter who questioned the wisdom and attractiveness of her close-cropped hair, presumed to be a matter of choice. He told me that they had received many such missives, including one that complained that she looked, he said, ''like a punk rocker.''
 ''Left-wing radical is what it said,'' Carly interjected.
 ''Thank you,'' Frank said. ''Thank you for correcting me on that.''
 She has a way of flaunting her recall, knowledge and accomplishments, quickly volunteering or clarifying information that a less assertive person might not. On that same morning, Frank happened to mention something about her fluent Italian, and I asked her how she'd come by it, given that her own ancestry is German.
 ''Well, I took Italian in college,'' she answered, adding, a beat later, ''on top of the high-school Greek and the high-school French.''
 An aide picked up a heavy bag filled with bottles of water for a two-hour drive to Fresno, the next campaign stop. 
 ''Stress is dehydrating,'' Fiorina instructed us, and then, all of a sudden, she was talking about H.P., saying, ''In the height of the proxy battle, I would insist that we take water breaks.''
 In the back seat of the black sport utility vehicle ferrying us north, she kicked off her Ferragamo shoes and curled her feet under her, accentuating how little space she actually takes up. But she is small in physical stature only -- like the Yorkshire terriers she and Frank have long raised.
 ''They're little but they're not sissies,'' she told me, explaining what she loves about them. ''They're real dogs in little bodies. They think they're really big and really tough.''
 A contest between Boxer and Fiorina would be a doozy, watched coast to coast. Fiorina has made it clear that she's a brawler, beginning with her campaign's release, on the Web, of two attack videos so menacing, even apocalyptic that they could be taken for ''Saturday Night Live'' parodies of negative advertising. One posits the fraudulence of Campbell's proclaimed fiscal conservatism by introducing ''a wolf in sheep's clothing,'' its demonic eyes glowing red and the fleecy innocents around it bolting in terror. The other, aimed at Boxer, portrays her head as a monstrous balloon -- inflated by egotism, unrestrained liberalism and hot air -- that busts through the U.S. Capitol dome and then darkens the California landscape, upon which (you will notice a theme here) innocent citizens bolt in terror. (Fiorina's first television ads, in contrast, have been tame: voters expressing anxiety and Fiorina allaying it.)
 On the stump, her manner is never more animated than when she's bashing Boxer. In many speeches she mentions an incident last year when Boxer chastised an Army brigadier general for calling her ''Ma'am,'' saying she preferred ''Senator.'' Fiorina told one group of Republicans that if she is elected, ''You may call me 'Ma'am.' You may call me 'Senator.' You may call me 'Carly.' You may call me, 'Hey, you, remember, you work for me.' ''
 In a Fiorina-Boxer matchup, Boxer would have ample ammunition of her own. Democrats have noticed a fondness Fiorina has for talking about her ''real world'' perspective, and they have noticed too that in addition to the Georgetown condo, she and her husband own a 14-room estate in the wealthy enclave of Los Altos, Calif., and dock a 70-foot yacht in Sausalito. She left H.P. with a severance package of $21 million, and in required Senate ethics committee filings, she estimated the couple's net worth at somewhere between $30 million and $120 million. 
 Boxer would no doubt draw attention to Fiorina's most conservative statements -- and to something else too. Fiorina didn't bother to vote for the 10 years she lived in New Jersey and voted in fewer than half of the last 18 elections in California in which she could participate.
 I asked Fiorina about that, and she said instantly, ''It was a mistake.'' But then, as if her lapse mattered only in the context of her current ambition, she added: ''I felt disconnected from the process. I wasn't running my life to seek political office someday. Well, I'm all in now.''
 Fiorina was up before dawn on a recent Saturday in Sacramento, where she lined up with about 30 campaign compatriots under a ''Carly for California'' sign at the Race for the Cure, a breast cancer fund-raiser. Like many of the thousands of participants, the Carly team planned to walk, not run, the three miles, and just before they began, a few of them learned they were in the wrong spot. They had to thrash their way through a thick row of Oleander bushes to get to the right one.
 ''You didn't know you'd be going through the jungle,'' I said to Carly.
 ''We go through the jungle every day,'' she responded, then informed me that Oleander flowers are poisonous.
 The signs identifying other teams said ''Walking for Knockers,'' ''Jogging for Jugs'' and ''Fond Mammaries.''
 ''You can do that on this walk,'' she said to me. ''You know the way Italians can tell Italian jokes? Girls can tell boob jokes.''
 She mentioned that last July, in San Jose, she went to a similar cancer fund-raiser, led by Lance Armstrong, but was too weak to participate. ''I was literally in the middle of chemo,'' she said. But she blew the starting horn and watched more than 3,000 people go by.
 To be back in the stew of things just 10 months later, she said, ''is surprisingly emotional, I have to say: I didn't know what to expect.'' Her eyes welled with tears.
 For most of the walk she held Frank's hand, but then became antsy and let go. She couldn't reconcile herself to the sluggish pace in the thick crowd. When her team slowed down too much and the walkers ahead pulled away, she shouted: ''We're straggling! We're straggling!''
 At the end she looked relieved, even joyful. She jumped up and down, arms raised high; she doled out hugs. This wasn't the finish line foremost in her thoughts. But for now it would do.

HEADLINE: LETTERS; The Teachers' Unions' Last Stand

 BODY:
 There are many things in Steven Brill's article that trouble me, but my greatest concern about the education-reform debate is the absence of teachers' voices. When the country was debating the economic-stimulus plan, policy makers asked economists for advice, and the press frequently provided a forum for them to express their opinions. Yet when discussing education, the experts -- those who work with children every day in classrooms -- are rarely consulted. Many of those who were interviewed for Brill's article said that they want what is best for children. It seems to me that if this is a genuine concern, those who best understand the challenges and problems in our schools, namely teachers, should be asked what they think. EMILY MILLER Second-Grade Teacher, P.S. 24, Brooklyn
 The arguments underpinning Brill's article may be fashionable, but they are flawed. Like many observers with a newfound interest in education, Brill espouses the ideas that public schools are hopelessly broken and that alternatives to public schools are silver bullets. But Brill's facts don't hold up -- not in his characterization of teachers' unions or school-improvement efforts nor in his comparison of two schools. 
 No one is satisfied with the state of education -- certainly not the members and leaders of the American Federation of Teachers. That is why we are leading and collaborating on efforts to improve teaching and learning. In New Haven and elsewhere around the country, numerous A.F.T. affiliates have used collective bargaining as a tool to overhaul teacher development and evaluation, which is the key to having good teachers. And -- in the midst of devastating budget cuts -- we're fighting for the tools teachers need to help their students. But this reality doesn't square with the caricature of unions Brill presents.
 Finally, Brill's portrayal of P.S. 149 and the Harlem Success Academy suggests you can make an apples-to-apples comparison between the schools and that differences in achievement can be attributed to whether the teachers are unionized, among other factors. In truth, each school has seen academic improvement, but Brill fails to note that P.S. 149 serves more students who are severely disabled, poor, homeless or not fluent in English than Harlem Success Academy does.
 When the facts are revealed, Brill's arguments fall far short. RANDI WEINGARTEN President, American Federation of Teachers Washington
 Brill's attack on teachers' unions for the lack of progress in school reform misses the mark. It may be fashionable to attack unions, but anyone who has looked closely at what's going on should realize that the issues are far more complex. Consider this: Massachusetts and Minnesota have made more progress than most states in raising achievement, and both states have strong teachers' unions. States like Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, meanwhile, have weak unions and have made very little progress.
 Brill would have been more helpful if he had been more specific in describing the areas where flexibility is needed, unless he simply wants to eliminate teachers' unions. Any honest observer would acknowledge that unions do occasionally obstruct changes that are needed to improve schools, but so do superintendents (and chancellors), mayors, state legislatures and occasionally parents. There's plenty of room for blame, and that's part of the problem. We spend too much time casting blame and not enough time taking responsibility for bringing about the changes that are needed in America's schools. PEDRO A. NOGUERA, PH.D. Executive Director, Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, New York University New York
 Brill ignores two essential barriers to using student test scores to judge teacher effectiveness. First, current achievement tests are not accurate indicators of what students have learned. While it is not hard to determine whether children can recognize a printed word, it is difficult to construct test items that show whether students can read between the lines, draw conclusions, recognize author biases or determine the gist of a long passage.
 Second, student achievement is influenced by many factors. Research finds that family background is the strongest determinant of school achievement. School-district policies affect classroom learning, among other ways, by allocating resources and assigning students, teachers and principals to specific schools. Without factoring in these influences, student scores cannot measure teacher effectiveness. ROSALIE FRIEND, PH.D. Retired Adjunct Associate Professor School of Education, Hunter College/CUNY Brooklyn
 As someone who has been at it for more than 20 years, I can tell you teaching is hard. If our approach to educational reform continues to focus on punishing teachers for underperforming rather than encouraging them to improve, we're lost. The current emphasis on testing and ''outcomes'' in evaluating teaching is unlikely to do much to raise student-achievement levels -- good teaching requires creativity in the classroom, not adherence to a prescribed regimen.
 If we want good teaching in our schools -- and this is as true at the university level as it is in elementary and secondary schools -- we need to design a system in which teachers are encouraged, and expected, to be active scholars, not just in their subjects but also in pedagogy. Teachers need to be up on educational research about what works; they need to get feedback on their teaching from people who are genuinely interested in their growth and development; and they need to keep studying with master teachers. In short, if you want better teachers, find ways to keep teachers in school. DAVID HLAVSA Professor of Theater Arts Saint Martin's University Lacey, Wash.
 Brill breezily dismisses the coming class-size crisis, a tsunami set to hit American schools this fall, when as many as 275,000 teachers face layoffs nationwide. In Chicago, class sizes will increase to 35 from 28, which is more children and desks than can fit into many classrooms. Teachers will be strained in their efforts to reach every student -- and the resulting damage to children will play out for years to come.
 Yes, it is true that American teachers' unions have created their own obstructionist image by systematically ensuring that incompetent teachers remain in the classroom. But this doesn't mean that those who have the hardest teaching jobs in America don't need and deserve collective representation and protection. Unions and tenure systems need to be reformed, not dismantled. Yes, the teacher-evaluation process needs to be completely revamped to allow for dismissal of incompetent teachers. But the process must be fair; teachers must be protected against the whims of political principals and school systems. The so-called reforms that Race to the Top pushes on states would undermine this protection, endangering the careers of the good teachers along with the bad ones. SETH PATNER Chicago
 I am surprised that Brill's well-written article, depicting the rapid changes in teacher pay and employment policies precipitated by the Race to the Top, did not once credit or even discuss the state of the economy. Certainly when times are not so tough, state governments still compete for federal dollars, but perhaps they would not have taken on the entrenched teachers' unions or made such radical changes if state budgets were not in such dire straits. Kudos to Arne Duncan and the Obama administration for leveraging the crisis to make monumental improvements in public education. ARI GERSTMAN Washington
 Brill writes about the informal network of reformers that has accelerated education reform. He overlooks a significant force, however: results-driven teachers in classrooms and in union halls who are just as eager to move the teaching profession into the 21st century. Teachers like myself are at the forefront of reform, and we are critical to its success.
 I am a founding teacher with Teach Plus, a nonprofit organization that gives voice to reform-oriented teachers. We have advanced common-sense reforms that improve opportunities for students, like creating an innovative teacher-leadership program for turnaround schools in Boston and including performance measures in layoff decisions in Indianapolis. The primary advocates for and leaders of these reforms are active union members.
 I speak for many teachers when I include ''reformer'' as a central part of my identity as a union-represented teacher. MARIA FENWICK Boston
 Nowhere in Brill's article is principal accountability mentioned, as it seldom is in this discussion. As a New York City public school teacher, I strongly believe there is no bigger factor in teacher effectiveness than the quality of school leadership. A good principal establishes a strong and tangible school culture, high expectations for teachers and students and a code of conduct that is both transparent and enforced for all members of the school. This is often the foundation of high-performing charter schools. The research shows that strong classroom teachers are the main contributors to student achievement, and more often than not, good teachers have good principals behind them. MELANIE LEE Brooklyn
 I am a teacher of 34 years and a union sister for 34 years. As I listen to the debate over the Race to the Top, I become agitated. I believe a key question is being neglected: when will financing for our future students become equitable? I would give up my union, and my tenure, if and when all students receive the same amount of federal and local aid. I would willingly have my salary adjusted when teachers from suburban and urban areas are remunerated for their work equally. Maybe we teachers are part of the problem in education, but I am willing to be part of the solution when tougher questions get asked. Is it fair that some students are allotted more money than others? COLLETTE CULLEN Wayne County, Mich.
 If school reform is to be seriously studied, a comparison of charter schools and public schools must involve random assignment of students. Comparisons in test performance are tainted by several factors, particularly parent involvement. Two schools (one charter, one public) sharing the same building particularly highlight this design flaw. Students with parents who make applications, attend meetings, purchase uniforms and otherwise inconvenience themselves for the sake of their children are a select group that is not comparable with the group of students whose parents do not do such things. A valid comparison of performance outcomes starts with random assignments from the same population of students. Until this is done, no conclusions can be drawn except poor experimental design. IRA F. GREENSPUN, PH.D. Staten Island

HEADLINE: Scanning for Trouble

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE. 
Tara Parker-Pope writes the Well column for The New York Times and is the author of ''For Better: The Science of a Good Marriage,'' which was released last month by Dutton.

 BODY:
THE sudden breakup of Al and Tipper Gore's seemingly idyllic marriage was the latest and among the sharpest reminders that the only two people who know what's going on in a marriage are the two people who are in it.
 The truth is that most marriages, even our own, are something of a mystery to outsiders. 
 Several years ago, a marriage researcher -- Robert W. Levenson, director of the psychophysiology laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley -- and his colleagues produced a video of 10 couples talking and bickering. Dr. Levenson knew at the time that five of the couples had been in troubled relationships and eventually divorced. He showed the video to 200 people, including pastors, marriage therapists and relationship scientists, asking them to spot the doomed marriages. They guessed wrong half the time. 
 ''People on the outside aren't very good at telling how marriages are really working,'' he said.
 Even so, academic researchers have become increasingly fascinated with the inner workings of long-married couples, subjecting them to a battery of laboratory tests and even brain scans to unravel the mystery of lasting love.
 Bianca Acevedo, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, studies the neuroscience of relationships and began a search for long-married couples who were still madly in love. Through a phone survey, she collected data on 274 men and women in committed relationships, and used relationship scales to measure marital happiness and passionate love. 
 Dr. Acevedo expected to find only a small percentage of long-married couples still passionately in love. To her surprise, about 40 percent of them continued to register high on the romance scale. The remaining 60 percent weren't necessarily unhappy. Many had high levels of relationship satisfaction and were still in love, just not so intensely.
 In a separate study, 17 men and women who were passionately in love agreed to undergo scans to determine what lasting romantic love looks like in the brain. The subjects, who had been married an average of about 21 years, viewed a picture of their spouse. As a control, they also viewed photos of two friends. 
 Compared with the reaction when looking at others, seeing the spouse activated parts of the brain associated with romantic love, much as it did when couples who had just fallen in love took the same test. But in the older couples, researchers spotted something extra: parts of the brain associated with deep attachment were also activated, suggesting that contentment in marriage and passion in marriage aren't mutually exclusive.
 ''They have the feelings of euphoria, but also the feelings of calm and security that we feel when we're attached to somebody,'' Dr. Acevedo said. ''I think it's wonderful news.''
 So how do these older couples keep the fires burning? Beyond the brain scans, it was clear that these couples remained active in each other's lives.
 ''They were still very much in love and engaged in the relationship,'' Dr. Acevedo said. ''That's something that seems different from the Gores, who said they had grown apart.''
 Indeed, if there is a lesson from the Gore breakup, it's that with marriage, you're never done working on it. 
 ''It's not that you have to be constantly scared about your relationship, but you do have to renew it,'' said Stephanie Coontz, a marriage historian at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. ''I think the warning we should take from this is not that marriages are doomed, but that you can't skate indefinitely and be doing different things and not really be paying attention to the marriage itself.''
 Research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that couples who regularly do new and different things together are happier than those who repeat the same old habits. The theory is that new experiences activate the dopamine system and mimic the brain chemistry of early romantic love.
 In a new study, the Stony Brook scientists will have couples playing either a mundane or exciting video game together while their brains are being scanned.. The goal is to see how sharing a new and challenging experience with a spouse changes the neural activation of the brain.
 But for those of us without a brain scanner, there are simple ways to find out if your relationship is growing or vexed by boredom. Among the questions to ask yourself: How much does your partner provide a source of exciting experiences? How much has knowing your partner made you a better person? In the last month, how often did you feel that your marriage was in a rut? 
 If the answers aren't exactly what you hoped for, take heart. From a statistical standpoint, your risk for divorce begins to fall once you've passed the 10-year mark. According to Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, recent Census Bureau data show that only about 4 percent of recently ended marriages involved couples married for 40 years or more.
 And it's worth noting that the Gores married in 1970s, the beginning of a generation of couples that has consistently struggled with marriage more than any other group. Dr. Stevenson calls them the ''greatest divorcing generation.''
 Lost in the discussion about the Gore divorce is the inherent optimism that the decision represents. Professor Coontz recalls living next door to a couple in their 70s who disliked each other so much that during the summer, they sat outside in lawn chairs on the opposite sides of the house. ''I think it's good that people can go ahead and start over before they get to that level of anger and hostility,'' she said.
 Dr. Stevenson called the Gore breakup a ''glass-half-full story.''
 ''They had 40 years of marriage, and they had what, by many dimensions, should be considered a successful marriage,'' she said. ''The fact that they both can look forward and see a promising future by not being married -- it's unfortunate that the answer is 'yes,' but it's also somewhat a celebration about how much optimism they have for the rest of their lives.''

HEADLINE: Losing an Incumbent, Not Necessarily the Seat

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Anti-incumbency fever is not necessarily all bad for the political power structure.
 The deep resentment against Washington that has already toppled a few Congressional incumbents this midterm election cycle and has helped persuade others to step aside could actually allow the parties to hang on to seats they might have otherwise lost. 
 Given the intense battle under way for control of the House and the Senate, where results in just a few races could mean the difference between majority and minority, bidding an early goodbye to a longtime colleague might be a small price to pay. 
 Take the case of Representative Alan B. Mollohan, the veteran West Virginia Democrat and second-generation congressman who was convincingly defeated on May 11 by a state legislator, Mike Oliverio. 
 Strategists for both parties now say that Mr. Oliverio will be a stronger candidate than Mr. Mollohan, a 14-term incumbent who got caught up in some ethical issues and was going to have to defend a string of his own votes as well as the actions of the Democratic majority in the House. Mr. Oliverio, despite long service in the State Legislature, does not have those extended Capitol Hill ties and in fact can now run against Washington -- an advantage Mr. Mollohan was never going to have.
 A similar situation exists in the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Senator Arlen Specter, the party-switching incumbent who was backed by the White House, lost on May 18 to Representative Joe Sestak. 
 Mr. Sestak is a quasi incumbent himself because of his two terms in the House. But Mr. Specter angered both parties when he switched from Republican to Democrat. Mr. Sestak gives the party something of a fresher start and has already been found to be leading his Republican opponent, Pat Toomey, in some early polls.
 ''With Specter having been a part of Washington for so long, I think if one of them had a better chance of surviving than the other, it was clearly Sestak,'' said Charlie Cook, a veteran nonpartisan handicapper of Congressional races.
 In Wisconsin, Republicans had been preparing for a titanic fight against Representative David R. Obey, the third-most-senior member of the House. To Republicans, Mr. Obey epitomizes Democratic fiscal policy as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and architect of the 2009 stimulus legislation.
 Democrats were worried that Mr. Obey, first elected to Congress in 1969, might not want to engage in the intense campaign required to hold on to his seat this year. In early May, he announced he would instead retire, immediately reshaping the race. Now Democrats will have their own Washington outsider to run against the Republican outsider.
 The loss of incumbents is not helpful to Democrats alone. Though Republicans were likely to hold on to the seat of Representative Parker Griffith in Alabama, it might now be a tad easier, since Mr. Griffith himself lost his party primary last Tuesday. 
 As a Democrat who became a Republican last December, Mr. Griffith -- like Mr. Specter in Pennsylvania -- had irritated voters of both parties. Had he been the Republican nominee in the general election, he could have conceivably been deserted by Republicans suspicious of his loyalties, opening the door to a Democratic victory. The winning Republican nominee, Mo Brooks, now starts with a clean slate.
 Of course, neither party would argue that it would be wise to let most of its incumbents fall in primaries this year. An experienced, well-financed political veteran who has survived past political turmoil is still the best hope for prevailing in what promises to be a tumultuous year. A win is a win, even if the margin of victory is smaller. 
 And some retirements have clearly diminished both parties' chances for victory. Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, was a better bet for a Senate victory in Indiana in a difficult election year than Representative Brad Ellsworth, who was chosen as the state's Democratic candidate after Mr. Bayh decided not to seek re-election.
 Coming primaries will provide new tests for incumbents and for how the parties view the results. In the most highly publicized case, the fate of Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, is on the line in a runoff election on Tuesday. 
 Some analysts say, and polls have suggested, that her opponent, Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, could conceivably make a more formidable general election candidate against Representative John Boozman, the Republican contender. 
 Mr. Halter would not have to defend votes like Mrs. Lincoln's support for the health care overhaul and the economic bailout, both of which have proven to be unpopular in Arkansas. In fact, Mr. Halter could turn the Troubled Asset Relief Program, better known as Tarp, on Mr. Boozman, who supported it as a member of Congress.
 It is one more piece of evidence that while Democrats and Republicans publicly root for their incumbents to survive, losing a few more is not necessarily the end of the world.

HEADLINE: Few Rules, No Curfew: The Pauls' Libertarianism Began at Home

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
 WASHINGTON -- In keeping with their position as the First Family of Libertarianism, the Pauls of Lake Jackson, Tex., did not have many rules around their home.
 ''Behave yourself and be polite'' is how Representative Ron Paul describes his regulatory philosophy about rearing five children. Mr. Paul, a Republican, and his wife of 53 years, Carol, never believed in assigned chores or mandates.
 They did not give out allowances, which they viewed as a parental version of a government handout. They did not believe in strict curfews; Mr. Paul says that unintended consequences -- like speeding home to beat the clock -- can result from excessive meddling from a central authority.
 While Mr. Paul's laissez-faire views produced a family of likeminded thinkers -- ''We're all on board,'' says the oldest son, Ronnie Paul -- they inspired the middle child, Rand, to follow his father's career path, first into medicine and now politics. If he prevails in November after winning the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in Kentucky last month, he and his father would form a two-man libertarian dynasty. 
 Father and son are described as each other's political sounding boards, confidants and support systems. ''Dad and Rand spent hours having great philosophical discussions about issues,'' said Joy Paul Leblanc, the youngest sibling.
 ''Everyone always said, 'If anyone runs for anything, it will be Rand,' '' the congressman said.
 The two Pauls have similar economic ideologies, overlapping organizations and Internet-based fund-raising apparatuses. The elder Mr. Paul, 74, dispensed behind-the-scenes advice during his son's bid for the Senate seat, in which he upset the favorite, Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson.
 In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Paul, the two-time libertarian presidential candidate, referred to his son's campaign as ''our race.'' When his son faced criticism recently over comments that some interpreted as skeptical of federal civil rights laws, the congressman was shaken.
 Rand Paul, 47, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has described his father as his political hero. But he is quick to emphasize that he has never been dependent on him. ''I think my dad has helped me tremendously,'' he said in a joint interview with his father for a Kentucky television station this year. ''But the only way I win is on my own two feet.''
 He decided to go into politics despite his lineage as much as because of it, family members said. ''Ron believes that you are not supposed to initiate force on anyone else,'' Mrs. Paul said. Her husband promoted self-reliance in his children, and their choices and views flowed from that, she said.
 Friends of the family describe a traditional household with early American decor and the frequent aroma of Mrs. Paul's chocolate chip cookies, if not fish sticks. They have lived since July 4, 1968, in the same middle-class enclave of Lake Jackson, where the streets are named for trees, flowers and fauna (the Pauls live on Blossom). They owned a series of collies (Julie, Kippy and Cricket) and a Maltese (Liberty), and the kids were expected, though not required, to feed the pooches, make their own beds, clear their own dishes from the table and not talk back to their elders.
 As a member of Congress, Mr. Paul spent most of his time in Washington and, upon returning to Texas, often crisscrossed his sprawling district to attend political events. At home, his children recall, he prized the solitude of his lawnmower. Mrs. Paul was a stay-at-home mom, longtime Girl Scout troop leader and self-described ''busybody'' who prided herself on knowing exactly what everyone was doing. If one of the children misbehaved, her husband did not spank or yell. Instead, he sometimes gave them written assignments, Mrs. Paul said, explaining, ''He believed in exercising the brain.''
 Ron Paul said he was not philosophically opposed to centralized authority, as long as it existed close to home, or within it. ''We didn't say the kids could do anything they wanted,'' he said.
 ''They were a very Brady Bunch-type American family,'' said Eric Dondero, a longtime former aide to Ron Paul. ''As different as their politics are, their personal life was very normal.''
 A strong libertarian bent ran through the Paul brood, and there are no apparent outliers. ''Once you learn about the broken monetary policy, there is no other way,'' said Ronnie Paul, a retired engineer at Dow Chemical in nearby Freeport. ''We believe that stealing from people is not good, whether you're the government or whether you have a mask on your face.''
 Rand particularly absorbed the family ethic of exerting his free will. Though never rebellious, he sometimes bristled at being given too many directions. As a junior in high school, his mother recalled, he got a paper back from a geometry teacher that, while largely correct, was filled with what he considered to be unnecessary red marks. He walked into the principal's office and asked to be moved into another class. ''He and that teacher were not on the same wavelength,'' said Mrs. Paul, who added that she and her husband supported Rand's actions. ''Rand was someone who took care of his own problems.''
 As a teenager, he studied the Austrian economists that his father revered, as well as the iconic free-market novelist and philosopher, Ayn Rand (she was not the inspiration for Rand's name, which is short for Randal; he was called Randy growing up).
 Rand walked door to door in support of his father's first Congressional race, in 1974, and while a student at Baylor University, he helped in his father's unsuccessful Senate race against Phil Gramm in 1984. (When Ron Paul had to be in Washington for a Congressional vote, Rand stepped in for him in a debate against Mr. Gramm -- it was his first public speaking appearance). Rand would take it upon himself to organize the other family members on neighborhood walking tours, canvasses and appearances.
 ''We would all be home for a big Christmas dinner,'' his father said. ''And Rand would be talking politics. He educated himself on politics in ways that I've never even cared about.''
 More recently, Rand traveled to several states in 2008 on behalf of his father's insurgent campaign for the Republican nomination -- an enterprise that gained surprising traction at the grass roots and brought in over $35 million in campaign donations.
 Mr. Paul was loath to guide his five children in any vocational direction, although three of them followed him into careers in medicine. (Rand is an ophthalmologist, who like his father attended Duke University Medical School and is often referred to as Dr. Paul by his staff and supporters; Joy is an obstetrician-gynecologist, and Robert is a family doctor.)
 The father was insistent about allowing his children as much autonomy as possible and he believed, for instance, that economic subsidies (like allowances) could foster dependence. He discouraged Rand or any of his siblings from accepting financial aid to attend college, nor would he accept Medicare or Medicare payments from patients, calling it ''stolen money'' in a 1996 interview with The Austin American-Statesman. (Rand Paul, however, was criticized recently for opposing cuts to Medicare physician payments.)
 While Ron Paul supports his son's Senate campaign, his participation has been noticeably arms-length, owing to a concern that his views might be too outside the mainstream for a general electorate, particularly on foreign policy. He has suggested, for example, that the United States needs to explore Al Qaeda's motives. ''Nobody wants to talk about the motive,'' he said last January. ''But it's out there, it's laid on a platter. Bin Laden writes of it.''
 When asked whether anyone told him to keep his distance from Kentucky, the elder Mr. Paul said: ''I've got a life to lead. I have a job. And when I'm off, I want to be in Texas.''
 He added that there are perils for political heirs relying too heavily on their patrons. ''It can be very dangerous when somebody thinks they inherit these things,'' he said.
 Family members say the congressman has been shaken by the recent storm his son has faced over remarks in which he seemed to take issue, on libertarian grounds, with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
 At the outset of an interview on Capitol Hill, Mr. Paul placed the controversy -- ''the agitation,'' he called it -- off limits. But then he immediately referred to a recent column supportive of his son in the Congressional newspaper, The Hill, and volunteered that he had just telephoned the column's author, Lanny Davis, a Clinton White House aide, to thank him.
 Mr. Davis said, ''I heard a father's concern more than I did any political concern,'' and described the conversation as emotional.
 Mr. Paul conceded that it is easier to be the candidate under attack than to be a family member of one. ''No matter how well you arm yourself, no matter how well you know the system,'' he said in the interview, ''it really hurts when it's your son.''

HEADLINE: Don't Get Mad, Mr. President. Get Even.

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IT turns out there is something harder to find than a fix for BP's leak: Barack Obama's boiling point. 
 The frantic and fruitless nationwide search for the president's temper is now our sole dependable comic relief from the tragedy in the gulf. Only The Onion could have imagined the White House briefing last week where a CBS News correspondent asked the press secretary, Robert Gibbs, if he had ''really seen rage from the president'' and to ''describe it.'' Gibbs came up with Obama's ''clenched jaw'' and his order to ''plug the damn hole.'' (Thank God he hadn't settled for ''darn.'') This evidence did not persuade anyone, least of all Spike Lee, who could be found on CNN the next night begging the president, ''One time, go off!'' 
 Not going to happen. Obama will never unleash the anger of the antagonists in ''Do the Right Thing'' or match James Carville's rebooted ''ragin' Cajun'' shtick. That's not who Obama is. If he tried to go off, he'd look ridiculous. But the debate over how to raise the president's emotional thermostat is not an entirely innocuous distraction. It allows Obama to duck the more serious doubts about his leadership that have resurfaced along with BP's oil. 
 Unlike his unflappable temperament, his lingering failings should and could be corrected. And they must be if his presidency is not just to rise above the 24/7 Spill-cam but to credibly seize the narrative that Americans have craved ever since he was elected during the most punishing economic downturn of our lifetime. We still want to believe that Obama is on our side, willing to fight those bad corporate actors who cut corners and gambled recklessly while regulators slept, Congress raked in contributions, and we got stuck with the wreckage and the bills. But his leadership style keeps sowing confusion about his loyalties, puncturing holes in the powerful tale he could tell. 
 His most conspicuous flaw is his unshakeable confidence in the collective management brilliance of the best and the brightest he selected for his White House team -- ''his abiding faith in the judgment of experts,'' as Joshua Green of The Atlantic has put it. At his gulf-centric press conference 10 days ago, the president said he had ''probably had more meetings on this issue than just about any issue since we did our Afghan review.'' This was meant to be reassuring but it was not. The plugging of an uncontrollable oil leak, like the pacification of an intractable Afghanistan, may be beyond the reach of marathon brainstorming by brainiacs, even if the energy secretary is a Nobel laureate. Obama has yet to find a sensible middle course between blind faith in his own Ivy League kind and his predecessor's go-with-the-gut bravado.
 By now, he also should have learned that the best and the brightest can get it wrong -- and do. His economic advisers predicted that without the stimulus the unemployment rate might reach 9 percent -- a projection that was quickly exceeded even with the stimulus and that has haunted the administration ever since. Other White House geniuses persuaded the president to make his fateful claim in early April that ''oil rigs today generally don't cause spills'' -- a particularly specious (indeed false) plank in the argument for his spectacularly ill-timed expansion of offshore oil drilling. The Times reported last week that at the administration meetings leading to this new drilling policy the subject of the vast dysfunction at the Minerals Management Service, the agency charged with regulating the drilling, never even came up. 
 Obama's excessive trust in his own heady team is all too often matched by his inherent deference to the smartest guys in the boardroom in the private sector. His default assumption seems to be that his peers are always as well-intentioned as he is. The single biggest mistake he has made in managing the gulf disaster was his failure to challenge BP's version of events from the start. The company consistently understated the spill's severity, overestimated the progress of the repair operation and low-balled the environmental damage. Yet the White House's designated point man in the crisis, Adm. Thad Allen of the Coast Guard, was still publicly reaffirming his trust in the BP chief executive, Tony Hayward, as recently as two weeks ago, more than a month after the rig exploded. 
 This is baffling, and then some, given BP's atrocious record prior to this catastrophe. In the last three years, according to the Center for Public Integrity, BP accounted for ''97 percent of all flagrant violations found in the refining industry by government safety inspectors'' -- including 760 citations for ''egregious, willful'' violations (compared with only eight at the two oil companies that tied for second place). Hayward's predecessor at BP, ousted in a sex-and-blackmail scandal in 2007, had placed cost-cutting (and ever more obscene profits) over safety, culminating in the BP Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 and injured 170 in 2005. Last October The Times uncovered documents revealing that BP had still failed to address hundreds of safety hazards at that refinery in the four years after the explosion, prompting the largest fine in the history of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (The fine, $87 million, was no doubt regarded as petty cash by a company whose profit reached nearly $17 billion last year.)
 No high-powered White House meetings or risk analyses were needed to discern how treacherous it was to trust BP this time. An intern could have figured it out. But the credulous attitude toward BP is no anomaly for the administration. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs was praised by the president as a ''savvy'' businessman two months before the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman. Well before then, there had been a flood of journalistic indicators that Goldman under Blankfein may have gamed the crash and the bailout. 
 It's this misplaced trust in elites both outside the White House and within it that seems to prevent Obama from realizing the moment that history has handed to him. Americans are still seething at the bonus-grabbing titans of the bubble and at the public and private institutions that failed to police them. But rather than embrace a unifying vision that could ignite his presidency, Obama shies away from connecting the dots as forcefully and relentlessly as the facts and Americans' anger demand.
 BP's recklessness is just the latest variation on a story we know by heart. The company's heedless disregard of risk and lack of safeguards at Deepwater Horizon are all too reminiscent of the failures at Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and A.I.G., where the richly rewarded top executives often didn't even understand the toxic financial products that would pollute and nearly topple the nation's economy. BP's reliance on bought-off politicians and lax, industry-captured regulators at the M.M.S. mirrors Wall Street's cozy relationship with its indulgent overseers at the S.E.C., Federal Reserve and New York Fed -- not to mention Massey Energy's dependence on somnolent supervision from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. 
 Given Toyota's recent game of Russian roulette with Americans' safety and Anthem Blue Cross's unconscionable insurance-rate increases in California, Obama shouldn't have any problem riveting the country's attention to this sorry saga. He has the field to himself, thanks to a political opposition whose hottest new star, Rand Paul, and most beloved gulf-state governor, Haley Barbour of Mississippi, bothleapt to BP's defense right after the rig exploded. The Wall Street Journal editorial page perfectly set forth the conservative establishment's party line on May 26: ''There is zero evidence so far that this blowout resulted from lax regulation or shoddy practices.'' Or as BP's Hayward asked indignantly, ''What the hell did we do to deserve this?''
 If Obama is to have a truly transformative presidency, there could be no better catalyst than oil. Standard Oil jump-started Progressive Era trust-busting. Sinclair Oil's kickback-induced leases of Wyoming's Teapot Dome oilfields in the 1920s led to the first conviction and imprisonment of a presidential cabinet member (Harding's interior secretary) for a crime committed while in the cabinet. The Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s and the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 sped the conservation movement and search for alternative fuels. The Enron scandal prompted accounting reforms and (short-lived) scrutiny of corporate Ponzi schemes.
 This all adds up to a Teddy Roosevelt pivot-point for Obama, who shares many of that president's moral and intellectual convictions. But Obama can't embrace his inner T.R. as long as he's too in thrall to the supposed wisdom of the nation's meritocracy, too willing to settle for incremental pragmatism as a goal, and too inhibited by the fine points of Washington policy debates to embrace bold words and bold action. If he is to wield the big stick of reform against BP and the other powerful interests that have ripped us off, he will have to tell the big story with no holds barred.
 That doesn't require a temper tantrum. Nor does it require him to plug the damn hole, which he can't do anyway. What he does have the power to fix is his presidency. Should he do so, and soon, he'll still have a real chance to mend a broken country as well.

HEADLINE: Can A Soda Tax Save Us From Ourselves?

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.

 BODY:
AS governments large and small face sizable budget shortfalls, policy makers are looking for ways to raise tax revenue that will do the least harm and, perhaps, even a bit of good. One idea keeps popping up: a tax on soda and other sugary drinks.
 The city council in Washington recently passed such a tax. Gov. David A. Paterson has sought one in New York. And a national soda tax was briefly considered by the Senate Finance Committee as a way to help pay for President Obama's health care overhaul. 
 But is a soda tax a good idea?
 Economists have often advocated taxing consumption rather than income, on the grounds that consumption taxes do less to discourage saving, investment and economic growth. Hence the case for broad-based consumption taxes, like a value-added tax. The main issue for the soda tax, however, is whether certain forms of consumption should be singled out for particularly high levels of taxation.
 One argument for specific taxes is that consuming certain products has an adverse impact on bystanders. Economists call these effects negative externalities.
 Taxes on gasoline can be justified along these lines. Whenever you go out for a drive, you are to some degree committing an antisocial act. You make the roads more congested, increasing the commuting time of your neighbors. You increase the likelihood that other drivers will end up in accidents. And the gasoline you burn adds to pollution, including the greenhouse gases thought to cause global climate change. 
 Many economists advocate gasoline taxes so that drivers will internalize these negative externalities. That is, by raising the price of gasoline, a tax would induce consumers to take into account the harm they cause after making their purchases. One prominent study added up all the externalities associated with driving and concluded that the optimal gasoline tax is over $2 a gallon, about five times the current level (combining the federal and a typical state's levies) and about the tax rate in many European countries.
 Applying that logic to other consumer goods, however, is not as straightforward. Consider cigarettes. They are among the economy's most heavily taxed products, as governments try to discourage people from smoking. Yet the case for such a policy cannot rely on a conventional externality argument. 
 When a person sits at home and smokes two packs a day, the main adverse impact is on his or her own health. And even if second-hand smoke is a concern, that problem is most naturally addressed within the household, not at the state or federal level.
 Sometimes, advocates of ''sin'' taxes contend that consumers of certain products impose adverse budgetary externalities on the rest of us -- that if the consumption induces, say, smoking- or obesity-related illness, it raises health care costs, which we all pay for through higher taxes or insurance premiums.
 Yet this argument has a flip side: If consumers of these products die earlier, they will also collect less in pension payments, including Social Security. Economists have run the numbers for smoking and often find that these savings may more than offset the budgetary costs. In other words, smokers have little net financial impact on the rest of us.
 It may seem grisly to consider the budgetary savings of an early death as a ''benefit'' to society. But when analyzing policy, economists are nothing if not cold-blooded. If one uses budgetary costs to justify taxing particular consumption goods, the accounting needs to be honest and complete. 
 There is, however, an altogether different argument for these taxes: that when someone consumes such goods, he does impose a negative externality -- on the future version of himself. In other words, the person today enjoys the consumption, but the person tomorrow and every day after pays the price of increased risk of illness.
 This raises an intriguing question: To what extent should we view the future versions of ourselves as different people from ourselves today?
 To be sure, most parents have no trouble restricting a child's decisions on the grounds that doing so is in the young person's best interest. Few teenagers are farsighted enough to fully incorporate the interests of their future selves when making decisions. As parents, we hope that someday our grown-up children will be grateful for our current restrictions on their behavior.
 But people do not suddenly mature at the age of 18, when society deems us ''adults.'' There is always an adolescent lurking inside us, feeling the pull of instant gratification and too easily ignoring the long-run effects of our decisions. Taxes on items with short-run benefits and long-run costs tell our current selves to take into account the welfare of our future selves.
 IF this is indeed the best argument for ''sin'' taxes, as I believe it is, we are led to vexing questions of political philosophy: To what extent should we use the power of the state to protect us from ourselves? If we go down that route, where do we stop?
 Taxing soda may encourage better nutrition and benefit our future selves. But so could taxing candy, ice cream and fried foods. Subsidizing broccoli, gym memberships and dental floss comes next. Taxing mindless television shows and subsidizing serious literature cannot be far behind.
 Even as adults, we sometimes wish for parents to be looking over our shoulders and guiding us to the right decisions. The question is, do you trust the government enough to appoint it your guardian?

HEADLINE: Obama and the Chaos Perception

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is that rare politician who is also a gifted writer, and he understands the power of a good metaphor. So you had to believe, on some level at least, that the president could appreciate the poetic significance of that cloud of oil, ubiquitous on cable television all last week, spewing endlessly from a 5,000-foot-deep puncture in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Obama's administration, too, had been breached, and the accumulating cloud threatened to obscure its considerable achievements -- particularly the comprehensive reforms of health care and federal education spending -- as the president heads toward the halfway point in his term. 
 The man-made catastrophe in the gulf does not yet constitute an existential threat to Mr. Obama's presidency. (There's not much Mr. Obama can do about it at this point, anyway, short of slapping on a scuba suit and sticking his hand in the pipe until the relief well is completed.) But then, it is never really one crisis that diminishes a president as much as a succession of crises, avoidable or not. And this might be the real danger for Mr. Obama's administration -- not that the spill itself remains unmanageable, but that it comes to represent a pattern in the public mind, a sense that too many dangers at once (mines and foreign economies collapsing, possible war on the Korean peninsula) seem to be gushing beyond his reach.
 As much as we talk about ideology and competence, our judgment of presidents doesn't hinge on either of these things in isolation. What matters is the perception -- or perhaps the illusion -- that one is shaping events, rather than being shaped by them. The modern presidency, like the old ''Get Smart'' series, is about chaos versus control.
 Take, for instance, the cautionary tale of Jimmy Carter, whose presidency, it is often said, was felled by inflation, or maybe Iranian hostage-takers or gas shortages, depending on who is doing the eulogizing. In fact, inflation was probably at the core of Carter's troubles. Those other misfortunes contributed, too.
 But as the historian Kevin Mattson made clear in his recent book about the Carter presidency, ''What the Heck Are You Up To, Mr. President?'' you also have to factor in the meltdown at Three Mile Island, Soviet tanks in Afghanistan and the vivid specter of Skylab hurtling day after day toward a stationary and helpless Earth -- in other words, an air of general chaos and a belief that a president lauded for his humility had too little control over larger forces in the universe. This explains, too, the appeal of Ronald Reagan, whose cinematic persona suggested that he would have lassoed the Skylab satellite and hurled it back into space.
 Similarly, George W. Bush was undone, during his second term, not only by a sluggish economy or the failure to find biological weapons in Iraq, but also by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the cascade of unsettling headlines about bird flu and failing banks, suicide bombers and Korean missiles. This stood in contrast to his predecessor, Bill Clinton, who could not have done more to sink his own presidency had he tried, but who left office with strong approval ratings nonetheless -- in part because of a surging economy, but also because he seemed at his most commanding when unpredictable crises (the Columbine High School shooting and the Oklahoma City bombing come to mind) threatened to undermine our collective sense of order.
 Political chaos theory, if you want to call it that, has always been integral to the American presidency. It's what Abraham Lincoln understood when, days after taking office, he sought to take charge of events at Fort Sumter, rather than heed the advice of those who thought he should simply let them play out. Franklin Roosevelt demonstrated the same essential insight in confronting the Great Depression -- that people needed to know you would impose order, even if not every attempt at doing so worked. (Roosevelt and his intrepid New Dealers would probably be thinking about ways to drain the Gulf of Mexico right about now.)
 And yet a president's ability to confront chaos seems more central to the office now than it was, say, a half-century ago, when almost no one blamed Dwight Eisenhower for allowing quiz show scandals or Mississippi tornadoes to go unchecked. In part, this is probably a function of our having lost so much faith in the ability of government generally. There is, after all, a short distance between believing that government doesn't solve our problems to believing that government actually causes them, and a lot of Americans in the last few decades have made the leap. If tar balls are turning up along the Gulf Coast, then some bureaucrat somewhere must be to blame -- and why not the bureaucrat-in-chief?
 On a deeper level, though, we may be reacting to our own lack of control as workers, providers and parents. For about 40 years, since the onset of industrial decline, Americans have been trying to negotiate an increasingly unstable economic and cultural landscape, the effects of which are clear in any community where factories or farms (or often both) have withered away -- substance abuse, failing schools, higher rates of crime and divorce. The chaos is all around us, and what we ask of a president, increasingly, is to somehow use the instruments of government to rein it in.
 Mr. Obama seems to find it particularly hard to adjust to this role, perhaps because he has always defined himself as an outsider to Washington and its governing apparatus -- someone who would reform government, but not necessarily master its inner workings. This, after all, was the subtext of his entire debate with Hillary Rodham Clinton during the Democratic primaries in 2008; she was the insider who could competently work all the pulleys and levers of government, and he was the outsider looking to cast aside what he later called the ''childish things'' that dominated debate in Washington.
 The problem here for Mr. Obama is that, almost 18 months after assuming office, he still seems to regard himself as something of an intellectual critic of government, when, in fact, what Americans expect from him now is markedly different. The transition is long behind us, which means the president embodies the government he once assailed and is held accountable, fairly or not, for its failures.
 The disconnect was on vivid display during Mr. Obama's news conference late last month, when, despite professing full responsibility for his administration's response to the leak, he referred several times to what the ''federal government'' was doing, as if he himself were merely a disappointed spectator like the rest of us. He railed coolly against the ''cozy and sometimes corrupt relationship'' between oil companies and the government, despite the fact that his administration had been governing for more than a year. And he seemed unbothered admitting to reporters that he didn't know whether his own director of the Minerals Management Service had been fired or resigned.
 By the time the president spoke again at the White House and then revisited the gulf on Friday, he seemed genuinely enraged at BP. The writer in him, perhaps, sensed that the oil from a snapped-off pipe on the ocean floor might yet come to signify something deeper about his administration. But chaos-weary Americans no longer needed him to share their outrage at the leak. They needed him to finally shut it off.

HEADLINE: Underestimating Risk

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In retrospect, the pattern seems clear. Years before the Deepwater Horizon rig blew, BP was developing a reputation as an oil company that took safety risks to save money. An explosion at a Texas refinery killed 15 workers in 2005, and federal regulators and a panel led by James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, said that cost cutting was partly to blame. The next year, a corroded pipeline in Alaska poured oil into Prudhoe Bay. None other than Joe Barton, a Republican congressman from Texas and a global-warming skeptic, upbraided BP managers for their ''seeming indifference to safety and environmental issues.''
 Much of this indifference stemmed from an obsession with profits, come what may. But there also appears to have been another factor, one more universally human, at work. The people running BP did a dreadful job of estimating the true chances of events that seemed unlikely -- and may even have been unlikely -- but that would bring enormous costs. 
 Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to consider what BP executives must be thinking today. Surely, given the expense of the clean-up and the hit to BP's reputation, the executives wish they could go back and spend the extra money to make Deepwater Horizon safer. That they did not suggests that they figured the rig would be fine as it was.
 For all the criticism BP executives may deserve, they are far from the only people to struggle with such low-probability, high-cost events. Nearly everyone does. ''These are precisely the kinds of events that are hard for us as humans to get our hands around and react to rationally,'' Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard, says. We make two basic -- and opposite -- types of mistakes. When an event is difficult to imagine, we tend to underestimate its likelihood. This is the proverbial black swan. Most of the people running Deepwater Horizon probably never had a rig explode on them. So they assumed it would not happen, at least not to them.
 Similarly, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspanliked to argue, not so long ago, that the national real estate market was not in a bubble because it had never been in one before. Wall Street traders took the same view and built mathematical models that did not allow for the possibility that house prices would decline. And many home buyers signed up for unaffordable mortgages, believing they could refinance or sell the house once its price rose. That's what house prices did, it seemed.
 On the other hand, when an unlikely event is all too easy to imagine, we often go in the opposite direction and overestimate the odds. After the 9/11 attacks, Americans canceled plane trips and took to the road. There were no terrorist attacks in this country in 2002, yet the additional driving apparently led to an increase in traffic fatalities.
 When the stakes are high enough, it falls to government to help its citizens avoid these entirely human errors. The market, left to its own devices, often cannot do so. Yet in the case of Deepwater Horizon, government policy actually went the other way. It encouraged BP to underestimate the odds of a catastrophe.
 In a little-noticed provision in a 1990 law passed after the Exxon Valdez spill, Congress capped a spiller's liability over and above cleanup costs at $75 million for a rig spill. Even if the economic damages -- to tourism, fishing and the like -- stretch into the billions, the responsible party is on the hook for only $75 million. (In this instance, BP has agreed to waive the cap for claims it deems legitimate.) Michael Greenstone, an M.I.T. economist who runs the Hamilton Project in Washington, says the law fundamentally distorts a company's decision making. Without the cap, executives would have to weigh the possible revenue from a well against the cost of drilling there and the risk of damage. With the cap, they can largely ignore the potential damage beyond cleanup costs. So they end up drilling wells even in places where the damage can be horrific, like close to a shoreline. To put it another way, human frailty helped BP's executives underestimate the chance of a low-probability, high-cost event. Federal law helped them underestimate the costs.
 In the wake of Deepwater Horizon, Congress and the Obama administration will no doubt be tempted to pass laws meant to reduce the risks of another deep-water disaster. Certainly there are some sensible steps they can take, like lifting the liability cap and freeing regulators from the sway of industry. But it would be foolish to think that the only risks we are still underestimating are the ones that have suddenly become salient.
 The big financial risk is no longer a housing bubble. Instead, it may be the huge deficits that the growth of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will cause in coming years -- and the possibility that lenders will eventually become nervous about extending credit to Washington. True, some economists and policy makers insist the country should not get worked up about this possibility, because lenders have never soured on the United States government before and show no signs of doing so now. But isn't that reminiscent of the old Bernanke-Greenspan tune about the housing market?
 Then, of course, there are the greenhouse gases that oil wells (among other things) send into the atmosphere even when the wells function properly. Scientists say the buildup of these gases is already likely to warm the planet by at least three degrees over the next century and cause droughts, storms and more ice-cap melting. The researchers' estimates have risen recently, too, and it is also possible the planet could get around 12 degrees hotter. That kind of warming could flood major cities and cause parts of Antarctica to collapse.
 Nothing like that has ever happened before. Even imagining it is difficult. It is much easier to hope that the odds of such an outcome are vanishingly small. In fact, it's only natural to have this hope. But that doesn't make it wise.

HEADLINE: The Legal but Largely Unregulated World of Pot Merchants Thrives

BYLINE: By KATE McLEAN. 
kmclean@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
In his nondescript San Francisco flat, Kevin Reed operates a sleek, efficient marijuana delivery service.
 Five drivers deliver the product -- glistening green buds in white paper bags -- to neighborhoods throughout the city. Two operators work the phones. Flat-screen TVs display security feeds of the surrounding neighborhood.
Mr. Reed, who had a clean-shaven head and wore a pinstriped shirt, calls his business the Green Cross. It is the only pot delivery service in San Francisco with a city permit, for which Mr. Reed paid $15,000.
 Getting the permit was a laborious, three-month process, and this is why Mr. Reed is watching the proliferation of rival pot delivery services -- none licensed -- with dismay. 
 ''I have to compete with the guy who has 2,000 plants in a field behind his house,'' Mr. Reed said in a lilting Alabama accent as he smoked a joint. ''And is selling his pot for $200 an ounce in the newspaper, delivery fee included. And not paying Uncle Sam a dime.''
 In the new marijuana economy, the guy with the pot field behind his house is increasingly at odds with a growing class of Bay Area cannabis merchants. 
 A patchwork of local, state and federal laws -- some in direct contradiction to one another -- has led to a freewheeling marketplace for Bay Area pot, some of the world's finest. With a state ballot measure to legalize the drug set for November, the economic activity has reached a fever pitch, drawing in local politicians, trade unionists, doctors and a variety of entrepreneurs.
 Some of the activity is still blatantly illegal. In Oakland, a house where growers surreptitiously used eight car batteries to cultivate 300 pot plants recently burst into flames. And, in a practice that growers now say is widespread, pesticides not meant for consumable crops are being sold in hydroponic ''grow'' shops throughout the region, often in unlabeled vials. 
 Other activities occupy a more informal gray area. Posts on Web sites like budtrader.com propose to exchange marijuana for Nintendo systems and offer warnings about ''rippers'' who cheat or steal from suppliers.
 With so much cash flying around, these transactions also attract crime. Last week, a San Francisco State student who ran an unlicensed delivery service out of his apartment took an order over the Internet. When he went to deliver a pound of marijuana to Richmond after midnight, the student was robbed of the pot and $1,000. 
 Still other activities are perfectly legal. The 29 licensed medical marijuana stores, or dispensaries, in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley are prohibited from turning a profit, but many are thriving. Harborside Health Center in Oakland is the largest medical marijuana store in the world -- it shares 52,000 registered members with a sister location in San Jose. Harborside puts these earnings into free programs -- like yoga classes and cannabis for low-income members -- and makes charitable contributions.
 ''Some people think that our movement is being hijacked into big business,'' said Jeff Jones, a proponent of the legalization initiative and a longtime medical marijuana activist. ''I think we are just maturing.''
 It has been 13 years since voters passed Proposition 215, which laid out narrow rules for patients with a doctor's prescription to grow and consume marijuana. More state rules followed, and local governments have added their own regulations.
 Municipal governments decide how many dispensaries can operate within the city limits -- Oakland allows four, Berkeley three, while San Francisco sets no cap. Some city and county governments limited how much medical marijuana can be legally grown by individuals and dispensaries.
 Marijuana remains a controlled substance -- and illegal -- under federal law. But most local authorities take a laissez-faire approach to marijuana businesses that would appear to be only loosely connected to medical treatment. 
 But legal ambiguities aside, pot is rapidly evolving into a legitimate business in the Bay Area.
 Last week, Rebecca Kaplan, a member of the Oakland City Council, appeared at a news conference of union leaders to announce that pot industry workers -- including bud tenders-- would become members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 5. It was a move that dispensary operators and legalization proponents applauded as bringing new legitimacy to their industry.
 ''This is a good day for Oakland,'' Ms. Kaplan told reporters. ''Having the workers in a union adds another check and balance as this movement grows.'' 
 Ms. Kaplan is also working on a proposal with Councilman Larry Reid to regulate marijuana production by licensing about four indoor pot farms in the industrial areas of Oakland. The city already limits indoor residential medical marijuana growing to 72 plants for individuals and 6 mature plants plus 12 immature ones per patient for dispensaries. 
 The Council will consider the new plan in July, and if it passes, the AgraMed company will be poised to apply. The company proposes to build a 100,000-square-foot medical marijuana megafarm beside Interstate 880 near Oakland International Airport that, according to projections, could generate 58 pounds of pot a day and $59 million a year in revenue.
 ''I think the City of Oakland has shown a lot of courage in managing cannabis from a common sense standpoint,'' said Jeff Wilcox, president of AgraMed and a member of the steering committee of the initiative to legalize marijuana. ''They have rationally looked at it and found a way to develop it into a real industry that serves individuals, that serves the community.''
 Mr. Wilcox is hoping to bring a degree of corporate structure to the medical marijuana industry. In March, he approached the city with an economic study that proposed a 3 percent ''production tax'' on AgraMed, which he said could generate $1.8 million a year for the city. AgraMed would also create 371 jobs, many of them unionized, according to the study.
 Mr. Wilcox estimated that AgraMed would cost $20 million to develop -- a risk he said he was willing to take even though the company would be technically illegal under federal law, and facility operators would be subject to prosecution.
 Mr. Wilcox's vision can be seen at his 7.4 acre complex of low buildings. Although he said construction would not begin until the Council signed off and his permit was granted, Pacific Gas and Electric recently increased the power supply to one of his buildings by about 2,000 amps. Martin Kaufman, Mr. Wilcox's associate, estimates that the facility will require 600,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month to power the grow lights needed for 30,000 plants, which can be harvested six times a year. 
 Because marijuana is illegal, many growers are reluctant to open their operations to scrutiny. Currently, there are no local, state or federal agencies to provide that oversight. In this regulatory vacuum, private businesses -- essentially self-deputized regulators -- have emerged to do things like certify that marijuana is organic and test the product for contaminants. 
 The issue of testing is particularly sensitive because growers are turning to an array of growth-enhancement products and illegal pesticides to protect their lucrative crops. 
 ''Medical cannabis has had to be produced and procured in a not-quite-above-board way,'' Councilwoman Kaplan said. ''I think we're really at a turning point that we can handle this in a regulated and permitted way.'' 
 Many Bay Area dispensaries participate in civic projects and organizations like the Chamber of Commerce. And as the November balloting get nearer, advocates of legalization are gathering new and powerful allies. 
 Some medical marijuana activists worry that there is now a divide between the well-connected dispensaries and smaller, more informal groups of growers and consumers who for years have been part of the medical marijuana scene.
 ''To me, it's a money movement now,'' said Chris Smith, who is part of 40 Acres Medical Marijuana Collective, an underground medical marijuana group in Berkeley. ''Most of them probably got a little political pull or a little political networking; they got lawyers; they got money for lawyers; they jump right in to position.''
 40 Acres Collective consists of about 100 growers and users who gather to share pot, money and plants.
 Mr. Smith said the collective would like to be able to get a city permit and become a licensed dispensary. But the city has capped the number of pot clubs at three, and all the spots are taken. Mr. Smith said he worried that 40 Acres Collective might ultimately be shut out. 
 As he showed off several rooms filled with marijuana plants beginning to flower, the collective's members gathered in another room to celebrate the 76th birthday of Mr. Smith's father, Scott Smith Jr., a former Black Panther who taught his son to garden. 
 The celebration was to be followed by an event called ''the weed Olympics,'' in which the participants try to out-smoke one another. 
 ''Medical marijuana is not really a business, you know?'' said the younger Mr. Smith, as people around him laid out pot cookies, tiny pot-laced pineapple upside-down cakes and decorative pot plants for the party. ''It's a community-based organization. There is revenues being exchanged, transactions happening, but that's not really what it's about.''

HEADLINE: Daley Charity Gets More From City

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS; Katie Fretland contributed to this report.

 BODY:
Most city workers are being forced to take almost five weeks off without pay because of what Mayor Richard M. Daley has called the worst financial crisis in decades. At this time of record deficits, however, the city is giving more than ever to After School Matters, the charity led by Mayor Daley's wife. 
 The nonprofit group, founded by Maggie Daley and still led by her, was paid almost $15 million by the city in 2009, far more than the previous year.
Asked Friday about the increase, Mayor Daley defended the group and its after-school youth programs. ''It's a charity for teenagers in Chicago. Are you questioning my wife now?''
 The mayor's press secretary, Jacquelyn Heard, later added that the city was preserving or increasing budgeted amounts for many social service efforts, ''not just Maggie Daley's program.'' 
 City officials said much of the increase was due to the fact that they had been a year behind in their payments to the group under the main contract between After School Matters and the city. In 2009, the city paid what was owed the group for both 2008 and 2009.
 Still, even with the city's accounting, After School Matters received more than $10 million last year for work it did in 2009 -- almost twice as much as it received from the city in 2005. The increase over the past five years is due also to three new contracts that After School Matters signed with the city since 2007. The city funnels federal stimulus money to the group under two of those contracts. Since August, the city has paid almost $1 million in federal stimulus money to the group, primarily to help low-income youths get job skills. 
 City officials are preparing to award a new $6.5-million-a-year contract to After School Matters, according to the city's Web site. This contract would maintain financing for the group's core programs at their current level. 
 Mrs. Daley, who has been fighting cancer for almost eight years, founded After School Matters in 2000. The group has received a total of more than $46 million from City Hall in the last five and a half years, city records show. 
 After School Matters also takes in millions of dollars a year in private donations. The Chicago Sun-Times reported in 2008 that many of those contributions come from city contractors.
 ''These are wonderful programs in the city to take teenagers away from gangs and drugs,'' Mayor Daley said, adding that after-school programs are for a lot of poor youths. 
 ''They're not wealthy kids,'' he said. ''Poor kids in the city. It's one of the best programs in the country.''

HEADLINE: Crime and Suspicion Remain Where Burge Once Held Sway

BYLINE: By DON TERRY and KATIE FRETLAND

 BODY:
For Diane Latiker, a middle-aged mother of eight who works with troubled youth in the tough Roseland neighborhood on the Far South Side, the mention of Jon Burge makes her think of ''the boogeyman.'' 
 ''The name,'' she said, ''makes most grown folks around here gasp.''
For Nick Jones, 17, who sits on the curbs of Chatham, a few miles north, and tries to make a few bucks pounding out beats on a plastic bucket, the name means nothing. He has never heard of Mr. Burge, the former Chicago police commander now on trial in Federal District Court, charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for allegedly lying about torturing suspects. 
 Mr. Jones is worried about today's police officers. ''You can't do nothing positive around here without them messing with you,'' he said. ''They harass us every day.'' 
 In more than two dozen interviews in the sprawling Area 2 police district that includes Roseland and Chatham -- the territory where Mr. Burge once oversaw a team of detectives, some of whom were accused by suspects of engaging in a regime of torture at area headquarters -- Mr. Burge's name elicited a mix of responses, from anger to indifference to ''Jon who?'' 
 Seventeen years after Mr. Burge was fired by the police board, there are lingering suspicions between the area's residents and the police. Many residents fear that a legacy of mistrust is undermining efforts to stop the violent crime that still plagues the area. 
 When it comes to Jon Burge, the generation gap is alive and well. The older the person is, the fresher the memories are of the man and his command. 
 ''The community has not reacted yet as I think it will as the trial goes on,'' said Zakiyyah S. Muhammad, 64, who sat through several sessions of trial testimony at the Dirksen Federal Building. ''It's not a hot, hot issue like it was. I think the media might be trying to protect Burge a little bit, because you don't hear as much as you should hear.'' 
 The case remains a hot issue for Antonio Berry, 39. ''I can't imagine what those people went through,'' Mr. Berry said. ''It's unspeakable.'' 
 Ms. Latiker, who runs a youth center from the living room of her house on the edge of Roseland, said she recently talked to a 21-year-old man about Mr. Burge's trial. She tried to explain to him why the decades-long case still mattered, and why the sickly, 62-year-old former police commander should face justice. 
 But the man -- no stranger to the back of a police car -- said he did not understand why people like Ms. Latiker were making such a fuss about Mr. Burge, even if he did torture suspects more than 30 years ago and then lied about it under oath. 
 ''Wasn't he just trying to get the thugs off the street?'' the man said. ''With all this killing going on, what's wrong with that?'' 
 Ms. Latiker said she was shocked at the man's attitude. ''I said to him, 'You're a thug. Would you like the police to abuse you?' '' 
 The man shrugged and fell silent, she said. 
 ''These kids today have seen and experienced so much bad they're immune to it,'' Ms. Latiker said. ''That's why they need to see that no one is above the law, not even the police.'' 
 Like most of the adults interviewed, Thomas Mitchell, 39, an unemployed construction worker who was waiting for a bus on 87th Street, said he had been following the Burge case for years. ''You can't just turn a blind eye to stuff like that,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''It shouldn't have taken this long to bring him to justice.'' 
 The Burge trial, which begins its third week on Monday, is not the justice Mr. Mitchell and many others had hoped for. Mr. Burge is not being tried for torturing suspects: The statute of limitations ran out years ago without any torture-related criminal charges brought against him. 
 Instead, he is being tried on charges of lying about the torture in 2003 in a civil lawsuit filed by a former death row inmate. Mr. Burge has denied the accusations of torture. ''I know that all police aren't bad,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''The ones that are crooked put a bad light on the ones who are trying to protect the community.'' 
 About 17 miles north of Area 2, in the other America that is downtown Chicago, civil rights advocates, lawyers, teachers, mothers of inmates and at least one elected official have packed Courtroom 1925 since testimony in the Burge trial began. Sometimes the size of the crowd has forced officials to open another courtroom two floors below where an audio feed of the proceedings is piped in. 
 Alderman Ed Smith (28th Ward) said recently that Mr. Burge was responsible for putting a lot of innocent people on death row. ''The Burge case should be significant to everybody in Chicago,'' Mr. Smith said. ''And it should be significant to everybody in the country.'' 
 But when asked about the case, Raheem Taylor, 35, who was standing in front of his printing shop in the 11300 block of South Michigan Avenue, replied, ''Who's Jon Burge?'' 
 A few moments later, with a little prodding, Mr. Taylor recognized the name. 
 ''I haven't been following the case,'' he said. ''The big story around here has been the serial killer, the Roseland rapist.'' 
 A 24-year-old man was arrested May 27 and charged with killing three women in Roseland and dumping their bodies in abandoned buildings. 
 Mr. Taylor pointed across the street to a boarded-up Harold's Chicken restaurant, its sign still promising Finger Lickin' Fried Chicken. ''They found one of the murdered women in that building over there,'' he said. 
 Mr. Taylor was joined by a man who would give his name only as Gerald. As they talked, a police officer pulled up and said, ''You guys are going to have to find something else to do.'' 
 When the officer drove off, Mr. Taylor said: ''That happens all the time, telling us to move along. I'm a grown man, standing in front of my own business.'' 
 Down the street at Legends barber shop, Macoi Long, a 30-year-old barber, said Mr. Burge ''is dead, right?'' 
 ''No,'' a friend said, laughing. ''He's in court. 
 ''Oh, yeah, now I remember,'' Mr. Long said. ''He's on trial downtown. Now he has to stand tall for what he done like the rest of us.'' 
 Mr. Long said he had been hearing about the alleged torture crimes of Mr. Burge and his men for years, ''whipping people, torturing people, sending guys to death row for something they didn't do.'' 
 ''Didn't that happen a long time ago?'' asked a teenager waiting for a haircut. 
 ''True, but he still deserves some tick,'' Mr. Long said, using a slang expression for jail time. 
 A few miles north, Iris Gilbert, 55, was leaving a beauty college in the Gresham neighborhood with curlers in her hair. ''We need our police now because it's so violent,'' she said. 
 But, Ms. Gilbert added, ''you can't trust them because of people like Burge.
 ''When you can't trust the police,'' she said, ''you take the law into your own hands. In the African-American community, they look at the police as another gang.'' 
 That sentiment was shared by a group of teenagers and young adults who work for Ms. Latiker at her youth center, Kids Off the Block. 
 As the young people talked about police harassment and never meeting ''a good cop,'' Ms. Latiker held up her hand.
 ''Now wait a minute,'' she said. ''We don't want to group all the police in the same boat. We don't want to do to them what they do to you all. We don't want to stereotype them.'' 
 ''You're right,'' one of the teenagers said. ''We're better than that.''

 BODY:
On a cloudless spring afternoon,Carly Fiorina strode onto an outdoor stage in Pleasanton, Calif., with the happy, hungry expression of someone not just confident of an enthusiastic reception but counting on one. She surveyed a riot of signs artful and artless -- ''Give us liberty, not debt,'' ''Pelosi's gavel is the new health care colonoscopy'' -- and beamed. For the stemwinder on bloated government that she was about to deliver, there was probably no better audience than these thousands of angry rebels, spread across acres of fairgrounds near San Jose for a special Tea Party rally. And there was definitely no better date than this one: April 15. Tax day.
 Fiorina rattled off a slew of stratospheric numbers about the national debt, then example upon example of what she deemed federal overreach, proclaiming: ''The federal government does not create the American dream, although the federal government can surely destroy the American dream.'' The crowd applauded. 
 ''You know,'' she went on, her voice dropping, as if weighed down by emotion, ''I have lived the American dream.'' That was her segue into a condensed version of her professional biography: a liberal-arts degree from Stanford University that didn't qualify her for anything in particular; an abandoned stab at law school; secretarial work; and then, thanks to a late-blooming focus and a lot of ferocious effort, a dizzying climb up the corporate ladder, culminating in more than five years as the chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, by far the most prominent American company that a woman had -- or, to this day, has -- ever run. Fiorina, in a phrase, made history.
 And now she is trying to make a political career out of that, running for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat held for nearly 18 years in California by Barbara Boxer, a liberal Democrat who has long been at the top of the Republican hit list. Not just to the Tea Party but to all the Republicans and independents who will vote in the June 8 primary, Fiorina presents herself as a businesswoman, not a bureaucrat, capable of bringing private-sector savvy to a beleaguered economy. 
 The crowd in Pleasanton loved her, and as she left the stage, she was buoyant. Then she took a few questions from local reporters on hand. One asked about a federal probe into whether bribes greased Hewlett-Packard's access to the Russian market when she ran the company. In a tight, brittle voice, Fiorina said she knew nothing about that.
 Then came a question about H.P. and Iran. And then anotherquestion about H.P. and Russia. Fiorina stated emphatically that H.P. had never, at her direction, acted unlawfully, but her response didn't stop there. She chided the reporters, fuming that it would be nice ''if you would report on the big issues that matter.
 ''You have a huge story happening behind you,'' she snapped, referring to the rally and the voter anxiety it signaled. ''That's what you ought to be reporting on.'' Her smile was gone. And a second later -- poof! -- so was she, in a surrender of cool fascinating for several reasons. It served as both a reminder of how new she is to the political arena and a suggestion, echoed by the occasionally odd tone of her campaign, that she is still finding her way. And the trigger of her ire spoke volumes about why she got into the race and what she may hope, even need, to get out of it.
 Back in 1999, when Cara Carleton S. Fiorina took the helm of H.P., all the exhilarating talk was of trails blazed and ceilings shattered. That ended fast. She was soon pilloried for sweeping work-force cuts, unmet earnings projections and tumbling stock prices; disparaged by the Hewlett and Packard families, who staged a narrowly defeated proxy battle against her merger of H.P. with Compaq; and fired in February 2005, the climax of an exhaustively chronicled corporate melodrama. She still has her place in business history, but it is an entry with an asterisk. While she rose higher than any woman before her, she also fell harder and louder, and what she wanted to regard as a triumph was forever being turned into a taunt, with H.P. thrown at her -- as it was after the Pleasanton rally -- in ways meant to put her on the defensive.
 ''It's heartbreaking,'' says Deborah Bowker, a close friend who lived through the experience with Fiorina and now works as her chief of staff. Fiorina has seemingly had a hard time shaking it off: she tends to bring up H.P. at odd moments, apropos of nothing. I got the sense that her time there is always playing on a tape loop in her mind, like the high-school championship game that didn't turn out quite the way everyone on the team dreamed it would.
 For Fiorina, who is 55, a Senate seat would be more than a fresh challenge. It would be a new loop, a more upbeat ending, even a validation of her business know-how, because she would be winning election at a time when the economy is issue No. 1, in a state with an unemployment rate above 12 percent.
 ''Now, in politics, she can prove she was right all along,'' says Tom Perkins, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who was on the H.P. board when Fiorina led the company and who pushed for her ouster. He says that it was necessary at the time, but that on balance and in retrospect, she deserves credit for revivifying a logy leviathan. ''If she can go into a similar situation in Washington and bring order and make progress,'' he says, ''it's another opportunity for her to prove that she's got what it takes.''
 In a twist that makes California an especially intriguing story during this election cycle, Fiorina isn't the only well-known wealthy businesswoman from Silicon Valley running for statewide office. The favorite for the Republican nomination to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor is Meg Whitman, the former C.E.O. of eBay. Whitman and Fiorina make essentially the same promise: to do in government what they sought to do in business, which is create wealth. And they wear the same mantle: that of the political outsider with the kind of practical, no-nonsense perspective needed to root out waste, balance budgets and cut through government sclerosis.
 Fiorina is no shoo-in for the nomination. Until mid-May, polls showed her slightly behind Tom Campbell, a former California congressman, who is running to her left: he supports abortion rights and gay marriage and hasn't made an unequivocal pledge against new taxes. But as the contest draws to a close, she is using her more formidable war chest -- at least $5.5 million of it her own money -- to outspend him, and two polls in late May showed her far ahead. A third contender, Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, brands himself as the one true conservative in the race, but primary voters may make their decision based less on ideology than on which candidate they feel matches up best against Boxer, deemed to be more vulnerable than ever right now. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, along with John McCain and a roll call of other prominent Republican senators, are backing Fiorina, who has widespread name recognition, a Rolodex of affluent friends (and potential donors) and polish at the microphone. Campbell has already lost one Senate race, against Dianne Feinstein in 2000, and often speaks like the brainy law professor he is. DeVore would be hard-pressed to win over moderates, though that attribute has only endeared him to Tea Party groups, who have ebulliently (and effectively) bucked the establishment in their embrace of Republican candidates like Marco Rubio in Florida and Rand Paul in Kentucky. Like Rubio and Paul, DeVore has been endorsed by Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, the eager spoiler of his Washington colleagues' wishes.
 Fiorina entered the race without voters in California or Republicans in Washington knowing all that much about her politics, and the widespread assumption was that she was a moderate. After all, as a campaign surrogate for John McCain in 2008, she was used to woo independents and women who tended to vote Democratic, and she lambasted health insurers who covered Viagra but not birth control, creating an embarrassment for McCain, who voted against legislation that would have changed that. She also told voters -- erroneously -- that McCain had never called for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. 
 But during this campaign, she has assiduously courted the right, calling for the repeal of health care reform, taking a pledge to oppose new taxes of any kind and pointing to recent endorsements by Sarah Palin and by former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a longtime darling of abortion opponents. Palin reminded California voters that beating Boxer was goal No. 1 and told them that Fiorina would give them the best chance ''of putting an end to the Pelosi-Reid big-government agenda.''
 As the campaign has progressed, Fiorina has sounded ever more conservative. Months ago, she said she probably would have voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor's appointment to the Supreme Court; in more recent comments about Elena Kagan, she has come across as doubtful and wary. When the passage of the Arizona immigration law first made headlines, she deflected questions about it, trying to steer the conversation to what she said was the Obama administration's failure to patrol the border. It was a prudent dodge, given the high percentage of Hispanic voters in California. But as the days went by and the questions kept coming, she said that she supported what Arizona had done, though she wasn't recommending a similar measure in California.
 And during a Republican debate in Los Angeles on May 6, when the three candidates were asked if people on the no-fly list should be allowed to purchase a gun, only Campbell said no. Along with DeVore, Fiorina gave an instant, unequivocal yes.
 ''My goodness,'' Campbell sputtered, seeming genuinely taken aback.
 ''That's why Tom Campbell has kind of a poor rating from the National Rifle Association right there,'' Fiorina shot back. She told reporters after the debate that the no-fly list is overpopulated with individuals who are on it because of bureaucratic or clerical blunders. Their rights shouldn't be abridged because of that, she said.
 She has won endorsements from both the National Right to Life Committee and the California Pro Life Council, who see her as a trustworthy opponent of abortion, even though she says she would have no litmus test for a Supreme Court justice and believes abortion should be permitted in cases of incest, rape and danger to a mother's life. She is opposed to publicly financed abortions of any kind.
 Many of these positions could hinder her in the general election, her stance on abortion being a prime example. The last time a pro-life candidate won a majority of the votes in an election for president, senator or governor in California was in the 1988 presidential race, when George H. W. Bush outpolled Michael Dukakis. But that contest was part of a national landslide, and Bush's commitment to the pro-life cause was widely considered to be a shaky one.
 ''Barbara Boxer is good at a lot of things, but her single greatest talent is running against pro-life opponents,'' says Dan Schnur, who served as an aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and now teaches political science at the University of Southern California. ''She's run against three of them so far, and in each of those campaigns she's used this particular issue to great effect. On some things, she's shrill. On this one, she's not.''
 Fiorina, for her part, is ready with a poignant explanation for her position that goes beyond religious conviction -- she's an irregular churchgoer, not devoted to any denomination -- though she says that religion is part of it. She told me that painful years of unsuccessful efforts by her and her husband, Frank Fiorina, to add a child of their own to his two daughters from a previous marriage served as ''a reminder that life is a precious gift and not everyone is given that gift.'' In addition, she said, her husband's mother, when pregnant with him, was told that her health was in jeopardy and was encouraged to have an abortion. She chose not to, and survived. ''Frank turned out to be the joy of her life, and of my life,'' Fiorina said. ''When that's put into such vivid and personal terms, it makes you think.''
 Fiorina is deft at transforming personal experience into political revelation and at pressing her story into the service of her quest. She does this to especially rousing effect with yet another compelling dimension of this campaign: just 15 months ago, she found out she had breast cancer. She says that after surgery, radiation and months of chemotherapy, she was pronounced cancer-free; although she and her primary opponents have sniped at one another over almost everything imaginable, her health has at no point been an issue in this race.
 But in many speeches, she digresses to explain that her short hair is a vestige of the chemo. ''Having gotten through that experience,'' she went on to say onstage in Pleasanton, ''let me tell you this: a sharp-tongued senator with an invisible legislative record does not intimidate me one bit. I say: 'Bring it on. Bring it on, Barbara Boxer.' ''
 The Pleasanton speech wasn't the first, or last, time I heard her talk about intimidation and fear: what used to frighten her; what doesn't scare her; the importance of being intrepid. Fiorina seems almost obsessed with the topic, and with making clear how very dauntless she is.
 At a women's leadership banquet in San Jose just hours after the Pleasanton speech, she told her audience that she had had ''many fears in life,'' started out ''as a scared, shy child'' and learned that ''if you conquer your fears, you come out stronger and better on the other side.'' When the banquet's organizer asked her for her one best piece of advice for young businesswomen, Fiorina said: ''First, don't panic if you're a little scared. Everybody's scared at some point.''
 And during one of my interviews with her, when I pressed her to single out a favorite among the many oil paintings that her mother, an amateur artist, gave her, she picked a portrait of a transvestite whom her mother had once approached on the subway in San Francisco and invited back to her house to pose. Fiorina explained that the painting ''says a lot about my mother.'' Like what? ''That she was unafraid.''
 Fiorina's father, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor and a judge who served as a deputy attorney general in the Nixon administration and later on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. She was the middle of three children and, from the start, the family's diligent, obedient overachiever. In speeches, interviews and her best-selling 2006 memoir, ''Tough Choices,'' a chronicle principally of her business career, she says that one of the most difficult episodes of her early life was quitting law school at U.C.L.A. after one semester and having her father say, ''I'm not sure you'll ever amount to anything.'' 
 Around that time she married Todd Bartlem, a college sweetheart, and followed him to Bologna, Italy, where he did graduate work and she gave English lessons to Italian businessmen. When they subsequently moved to the Washington area, she got a graduate business degree at the University of Maryland, took a job with AT&T and threw herself into her work. For Bartlem, whom she divorced after a half-dozen years of marriage, the metaphor for that devotion was a beloved childhood piano of hers that he told me her parents sent cross-country, at great expense, and that sat unused in their Maryland home for years. ''She never sat down and played it,'' Bartlem said. ''Because at that point, her whole life and all of her passion had gone into her career.''
 As recounted in ''Tough Choices,'' she was forever turning situations that terrified her to her advantage, like a sales meeting with a bunch of arrogant men whom she disarmed by showing up with socks stuffed into her pants and crowing that her equipment matched theirs. The year after her divorce from Bartlem was final, she married Frank, a high-ranking colleague at AT&T. She went from AT&T to a spinoff, Lucent Technologies, where her spectacular success got her the cover of Fortune magazine and, less than a year later, the offer to lead H.P. That job brought her back to where her father, at this point a widower, lived. She told me, ''He was enormously proud.''
 Fiorina was hired to restore sparkle and edge to a staid institution that had lost both, and the cornerstone of her effort was the Compaq merger, designed to shake up H.P.'s culture and make the company a bigger player in the personal-computer market. But many critics deemed it unwieldy and unwise, and it didn't pay off as lucratively, in the short term, as she at times predicted it would. Her critics assailed her for that, and for pettier matters, like the expensive clothing she wore, the amount of flying in the company jet she did and the way she put her face and name front and center in advertising and promotional efforts. Not long after she was fired, there was an enormous scandal over the methods with which investigators operating under her successors tried to identify the board members and journalists behind news-media leaks that she had first set out to stop.
 H.P. today is robust, one of the largest technology companies in the world. But does the credit go to her or to the company's current C.E.O., Mark Hurd, who finished what she started, completing the Compaq merger? That question has been hashed out for years, in boardrooms and in books, with no real consensus on the job she did. Her Senate candidacy, predictably, has resurrected the debate.
 On April 4, Craig Barrett, the former chairman of the board of Intel, published an opinion piece in The San Jose Mercury News that stated that Fiorina brought ''exactly the right approach to a company that would have faced a more uncertain future otherwise.''
 On April 22, David W. Packard, the son of one of the company's founders, published a retort, using the same space in the same newspaper to note how low H.P.'s earnings per share fell on Fiorina's watch and how many employees were laid off. He said that personal glory, not good sense, had driven her ''relentless pursuit of size and market share.''
 After leaving H.P., Fiorina took high-paid speaking gigs around the world, started a charitable foundation, took seats on corporate boards and gave off glimmers of interest in government and politics. She and Frank bought a condominium in the Ritz Carlton in Georgetown and began spending more time in the Washington area, where Frank's daughter and two granddaughters, ages 13 and 5, live. Frank had another daughter who died, at age 35, last year. The obituaries don't mention the cause of death, and the Fiorinas and their friends decline to answer questions about it.
 But Fiorina's political ambitions became utterly clear only when she offered to campaign for McCain and stumped wide and far and hard for him, helping him to shore up his economic credentials. Her stumbles in the role included answering no to an interviewer's question about whether Palin could run a big corporation. Trying to do damage control, Fiorina compounded her mistake by clarifying that she didn't think McCain could run one either. McCain's aides made scarce use of her for a while thereafter.
 That didn't sour her on politics, and she seemed to be tilting heavily toward the 2010 Senate race when she found a lump under her arm in February of last year, putting the future in limbo for a while. Once all the tests were run, her prognosis for recovery was good, and she never really worried she would die, she says. But at times she doubted that she would ever get her former level of energy back. As her treatments ended and she did, the campaign commenced right away, just as Frank Fiorina always suspected it would.
 ''Carly's going to do what she wants to do,'' says Frank, who is five years older than she and took an early retirement in 1998 as her star rose, so he could advise her, travel with her and help out more at home. He conceded mixed feelings about the Senate race. The two of them could otherwise be enjoying a leisurely life, one that spared his wife the kind of withering scrutiny she has often endured. He's also not sure where or how he fits into this. He knows business, and when he accompanied his wife on business trips during the H.P. days, ''people were pleased to be able to talk to me,'' he says. 
 ''So I felt useful,'' he added. ''I worry, frankly, that I'll be involved, but I won't be able to be as involved as I was.''
 Their dynamic is tender but prickly. On a May morning in Bakersfield, as I idled with them after a campaign event, he held out his phone to show me an e-mail message he had just received from a supporter who questioned the wisdom and attractiveness of her close-cropped hair, presumed to be a matter of choice. He told me that they had received many such missives, including one that complained that she looked, he said, ''like a punk rocker.''
 ''Left-wing radical is what it said,'' Carly interjected.
 ''Thank you,'' Frank said. ''Thank you for correcting me on that.''
 She has a way of flaunting her recall, knowledge and accomplishments, quickly volunteering or clarifying information that a less assertive person might not. On that same morning, Frank happened to mention something about her fluent Italian, and I asked her how she'd come by it, given that her own ancestry is German.
 ''Well, I took Italian in college,'' she answered, adding, a beat later, ''on top of the high-school Greek and the high-school French.''
 An aide picked up a heavy bag filled with bottles of water for a two-hour drive to Fresno, the next campaign stop. 
 ''Stress is dehydrating,'' Fiorina instructed us, and then, all of a sudden, she was talking about H.P., saying, ''In the height of the proxy battle, I would insist that we take water breaks.''
 In the back seat of the black sport utility vehicle ferrying us north, she kicked off her Ferragamo shoes and curled her feet under her, accentuating how little space she actually takes up. But she is small in physical stature only -- like the Yorkshire terriers she and Frank have long raised.
 ''They're little but they're not sissies,'' she told me, explaining what she loves about them. ''They're real dogs in little bodies. They think they're really big and really tough.''
 A contest between Boxer and Fiorina would be a doozy, watched coast to coast. Fiorina has made it clear that she's a brawler, beginning with her campaign's release, on the Web, of two attack videos so menacing, even apocalyptic that they could be taken for ''Saturday Night Live'' parodies of negative advertising. One posits the fraudulence of Campbell's proclaimed fiscal conservatism by introducing ''a wolf in sheep's clothing,'' its demonic eyes glowing red and the fleecy innocents around it bolting in terror. The other, aimed at Boxer, portrays her head as a monstrous balloon -- inflated by egotism, unrestrained liberalism and hot air -- that busts through the U.S. Capitol dome and then darkens the California landscape, upon which (you will notice a theme here) innocent citizens bolt in terror. (Fiorina's first television ads, in contrast, have been tame: voters expressing anxiety and Fiorina allaying it.)
 On the stump, her manner is never more animated than when she's bashing Boxer. In many speeches she mentions an incident last year when Boxer chastised an Army brigadier general for calling her ''Ma'am,'' saying she preferred ''Senator.'' Fiorina told one group of Republicans that if she is elected, ''You may call me 'Ma'am.' You may call me 'Senator.' You may call me 'Carly.' You may call me, 'Hey, you, remember, you work for me.' ''
 In a Fiorina-Boxer matchup, Boxer would have ample ammunition of her own. Democrats have noticed a fondness Fiorina has for talking about her ''real world'' perspective, and they have noticed too that in addition to the Georgetown condo, she and her husband own a 14-room estate in the wealthy enclave of Los Altos, Calif., and dock a 70-foot yacht in Sausalito. She left H.P. with a severance package of $21 million, and in required Senate ethics committee filings, she estimated the couple's net worth at somewhere between $30 million and $120 million. 
 Boxer would no doubt draw attention to Fiorina's most conservative statements -- and to something else too. Fiorina didn't bother to vote for the 10 years she lived in New Jersey and voted in fewer than half of the last 18 elections in California in which she could participate.
 I asked Fiorina about that, and she said instantly, ''It was a mistake.'' But then, as if her lapse mattered only in the context of her current ambition, she added: ''I felt disconnected from the process. I wasn't running my life to seek political office someday. Well, I'm all in now.''
 Fiorina was up before dawn on a recent Saturday in Sacramento, where she lined up with about 30 campaign compatriots under a ''Carly for California'' sign at the Race for the Cure, a breast cancer fund-raiser. Like many of the thousands of participants, the Carly team planned to walk, not run, the three miles, and just before they began, a few of them learned they were in the wrong spot. They had to thrash their way through a thick row of Oleander bushes to get to the right one.
 ''You didn't know you'd be going through the jungle,'' I said to Carly.
 ''We go through the jungle every day,'' she responded, then informed me that Oleander flowers are poisonous.
 The signs identifying other teams said ''Walking for Knockers,'' ''Jogging for Jugs'' and ''Fond Mammaries.''
 ''You can do that on this walk,'' she said to me. ''You know the way Italians can tell Italian jokes? Girls can tell boob jokes.''
 She mentioned that last July, in San Jose, she went to a similar cancer fund-raiser, led by Lance Armstrong, but was too weak to participate. ''I was literally in the middle of chemo,'' she said. But she blew the starting horn and watched more than 3,000 people go by.
 To be back in the stew of things just 10 months later, she said, ''is surprisingly emotional, I have to say: I didn't know what to expect.'' Her eyes welled with tears.
 For most of the walk she held Frank's hand, but then became antsy and let go. She couldn't reconcile herself to the sluggish pace in the thick crowd. When her team slowed down too much and the walkers ahead pulled away, she shouted: ''We're straggling! We're straggling!''
 At the end she looked relieved, even joyful. She jumped up and down, arms raised high; she doled out hugs. This wasn't the finish line foremost in her thoughts. But for now it would do.

HEADLINE: Cap on Well Is Reported to Recover 6,000 Barrels of Oil

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and HENRY FOUNTAIN; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Henry Fountain from New York. Reporting was contributed by Michael Cooper in New Orleans; Jackie Calmes and John M. Broder in Washington, and Maria Newman in New York.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- A cap placed over a leaking well spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico has recovered about 6,000 barrels during the first 24 hours it has been in operation, Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard said Saturday morning.
 With the broken well dumping as much as 19,000 to 25,000 barrels a day into the Gulf, Admiral Allen said that engineers hope to gradually increase the amount of oil captured into a ship hovering on the sea's surface without jeopardizing the delicate recovery effort after so many other efforts have failed in the last six weeks. The admiral is commanding the federal response to the disaster, which began after the Deepwater Horizon drill rig exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers.
 Oil is still escaping through four vents on the top of the cap, designed to relieve pressure and not overstress the containment system. Admiral Allen said that if the vents were closed too quickly, cold sea water could rush in and form the kind of icy hydrates that doomed a previous attempt to cap the spill.
 The admiral had initially said that they hoped to begin closing the vents on Friday. But on Saturday he said that they had been unable to do so because the pressure inside the containment cap might become so great that oil would blast through the imperfect seal connecting it to the riser pipe. 
 ''The want to raise that up to the maximum extent possible, on a daily basis, and then slowly start turning off those vents where the oil is coming out of right now when they're sure that they don't have sea water coming in.'' he said.
 The 6,000 barrels were recovered from midnight Thursday to midnight Friday, he said, and the goal of the capping operation is to push production to 15,000 barrels a day, which is the capacity of the ship above the damaged well.
 In his weekly address, President Obama emphasized that the federal government had ''mobilized on every front'' to contain and clean up the oil spill, and called attention to the plight of some of the shrimpers and oystermen he met while visiting the Louisiana coast on Friday.
 ''These folks work hard,'' the president said in the address, which he recorded Friday evening in Grand Isle, La. ''They meet their responsibilities. But now because of a manmade catastrophe -- one that's not their fault and that's beyond their control -- their lives have been thrown into turmoil. It's brutally unfair. It's wrong. And what I told these men and women -- and what I have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that I'm going to stand with the people of the Gulf Coast until they are made whole.''
 During his visit to the Gulf Coast, Mr. Obama had kept up his criticism of BP, saying the oil company had paid billions of dollars in stock dividends and spent millions on image advertising while people who suffered from the disaster were reporting difficulties getting claims paid. He reiterated that point in his address: ''We've also ordered BP to pay economic injury claims, and we will make sure they pay every single dime owed to the people along the Gulf Coast.''
 Mr. Obama reeled off a ream of statistics to show the scale of the response so far. He said that more than 20,000 people are at work protecting the coastlines, and that he had authorized the deployment of 17,500 National Guard troops to help in the response. He said that 1,900 boats were in the Gulf working on the clean up, and that more than 4.3 million feet of boom had been deployed to try to keep oil from reaching the coastline.
 And he said that while there have been early indications that BP's latest efforts to put a cap over the well to allow them to pump some of the oil to the surface were working, ''we are prepared for the worst, even as we hope that BP's efforts bring better news than we've received before.''
 The process of placing the large metal cap on the well had all the drama of a space launching. Thursday evening, about 80 engineers, scientists and government officials crowded into the hive -- as the room in the subsea operations command center here is called -- to watch on video screens as the cap was inched into place. The maneuver was their handiwork, and a critical step in the latest of what had been a string of dismal efforts to capture some of the oil leaking since theexplosion.
 As the cap hit the oil and gas streaming with great force from the top of the well, it suddenly disappeared, hidden from the video cameras by clouds of hydrocarbons spewing everywhere, said a technician who was there. The operation was briefly flying blind. But a few tense moments later the cap was successfully centered over the wellhead, 5,000 feet below the surface, then lowered half a foot to make a seal. The crowd, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu, gave a cheer.
 ''I would say that things are going as planned,'' Kent Wells, a BP executive, said at a briefing Friday afternoon. ''I am encouraged. But remember, we only have 12 hours' experience.''
 At the briefing in Houston, Mr. Wells said that so far there were no signs that the cap or pipe were being blocked by icelike hydrates, which had derailed an effort several weeks ago to contain some of the oil at the sea bed.
 Mr. Wells would not predict how much oil could finally be collected, although Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said he hoped more than 90 percent of the spill could be contained until relief wells that would permanently stanch the flow were finished, perhaps by August.
 At times during the process of preparing the wellhead to accept the cap and putting the cap into position, it seemed like this latest effort might prove as futile as the previous ones.
 A diamond-studded wire saw had talled on Wednesday after cutting less than halfway through the damaged riser pipe atop the blowout preventer stack at the wellhead. Technicians switched to a ''super shear,'' a 20-foot-long hydraulic scissor, to cut through the pipe.
 Because that cut was not as clean as desired, engineers decided to switch to a different cap among the seven that had been constructed. The one selected, with the number ''4'' painted on the side, was not on the sea bed, the technician said. It had to be lowered by another ship and then hooked up to the drill ship.
 This cap was designed with rubbery materials and soft metal to seal against the flange that joins the riser pipe to the preventer stack, but the flange has bolts of different sizes and heights. ''It's all problematic,'' the technician said, describing the switch in caps as a scramble.
 The technician said that shortly after the cap was successfully placed, Dr. Chu wondered aloud why oil was still spewing from around the bottom. Engineers had to tell him that the leaks were expected, at least initially.
 For at least an hour after the cap was in place, the technician said, two remotely operated submersibles pushed on the device from opposite sides, ''so it would not move on its own accord'' under the pressure of the oil and gas, the technician said.
 Other submersibles monitored the equipment with their video cameras, and one watched the sea bed from a few feet above it, looking for signs that building pressure in the well might be causing problems below.
 The technician said the assembled crowd, which included workers from BP and other companies involved, was in ''pretty good cheer'' after the cap was successfully placed.
 ''But you have to temper all that right now because you don't know the final result,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Teachers' Unions' Last Stand

 BODY:
 There are many things in Steven Brill's article that trouble me, but my greatest concern about the education-reform debate is the absence of teachers' voices. When the country was debating the economic-stimulus plan, policy makers asked economists for advice, and the press frequently provided a forum for them to express their opinions. Yet when discussing education, the experts -- those who work with children every day in classrooms -- are rarely consulted. Many of those who were interviewed for Brill's article said that they want what is best for children. It seems to me that if this is a genuine concern, those who best understand the challenges and problems in our schools, namely teachers, should be asked what they think. EMILY MILLER Second-Grade Teacher, P.S. 24, Brooklyn
 The arguments underpinning Brill's article may be fashionable, but they are flawed. Like many observers with a newfound interest in education, Brill espouses the ideas that public schools are hopelessly broken and that alternatives to public schools are silver bullets. But Brill's facts don't hold up -- not in his characterization of teachers' unions or school-improvement efforts nor in his comparison of two schools. 
 No one is satisfied with the state of education -- certainly not the members and leaders of the American Federation of Teachers. That is why we are leading and collaborating on efforts to improve teaching and learning. In New Haven and elsewhere around the country, numerous A.F.T. affiliates have used collective bargaining as a tool to overhaul teacher development and evaluation, which is the key to having good teachers. And -- in the midst of devastating budget cuts -- we're fighting for the tools teachers need to help their students. But this reality doesn't square with the caricature of unions Brill presents.
 Finally, Brill's portrayal of P.S. 149 and the Harlem Success Academy suggests you can make an apples-to-apples comparison between the schools and that differences in achievement can be attributed to whether the teachers are unionized, among other factors. In truth, each school has seen academic improvement, but Brill fails to note that P.S. 149 serves more students who are severely disabled, poor, homeless or not fluent in English than Harlem Success Academy does.
 When the facts are revealed, Brill's arguments fall far short. RANDI WEINGARTEN President, American Federation of Teachers Washington
 Brill's attack on teachers' unions for the lack of progress in school reform misses the mark. It may be fashionable to attack unions, but anyone who has looked closely at what's going on should realize that the issues are far more complex. Consider this: Massachusetts and Minnesota have made more progress than most states in raising achievement, and both states have strong teachers' unions. States like Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, meanwhile, have weak unions and have made very little progress.
 Brill would have been more helpful if he had been more specific in describing the areas where flexibility is needed, unless he simply wants to eliminate teachers' unions. Any honest observer would acknowledge that unions do occasionally obstruct changes that are needed to improve schools, but so do superintendents (and chancellors), mayors, state legislatures and occasionally parents. There's plenty of room for blame, and that's part of the problem. We spend too much time casting blame and not enough time taking responsibility for bringing about the changes that are needed in America's schools. PEDRO A. NOGUERA, PH.D. Executive Director, Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, New York University New York
 Brill ignores two essential barriers to using student test scores to judge teacher effectiveness. First, current achievement tests are not accurate indicators of what students have learned. While it is not hard to determine whether children can recognize a printed word, it is difficult to construct test items that show whether students can read between the lines, draw conclusions, recognize author biases or determine the gist of a long passage.
 Second, student achievement is influenced by many factors. Research finds that family background is the strongest determinant of school achievement. School-district policies affect classroom learning, among other ways, by allocating resources and assigning students, teachers and principals to specific schools. Without factoring in these influences, student scores cannot measure teacher effectiveness. ROSALIE FRIEND, PH.D. Retired Adjunct Associate Professor School of Education, Hunter College/CUNY Brooklyn
 As someone who has been at it for more than 20 years, I can tell you teaching is hard. If our approach to educational reform continues to focus on punishing teachers for underperforming rather than encouraging them to improve, we're lost. The current emphasis on testing and ''outcomes'' in evaluating teaching is unlikely to do much to raise student-achievement levels -- good teaching requires creativity in the classroom, not adherence to a prescribed regimen.
 If we want good teaching in our schools -- and this is as true at the university level as it is in elementary and secondary schools -- we need to design a system in which teachers are encouraged, and expected, to be active scholars, not just in their subjects but also in pedagogy. Teachers need to be up on educational research about what works; they need to get feedback on their teaching from people who are genuinely interested in their growth and development; and they need to keep studying with master teachers. In short, if you want better teachers, find ways to keep teachers in school. DAVID HLAVSA Professor of Theater Arts Saint Martin's University Lacey, Wash.
 Brill breezily dismisses the coming class-size crisis, a tsunami set to hit American schools this fall, when as many as 275,000 teachers face layoffs nationwide. In Chicago, class sizes will increase to 35 from 28, which is more children and desks than can fit into many classrooms. Teachers will be strained in their efforts to reach every student -- and the resulting damage to children will play out for years to come.
 Yes, it is true that American teachers' unions have created their own obstructionist image by systematically ensuring that incompetent teachers remain in the classroom. But this doesn't mean that those who have the hardest teaching jobs in America don't need and deserve collective representation and protection. Unions and tenure systems need to be reformed, not dismantled. Yes, the teacher-evaluation process needs to be completely revamped to allow for dismissal of incompetent teachers. But the process must be fair; teachers must be protected against the whims of political principals and school systems. The so-called reforms that Race to the Top pushes on states would undermine this protection, endangering the careers of the good teachers along with the bad ones. SETH PATNER Chicago
 I am surprised that Brill's well-written article, depicting the rapid changes in teacher pay and employment policies precipitated by the Race to the Top, did not once credit or even discuss the state of the economy. Certainly when times are not so tough, state governments still compete for federal dollars, but perhaps they would not have taken on the entrenched teachers' unions or made such radical changes if state budgets were not in such dire straits. Kudos to Arne Duncan and the Obama administration for leveraging the crisis to make monumental improvements in public education. ARI GERSTMAN Washington
 Brill writes about the informal network of reformers that has accelerated education reform. He overlooks a significant force, however: results-driven teachers in classrooms and in union halls who are just as eager to move the teaching profession into the 21st century. Teachers like myself are at the forefront of reform, and we are critical to its success.
 I am a founding teacher with Teach Plus, a nonprofit organization that gives voice to reform-oriented teachers. We have advanced common-sense reforms that improve opportunities for students, like creating an innovative teacher-leadership program for turnaround schools in Boston and including performance measures in layoff decisions in Indianapolis. The primary advocates for and leaders of these reforms are active union members.
 I speak for many teachers when I include ''reformer'' as a central part of my identity as a union-represented teacher. MARIA FENWICK Boston
 Nowhere in Brill's article is principal accountability mentioned, as it seldom is in this discussion. As a New York City public school teacher, I strongly believe there is no bigger factor in teacher effectiveness than the quality of school leadership. A good principal establishes a strong and tangible school culture, high expectations for teachers and students and a code of conduct that is both transparent and enforced for all members of the school. This is often the foundation of high-performing charter schools. The research shows that strong classroom teachers are the main contributors to student achievement, and more often than not, good teachers have good principals behind them. MELANIE LEE Brooklyn
 I am a teacher of 34 years and a union sister for 34 years. As I listen to the debate over the Race to the Top, I become agitated. I believe a key question is being neglected: when will financing for our future students become equitable? I would give up my union, and my tenure, if and when all students receive the same amount of federal and local aid. I would willingly have my salary adjusted when teachers from suburban and urban areas are remunerated for their work equally. Maybe we teachers are part of the problem in education, but I am willing to be part of the solution when tougher questions get asked. Is it fair that some students are allotted more money than others? COLLETTE CULLEN Wayne County, Mich.
 If school reform is to be seriously studied, a comparison of charter schools and public schools must involve random assignment of students. Comparisons in test performance are tainted by several factors, particularly parent involvement. Two schools (one charter, one public) sharing the same building particularly highlight this design flaw. Students with parents who make applications, attend meetings, purchase uniforms and otherwise inconvenience themselves for the sake of their children are a select group that is not comparable with the group of students whose parents do not do such things. A valid comparison of performance outcomes starts with random assignments from the same population of students. Until this is done, no conclusions can be drawn except poor experimental design. IRA F. GREENSPUN, PH.D. Staten Island

HEADLINE: A Candidate Tripped Up by Truth on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
We should give Representative Mark Kirk the DVDs of the wonderful, if fictional, cable television series ''Mad Men.'' 
 The protagonist is a smart, tormented and philandering New York advertising executive of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rises professionally and has a nice family despite fabricating his entire past after stealing the dog tags and identity of an Army superior who died next to him in a freakish Korean War accident.
After Mr. Kirk's fumbling over his own military record, I mused about the possibility that he had swapped identities with a buddy during Operation Desert Storm, the first Persian Gulf war. But, as we now know, he didn't take part in Desert Storm, as his Congressional office claimed. 
 Mr. Kirk is the latest in a line of prominent Americans caught lying about their past. Googling will bring you tons. These are among my favorites:
 Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general and Democratic United States Senate candidate, misrepresented his Vietnam War service record; George O'Leary, the then-just-hired Notre Dame football coach , falsified his resume to make specious athletic and academic claims; Marilee Jones, the head of admissions at M.I.T., fabricated her academic credentials; David J. Edmondson, a Radio Shack chief executive, fibbed about his educational background; and George C. Deutsch, the NASA spokesman, didn't really graduate from Texas A&M.
 Mr. Kirk's fibbing includes the claim that he'd won a big Navy award as intelligence officer of the year. When the truth surfaced, Mr. Kirk, the Republican candidate for President Obama's former Senate seat, first took the low road, suggesting that the discovery was a function of his own review -- no, a Washington Post reporter was on to him -- and accusing his Democratic rival, Alexi Giannoulias, of unfairly deriding his military service. 
 Then he delivered a rationale so contorted that it must be the handiwork of the Cirque de Soleil School of Rhetorical Gymnastics. ''I simply misremembered it wrong,'' he told The Sun-Times about that big award. And he has now made other corrections.
 ''I believe that when it comes to lying, there's a pretty simple way to look at things,'' said Jeffrey Seglin, a professor at Emerson College and a syndicated ethics columnist. ''It's not the small lies that cause us trouble. It's the lies we tell to cover that original lie that tend to take on a life of their own. Nothing could be truer when you think about Blumenthal and Kirk.
 ''Each could have talked about his accomplishments honestly, clearly, without embellishment, and still have been perceived to have served honorably. That each decided to embellish with a lie -- or didn't stop others from embellishing with a lie -- suggests that little good can come of lying.''
 We live in a world of sophisticated self-promotion, whether it's applying to college or for a job. We're savvy about highlighting accomplishments. 
 But making stuff up is different, and motivation is always tricky to discern. Still, it takes a leap to believe that Mr. Kirk was moved by a desire to make everything right rather than a fear of being caught. He asserted, ''I think, for veterans, in this climate, we're all going to have to make sure that you're speaking with complete, um, precision.''
 Is it really an Internet- or Blumenthal-fueled ''climate'' that demands honesty? Professor Seglin agrees that the fact that it's easier to get caught these days shouldn't alter the need to be honest. 
 It's thus fitting that the trial of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich started amid Mr. Kirk's stumbling. The trial is, after all, a potential daily public-service announcement for Republicans, given its potentially tawdry look at Democratic-run politics in the state.
 Then you add in the recession and awful unemployment, with all its attendant anxieties and fear. Throw in Democratic Party anxiety that Mr. Giannoulias might be a weak candidate.
 For good measure, consider the BP oil spill and questions -- fair or not -- of the Obama administration's competence, replete with liberal Washington columnists berating the president for not being forceful enough. Forget that the only real alternative, besides BP's engineers, seems to be divine intervention.
 It is likely that a gathering of animal behaviorists would conclude that there is only one known species that could take all these potential advantages and botch things completely. 
 It's the species known as Illinois Republican.

 BODY:
THE NEWSYukio Hatoyama abruptly resigned as prime minister of Japan, eight months after being swept into office by his Democratic Party's landslide victory at the polls and ousting the long-dominant Liberal Democrats. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Hatoyama, the fourth Japanese prime minister in four years to resign, took power vowing to remake the country's politics, revive its economy and loosen the grip of bureaucrats. But by wavering and then backtracking on a promise to remove an American military base on Okinawa, he made himself look indecisive and rapidly squandered his popularity.
 THE NEWSRoger Federer, the highest-ranked male tennis player in the world, was eliminated in a quarterfinal match at the French Open, the first time in the last 24 Grand Slam events that he has failed to reach the semifinals. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS He was beaten in four sets by Robin Soderling, the same player who, a year ago, became the first to beat Mr. Federer's archrival, Rafael Nadal, at the French Open. It has been a tournament of upsets: The top-seeded player on the women's side, Serena Williams, fared no better than Mr. Federer did, losing to Samantha Stosur in her quarterfinal match.
 THE NEWS Representative Artur Davis, who hoped to become Alabama's first black governor, was beaten in the Democratic primary by the state agriculture commissioner, Ron Sparks. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS In trying to build a diverse coalition of moderate voters patterned on the one that elected President Obama, Mr. Davis played down race as a factor in the campaign and never sought support from the state's four major black political groups. Mr. Sparks, who is white, was endorsed by all four. Though most polls had Mr. Davis in the lead, analysts said he failed to spark much enthusiasm among voters.
 THE NEWS Britian experienced its worst shooting rampage in years when a 52-year-old taxi driver killed 12 people and wounded 11 others before shooting himself in a remote area of the Lake District, a celebrated scenic spot.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Britain's new prime minister, David Cameron, warned against ''knee-jerk'' calls for even tougher rules in a country that claims to have the strongest gun control laws in Europe. The killer had a valid license for the shotgun and .22-caliber rifle he used in the shootings. As for a motive, police investigators suggested ''a mixture of grudge, and random.''
 THE NEWS Al and Tipper Gore announced that they were separating after 40 years of marriage.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Who would have guessed? The college sweethearts seemed to have the enduring marriage while the other half of their political union, Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, seemed not so likely to last. The Gores were never trailed by rumors, and their trademark moment was a big sloppy kiss on the stage of the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Friends said they expected no second shoe to drop; the decision was simply about a couple that had grown apart after four decades.

HEADLINE: In Harlem, the End for Rangel Appears Greatly Exaggerated

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
The 40-year Congressional career of Representative Charles B. Rangel seemed to come apart over the last year and a half, amid an unrelenting swirl of accusations that he dodged taxes, hoarded rent-stabilized apartments and accepted corporate-sponsored junkets to the Caribbean. 
 Suddenly, the genial, gravelly voiced prince of Harlem became a symbol of malfeasance and self-dealing Washington insiderism. Republicans talked of building their midterm election strategy around him. Democrats returned his campaign contributions. And Mr. Rangel, 79, relinquished the chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. 
 But back in his Congressional district, a very different attitude has emerged: a fierce determination that Mr. Rangel, whatever his transgressions, should end his public life on his own terms and be given one last term.
 That sentiment is frustrating his Democratic challengers and propelling Mr. Rangel, who formally announced his candidacy on Sunday, into a surprisingly strong position just months after predictions of his demise. 
 ''When it's time for him to go, he will make that decision,'' said Jackie Rowe Adams, 62, a Parks Department employee and union local leader who grew up in Harlem. ''He'll leave gracefully.''
 ''That time,'' she said, ''is not now.''
 Mr. Rangel's re-election prospects are all the more striking given that incumbents around the country are imperiled, as voters seethe and approval of Congress plunges to its lowest point in decades. The talk in Harlem is not of ethics investigations and potential penalties, but of dignity -- Mr. Rangel's and, by extension, Harlem's.
 Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright of Harlem, the chairman of the Manhattan Democratic Party, said of Mr. Rangel, ''He can't go out like this.''
 Now, he said, ''It's about protecting and enhancing the legacy.''
 No formidable opponent has yet emerged, and the Democrats who are trying to challenge him are struggling to raise money and excitement.
 ''He wants one last shot, and frankly, most of the political establishment seems ready to give it to him,'' said one of the challengers, Vince Morgan, a 41-year-old banker who argues that the district needs new energy.
 Mr. Rangel acknowledged that he did not want to leave office with an ethical cloud over his head. ''It would be awkward,'' he said. 
 During a wide-ranging interview on Saturday, he invoked athletes like Muhammad Ali, and said, ''If they needed one more chance to go out at the top of their game -- I buy that.''
 He added, ''This is not the time to be hanging up the gloves.'' 
 Of course, no independent polls have been published that measure Mr. Rangel's support, and political fortunes can always turn. One big unknown is when findings will be issued by the House Ethics Committee, which is probing the congressman's rent-stabilized apartments, his failure to report income from his Dominican villa, and his use of official stationery to raise money for a building that will bear his name.
 And even as the congressman feels buoyed by the embrace of old Harlem, he is aware that in his changing district -- which spans the Hispanic neighborhood of Washington Heights and heavily Jewish areas of the Upper West Side -- he needs to be attentive beyond his most loyal constituents. He is reaching out in ways that are decidedly un-Rangel-like: via Twitter, Facebook and digital town hall meetings (he calls them tele-town halls).
 The congressman's staff has invited thousands of his constituents to phone in to the conference calls, in which his distinctive, disembodied voice can be heard, holding forth on national defense, health care and the economy. Then he takes about a dozen prescreened questions. ''Now remember,'' he says, as his office chair squeaks audibly over the telephone line, ''Press star three to ask me a question.''
 During the latest session, one bedridden caller thanked the congressman profusely for creating such a convenient way for her to interact with him.
 While some Democrats nationally are distancing themselves from Mr. Rangel, on Sunday in Washington Heights he was surrounded by the leaders of Manhattan's Democratic establishment, from Gov. David A. Paterson to the speaker of the City Council, Christine C. Quinn. 
 Still, Mr. Rangel's opponents believe a campaign built around the idea of giving him a valedictory term to preserve his dignity could backfire. 
 ''It strikes me as a symbolic term, rather than a real term of public service,'' said one opponent, Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV, a Democrat, whose father held the seat before Mr. Rangel.
 Mr. Morgan said, ''Why should we give him an ego stroke when the needs of the district are bigger than the needs of this man's ego?''
 Another hopeful, Jonathan Tasini, a Texas native, is trying to use Mr. Rangel's deep support among Democratic leaders against him; Mr. Tasini says that he is running ''a campaign for the people, and in opposition to the dysfunctional political machine.'' 
 In interviews, few voters expressed concern about Mr. Rangel's giving up his Ways and Means chairmanship. They pointed out that he had brought much-needed money and attention to the district.
 ''We in Harlem need someone who can get in every room in Washington and can deliver the things that are needed here,'' said Walter J. Edwards, who runs a real estate development company.
 Mr. Rangel was elected in 1970 and has rarely faced a real challenge, routinely winning re-election with more than 90 percent of the vote. He declared on Sunday that he would run this campaign ''as if it is very a close one, and the whole Congress is relying on this to keep the majority.''
 But it is clear this has been a difficult period. In the interview, he described the last 18 months as ''painful'' for him and his family, and seemed taken aback by the suggestion, made by his Democratic challengers and many critics outside of New York, that he should step aside. 
 Displaying the bravado that is beloved by his fans and abhorred by his foes, he wondered aloud who could fill his shoes. ''It's hard for me to think of somebody better than me to do it, in the country, let alone the district,'' he said.
 Donors have not shared his confidence. Mr. Rangel's fund-raising has fallen since the previous election cycle, and legal bills from the ethics investigation are consuming much of what is left. He has paid more than $1 million to Zuckerman Spaeder, a Washington firm. By the end of March, he had $635,000 in his campaign account. That amount, however, dwarfs anything raised by his challengers.
 On Sunday at Boricua College in Washington Heights, Mr. Rangel beamed and occasionally pumped his fist as elected officials trumpeted his accomplishments and joined in a chant of ''Run, Charlie, run!'' 
 Upon leaving the event, the congressman stopped to talk to reporters. As he was peppered with questions about the ethics inquiry, the absence of his Congressional colleagues at his announcement and his rationale for running again, he told reporters that he remained fully engaged and energized.
 ''Hey, when I get tired, it's time to leave,'' he said.

HEADLINE: City Proceeds With Big Middle-Income Housing Project on Queens Waterfront

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After four years of planning and delays, the city will start soliciting bids on Monday to begin building what could become the city's largest development for middle-income residents in 40 years. 
 The Bloomberg administration, which is heavily subsidizing the project, is asking developers to compete to build 1,000 apartments on a once industrial strip of Queens land known as Hunters Point South, where Newtown Creek enters the East River. 
 At least 60 percent of the apartments would be reserved for families earning $63,000 to $130,000 a year. Although construction is not scheduled to begin until 2012, the project would mark the first section of a waterfront community of 5,000 apartments with shops, a school and a 10-acre public park. 
 Plans call for a mix of rental apartments and condominiums, with about 40 percent of the units going for market rates. The buildings would vary in height up to about 30 stories.
 The city is making a substantial commitment to the project, having bought the land from the state last year for $100 million. 
 It has budgeted an additional $175 million for toxic cleanup, the park and a network of roads, sewers and electric lines, although only $60 million would be spent to prepare the first two parcels for construction. 
 Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said the city expected to provide about $90,000 for each of the first 600 subsidized units. 
 The city would continue to own the land, but the developers would own the buildings, and the subsidized apartments would permanently remain affordable for people in the middle-income range. 
 Neighborhood officials said they were pleased that the project was moving forward, although some housing advocates said the project would not address the needs of many Queens residents. 
 Adam Friedman, director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a policy and planning group, said that because the median family income in Queens was $51,290 a year, ''half the families in Queens'' earn too little to be eligible for the subsidized units. 
 ''We're arguing that there have to be deeper subsidies so that the community that evolves out of this has economic diversity,'' Mr. Friedman said.
 But Mr. Cestero said the city needed to address the needs of the middle class, including teachers, firefighters and construction and health care workers. 
 ''The vast majority of housing we create is for low-income families,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''But we also know that people with moderate and middle incomes have significant housing challenges. We don't want them to have to leave the city to find housing.''
 Jerilyn Perine, a former city housing commissioner who is executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said that not every project could address all of the city's housing needs. 
 ''We're still a city where half the households are paying more than 30 percent of their income for rent,'' Ms. Perine said. 
 She said Hunters Point South was a great project. ''I'm a big fan of transforming the industrial waterfront,'' she said. ''It's something that has to be done for the future of our city. There is, however, an upfront cost to doing that in time and money.''
 Given the lull in residential construction since the recession, Mr. Cestero said the city was expecting that large-scale developers, like Avalon Bay, Douglaston Development, Related Companies and Gotham, as well as the city's traditional builders of affordable housing, would compete for the first two construction sites at Hunters Point. The competition could result in a larger number of middle-income units. 
 ''We believe that high-quality builders and developers are eager to come in and get started here as part of stimulating the market for housing,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''We'll be looking for them to maximize the number of units for the least subsidy from the city.''
 Both Ron Moelis, chief executive of L & M Equity, a developer of affordable housing, and Jeffrey E. Levine, chairman of Douglaston Development, said they were interested. 
 But Mr. Levine said that the job might require the construction unions to agree to concessions to keep costs down.
 ''Even with the cooperation of organized labor, it's a lift,'' said Mr. Levine, who is completing a large luxury project on the Brooklyn waterfront that includes 347 units for families with low or moderate income. 
 ''But with the proper package of infrastructure improvements and low interest rates,'' he said, ''it can happen.''
 Hunters Point South would be the largest middle-income complex built in New York since Co-op City in the Bronx and Starrett City in Brooklyn in the early 1970s. 
 It is also where in 2005 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wanted to build temporary housing for athletes as part of the city's ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. 
 A year later, the mayor announced plans to build 5,000 units of subsidized housing for the middle class.
 At that time, Mr. Bloomberg had come under criticism from housing advocates for not intervening in the sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a sprawling middle-class enclave in Manhattan. A tenant group was outbid in 2006 by a private investor who paid a record-breaking $5.4 billion, but the venture is now in foreclosure. 
 City officials said at the time that they could build affordable housing in Queens for about $54,000 a unit, far more cheaply than in Manhattan. It has not worked out that way.
 Joseph Conley, chairman of Community Board 2 in Long Island City, said his board had worked with city officials on the layout of the buildings, the school and the public park, which he said was badly needed in southwest Queens. 
 He said the board had asked the city to do something about increasing the capacity of the closest subway line, the No. 7, which is already crowded during rush hours. 
 Still, Jimmy Van Bramer, the City Council member whose district includes Hunters Point, said the project had ''the potential to transform the area, which right now is either abandoned or underutilized land, and make it into a thriving community where people want to live.''

HEADLINE: A Pitch for Hummus Goes Nationwide

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE economy has remade the Madison Avenue landscape in myriad ways, among them changing the types of products that are advertised frequently now compared with during the boom years.
 In other words, Hummer, no; hummus, yes.
 Shorthand, to be sure, but it encapsulates a major trend: Ads for glossy, big-ticket purchases like behemoth sport utilities have been supplanted in many instances by ads for prosaic, less expensive products like packaged foods. 
 Several food marketers increased ad spending markedly in the first quarter compared with the period a year ago, according to the Kantar Media research division of WPP. Among them were ConAgra Foods, up 22.9 percent; H. J. Heinz, up 45.2 percent; Hershey, up 81.2 percent; General Mills, up 15.5 percent; Kraft Foods, up 17.8 percent; and J. M. Smucker, up 12.4 percent. 
 Among the brands planning to spend more throughout 2010 is the Sabra line of refrigerated dips and spreads that includes more than a dozen varieties of, yes, hummus. Sabra is sold by the Sabra Dipping Company, a joint venture of the Strauss Group and the Frito-Lay North America division of PepsiCo.
 Although the name of a soft drink predominates in the corporate brand, PepsiCo estimates that $10 billion of its annual revenue of $43.2 billion last year came from what it calls its ''good-for-you portfolio'' of products like Aquafina water, Near East couscous, Quaker Oats and Tropicana juices.
 Among those products are smaller brands like Sabra, Naked juices, Smartfood snacks, Stacy's pita chips and True North nuts.
 PepsiCo intends to ''rapidly expand'' its lineup of healthier fare, according to the company's 2009 annual report, by taking steps like ''investing to accelerate the growth of these platforms'' -- in other words, more advertising.
 A campaign for Sabra that was tested in five regional markets last year ''performed well, better than our expectations,'' said Mina Penna, Sabra brand manager at Sabra Dipping in Astoria, Queens, so it is being expanded, beginning on Monday, into a national initiative.
 The campaign will include television commercials, two Web sites, digital ads, a presence in social media like Facebook and Twitter, ads in stores, promotions and events like a chefs' tour of 19 cities and house parties where guests can sample Sabra products.
 The campaign is being created by the New York office of StrawberryFrog, which also creates ads for Stacy's and True North. The premise of the humorous campaign, which carries the theme ''Adventure awaits,'' is that Sabra is just what a pallid palate craves.
 People who enjoy what they eat and like to try new tastes ''sometimes fall into a 'food rut' and lose their way a bit on their epicurean journey,'' Ms. Penna said, as symbolized in the ads by a rote reliance on Chinese takeout, lettuce-only salads or even -- gasp! -- spray cheese.
 The campaign proposes saving all the unfortunates who are ''in need of a taste intervention,'' as an announcer declares, by switching them to Sabra. 
 Visitors to sabraintervention.com will be able to nominate family members and friends for comestible makeovers.
 (Coincidentally, Kraft last month introduced a humorous campaign for its Sandwich Shop Mayo line of flavored mayonnaise that carries the theme ''Give your sandwich a makeover'' and features cast members of the HGTV reality series ''Design Star'' intervening in the lives of bored eaters.)
 ''We use the term 'epicurious' '' to describe the target audience, said Chip Walker, partner and head of planning at StrawberryFrog New York. (The Conde Nast Digital unit of Advance Publications likes the term, too, judging by its epicurious.com Web site.)
 Some potential buyers of Sabra are ''adventurous eaters who we haven't quite connected with yet,'' Mr. Walker said, and some are ''people who don't know what hummus is or what it tastes like.''
 To help out the latter, commercials from the test last year, which describe Sabra as a delicious way to ''taste the Mediterranean without leaving home,'' will promote the hummus and perhaps introduce some people to it.
 In addition to StrawberryFrog New York, others working on the campaign include OMD in New York, a media agency that is part of the Omnicom Group, and Seymour Public Relations in Bergenfield, N.J.
 Sabra Dipping will spend ''significantly'' more on advertising this year than the estimated $3.3 million it spent last year, Ms. Penna said. She declined to be more specific.
 The first of 19 cities on the chefs' tour, called the Sabra Taste Adventure, is Richmond, Va., near a new, $61 million manufacturing plant that Sabra Dipping opened last month. Sabra Dipping executives have said they plan to move the company's headquarters to the Richmond area from Astoria.
 That would make it a rough year for New Yorkers who like their local food companies. First, the bakery Stella D'oro closed its plant in the Bronx, and now Sabra is going to leave Queens.

HEADLINE: The Tanker, Continued

 BODY:
For almost a decade, the Air Force has bungled attempts to replace its fleet of Eisenhower-era KC-135 refueling jets. The procurement process has been grossly mismanaged and tainted by corruption and favoritism. Now Congress seems ready to add to the confusion with legislation intended to ensure that the American contractor, Boeing, beats out its European rival, the aerospace consortium EADS, for the $50 billion contract. 
 Last month, the House passed an amendment to the Defense authorization bill requiring the Pentagon ''to take into consideration'' any unfair advantage to a bidder conferred by illegal subsidies. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, a staunch supporter of Boeing, has introduced a companion bill. 
 Boeing and its allies have reasonable concerns that subsidies will give an unfair price advantage to EADS's Airbus. The World Trade Organization issued a confidential ruling in March that reportedly agreed with American charges that European governments had awarded billions in illegal subsidies to EADS, helping it gain market share from Boeing. 
 The W.T.O. rules include their own enforcement mechanisms to make offending members end illegal subsidies. Instead of involving the Pentagon in American trade policy, it would be best to let the W.T.O. process run its separate course. Congress's proposed remedy, meanwhile, would entangle the tanker bidding in years of additional legal complications.
 The W.T.O. ruling is likely to be made public before the July 9 deadline for tanker bids. But the Europeans are entitled to appeal the decision. To truly level the playing field, the Pentagon would have to convert that finding into an estimate of the illegal subsidies to each Airbus tanker -- a process the Europeans are likely to contest. And the tanker selection would occur before the W.T.O. reached a verdict on the rival complaint brought by Europe over American subsidies to Boeing. 
 This fraught process would probably bump EADS out of the bidding, leaving the Air Force with only one plane to choose from. That is not the best way to get the best possible jet for taxpayers' money. And it would almost certainly invite retaliation by European governments, which buy a lot of technology from American defense contractors. 
 The tanker procurement already has the feel of a sketch from the Keystone Cops. In 2004, Senator John McCain scuttled the Air Force's plan to lease Boeing jets when he found that a top Air Force procurement official was angling for a job at the defense contractor. The Pentagon then held an open auction, awarding the contract to a consortium made of Northrop Grumman and EADS.
 After Boeing protested the result, the Government Accountability Office concluded that the Pentagon unfairly favored Northrop, notably by awarding it points for size even though the specifications didn't call for a big jet. Northrop took itself out of the bidding in March, when the Air Force's new specs made clear that there would be no points for size. EADS chose to remain and bid on its own. 
 Flag-waving for Boeing in Congress would add a further, unnecessary twist to this painful saga. And by shoving out the competition, it would almost ensure that American taxpayers would get less tanker for their money.

HEADLINE: An Initial Offering Will Test Nielsen

BYLINE: By ROB COX, ROLFE WINKLER and NICHOLAS PAISNER

 BODY:
Nielsen's planned $1.75 billion initial public offering will be closely watched by its core demographic: buyout barons. No fewer than six private equity firms -- including the industry leaders Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners -- own the business, which dominates the market for tracking media viewership.
 The question is whether the new Nielsen can attract similar audience awareness from stock market investors. 
 If it can, Nielsen, led by the former General Electric wunderkind David L. Calhoun, may provide decent returns for its current investors. They injected about $3 billion of equity into the $10 billion buyout of the business, formerly called VNU and listed in the Netherlands.
 An initial offering that comes close to doubling their money would also help dispel criticism that buyout firms are nothing more than undertaxed financial engineers.
 That may not be an unreasonable pitch. Under Mr. Calhoun, the company has disposed of ancillary assets, focused on its core ratings business and squeezed out costs. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose to around $1.3 billion last year from $879 million four years ago. Revenue has grown about 2 percent a year since 2007.
 Moreover, as the industry standard for television and cable ratings information, Nielsen has traditionally operated a business with high barriers to entry. And its penetration of developing markets is still small, accounting for just around 17 percent of revenue.
 But media habits are changing. ComScore, for instance, is better positioned to measure eyeballs gravitating to online media like YouTube and Facebook. In its prospectus, Nielsen also notes the risk that multiple competitors are looking to measure TV audiences digitally using new set-top boxes.
 Given these risks and opportunities, what is Nielsen worth? At 11 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- a hefty 20 percent premium to its competitors, the GfK Group of Germany and Ipsos of France, to reflect Nielsen's dominant position -- the company would have a $14.3 billion enterprise value. Net of debt, that is just under $6 billion for the equity -- nearly doubling the consortium's original investment.
 That may not sound like a home run. But it would help validate the private equity industry. It would suggest leveraged buyout firms do more than just shift debt around, and that they can put large amounts of capital to work, make better-than-market returns and even cooperate with one another.
 For all these reasons, Nielsen should score big audience ratings on Wall Street.
 Exiting Deutsche Bank
 Deutsche Bank is losing half of one of the few successful double acts in investment banking. Michael Cohrs, an American who has been co-head of the company's investment bank for six years, is to set to retire and hand off to Anshu Jain.
 The departure of Mr. Cohrs -- and the concentration of power with Mr. Jain, a market specialist -- may unsettle investors. But while the transition has its challenges, this looks like a natural evolution.
 Mr. Cohrs is following on the heels of several top Deutsche bankers who have left this year. But the timing looks planned. It coincides with the original departure date scheduled for the group's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, who deferred his own retirement to 2013.
 The advisory business Mr. Cohrs has run since 2001 has come far under his tenure, coming from nowhere to break into the top tier in American mergers. Still, that business has always been overshadowed by Mr. Jain's market machine.
 Judged on his contribution to revenue, Mr. Jain has certainly earned the right to take over. And while the co-head structure has worked, it would be risky to wedge in a new leader at this stage.
 Mr. Jain is a candidate to replace Mr. Ackermann. He now has some big challenges to tackle. He must protect the position in the business that Mr. Cohrs has built up, and should consider appointing a new advisory champion to secure that legacy.
 Above all, Mr. Jain needs to defend investment banking within Deutsche Bank amid pressure to allocate capital to less risky businesses. Moody's, the rating agency, recently criticized the bank's dependence on capital markets, questioning its risk management capabilities.
 It is hard to think of a stronger advocate for capital markets than Mr. Jain. He will have to resolve tensions internally and with regulators. If he handles that well, his candidacy for the top job at the bank will be strengthened.

HEADLINE: Domestic Workers' Rights

 BODY:
New York State has the chance to lead the nation in extending basic workplace protections to domestic workers -- the nannies, housekeepers and caregivers for the elderly who are as essential to the economy as they are overlooked and unprotected. 
 The State Senate has just passed a domestic workers' bill of rights, with an array of guarantees that most workers take for granted, like paid holidays, sick days, vacation days and the right to overtime pay and collective bargaining. The Assembly passed its version last year. The Legislature should swiftly reconcile the bills and send a measure to Gov. David Paterson for his signature.
 Domestic workers, like farm workers, have long struggled for equality in the workplace. Labor protections drafted in the New Deal specifically excluded both groups of workers, who remain highly vulnerable to exploitation. The problem is especially acute for domestic workers, a largely immigrant and female work force that toils out of public sight in private homes.
 The bill in Albany gives employers and workers a baseline of fairness about pay, hours and benefits. It also gives the State Labor Department and attorney general the power to enforce its provisions. 
 There is little doubt that these women are vital -- an estimated 200,000 of them toil in the metropolitan area, where entire industries and neighborhoods are dependent on paid domestic help. The cruel injustice is that while nannies and caregivers make it possible for professional couples to balance the demands of family and work, they often cannot take time to be with their own families when sickness or injury strikes. 
 The bill's success in Albany comes at a time when low-wage workers are suffering in a dismal economy, and losing battles to extend their rights. Home health aides, for example, still lack the right to a minimum wage and overtime pay, their pleas for justice having been soundly rejected by the Labor Department and the Supreme Court.
 All the more reason to hail the progress in Albany, and push lawmakers there to revive and pass a long-stalled bill with similar protections for farm workers.

HEADLINE: COAST GUARD SEES OIL SPILL CLEANUP LASTING INTO FALL

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JOHN M. BRODER; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and John M. Broder from Washington. Henry Fountain contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- The Coast Guard commander in charge of the federal response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico warned on Sunday that even if the flow of crude was stopped by summer, it could take well into autumn -- and maybe much longer-- to deal with the slick spreading relentlessly across the gulf.
 The assessment came as the sheer volume of oil gushing from the out-of-control well forced BP to temporarily halt its attempts to close all four vents on a capping device designed to capture the oil. Even with three vents still open, the cap was capturing so much oil -- more than 10,000 barrels a day, an improvement over any previous containment attempt -- that the company did not have adequate equipment at hand to process any more. 
 The well, like a raging undersea beast, has continued to stymie BP and government officials. One technician, amazed at the power of the oil gushing from its depths, called it ''one hell of a well.'' 
 Adm. Thad W. Allen, the Coast Guard commander, said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS that BP officials were working to secure the cap over the wellhead and to gradually increase the amount of oil recovered. But he said the only solution to the problem would be the successful completion of relief wells to finally stop the flow from the bottom of the 18,000-foot-deep well, a job that will not be completed until August at the earliest.
 ''The spill will not be contained until that happens,'' Admiral Allen said. ''But even after that, there will be oil out there for months to come. This will be well into the fall.''
 He added: ''This is a siege across the entire gulf. This spill is holding everybody hostage, not only economically but physically. And it has to be attacked on all fronts.''
 Officials said Sunday that they were collecting more than 10,000 barrels a day from the well, but it was impossible to gauge what fraction of the total flow that represented.
 A federal panel has estimated that 12,000 to 25,000 barrels a day is flowing from the well. But those calculations were made before BP cut the riser pipe last week to accommodate the capping device, which administration officials have said could increase the flow rate by as much as 20 percent. 
 The area of gulf shoreline potentially affected by the spill has continued to grow, extending from central Louisiana to Port St. Joe in the middle of the Florida Panhandle, a 400-mile front in a widening sea, air and land war. Admiral Allen, who appeared on four television programs on Sunday morning to discuss the disaster, said he was fighting the oil and the elements with a flotilla of skimmers and boom-laying boats to try to keep the oil from making landfall.
 ''The problem we have, this is not a large, monolithic spill anymore,'' he said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''It is an aggregation of thousands of smaller spills that could come ashore at any particular time based on wind and current.''
 It was too early to judge the degree of success of BP's latest maneuver to control the leak, although company officials continued to express optimism that the containment cap and a new device to be installed later in the week could eventually collect the majority of the oil.
 After two days of trying to gradually close the four vents on the capping device, engineers on Sunday decided to keep some open when they realized that more oil was being captured than could be processed on a drill ship floating in the gulf above. In a statement late Sunday, the company said it ''may leave some'' of the valves open ''to ensure system stability.''
 Engineers had feared that the volume and velocity of oil escaping might create so much friction on the new pipe that it might force it entirely off the cap. All day Saturday they worked to shut two of the vents, and they spent the afternoon measuring the results, mindful that if they closed the vents too quickly, water could rush in and form the kind of icy hydrates that doomed a previous containment effort.
 But while the cap remained snugly in place and there were no signs of significant hydrate formation, by nightfall Saturday the engineers suddenly were forced to deal with another problem: the Discoverer Enterprise drill ship can only handle 15,000 barrels a day, and the capping device was trapping almost that amount without the vents shut.
 ''We're maxed out,'' said the technician, who is working on the operation and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. He said the capping device was capturing 10,000 to 15,000 barrels a day. 
 ''There is no chance to close the vents when you are at maximum production,'' he said. ''You wish desperately you could capture it all, but it depends on the volume coming out of well. And you know how people are arguing about that.'' 
 The problem may be only a temporary one. The limitations of the Discoverer Enterprise to handle oil are mainly due to the size and capacity of the machines it has on board to separate the oil, gas and water for storage. The ship has the capacity to store 139,000 barrels of oil, a quantity that may be reached in a matter of days. Shuttle barges carry oil from the ship to storage tanks on shore.
 BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, in a British television interview broadcast Sunday, said another containment device would be deployed by next weekend. That device is a free-standing riser pipe that would siphon oil through the manifold that was built during a failed operation known as top kill. Another pipe will be also used to take oil from the well to a second container ship, the Q4000. 
 Taken together, BP executives say, they should be able to eventually contain a vast majority of the leaking oil. By early July, BP plans to replace the new containment cap with another device called an ''overshot tool,'' which is heavier and more tightly sealed. ''That would capture even more oil'' than the current cap, said Toby Odone, a BP spokesman.
 The struggle to fully deploy the new containment device has raised renewed questions about just how much oil is spewing from the well. Official government and BP estimates began at 1,000 barrels a day, then increased to 5,000 barrels a day.
 In recent days government scientists estimated the leak at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels, and Admiral Allen on Sunday put the upper range at 25,000 barrels. Some independent scientists say the number could be far higher, and they question why BP has not made an active effort to estimate the size of the leak. 
 Some questioned whether BP knew or even wanted to know how much oil was escaping.
 ''BP still does not appear to know precisely how much oil is actually escaping, which is discouraging,'' Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a letter he wrote to BP on Sunday.
 Government officials and BP executives say the containment efforts should help them come up with a more solid number.

HEADLINE: Printing in a Smartphone Age

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- Vyomesh I. Joshi, the head of Hewlett-Packard's $24 billion printing empire, relaxes by taking long walks on the beaches near his home here. And, for a while, it seemed as if he might end up spending more time strolling the sand than moving ink and toner.
 H.P.'s printing business deflated during the darkest days of the recession, producing plenty of gossip that Mr. Joshi would either leave the company or be fired. But sales have started to come back, and Mr. Joshi, who goes by V.J., is still around in fighting form. On Monday, he will preside over an event announcing H.P.'s latest attack on the printing market -- which will center on printers built for the iPhone age.
 ''We heard some of that speculation about V.J.,'' said Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Barclays Capital. ''But it does seem like he's reinvigorated and there are new products, and things are getting better for the business.'' 
 Mr. Joshi has spent years disputing the notion that people will print less as they do more on their hand-held devices. This week, he will see his ideas put into action as H.P. introduces a fleet of printers with Web access, their own e-mail addresses and touch screens. These products should open up new ways for people to print from Web services like Google Docs, and from smartphones and devices like the iPad from Apple.
 Mr. Joshi is going back to his roots as an engineer -- as a young H.P. researcher, he figured out a way to make ink cartridges fire 45 million drops -- and relying on new technologies, not slick marketing. But still, he will have to prove that customers will change their behavior and print more if given the right tools. That, Mr. Reitzes said, is crucial to how investors will evaluate the long-term prospects of H.P.
 ''Investors are worried about printing,'' he said. ''It's really important that they get this right.''
 As the world's largest technology company, H.P. sells a wide variety of products but got much of its profit from printers and their pricey ink. More recently, H.P. has built up a large technology services arm as well, which has helped round out its business. But the printing division accounts for about a fifth of its revenue and a third of its profits.
 The new printers -- which build on a limited experiment last year -- will range in price from $99 to about $400. Every one will come with what H.P. executives billed as a breakthrough feature -- its very own e-mail address. 
 H.P.'s engineers hit on the e-mail address as an easy, familiar way for people to send print jobs to the Web-ready printers. You can, for example, take a photo with a phone, e-mail it to your printer's address and have the printout waiting for you at home. Or, you can share the printer's e-mail address with family and friends. This means that someone can buy Grandma a Web-ready printer and have it pump out photos of the grandchildren without Grandma having to do much of anything. (Except buy that pricey ink.)
 H.P. is also lining up partners for a Web site, the ePrintCenter, which the company envisions as the kind of app store that Apple, Google and others have for their smartphones. The idea is that the partners -- so far, H.P. has lined up 40 -- can build software and services for its Web printers. 
 For example, children, and their parents, could print out coloring books from Crayola, and Dora the Explorer birthday activity packs from Nickelodeon.
 ''Now that H.P. is going mass-market with this technology, we will more actively program to it,'' said Steve Youngwood, an executive vice president at Nickelodeon.
 H.P. plans to offer a few of these new printers to consumers this month, and then a few more of the products to small businesses in September. It expects to sell more than 15 million of the Web printers by next year.
 The hardest part may be convincing consumers to change their behavior and adopt the new tools. People who once printed out directions now have their own navigational devices, and things like boarding passes and tickets are starting to give way to their digital equivalents on smartphones. Analysts add that recessions tend to condition people to print less. 
 Still, Mr. Joshi is optimistic. ''We think by next year more printing will be done from the Web than from word-processing applications,'' he said.
 The e-mail address approach removes a major barrier to use in the mobile era: a cable, as well as the installation of the often-irksome software that makes the printer and PC work together.
 This type of technology could make finding and using a printer at an airport, hotel or office easier as well. 
 H.P.'s approach has caught the attention of Google, and the companies have formed a partnership so that people can send jobs from things like Google Docs and Calendar to H.P.'s Web printers. 
 Beyond the home and office printers, H.P. has found some flashy expansions for its industrial digital printing machines -- some bigger than conference rooms -- that crank out thing as varied as billboards, textbooks and custom labels on Heineken beer bottles. 
 Companies like Nickelodeon and Dr. Seuss Enterprises will soon offer customized wallpaper through H.P. and retail partners. From a Web site, people can enter the dimensions of a room and then arrange their favorite characters in a scene built to fit that room. They can then pick up numbered wallpaper sheets at a local store and put them up with water and a sponge.
 Tiny Prints produces custom greeting cards and stationery with H.P.'s industrial digital machines, and raised sales by 100 percent in 2008 and 50 percent in 2009 despite the grim economy, said Ed Han, the company's chief executive. 
 H.P. also expects to have about 7,000 printing kiosks in retail stores by the end of this year, pumping out photos, books and brochures. And, over the last few years, H.P. has built out its business for managing the printing operations of companies and now has $6 billion worth of contracts.
 ''That is literally from zero dollars,'' said Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive of H.P. 
 Historically, H.P. has spent vast sums of research and development dollars on its printing and imaging business to make sure its products could outdo those of competitors. This division, however, has come under the same cost constraints as other parts of H.P. under Mr. Hurd. 
 ''Have our budgets and resources been impacted? Yes, absolutely they have,'' said Glen Hopkins, a vice president in H.P.'s printing research and development group. 
 Mr. Joshi has also pushed to lower the printing division's manufacturing costs. 
 ''I think this group has made material progress,'' Mr. Hurd said. ''At the same time, it also has the opportunity to be more efficient.''
 Mr. Joshi, who many people thought would one day inherit the chief executive job, said he chose to ignore the public speculation about his future at H.P.
 ''In October, I will have completed 30 years here,'' Mr. Joshi said. ''I love this company, and my view is that printing is still a very significant part of H.P.''

HEADLINE: Dictator's Link to Prize Puts Unesco in Odd Spot

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- A new international prize for scientific achievement lavishly financed by one of Africa's most infamous dictators has placed Unesco and its new director general in a delicate bind.
 The Unesco-Obiang prize, tentatively scheduled to be awarded by the end of the month, has been roundly criticized by scientists and human rights organizations as little more than a clumsy effort to burnish the reputation of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the president of Equatorial Guinea. Mr. Obiang has been accused by rights groups and anticorruption activists of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars from his tiny oil-rich West African state, while most of its people scrape by in dire poverty.
 The irony of having Mr. Obiang's name attached to a prize that honors achievements that ''improve the quality of human life'' is not lost on critics, who say Unesco -- the Paris-based United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization -- is undermining its own credibility by awarding it. 
 With the first prize to be announced soon, efforts to delay, abandon or modify it have gained urgency. 
 But at a meeting in April, Unesco's 58-nation executive board dismissed concerns that the award would damage the organization, and Unesco officials say that African countries on the board have maintained their unanimous backing for the prize.
 The United States, France and other members that opposed the prize when it was approved in 2008 voiced no objections at the April meeting. Wary of appearing anti-African or colonialist, Western diplomats said that any initiative to alter or drop the award would have to come from the board's African members.
 That leaves the agency's new director general, Irina Bokova, who is obligated to follow the wishes of the executive board, in the awkward position of trying to appeal to African leaders to rebuff one of their own for the good of the agency. 
 She declined to be interviewed for this article, but Unesco's spokeswoman, Sue Williams, said that Ms. Bokova had raised the issue with the board. 
 ''The director general has expressed her serious concern over Unesco's prestige and has urged member states to live up to their responsibilities and discuss the future of the prize,'' Ms. Williams said. ''She is for continuing consultations with member states to find a solution to the difficulties being encountered with this prize.''
 In addition to having to navigate touchy regional and historical minefields, Ms. Bokova finds herself objecting to what, on its face, is a generous gift for a worthy cause.
 Mr. Obiang, who has ruled Equatorial Guinea since 1979, has committed $3 million a year for five years; half the money is to go to five awardees, who receive $300,000 grants, and half to cover the costs of selecting the winners. 
 The administrative budget of $1.5 million a year struck some Unesco diplomats, who asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the issue, as ripe for the kind of corruption that has often marked Unesco programs.
 But the larger concern is Mr. Obiang himself.
 ''It's shameful that Unesco ever agreed to honor one of the world's worst dictators with a prize in his name,'' said Lisa Misol, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization. ''President Obiang's record of human rights abuse and corruption contradicts everything Unesco is supposed to stand for.''
 Steven Ekovich, a professor at the American University of Paris, said on Radio France International, ''If an African dictator wants to improve the lives of people, he should improve the lives of his own people first.'' 
 According to the African Economic Outlook, 77 percent of Equatorial Guinea's population fell below the poverty line in 2006. The country has one of the highest infant-mortality rates in the world and an average life expectancy of 62. It ranks among the bottom 13 countries on Transparency International's corruption index, and ninth on the Freedom House list of the world's most repressive countries. 
 In March, a group of exiled citizens of Equatorial Guinea wrote to Ms. Bokova urging her to abolish the prize and use the money instead to buy school supplies for the country.
 Last month, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations, wrote Ms. Bokova seeking clarification and expressing his concern ''that by sponsoring this prize, Unesco is associating itself with a dictator who has spent 30 years doing little more than consolidating his power and enriching himself and his family.''
 Mr. Leahy said that ''there are credible reports that President Obiang and his family have stolen large sums, possibly billions of dollars, from the people of Equatorial Guinea, one of the largest oil-producing countries in Africa with a per capita G.D.P. of over $30,000, but which ranks at or near the bottom of most health, education and human rights indicators.'' 
 The United States is the largest contributor to Unesco, responsible for about a fifth of its budget. Mr. Leahy's committee is considering a roughly $84 million appropriation for Unesco for fiscal year 2011.
 But Mr. Obiang's adviser for international organizations, Agapito Mba-Mokuy, contends that critics are unfairly singling out Equatorial Guinea for scrutiny. The tactic of opponents ''to this African prize,'' he said in a recent interview with the magazine Afrique-Asie, is ''to add an endless list of criteria'' about human rights and discrimination.
 ''There are around 30 prizes in Unesco,'' he said. ''Why is it that so many additional criteria are added only to this first, and so far only, scientific donation of this kind from an African member state?''
 Scientific grants, he said, benefit everyone. ''Africa needs science even more so than developed countries,'' he said. ''Without science, the continent will only clean the train that is taking others to the technological age of tomorrow.''
 The prize jury met in late May but has not announced a decision, Ms. Williams, the agency spokeswoman, said. A diplomat said that one juror from Hong Kong resigned in protest, and the jury advised Ms. Bokova to consult with member states on how to proceed.
 The diplomatic effort now, diplomats and officials said, is to find a way to persuade African states of the potential damage to Unesco and to agree to change the structure of the prize, without appearing to concede on questions of principle to the non-African world.
 The board meets again on June 15.

HEADLINE: Hungary Is Playing Debt Games

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting.

 BODY:
By the numbers, Hungary is not Greece.
 Its budget deficit is about one-half that of Greece. It does not use the euro and so could, if pressed, lift exports by devaluing its own currency, the forint. And it is in the middle of an economic overhaul program with the International Monetary Fund and can call upon an additional $2 billion if needed.
 But that did not prevent the politically charged comments made last week by senior Hungarian officials from sending world markets into a tailspin on Friday.
 The reason, perhaps, is that the newly elected center-right prime minister, Viktor Orban -- like other political leaders in Europe -- is finding it nearly impossible to satisfy two very different constituencies: disaffected voters who are unwilling to see their pay and benefits cut further, and the European Union, the I.M.F. and bond investors, who are demanding ever deeper austerity measures as a way of reducing debt. 
 Compounding this dilemma is the increasingly stagnant condition of the European economies. On Friday, Eurostat, the statistical arm of the European Union, released data showing that euro zone economies grew just 0.2 percent in the first quarter, putting the region last among all the major global economies -- even behind slumbering Japan.
 Japan, however, has a new and comparatively activist prime minister who some analysts say will stimulate its long-dormant domestic economy. So worries are now building that Europe will become the world's next growth laggard.
 If Europe's recovery is snuffed out by its debt problems, it will pose a danger to the global economy as a whole -- a threat highlighted over the weekend in a letter the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, sent to finance officials at a Group of 20 summit meeting in South Korea.
 ''Without further progress on rebalancing global demand, global growth rates will fall short of potential,'' Mr. Geithner wrote. ''In this context, we are concerned by the projected weakness in domestic demand in Europe and Japan.''
 Spain, Greece and Ireland are battling to balance the growth-choking effects of government austerity programs, while Germany -- to the disappointment of many -- seems to be focusing more on pushing through its own budget cuts instead of stimulating its economy, which grew only 0.2 percent last quarter.
 And while Britain's growth rate of 0.3 percent last quarter beat that of the euro zone, its own economy -- more reliant on government spending than peripheral euro zone economies like Greece and Spain -- will also suffer when the new government of Prime Minister David Cameron follows through with its promises of deep cuts in public spending.
 Against this backdrop of slower growth in the euro zone, in Britain and in surrounding Eastern European economies like Hungary, last week's inflammatory comments by Hungarian government spokesmen carried a more powerful punch.
 Peter Szijjarto, a spokesman for the new prime minister, was quoted Friday by news agencies as saying that the Hungarian economy was in a ''very grave situation.'' He even raised the specter of a default, saying such speculation ''isn't an exaggeration.'' 
 The day before, Lajos Kosa, a vice president of Fidesz, the governing center-right party, and other officials warned that Hungary was in danger of suffering a Greek-style crisis, with budget deficits possibly reaching 7.5 percent of G.D.P. this year. (They were officially 4 percent of gross domestic product in 2009.)
 After the comments, the forint slid, the yield on 10-year Hungarian government bonds surged and shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange tumbled.
 Over the weekend, the Hungarian government took pains to assure shaken investors that it was nowhere near bankrupt and that it intended to meet the deficit target of 3.8 percent of G.D.P.
 Mr. Szijjarto also said Sunday that the introduction of a 16 percent flat tax on personal income was among the possibilities discussed at a three-day meeting on the country's economy. 
 The notion that Hungary might report a higher deficit has raised concerns within the country about the accounting of past governments and the possibility that they relied heavily on off-balance-sheet mechanisms to finance large infrastructure investments.
 Speaking on background, government officials and bankers advising the government said over the weekend that Hungary was committed to continuing the deficit reduction begun by the outgoing Socialist government. And while they admitted that it was possible the deficit could overshoot its 2010 target, they said this would be caused more by differences over how to account for the finances of municipal and government-owned public entities than Greek-style number massaging.
 Nonetheless, while likening Hungary to Greece may unnerve international investors, the comparison has domestic political merits. On the one hand, it could steel a reluctant populace for tougher spending cuts to come; on the other, it gives the government bargaining power to push through tax cuts and other deficit-busting measures that might stimulate growth.
 ''It is all about growth now,'' said a government official who declined to be identified, having not been authorized to speak publicly. 
 Such political gamesmanship could also backfire, with investors bolting the forint, as happened last week, and refusing to continue to finance the budget deficit. (Recent bond auctions have already been met by very weak demand.)
 ''If you were a neoconservative banker, you could believe that they were going to pursue a proper internal devaluation -- and if you were an indebted small businessperson in the countryside, you could believe they were going to cut your taxes to offset increased loan repayments,'' said Mark Pittaway, a history professor at the Open University in Britain with an expertise in Hungarian politics and economics. ''Even with a perfect economic situation, not all of these things could be true, and some parts of this constituency were going to be very upset.''
 Indeed, according to Goldman Sachs, Hungary's projected growth rate of 0.1 percent is one of the lowest in all of Europe, and a number of analysts in Hungary are forecasting a negative number -- although that would be an improvement over the 6.2 percent contraction in 2009. 
 In Hungary -- a small, open economy that traditionally depends on exports to drive growth -- there is also a view that officials invoked the specter of a Greece-style financial meltdown to talk down the value of the forint and thus make Hungarian exporters more competitive in world markets.
 But 75 percent of Hungary's exports go to a slowing euro zone economy, whose officials seem more inclined to talk down the euro to spur the region's own exports, rather than work to stimulate domestic demand. Given that, Hungary is unlikely to get the desired effect of a sharp increase in exports.
 So, although the politics of last week's comparison to Greece may well have been local, the cause of it -- Europe's declining growth -- will remain decidedly global as long as Hungary's debts and deficits remain as high as they are.

HEADLINE: After Graduation, Back to the Sing Sing Cellblock, With Hope

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
OSSINING, N.Y.
 The graduates in caps and gowns wore black. The prison guards wore blue. The view of the Hudson was dazzling save for the razor wire coiled at the top of the chain-link fence outside. 
 It was graduation night at Sing Sing, and perhaps 400 people were in attendance. There were the new graduates -- almost all of the 32 inmates getting their bachelor of science and associate's diplomas -- as well as many of the 155 past graduates who were still in prison and some others who had come back for a night.
 There were beaming family members and friends. And then there were Harry Belafonte, Warren Buffett and his sister Doris Buffett, a regular donor to Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison, which organizes and supports the college program at Sing Sing and two other prisons. 
 If graduation season is about hope and new horizons, if all of us have a shot at redemption, if a college degree is about more than the decal on the rear window, it was one heck of a graduation Wednesday night at the maximum security prison 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. 
 ''Prison is the place where faith is tested,'' said the commencement speaker, Felipe Luciano, the poet, journalist and advocate for Latino and African-American issues, who had served time in prison for manslaughter. ''You are here because you were there. But if you pass this, you are good to go.''
 And when he said the men of the class of the 2010, ''educated, whole and courageous,'' were candidates for a new Peace Corps of men who knew the streets, knew the prisons and knew themselves, there was no reason to think he was wrong.
 ''I'm not a do-gooder; I'm not flaky -- I believe in this because it works,'' Ms. Buffett said. ''No one can leave here unconvinced.'' 
 Among those convinced was Mr. Buffett, who drove up to Sing Sing after testifying before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. He visited the cellblocks, attended the graduation, mingled with graduates and their families and posed for pictures.
 ''I've been to lots of graduation exercises, and almost every time, after a half-hour you start to feel your eyes closing,'' he said. ''This one I was there for four hours, and it was all fascinating.''
 In one of our periodic get-tough spasms in the 1990s, the federal and state governments forbade giving government education grants to convicted felons, in effect killing off hundreds of programs providing education to prison inmates. One response was Hudson Link, established in 1998 to restore the classes with private funding. It began offering courses at Sing Sing in June 2000 with 22 students taught by Nyack College faculty. Since then, the program has been taught by professors from Mercy College, offering four-year programs leading to a bachelor's degree in behavioral science.
 So far, there have been 196 graduates. An additional 107 inmates are currently enrolled. There's a 2.5-year waiting list. Of the 196 graduates, 41 have been released. Not one has returned to prison. Nationally, about 60 percent of inmates released from prison come back.
 Inmates, who make perhaps $12 to $15 every two weeks working at the prison, pay $10 per semester, which comes from money they could use for cigarettes or candy at the prison commissary. Classes are held at night, Mondays through Thursdays, while the other prisoners use that time for recreation. The students have no Internet access, and return to read and study in their 6-foot-by-9-foot cells.
 Despite conditions seemingly unconducive to higher learning, teachers say the inmates are remarkable students, curious, focused, hungry to learn. 
 ''These men are extremely motivated,'' said Jo Ann Skousen, an English professor. ''They're always in class on time, always prepared. If I assign one act of a play, they'll have read the whole thing.''
 Most are in for murder, serving sentences measured in decades. Like the graduating class speaker, Chris Payton, his words full of recognition of the irrevocable hurt he had caused to his victim and to his family, graduates reflected stark acceptance of what they had done wrong and gratitude for the transformative experience in a place where hope often goes to die.
 ''You can become roadkill here,'' said Rashan Smalls, a 2009 graduate. ''If you don't believe you have options, you can't move forward. But this program is all about providing hope. It's given me a new life.''
 It was almost 9. ''I need all of the inmates to report to the rear of the room,'' a guard called out. The guests were ushered out one by one through the vaultlike steel door and metal detector into the sticky night. The graduates, hope pushing out despair for a night, headed back to the cavernous cellblock, the noise and the stink, back to Sing Sing.

HEADLINE: After Displays of Rage, Skipping Town Halls

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
BEL AIR, Md. -- The reception that Representative Frank Kratovil Jr., a Democrat, received here one night last week as he faced a small group of constituents was far more pleasant than his encounters during a Congressional recess last summer.
 Then, he was hanged in effigy by protesters. This time, a round of applause was followed by a glass of chilled wine, a plate of crackers and crudites as he mingled with an invitation-only audience at the Point Breeze Credit Union, a vastly different scene than last year's wide-open televised free-for-alls. 
 The sentiment that fueled the rage during those Congressional forums is still alive in the electorate. But the opportunities for voters to openly express their displeasure, or angrily vent as video cameras roll, have been harder to come by in this election year.
 If the time-honored tradition of the political meeting is not quite dead, it seems to be teetering closer to extinction. Of the 255 Democrats who make up the majority in the House, only a handful held town-hall-style forums as legislators spent last week at home in their districts.
 It was no scheduling accident. 
 With images of overheated, finger-waving crowds still seared into their minds from the discontent of last August, many Democrats heeded the advice of party leaders and tried to avoid unscripted question-and-answer sessions. The recommendations were clear: hold events in controlled settings -- a bank or credit union, for example -- or tour local businesses or participate in community service projects.
 And to reach thousands of constituents at a time, without the worry of being snared in an angry confrontation with voters, more lawmakers are also taking part in a fast-growing trend: the telephone town meeting, where chances are remote that a testy exchange will wind up on YouTube.
 For incumbents of both parties facing challenging re-election bids, few things receive more scrutiny than how, when and where they interact with voters. Many members of Congress err on the side of being visible, but not too visible, and make only a few public appearances while they are back in their districts. 
 In New Hampshire, where open political meetings are deeply ingrained in the state's traditions, Representative Carol Shea-Porter's campaign Web site had this message for visitors: ''No upcoming events scheduled. Please visit us again soon!''
 Ms. Shea-Porter, a Democrat, attended a state convention of letter carriers on Saturday, but she did not hold a town-hall-style meeting during the Congressional recess. In 2006, when she was an underdog candidate for the House, she often showed up at the meetings of her Republican rival, Representative Jeb Bradley, to question him about Iraq.
 In Iowa, where voters also are accustomed to coming face to face with elected officials, Representative Leonard L. Boswell, a Democrat, provided few opportunities for voters to see him last week. His itinerary included a groundbreaking for a new law enforcement center and a renaming ceremony for a Des Moines post office. 
 In Maryland, where Mr. Kratovil endured considerable heckling last year over the health care legislation, which he ultimately opposed, he did not hold any large gatherings with voters. After returning from a visit to Afghanistan, he held two events with veterans before arriving at an evening discussion here at the credit union in Bel Air, north of Baltimore.
 ''It's dramatically different this break than it was in August of last year,'' Mr. Kratovil said in an interview after he finished speaking about financial regulatory legislation. ''At town halls, there was a group of people who were there to disrupt, purely politically driven, not there because they wanted to get answers or discuss the issues.''
 Mr. Kratovil said seeing voters in their workplace, or in casual settings like soccer fields, actually provided a broader sampling of public opinion than simply holding formal town-hall-style meetings, which often attract only political activists.
 An examination of public schedules for dozens of members of Congress last week showed that more House Republicans held open meetings, including several in a series of forums called America Speaking Out, which is intended to help write the party's agenda if it wins control of Congress in November.
 The anger that erupted at meetings last summer -- focused, particularly, on the health care legislation -- helped draw attention to Tea Party activists. A year later, some of the images are resurfacing once again and will almost certainly be used against lawmakers in television advertisements over the next five months.
 Representative Rick Boucher, a Democrat who has represented a wide part of southwestern Virginia for 28 years, has often encountered fierce criticism during his sessions with voters. But he said it was worth listening to the critiques, which often sound nearly identical as he travels across the 23 counties of his district.
 ''Obviously the town meetings are magnets for people who have a political agenda, but it's worth putting up with the talking-point-induced political dialogue to get good ideas,'' said Mr. Boucher, who was one of the few Democrats last week who did hold a wide-open meeting, which took place Saturday at the high school in Floyd, Va.
 ''I guess I'm old-fashioned,'' said Mr. Boucher, adding that he preferred visiting with voters in person, rather than communicating with them through ''tele-town-hall'' meetings, a sort of conference call that can include thousands of homes that has been on the rise since the technology was first used in 2006. ''I have no plans of changing my approach to this.''
 Representative Tom Perriello, a first-term Virginia Democrat, held 21 open meetings last August during the heat of the health care debate. He said that each of the sessions lasted an average of five hours, often ending well after midnight.
 ''We thought that the best strategy was to let people talk,'' Mr. Perriello said. ''It was important to stay until people had everything off of their minds.''
 Not last week. The meetings were traded for other stops in Mr. Perriello's central Virginia district, including an elementary school that received broadband Internet through the economic stimulus plan. He also dropped by several businesses, hoping to take the pulse on what he said were the chief issues for his constituents: jobs and the economy.
 Without so many lengthy meetings on his agenda, he said he had more time for impromptu encounters with voters. Constituents who were following along received updated information on Twitter, including this bulletin just before lunchtime one day: ''Now stopping for a hot dog at Moore's Country Store!''

HEADLINE: Policy and Politics Collide On the President's Path

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
President Obama, struggling for balance on a political oil slick, gave a speech last week that seemed to contradict itself.
 One part was ferociously partisan. He criticized Republicans for obstructionism, ascribing that stance to crass electoral strategy and a ''sincere and fundamental belief'' that every problem's solution involved tax cuts for the wealthy and less regulation for corporations.
 Another part called for legislative compromise. He asked Republicans to join, in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, in salvaging comprehensive energy legislation that both parties had largely given up for dead. 
 ''The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months,'' Mr. Obama declared. ''I will work with anyone to get this done -- and we will get it done.''
 Onto that fresh pile of presidential poker chips, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, threw a few more. Citing the need to hold ''BP and other oil polluters'' accountable, Mr. Reid directed committee leaders to offer ideas for energy legislation by July 4 with the goal of Senate action this summer.
 If the mix of political and policy imperatives makes the road map for Mr. Obama and his party appear unclear, that is because it is.
 Looking to 2011
 Mr. Obama has long advocated comprehensive legislation as critical for creating a new ''green energy'' economy, ending dependence on foreign oil and curbing global warming. But prospects had dimmed well before the oil rig exploded on April 20.
 Fights over economic stimulus, health care and financial regulation had exhausted Democratic lawmakers, many battling to survive midterm elections.
 The administration's energy centerpiece -- a system to limit carbon dioxide emissions that opponents deride as ''cap and tax'' -- appeared harder to achieve than the health bill. The oil spill made it harder still, undercutting Mr. Obama's effort to woo Republicans through support for expanded offshore drilling.
 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who this spring abandoned negotiations on a comprehensive bill with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said in an interview that he would remain on the sidelines.
 Mr. Graham expects Democrats to focus on oil companies in a revamped Kerry-Lieberman proposal, then dare Republicans to oppose it as tar balls wash onto gulf beaches.
 ''I could easily accept that dare,'' Mr. Graham said. Noting that energy-state Democrats also have reservations, he dismissed Mr. Obama's renewed push as ''all politics'' -- a ''head fake'' in response to pressure from environmentalists over the oil spill.
 The real action on energy, Mr. Graham predicted, will come in 2011.
 With a weaker hand in Congress after expected Democratic midterm losses, Mr. Obama could use his authority to regulate carbon through the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans could counter with more limited steps: capping emissions for utilities only, an idea Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, has discussed, and enhancing auto fuel efficiency, as Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, plans to propose on Monday.
 The question then: whether a Republican caucus strengthened by anti-government Tea Party activists would countenance compromise.
 ''The people who come in 2011 will have ridden a tiger to get here, and they'll be worried the tiger will turn on them,'' Mr. Graham said. But to protect American jobs, achieve energy independence and preserve credibility with environmentally sensitive younger voters, he added, Republicans must ''tame the tiger.''
 Hoping for 2010
 Obama advisers insist comprehensive legislation this year, if a long shot, is not yet a lost cause. 
 Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, cited potential ingredients: the Kerry-Lieberman bill; Mr. Lugar's plan; a proposal by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, to increase utilities' use of renewable energy; a plan by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, to tie carbon curbs to consumer rebates. 
 ''There's enough in each,'' Mr. Emanuel said, to assemble ''a serious and comprehensive energy bill. And you can do it this year.''
 Mr. Kerry, who has sought a Senate counterpart to the broad-ranging bill that has passed the House, expressed receptiveness to a more incremental approach if necessary.
 ''We have to get started, and I'm open to discussions on how to do that,'' he said. ''Maybe we can't get the full regime of pricing carbon in one fell swoop -- but we get started.''
 About the prediction from his erstwhile partner Mr. Graham, Mr. Kerry said, ''I don't know how he thinks we're going to change the bill.'' Democrats themselves have not decided.
 Besides, Mr. Kerry noted, a ''new coalition'' including leading industries he has pursued needs ''an opportunity to work its will.'' Among three major oil companies in that coalition: BP.

HEADLINE: Congress Is Pressed To Complete Reform Bill

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Congressional negotiators begin this week to merge two bills overhauling the financial system, the White House wants them to reach an agreement before President Obama leaves for a Group of 20 meeting this month in Toronto.
 The administration has tried to use the summit meeting to foster a sense of urgency among lawmakers. It thinks a deal would give Mr. Obama greater leverage in efforts to persuade other countries to support proposals like a global bank tax and higher capital standards for the largest financial institutions. The higher standards are part of the legislation but would require international coordination.
 ''We're on the verge of legislating sweeping reforms of our financial system, to fix what was broken in our system, recognizing that those failures in the United States were very consequential to the world as a whole,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said last week before leaving to meet with G-20 financial ministers in South Korea. 
 But first, Congressional negotiators must resolve substantial differences between the bills, which together total more than 3,000 pages and amount to the most extensive rewriting of financial regulations since the Great Depression. The process will begin formally on Thursday with a meeting of more than 20 lawmakers from both parties and both houses of Congress. 
 ''I think it is very important for the stability of the economy for this to get done,'' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a Democrat and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He said that Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, had urged him to produce a consensus report by June 24, when Mr. Obama is expected to leave for Toronto. 
 A White House spokeswoman, Amy Brundage, said over the weekend that Mr. Obama was looking forward to discussing the financial overhaul at the G-20 meeting and reiterated that ''he hopes to sign financial reform into law by July Fourth.''
 Perhaps the foremost question is whether to force giant banks to spin off their lucrative operations trading derivatives, the complex instruments that were at the heart of the financial crisis. Adding a political twist, the author of that provision, Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, faces a Democratic primary runoff on Tuesday.
 No matter the outcome of the runoff, the provision faces substantial opposition, not only from Wall Street but also from regulators like Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Also, the administration does not support it. 
 In a final, ferocious round of lobbying, big banks are also trying to influence negotiations on whether to curb the fees that retailers must pay when customers swipe credit and debit cards -- as the Senate bill seeks to do -- and how strictly to impose a ban on proprietary trading, or banks' making market bets with their own money. 
 The Senate bill directs regulators to impose such a ban, known as the Volcker Rule, after a period of study; the House version would merely permit the Fed to ban proprietary trading if it threatened the overall stability of the financial system. Most banks prefer the House version.
 Supermarkets and other merchants support the Senate bill's limits on the so-called interchange fees on card transactions, which the House bill does not address. Banks say the limits would result in fewer options for consumers, particularly in low-income areas where debit cards are commonly used instead of credit cards. 
 The House passed the legislation in December, and the Senate approved it last month. Many in Congress will return on Monday from their Memorial Day recess with an appetite to complete the legislation. Mr. Frank has vowed to get a final bill to Mr. Obama's desk before Independence Day. He called June 24 a target, not a deadline. 
 In a May 27 letter, Senate Republicans, led by Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the banking committee, told Democrats, ''The conference's work is too important to be bound by artificial deadlines.''
 The Senate negotiators are seven Democrats and five Republicans; the chief negotiator is Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a Democrat, who is the chairman of the Banking Committee. 
 Mr. Frank has recommended a list of House negotiators and said he expected Speaker Nancy Pelosi to complete the list on Wednesday. Then, according to the Democrats' plan, the committee will meet on Thursday and have six more days -- June 15, 16 and 17 and 22, 23 and 24 -- to complete its work. The panel will ''start with the Senate bill as the base text,'' Mr. Frank said. 
 He predicted that much of the negotiating time would be spent on three areas: Mrs. Lincoln's derivatives provision, the Volcker Rule and the interchange fees that retailers pay issuers of credit and debit cards. He said that the Senate version was better at tightening restrictions on derivatives trading and that he favored ''some very tough form of the Volcker Rule,'' but he stopped short of endorsing the Lincoln provision.
 Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council, and one of his deputies, Diana Farrell, met on Wednesday with liberal advocacy groups as part of a White House strategy to keep pressure on Congress.
 ''Summers's message for us was really, keep up the fight,'' said Heather C. McGhee, the Washington director of Demos, a liberal policy organization, who was part of the meeting. 
 Although both versions of the legislation are modeled largely on a blueprint the Obama administration put forward last June, and were approved despite stiff Republican opposition, cheering among Democrats has been muted. 
 ''This bill is on track to being the most misguided piece of federal banking regulation in the past half-century,'' said Richard S. Carnell, a Fordham law professor who was assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions during the Clinton administration. 
 Mr. Carnell, a Democrat, said the legislation mostly gave a Congressional blessing to powers that regulators possessed, but failed to exercise, before the crisis. ''If regulators didn't have the fortitude to do unpopular things before, why will they have the fortitude to do them now?'' he asked. 
 While the two bills would empower the government to seize and dismantle financial institutions on the verge of failure, Robert A. Johnson, director of the economic policy initiative at the Franklin & Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, and a former Senate economist, said they ''stop short of insulating the taxpayer from further bailouts, which is what Dodd and the Obama administration have advertised as the capacity of those powers.'' 
 Another part of the legislation would create a consumer financial protection agency. Under the House bill, the agency would stand alone, while the Senate bill would put the agency within the Fed. In either case, the agency would have an independent director and budget. The House version of the bill would exempt auto dealers from the ambit of the new agency; the Senate bill does not contain the loophole, which Mr. Obama opposes.

HEADLINE: Challenger In Arkansas Is Unafraid To Ruffle

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Lara Bergthold, a left-wing political consultant, has a word of advice for the labor unions and national liberal groups that recruited the challenger who is giving Senator Blanche Lincoln the fight of her political life: caveat emptor.
 Senator Lincoln, a two-term Democrat, had been judged too conservative, and her critics found a willing alternative in Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, whom they hailed as a ''true progressive.'' 
 But Ms. Bergthold, who spent weeks in 2003 working with Mr. Halter on Gen. Wesley K. Clark's presidential campaign, said Mr. Halter had been among the most conservative voices in the room, even pooh-poohing the importance of meeting with labor unions and other key segments of the Democratic base.
 Now, Ms. Bergthold worries that the groups that have poured millions of dollars into his campaign might not know what they are getting. Compared with Mrs. Lincoln, a senator for 12 years, Mr. Halter is a political cipher, with no voting record and several chapters of his history unexamined. 
 ''I don't like to see him turned into a progressive darling on the national stage when I know him to be something different,'' Ms. Bergthold said. ''He's a political opportunist.''
 But what critics call opportunism, supporters say is simply a willingness to buck the established political order. With union firepower behind him, Mr. Halter finished only two points behind Mrs. Lincoln in the May 18 primary, forcing her into a runoff. 
 A successful primary challenge against such a high-ranking incumbent is highly unusual, but Mr. Halter has astutely capitalized on the discontent with Mrs. Lincoln on the part of both national groups and Arkansas voters. 
 His ambition, though, has disenchanted a long list of former allies, beginning with his first adult job in Arkansas in the early 1990s, as director of a public policy group. 
 Mr. Halter's biography says he grew up in North Little Rock, the son of a nurse and a small- business man. His father did not actually own a business, but ran the mortgage arm of a bank.
 The younger Mr. Halter sacked groceries, became valedictorian of Catholic High School for Boys, got a scholarship to Stanford University and became a Rhodes scholar. He worked at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, and then as the chief economist for the Senate Finance Committee.
 His first return to Little Rock was rough. In 1991, he was hired to lead the new Arkansas Institute, a now defunct organization financed by wealthy businessmen like Sam Walton of Wal-Mart. To preserve the institute's nonpartisan identity, Mr. Halter was hired on the condition that he not get involved with Bill Clinton's incipient presidential campaign, recalled Walter Smiley, then the chairman of the institute's board. 
 But Mr. Halter took to disappearing from the office in the afternoons, and staff members who disliked their boss followed him to the Clinton campaign office, Mr. Smiley said. ''He and I had clearly agreed he would not do that,'' Mr. Smiley said. ''I know I talked to him about it up front, because he was a politically inclined person.''
 Mr. Halter was fired, Mr. Smiley said.
 Mr. Halter remembers things differently, saying that he had permission to work for the Clinton campaign and that the parting from the institute was mutually agreed upon. After he left, he joined the Clinton campaign and subsequently the administration, working first in the budget office and then as deputy director of the Social Security Administration.
 His campaign literature and advertisements make much of the fact that as deputy director he fought off efforts to privatize Social Security. But in a recent interview he acknowledged that privatization was not a major threat during the Clinton years.
 After serving on the board of several technology companies, Mr. Halter joined the Clark campaign as the traveling chief of staff, quickly frustrating other team members with what they described as an overbearing style.
 ''The one thing that united the campaign was dislike of Bill Halter,'' Ms. Bergthold said. ''He was the only person I know of that left the campaign not of his own volition.'' 
 Again, Mr. Halter said he was not fired but chose to leave. General Clark did not respond to a request for comment for this article, but is supporting Mrs. Lincoln in the primary.
 In 2005, Mr. Halter moved back to Arkansas, this time with the bold plan of running for governor. At the time, the attorney general, Mike Beebe, was widely assumed to be destined for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Halter ultimately stepped aside, saying he wanted to avoid hurting Democrats in a damaging primary, and made an 11th-hour entry into the race for lieutenant governor, spending more than $1 million of his own money to defeat two current lawmakers and a former one, which did nothing to bolster his popularity in the Capitol.
 Mr. Beebe, now the governor, has made no secret that he keeps Mr. Halter at arm's length.
 While some saw the idea of challenging Mr. Beebe as pure hubris, people like Vince Chadick, a lawyer in Fayetteville who is now the treasurer of the Halter Senate campaign, found Mr. Halter's resume persuasive and said he has never understood why so many people view the candidate as conceited. 
 ''I realized what he had made of himself and what opportunities he had taken advantage of,'' Mr. Chadick said. ''I just felt like this is a guy who will not be satisfied with the status quo.'' 
 He has not been. 
 As lieutenant governor, Mr. Halter took the unheard-of step of presenting his own legislative agenda. When lawmakers declined to move forward on a state lottery to finance college scholarships, Mr. Halter conducted a petition drive to submit the issue to a referendum, and it passed in a landslide. 
 He supported increasing the minimum wage, expanding prekindergarten education, and raising teachers' pay. He also drove other politicians to distraction with his smoke signals, first flirting with running against Senator Mark Pryor, a fellow Democrat, then with entering the race to succeed Representative Vic Snyder, also a Democrat. 
 Finally, after an intense courtship by national liberal groups, he challenged Mrs. Lincoln.
 Skeptical liberals argue that a lottery is hardly the most progressive way to finance education, and point to instances like Mr. Halter's repeated assertion that he supported a ban on gay foster parents during his 2006 campaign, when he faced a Republican opponent who campaigned on social issues. Two years later, Mr. Halter joined Mr. Beebe in opposing a referendum that barred gay men and lesbians from adopting or fostering children.
 Mr. Halter says he supported a ban in 2006 only if it were constitutional and proved to be in the best interests of children. 
 But while Mr. Halter may not pass a liberal purity test, he has never claimed that he would. Instead, he has struck a populist chord, saying that he would have supported a public option similar to Medicare in the health care bill, that he is more fiscally conservative than Mrs. Lincoln, and that he would most likely favor some version of a compromise bill that would make it easier to unionize.
 But when he is asked about his union support, he responds that he has nothing to do with campaigning by outside groups. 
 He has been an extraordinarily disciplined campaigner, always on message even during lengthy interviews. Cross-examined about his decisions to seek office, the answer is always that people out there, real Arkansans, asked him to run. He says the thing he hates most about campaigning is -- no surprise -- the time away from his wife, Shanti, and two daughters, ages 1 and 3. 
 Asked -- beseeched -- for a telling anecdote not within his rehearsed repertory, he tells of a voter who was grateful that the lottery would pay tuition for her three children.
 Mr. Halter has proved astute in other ways, taking his case for a Senate seat directly to the voters, just as he did with the lottery. 
 ''I hope that people will see that I'm doing the best that I can possibly do to advance policies that will help middle-class Arkansans,'' he said. ''If that means bucking special interest groups, fine, I'm built to take that. Look at my experience as lieutenant governor as actual experience doing that. If I've got a little political scar tissue, that's fine.''

HEADLINE: Policy Makers Need to Lead in Economic Recovery

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman (''The Pain Caucus,'' column, May 31) accuses the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of urging policy makers to ''stop promoting economic recovery and instead begin raising interest rates and slashing spending.'' I would like to clarify the O.E.C.D.'s position. 
 We do not advocate monetary contraction in the United States. In our view, stimulus should continue until the economy returns to full employment. But that does not mean that the authorities should stand by and do nothing. Recent events in Europe have sounded a warning signal regarding fiscal deficits and rising public debt. To manage these risks in the present unsettled financial environment, policy makers have to get out ahead of markets. Otherwise, markets can suddenly and sharply narrow the room for policy maneuver.
 To be sure, not every country is in the same situation. Some countries, like Greece, have no real choice but to reduce their deficits now, even though it will hurt. In the United States, President Obama's plan to reduce deficits gradually over the next five years is a good tradeoff between stemming a potentially dangerous increase in the national debt and preserving the economic recovery.
 On the interest rate front, however, the need to be forward-looking means beginning to ease up gradually on monetary stimulus by the end of this year. Effectively zero interest rates are creating distortions in capital markets. Monetary conditions need to be back to normal by the time economic slack disappears and inflationary pressures begin to reassert themselves.
 Raising real interest rates above zero would signal a commitment to contain inflation, helping to check inflationary expectations and hold down market interest rates two and three years into the future. Alternatively, if there is more fiscal tightening, interest rates can remain lower for longer. The crucial point is that policy needs to be forward-looking if governments are to seize the initiative back from financial markets.
 To be clear, staying ahead of the markets requires pre-emptive action to avoid sudden changes in policy later. In particular, policy makers should try to avoid being put in a position of having to raise interest rates abruptly at a later stage to keep inflationary expectations under control.
 Pier Carlo Padoan Paris, June 2, 2010

HEADLINE: Sit Under the Apple Tree With Me, Juice Brand Asks

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Want to know a juicy marketing secret? As soft drinks contend with challenges like health concerns and the economy, juices are stepping up their advertising efforts.
 Mott's returned to television last year, for the first time in a decade, and is bringing out this month a new variety, Mott's Medleys Juice. Welch's has a new campaign, as does Juicy Juice.
 Campbell Soup is enjoying higher sales of products like V8 and V8 V-Fusion juices. Apple & Eve has Fruitables, a blend of fruit and vegetable juices, and Ocean Spray is introducing a line of blueberry juice drinks.
 Now joining the juiced-up jamboree is Tree Top apple juice, sold by Tree Top, a growers' co-operative in the Pacific Northwest that is commemorating its 50th anniversary this year. Tree Top, the co-op, is introducing a campaign on Monday for Tree Top, the apple juice, with the product's first consumer ads in several years. 
 The idea behind the campaign by the Tree Top creative agency, Cole & Weber United in Seattle, part of the United unit of WPP, is ''Words to grow by.'' Consumers are being invited to share their own words at a microsite, or special Web site, which is going live on Monday.
 The focus on growth is intended to appeal to the primary target audience for the campaign, which is mothers of children ages 6 and under. They are big buyers of apple juice, a staple in households with youngsters.
 The campaign includes, in addition to the microsite, print advertisements, ads online and a prominent presence in social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter.
 Elements of the campaign like the print ads are being concentrated in markets where the Tree Top co-op is best known, which include California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
 The campaign is planned to appear through October, step aside during the holiday season and return after the new year begins.
 As for the budget, ''on a nationalized, annualized basis,'' it would be ''a few million dollars,'' says Dan Hagerty, senior vice president for sales and marketing the Tree Top co-op in Selah, Wash.
 By comparison, the co-op spent about $585,000 on advertising last year, he says, which included ads aimed at encouraging food makers to use its apples in producing their products.
 According to Kantar Media, a division of WPP that tracks ad spending, the Tree Top co-op spent even less on ads before that: $203,000 in 2007 and $184,000 in 2008.
 ''We have been on a bit of an advertising hiatus for the last few years,'' Mr. Hagerty says, and ''we had to concentrate more on trade and consumer incentives to keep our business moving forward.''
 But ''we now have the money to reinvest in the brand,'' he adds, and help consumers learn about the co-op origins of Tree Top products.
 ''We're a sleepy little co-op in Selah, Wash., that's been around for 50 years,'' Mr. Hagerty says, ''and when people find that out, that it's owned by the growers, they think it's cool.''
 ''The more they know about it, the more engaged they are with the brand,'' he adds, particularly among shoppers for whom buying American-made products is important.
 That is why Tree Top ads carry the theme ''Real fruit from real people'' and the new campaign seeks to point out the similarities between the co-op's growers and mothers.
 ''The whole campaign proposition is that it's great to do a job you love,'' Mr. Hagerty says, and that applies to moms as much as to apple farmers and vice versa.
 ''Raising a family is obviously a difficult job, but you wouldn't trade it in for anything,'' he says in summarizing the beliefs of mothers. That echoes ''the way our growers described their jobs: hard, but they couldn't imagine doing anything else,'' he adds.
 And just as mothers tell anyone who asks that hard times are not an excuse for bailing out on their families, Mr. Hagerty says, growers would say ''just because there's a bad crop, you don't rip out the trees.''
 (Is that the reason misbehaving children are called bad apples?)
 The roots of Tree Top in a growers' cooperative are clearly an inspiration for the home-grown, homespun look of the campaign. The print ads and treetopwordstogrowby.com use a folksy type of art known as paper cuttings, in this instance created by Jayme McGowan, who writes a journal about her work at roadside projects.blogspot.com.
 Ms. McGowan, who will herself ''be a mom pretty soon,'' Mr. Hagerty says, was found by Cole & Weber on the craft marketplace Web site Etsy.
 ''Today, building brands is about shared values, values consumers can relate to,'' says Mike Doherty, president at Cole & Weber, like the ''passion'' and ''common sense values'' of the Tree Top growers.
 Here, the intent is ''connecting moms with the values of these authentic people,'' he adds, who come from ''a real place, not a fake, made-up place'' like, say, Nature Valley, the brand name for products sold by General Mills.
 One print ad, bearing the headline ''Cultivate Happy,'' shows a farmer on a tractor, followed by a dog, with apple trees in the background.
 ''Meet grower John, one of our many apple growers here at Tree Top,'' the text begins, then continues: ''You see, to John this is the best darn job in the world. He gets to play in the dirt, drive a big ol' tractor and hang out with his dog.''
 ''Oh, and he also gets to grow and harvest some of the world's finest apples that make some pretty amazing juice,'' the text declares.
 A 15-second video version of the print ad, which brings Ms. McGowan's cut-paper artwork to life, can be watched on YouTube.
 In a second print ad, bearing the headline ''Sample Joy,'' a woman in a lab coat, holding a clipboard, stands next to a picnic table where a man, boy and girl are trying Tree Top apple juice and apples. A sign nearby reads, ''Free Tasting.''
 ''Meet Sonia,'' the text starts, then goes on: ''She's a quality control expert for Tree Top. That's really just a fancy way of saying that she gets to talk with juice lovers, offer them samples and listen to their opinions. All to make sure each glass of our juice is just as good as the last.''
 ''Her job is all about bringing smiles to people's faces -- and we wouldn't have it any other way,'' the ad says.
 A third print ad, with the headline ''Harvest Good,'' is planned.
 All the print ads will encourage readers to visit treetopwordstogrowby.com and describe what the phrases like ''Cultivate Happy'' and ''Sample Joy'' mean to them. The comments contributed by visitors to the microsite, along with content created by Tree Top employees, will be combined to form an online version of a quilt.
 Once on the microsite, visitors will also be able to do things like vote for their favorite content, sort the material by categories (among them, quotations and stories), share content with friends and download material.
 ''The modern mom is plugged in,'' Mr. Hagerty says, ''engaged in the Internet and heavy users of social networking.''
 During the research for the campaign, he adds, when mothers were asked to share photo journals ''every other picture was sent on an iPhone or from a laptop.''
 ''There's no way in the world we could outspend'' the juice giants like Mott's, Mr. Hagerty says. ''It's not in the cards.''
 But ''if we can get moms engaged and understanding who we are and wanting to talk to other moms about that,'' he adds, they can serve as brand advocates and evangelists for Tree Top.
 Mr. Doherty says that because mothers are ''active in all these places'' online, ''it makes them crave grounding even more in the things that are real and authentic.''
 That benefits Tree Top, as a grower-owned co-op, he adds, along with ''something to apple juice, pure and simple.''
 The print ads will run in magazines like American Baby, Baby Talk, Family Fun, Parenting, Parents and Working Mother.
 The digital ads will appear on Web sites and so-called mommy blogs like about.com, Baby Center, Cafe Mom, Circle of Moms, Facebook, ivillage.com and Moms Like Me along with sites that are part of the Walt Disney Company online network.
 During the years that the Tree Top co-op was not running consumer advertising, Cole & Weber remained its creative agency.
 ''There were two or three years when all I did was pick up the phone and say, 'We're still here,' '' Mr. Hagerty says, and at one point, he even sent ''a letter of termination.''
 The agency replied that it would refuse the letter, he adds, ''and said, 'When you're ready to advertise again, we want to be your guys.' ''
 Mr. Doherty recalls how Cole & Weber remained stalwart while its client ''retrenched.''
 ''We told them we would not take a retainer and 'we'll be here for you on a project basis,' '' he says. ''They came back at the end of last year and said they were ready to roll again.''
 Talk about cultivating happy, sampling joy and harvesting good.

HEADLINE: Cap Said to Recover 10,000 Barrels of Oil a Day

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston. Reporting was contributed by Michael Cooper in New Orleans; Jackie Calmes and John M. Broder in Washington, and Maria Newman and Joseph Berger in New York.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- A cap placed over a ruptured well spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico is capturing about 10,000 barrels a day, indicating engineers are making some progress in stanching the flow, Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, who is commanding the federal response to the disaster, said Sunday.
 ''We're slowly raising production,'' he said in an interview on the ABC television news program ''This Week.'' 
 But he also cautioned in a separate appearance on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' that even if the ultimate strategy -- two relief wells -- finally succeed in plugging the leak one mile below the surface of the gulf, it would take ''well into the fall'' to clean up the beaches and marshes sullied by the oil and to address other environmental harm. ''This is a very, very, very tough problem,'' he said, when asked if the disaster would end soon.
 Early Saturday, engineers were able to divert only 6,000 barrels in a 24-hour period to a ship on the surface as they worked to close two of four vents on the containment cap. But by midnight, according to Admiral Allen, the amount of oil diverted to the ship had reached 10,000 barrels.
 Admiral Allen's estimate of the effect of the new cap was echoed by Tony Hayward, the chief executive of BP, in a BBC interview broadcast Sunday, who also said that another containment system would be put in place by next weekend. ''So when those two are in place, we would very much hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil,'' Mr. Hayward said.
 Admiral Allen said that engineers hope to gradually increase the amount of oil captured into a nearby ship without jeopardizing the delicate recovery effort after so many other efforts failed in the last six weeks. The disaster began after the Deepwater Horizon drill rig exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers. 
 Oil was still escaping through four vents on the top of the cap that are designed to relieve pressure and not overstress the containment system. Admiral Allen said that if the vents were closed too quickly, cold sea water could rush in and form the kind of icy hydrates that doomed a previous attempt to cap the spill.
 The admiral had initially said that they hoped to begin closing the vents on Friday. But on Saturday he said that they had been unable to do so because the pressure inside the containment cap might become so great that oil would blast through the imperfect seal connecting it to the riser pipe.
 ''The want to raise that up to the maximum extent possible, on a daily basis, and then slowly start turning off those vents where the oil is coming out of right now when they're sure that they don't have sea water coming in,'' he said.
 It was not immediately clear how significant a gain the 10,000 barrels a day represented.
 Since the Deepwater Horizon explosion on April 20, official estimates have put the flow rate of the leak at 12,000 barrels to 19,000 barrels a day, although some scientists have said it could be substantially more. Government officials also said the volume might have increased by as much as 20 percent when engineers cut the damaged riser, which they did before lowering the containment dome.
 Technicians involved in the operation said they were concerned that as they succeed in gathering more and more oil, they may have trouble handling and storing all of it. A ship on the surface is capable of collecting 15,000 barrels a day, Admiral Allen said. 
 In his weekly radio address broadcast Saturday, President Obama emphasized that the federal government had ''mobilized on every front'' to contain and clean up the oil spill, and called attention to the plight of some of the shrimpers and oystermen he met while visiting the Louisiana coast on Friday.
 ''These folks work hard,'' the president said in the address, which he recorded Friday evening in Grand Isle, La. ''They meet their responsibilities. But now because of a manmade catastrophe -- one that's not their fault and that's beyond their control -- their lives have been thrown into turmoil. It's brutally unfair. It's wrong. And what I told these men and women -- and what I have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that I'm going to stand with the people of the Gulf Coast until they are made whole.''
 During his visit to the Gulf Coast, Mr. Obama had kept up his criticism of BP, saying the oil company had paid billions of dollars in stock dividends and spent millions on image advertising while people who suffered from the disaster were reporting difficulties getting claims paid. He reiterated that point in his address: ''We've also ordered BP to pay economic injury claims, and we will make sure they pay every single dime owed to the people along the Gulf Coast.''

HEADLINE: A Subpoena For Goldman In Inquiry

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and GRETCHEN MORGENSON; Sewell Chan reported from Washington, and Gretchen Morgenson from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The commission investigating the causes of the financial crisis said on Monday that it had subpoenaed Goldman Sachs and harshly accused the investment bank of trying to delay and disrupt its inquiry.
 ''Goldman Sachs has not, in our view, been cooperative with our requests for information, or forthcoming with respect to documents, information or interviews,'' Phil Angelides, the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, told reporters on a conference call. 
 The deputy chairman, Bill Thomas, accused Goldman of stonewalling, and said, ''They may have more to cover up than either we thought or than they told us.'' 
 But even as Goldman appeared to be uncooperative, it tried over the last month to set up personal meetings with members of the commission, two people briefed on the discussions said. 
 Lobbyists representing Goldman in Washington tried to arrange one-on-one meetings with a handful of commissioners, including Mr. Angelides, but he declined to meet with them, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the commission's inner workings. 
 Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas both said that Goldman had inundated the panel with data -- about five terabytes, equivalent to several billion printed pages -- and dragged its feet on answering detailed questions about derivatives, securitization and other business activities. 
 In particular, the commission sought records on collateralized debt obligations based on mortgage-backed securities, and the names of Goldman's customers in transactions of derivatives. In a chronology it provided, the commission also indicated that it was interested in Goldman's dealings with the American International Group, the insurance giant that collapsed in 2008, and in the bank's so-called Abacus transactions, which are at the heart of a civil fraud suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The commission's unusual public criticism -- it has issued 12 subpoenas, none accompanied by stinging accusations of obstruction -- underscored the anger in Washington at the outsize profits and influence of Goldman, which had emerged nearly unscathed from the financial crisis. It also reflected the fallout from Goldman's unyielding strategy of standing its ground in the face of inquiries and attacks. 
 A spokesman for Goldman, Michael DuVally, said, ''We have been and continue to be committed to providing the F.C.I.C. with the information they have requested.''
 The lashing by the commission further complicated Goldman's public image. In April, the bank was accused of securities fraud in a civil suit filed by the S.E.C., which contended that it created and sold a mortgage investment that was secretly devised to fail. 
 That investment and others like it were the subject of a Senate investigation that also exposed Goldman to withering criticism. And federal prosecutors in Manhattan have begun looking into the mortgage practices of banks, including Goldman. 
 The commission, created by Congress, is required to deliver a report by December, but with only $8 million and some 50 employees to draw on, it has at times seemed outmatched by the targets of its inquiries. 
 ''I suspect they're spending more on their lawyers than our whole budget,'' Mr. Thomas conceded. 
 Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, testified at the commission's first public hearing in January, with the top bankers Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley and Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America.
 After the hearing, the commission sent written questions for Mr. Blankfein and made requests for records in April and May.
 Mr. Thomas, a California Republican who served 28 years in the House, said the requests to Goldman were ''not inordinate'' compared with similar queries sent to a half-dozen other banks. All of the other institutions complied, he said.
 In contrast, Mr. Thomas said, Goldman gave a ''basically incomplete'' response, even as it deluged the commission with so much irrelevant information that it amounted to ''mischief-making'' that was both ''deliberate and disruptive.''
 Mr. Angelides, a former California treasurer and candidate for governor, said, ''We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our offices and dump a bunch of rubbish.'' He added, ''This has been a very deliberate effort over time to run out the clock.'' 
 The two men also seemed to acknowledge that the sheer volume of data was beyond the commission's capacity to analyze. ''We should not be forced to play Where's Waldo? on behalf of the American people,'' Mr. Angelides said. ''This is not right.'' 
 Mr. Thomas, turning to the proverb about looking for a needle in a haystack, said, ''We expect them to provide us with the needle.''
 The two men said that after the subpoena was issued on Friday, Goldman had moved to schedule interviews with several executives, including Mr. Blankfein; David A. Viniar, the chief financial officer; Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer; and Craig W. Broderick, the chief risk officer. 
 The 10-member commission was slow to get started. It recently replaced its executive director, B. Thomas Greene, with Wendy M. Edelberg, an economist on loan from the Federal Reserve, who had been the research director. Mr. Greene, a former chief assistant attorney general for California, remains on the commission's staff as senior counsel.

HEADLINE: When Out to Dinner, Don't Count Calories, or Watts

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
At Maialino, the Roman-style trattoria on Gramercy Park, they hover in groups of two and three. At the Standard Grill in the meatpacking district, they snake through the cafe, restaurant and patio. And at Recipe, a rustic spot on the Upper West Side, they cluster near the entrance as an enticement.
 They are not the latest cliques of beautiful people, but something quite old and plain: exposed-filament bulbs, energy-guzzling reproductions of Thomas Alva Edison's first light bulb. And despite the escalating push to go green and switch to compact fluorescents -- or perhaps because of it -- their antique glow has spread like a power surge. 
 Whether in hip hangouts tapping into the popular Victorian industrial look or elegant rooms seeking to warm up their atmosphere, the bulb has become a staple for restaurant designers, in part because it emulates candlelight and flatters both dinner and diner. 
 The filament light is now so ubiquitous that it has prompted a backlash among those who deem it overexposed -- a badge of retro cool that is fast becoming the restaurant-design equivalent of the Converse All Star. 
 Ken Friedman, an owner of nostalgic spots like the Spotted Pig and the Rusty Knot, called the look ''played out.'' In a planning session last year for the Breslin, his latest take on the British gastropub, he declared, ''No exposed bulbs!''
 And Charlie Palmer, the creator of a national hospitality empire who featured the lights in 1994 at his Flatiron district restaurant Alva said he recently dissuaded a designer from using them in a new space. ''That happened 20 years ago,'' he recalled saying. ''It's been done.''
 And yet, given all those burning amber threads dangling from cords in New York and the rest of the country, they would appear to be far from done. They remain a go-to design element, like wheatgrass in a box some years ago, for their casual air and winks at history. 
 A lot of thought and expense go into restaurant lighting -- upscale budgets easily reach six figures -- because it can shape a diner's experience almost as much as the food. Some lights favor certain colors and make others look unappetizing. But the old-fashioned bulb, though less efficient than fluorescent or L.E.D. lamps, can build an ambience at a relatively low cost. 
 ''It creates a very warm glow, through a broad spectrum with many colors,'' said Paul Bentel, whose firm Bentel & Bentel hung cascades of reproduction Tesla bulbs, similar to the original Edison, throughout Craft restaurant near Gramercy Park in 2001. ''A red apple will look as good as a green pear.'' 
 The Craft connection may have been the start of the boom. The bulbs became a signature there as the owner, Tom Colicchio, spread his restaurants across the country and appeared to spawn a thousand imitators. 
 But that might not have happened without Bob Rosenzweig, who started selling the reproductions in the 1980s out of a storefront in Flushing, Queens, inspired by a fascination with the old bulbs he bought from a salvage operation on Canal Street.
 Priced out of Flushing, then Long Island City and Jersey City, he moved his company, Aamsco, to Summerville, S.C., a suburb of Charleston. There, he manufactures and distributes his own bulbs, as well as lights from other companies, including Kyp-Go, which has been replicating Edison's original carbon filament bulb for nearly 50 years.
 ''My neighbors think I'm in the witness protection program,'' he said, with the brisk cadence of his Astoria upbringing. ''They say, 'Why in your right mind would you come down here to live on a dirt road in a small town? You've got to be hiding from somebody.' ''
 He started selling the lights to collectors, theatrical prop houses and the Edison national park site in New Jersey, for its gift shop. Demand grew but did not really take off, Mr. Rosenzweig said, until shortly after the turn of the century, as consumers were being pushed to use compact fluorescents. 
 Customers, particularly in San Francisco, complained that they hated how those squiggly bulbs looked in their vintage fixtures, casting an odd green tinge inside their restored Victorians. Around the same time came a boomlet of nostalgia-infused restaurants in New York, like Public, which opened in 2003 in a former Edison laboratory in NoLIta.
 ''You were going to do a space that was low cost -- you weren't going to throw a ton of money at it -- you wanted it as honest as possible,'' Kristina O'Neal, a founder of Avroko, which designed and operates Public, said of the raw, industrial look. ''But you wanted something a little bit nostalgic, a little bit about old New York, a little bit comforting, but still with your own take on it.''
 The bulbs are now popular all over the world, in Germany, England, Australia and even Hong Kong Disneyland, Mr. Rosenzweig said. The only place he cannot seem to find a market is Miami Beach, where the prevailing look is modern. In countries with bans on incandescent lights in homes, he markets the product as a novelty bulb. 
 ''Everybody's going green, but we're still hot and red,'' he said. ''My bulbs use a lot of energy and make the air conditioning work overtime.''
 In the United States, the craze has spilled over into home decor, with demand high enough that even mainstream retailers like Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware and Anthropologie sell the lights for $9 to $20 each. 
 It remains to be seen how all this will play out in a city where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has championed the compact fluorescent and restaurants crow about their connections to the earth.
 Mr. Bloomberg and his chief environmental aide declined to comment on the proliferation of the filament bulbs, some of which do not produce enough light to be included in the higher federal efficiency standards that begin taking effect in 2012, but can use roughly three times the energy of a standard incandescent.
 Although some Congressional aides say the new restrictions would not apply to the reproduction bulbs because they are not intended for general use, the Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped write the law, said it would challenge that interpretation.
 ''It boggles the mind that in these times of economic hardship and interest in environmental sustainability that restaurant owners would choose the light bulb that uses 5 to 10 times more power than the other bulbs on the market,'' Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the environmental group, wrote in an e-mail message. ''You can't on the one hand brag how green you are by serving organic beer and locally grown produce while you are lighting your business with the least efficient light bulbs available in the world.''
 Lighting designers, who tend to think in terms of overall watts used in a space as opposed to the environmental burden of a single fixture, say that most of the real illumination in restaurants can be handled by more efficient sources, with the vintage lights used as accents.
 For Mr. Friedman of the Spotted Pig, who said he was in a good-natured fight trying to restrain his designers from hanging hundreds of lights from the ceiling of his next restaurant, the eco-friendly and aesthetically pleasing solution is a simple one. If you want to conjure up an old-time feel, he said, ''just light real candles, you know?
 ''They're really cheap, they use way less of New York's energy than a light bulb. A little candle on a table -- there's nothing more old school than that.''

HEADLINE: As China's Wages Rise, Export Prices Could Follow

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Chen Xiaoduan contributed research.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The cost of doing business in China is going up. 
 Coastal factories are increasing hourly payments to workers. Local governments are raising minimum wage standards. And if China allows its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate against the United States dollar later this year, as many economists are predicting, the relative cost of manufacturing in China will almost certainly rise. 
 The salaries of factory workers in China are still low compared to those in the United States and Europe: the hourly wage in southern China is only about 75 cents an hour. But economists say wage increases here will eventually ripple through the global economy, driving up the prices of goods as diverse as T-shirts, sneakers, computer servers and smartphones.
 ''For a long time, China has been the anchor of global disinflation,'' said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse, referring to how the two-decade-long shift to manufacturing in China helped many global companies lower costs and prices. ''But this may be the beginning of the end of an era.'' 
 The shift was illustrated Sunday, when Foxconn Technology, one of the world's largest contract electronics manufacturers and the maker of well-known products that include Apple iPhones and Dell computer parts, said that it was planning to double the salaries of many of its 800,000 workers in China, beginning in October. The new monthly average would be 2,000 renminbi -- about $300, at current exchange rates. 
 The announcement follows a spate of suicides at two Foxconn campuses in southern China and criticism of the company's labor practices. 
 Foxconn, based in Taiwan and employing more than 800,000 workers in China, said the salary increases were meant to improve the lives of its workers. 
 Last week the Japanese automaker Honda said it had agreed to give about 1,900 workers at one of its plants in southern China raises of 24 to 32 percent, in hopes of ending a two-week strike, according to people briefed on the agreement. The new monthly average would be about $300, not counting overtime. 
 And last Thursday, Beijing announced that it would raise the city's minimum monthly wage by 20 percent, to 960 renminbi, or about $140. Many other cities are expected to follow suit.
 Analysts say the changes result from the growing clout of workers in China's economy, and are also a response to the soaring food and housing prices that have eroded the spending power of workers from rural provinces. These workers, without factoring in the recent wage increases by some employers, typically earn $200 a month, working six or seven days a week.
 But there are other reasons. Analysts say Beijing is supporting wage increases as a way to stimulate domestic consumption and make the country less dependent on low-priced exports. The government hopes the move will force some export-oriented companies to invest in more innovative or higher-value goods. 
 But Chinese policy makers also favor higher wages because they could help ease a widening income gap between the rich and the poor. 
 Big manufacturers are moving to raise salaries because they are desperate to attract new workers at a time when many coastal factory cities are struggling with labor shortages. 
 A Foxconn executive said last week that the turnover rate at its two Shenzhen campuses -- which employ over 400,000 people -- was about 5 percent a month, meaning that as many as 20,000 workers were leaving every month and needed to be replaced. 
 Marshall W. Meyer, a China specialist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, says that demographic changes in China are reducing the supply of young workers entering the labor force and that this is behind some of the wage pressure. 
 ''Demography will do what the Strategic and Economic Dialogue hasn't: raise the cost of Chinese goods,'' he said, referring to United States-China talks on Chinese currency reform and other economic issues. ''There is no way out.'' 
 Economists say many of the same forces that were at work in 2007 and 2008, when China's economy was overheating, have returned and even intensified this year. 
 Local governments have stepped up enforcement of labor and environmental regulations, driving up production costs. 
 And perhaps most troubling for companies here is the prospect of an appreciating Chinese currency, which would make their exports more expensive overseas. 
 Beijing has long promised to allow its currency to fluctuate more freely. But when the global financial crisis shuttered many Chinese factories, the government effectively repegged the renminbi to the dollar to protect exporters. 
 Pietra Rivoli, a professor of international business at Georgetown University and the author of ''The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,'' says the effects of rising labor costs will vary by industry, perhaps with lower-valued goods like garments being forced to move to western China or even to Vietnam and Bangladesh.
 But she says high-end electronics like smartphones are likely to remain, because they command high profit margins and because China has built a sophisticated infrastructure and quality-control system.
 ''Labor is such a small piece of the pie for them,'' Professor Rivoli says of the electronics brands. ''The money's all in the design, the marketing and the complicated distribution system, including retail outlets. Like with Apple, they have those rents in the shopping malls, fancy stores and all those hip people working there. That costs a lot.''
 Still, salary increases are expected to affect many stages of the supply chain and force some companies to raise prices. For many exporters who simply produce on contract for global brands, profit margins are already razor-thin, and raising prices could hurt business.
 ''They're going to have to find a way to pass this on to the end user,'' says Mr. Tao at Credit Suisse. 
 Economists say a necessary restructuring is under way, one that should allow the nation's huge ''floating population'' of migrant workers to better share in the benefits of growth and stimulate domestic consumption. 
 United States and European Union officials have been pressing China to help improve the global economy by consuming more and reducing the country's huge trade surpluses. 
 Rising labor costs here are not the end of cheap production in China, analysts say, but they are likely to help change the country's manufacturing mix. 
 ''China isn't going to lose its manufacturing base because it's got a huge domestic market,'' said Mary Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. ''But it will move them toward higher-end goods. And that matches the Chinese government's ambition. They don't just want to be the workshop of the world. They want to produce high-tech goods.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rose in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer borrowing increased slightly in April, a sign that Americans might have more faith in the economic recovery. 
 Borrowing rose by 0.5 percent, or $954.8 million, to $2.44 trillion in April, the Federal Reserve said Monday. But the government revised away a gain it had originally reported for March. Instead, it reported that credit fell $5.44 billion in the month.
 The April increase, if it stands, would be only the second gain in 15 months. Economists are hoping that households will soon feel confident enough to borrow more and help sustain the recovery.
 Consumer credit also rose in January. Beyond the January and April gains, consumer credit has posted a string of declines that started in February 2009.
 The strength in April reflected a 7.1 percent rise in nonrevolving credit, the category that includes auto loans. Auto spending has increased in recent months by incentives offered by automakers.
 Revolving debt, which includes credit card borrowing, plunged 12 percent. That was the 19th consecutive decline in this category.
 Tighter credit conditions imposed by many banks could constrain the rebound.
 For years, economists worried about the low personal savings rate among Americans. But now they fear less borrowing could hamper overall growth. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of total economic activity.
 The rise in credit in April lifted total borrowing to $2.44 trillion, still down 4.8 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: Using Appeals To Emotions To Sell Paint

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE collapse of the housing market has hurt paint sales, with total revenue for exterior paint falling 12 percent from 2007 to 2009, according to a recent report by Mintel, a market research company. But interior paint has fared better, with sales slipping just 3 percent during the period, because of what Mintel calls ''a silver lining'' to the downturn: cocooning. As short-on-cash people spend more time at home, sprucing up the rumpus room with a fresh coat of semigloss apparently seems to be worth the expense and effort.
 Now a new television commercial by the paint company Valspar is taking an unusual approach to selling interior paint: it never shows an interior, or consumers painting. The spot, by Euro RSCG Chicago, opens with a couple walking on white sand toward a white wall, which resembles a drive-in movie screen, as a voice-over begins, ''To some, a wall is just a wall -- a divider between here and there.'' The couple begin to guide the wall through various spectacular landscapes, and the wall assumes the color of the backdrops, from the incandescent green of flora near a waterfall to the warm tan of a hayfield to the reddish brown of a mountain setting. 
 ''To others, a wall is a canvas, an invitation, a blank slate,'' the voice-over continues to a lush soundtrack. ''The right color can turn any wall into so much more.''
 Paint advertising typically emphasizes quality and color selection, and depicts homeowners applying paint to walls.
 ''What you see in almost every paint commercial is couples in blue jeans and flannel shirts holding rollers and going up and down on the wall and whistling while they work, and Valspar didn't need to go there,'' said Steffan Postaer, chief creative officer at Euro RSCG Chicago. ''We don't show people painting walls, or interiors, or any of the kind of mundane aspects of the chore. It's more about the mind-space of the consumer -- we're talking to their imagination and emotions.''
 The latest commercial was shot at locations throughout Australia, with the wall, which measures 16 feet by 30 feet, being hauled and repainted. Other Valspar campaigns by the agency in recent years also have featured natural settings, such as spots in 2008 that showed objects like lily pads and trees with squares cut out, which transformed into square color samples. 
 Valspar originated as the plainly named Paint and Color in Boston in 1806, but in recent decades has not been a household name like Sherwin-Williams or Benjamin Moore because at the consumer level it mainly produced paint for retailers to sell as store brands, most notably at Lowe's. But in 2007, the company decided to market paint, at Lowe's and elsewhere, primarily under its own brand name. 
 Valspar spent $35.2 million on advertising in 2009, less than Sherwin-Williams, which spent $52 million, and more than Benjamin Moore, which spent $12.6 million, according to Kantar Media. 
 A current Benjamin Moore campaign on which the company has said it is spending $15 million emphasizes that it is the choice of professionals, and features several interior designers and contractors who describe their aesthetic approaches and laud the brand for quality and the vibrancy of its colors.
 ''There are 179 shades of white -- Benjamin Moore clearly understands that white is a color,'' says the designer Darryl Carter in one of the spots, by the New York office of Cramer-Krasselt. ''And given what I do, it's critical to have those variables.''
 Susanne Champ, director of marketing at Valspar, said that when the brand surveyed advertising in the category a few years ago, it was like watching paint dry. Most paint commercials were ''real yawners,'' she said. 
 ''Everyone's fighting over the same features and benefits,'' Ms. Champ said, rattling off typical claims. '' 'I have 3,500 colors,' 'No, I have 4,000 colors,' 'Mine's a paint and primer in one.' Everyone is working on the same benefits -- and showing people rolling paint on the wall.''
 But Ms. Champ said that when Valspar surveyed consumers, ''they told us that painting is an emotional journey with lots of highs and lows,'' and that applying paint itself was certainly not the high point. 
 ''They enjoy the first roll on the wall, but they don't want to be reminded of all that work,'' Ms. Champ said. ''Consumers talk about what they feel when they finish the project, and that's a sense of pride and accomplishment. They say, 'I feel like an artist,' and 'I feel a sense of freedom and joy.' They ladder up to a lot of high-level emotional benefits, and that's what we're trying to tap into through this campaign.''
 When it comes to future advertising, Valspar itself is now looking at a blank wall. The company recently dismissed Euro RSCG Chicago after the agency's London office became the agency of record for Dulux, a competing paint brand. Ms. Champ described it as an ''amicable separation.''
 Mintel, meanwhile, paints the industry and the economy with the same broad strokes.
 ''Sales are again likely to fall in 2010,'' according to the Mintel report. ''Pent-up demand is building for paint products, but it will take a rebound in employment, which leads to increased home moving, to get the extensive renovation and repair projects to drive the market higher.''

HEADLINE: History for Dollars

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
When the going gets tough, the tough take accounting. When the job market worsens, many students figure they can't indulge in an English or a history major. They have to study something that will lead directly to a job.
 So it is almost inevitable that over the next few years, as labor markets struggle, the humanities will continue their long slide. There already has been a nearly 50 percent drop in the portion of liberal arts majors over the past generation, and that trend is bound to accelerate. Once the stars of university life, humanities now play bit roles when prospective students take their college tours. The labs are more glamorous than the libraries. 
 But allow me to pause for a moment and throw another sandbag on the levy of those trying to resist this tide. Let me stand up for the history, English and art classes, even in the face of today's economic realities.
 Studying the humanities improves your ability to read and write. No matter what you do in life, you will have a huge advantage if you can read a paragraph and discern its meaning (a rarer talent than you might suppose). You will have enormous power if you are the person in the office who can write a clear and concise memo.
 Studying the humanities will give you a familiarity with the language of emotion. In an information economy, many people have the ability to produce a technical innovation: a new MP3 player. Very few people have the ability to create a great brand: the iPod. Branding involves the location and arousal of affection, and you can't do it unless you are conversant in the language of romance.
 Studying the humanities will give you a wealth of analogies. People think by comparison -- Iraq is either like Vietnam or Bosnia; your boss is like Narcissus or Solon. People who have a wealth of analogies in their minds can think more precisely than those with few analogies. If you go through college without reading Thucydides, Herodotus and Gibbon, you'll have been cheated out of a great repertoire of comparisons.
 Finally, and most importantly, studying the humanities helps you befriend The Big Shaggy.
 Let me try to explain. Over the past century or so, people have built various systems to help them understand human behavior: economics, political science, game theory and evolutionary psychology. These systems are useful in many circumstances. But none completely explain behavior because deep down people have passions and drives that don't lend themselves to systemic modeling. They have yearnings and fears that reside in an inner beast you could call The Big Shaggy.
 You can see The Big Shaggy at work when a governor of South Carolina suddenly chucks it all for a love voyage south of the equator, or when a smart, philosophical congressman from Indiana risks everything for an in-office affair.
 You can see The Big Shaggy at work when self-destructive overconfidence overtakes oil engineers in the gulf, when go-go enthusiasm intoxicates investment bankers or when bone-chilling distrust grips politics.
 Those are the destructive sides of The Big Shaggy. But this tender beast is also responsible for the mysterious but fierce determination that drives Kobe Bryant, the graceful bemusement the Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga showed when his perfect game slipped away, the selfless courage soldiers in Afghanistan show when they risk death for buddies or a family they may never see again.
 The observant person goes through life asking: Where did that come from? Why did he or she act that way? The answers are hard to come by because the behavior emanates from somewhere deep inside The Big Shaggy.
 Technical knowledge stops at the outer edge. If you spend your life riding the links of the Internet, you probably won't get too far into The Big Shaggy either, because the fast, effortless prose of blogging (and journalism) lacks the heft to get you deep below.
 But over the centuries, there have been rare and strange people who possessed the skill of taking the upheavals of thought that emanate from The Big Shaggy and representing them in the form of story, music, myth, painting, liturgy, architecture, sculpture, landscape and speech. These men and women developed languages that help us understand these yearnings and also educate and mold them. They left rich veins of emotional knowledge that are the subjects of the humanities.
 It's probably dangerous to enter exclusively into this realm and risk being caught in a cloister, removed from the market and its accountability. But doesn't it make sense to spend some time in the company of these languages -- learning to feel different emotions, rehearsing different passions, experiencing different sacred rituals and learning to see in different ways?
 Few of us are hewers of wood. We navigate social environments. If you're dumb about The Big Shaggy, you'll probably get eaten by it.

HEADLINE: What Is Goldman Hiding?

 BODY:
Congress created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission last year to investigate the causes of the meltdown. Many banks, financial firms and other witnesses have cooperated. But not Goldman Sachs. 
 According to the panel's chairman, Phil Angelides, Goldman has either not responded to requests -- stretching back to January -- for documents and interviews or has submitted data that are so voluminous or disorganized as to be useless. 
 On Monday, Mr. Angelides announced that the panel had finally subpoenaed Goldman. He told reporters that Goldman's performance had been ''abysmal, unacceptable and won't be countenanced.'' He added that it is his job to ensure that the American people are not ''played for chumps.'' 
 We couldn't agree more. We also have to ask what took the commission so long -- and hope this new toughness will carry through to a smart and tough report. The commission's final product is due on Dec. 15. If Goldman's lawyers think they can play out the clock, Congress had better disabuse them of that notion right now. 
 If Goldman doesn't comply, the commission can -- and should -- ask a court to enforce the subpoena. If Goldman still balks, the court could find Goldman in contempt. 
 We still don't know in detail what the crisis panel is hoping to learn from Goldman. In its own disturbing lack of transparency, the panel has not made the subpoena public. A summary on its Web site, posted late Monday, says that it is looking for information on Goldman's derivatives' deals and wants to interview Goldman's top executives and other employees with knowledge of specific transactions. The public clearly has the right to know those details and how they may have contributed to the financial crisis. 
 The Goldman subpoena is only the latest of many black eyes for the bank, including a civil suit for securities fraud brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. 
 In the conference call on Monday, the panel's vice chairman, Bill Thomas, a former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, suggested that Goldman's failure to cooperate indicated that the bank had something to hide. ''They may have more to cover up than either we thought or than they told us,'' he said. At the least, it suggests that Goldman is still trying to control the narrative of the financial crisis. 
 That is a prerogative it and all of the banks forfeited when they nearly brought down the financial system and then were bailed out by American taxpayers. 
 The country needs a full accounting of what went wrong. To do their job, Mr. Angelides, Mr. Thomas and the commission are going to have push a lot harder.

HEADLINE: Doctors and Hospitals Say Goals on Computerized Records Are Unrealistic

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In February 2009, as part of legislation to revive the economy, Congress provided tens of billions of dollars to help doctors and hospitals buy equipment to computerize patients' medical records. 
 But the eligibility criteria proposed by the Obama administration are so strict and so ambitious that hardly any doctors or hospitals can meet them, not even the most technologically advanced providers like Kaiser Permanente and Intermountain Healthcare. 
 Doctors and hospital executives, who have expressed their frustration in meetings with White House and Medicare officials, said the issue offered a cautionary tale of what could happen when good intentions meet the reality of America's fragmented health care system. 
 The goal of the law is to provide financial incentives, through Medicare and Medicaid, to encourage doctors and hospitals to adopt and use electronic health records. When the bill was passed, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the incentive payments would total $34 billion.
 It is no surprise that tiny hospitals in the Midwest and doctors practicing by themselves would grumble about the White House proposals.
 But elite institutions have similar concerns. Among those expressing deep reservations about the proposals are pioneers in the use of health information technology like Kaiser, Intermountain, the Mayo Clinic and Partners HealthCare System in Boston, which includes Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.
 One of most revealing assessments came from Dr. Thomas H. Lee, president of the physician network at Partners HealthCare.
 ''Effective use of electronic health records will greatly improve patient safety, quality and efficiency,'' Dr. Lee said in a letter to Medicare officials. But he said the approach taken by the administration was based on ''unrealistic expectations'' and ''unachievable timelines.''
 ''We are very concerned about the requirement that hospitals and eligible professionals must meet each and every one of the objectives to demonstrate meaningful use and thereby qualify for incentive payments,'' Dr. Lee said. 
 In meetings at the White House, doctors and hospital executives have conveyed the same message: the president's all-or-nothing approach could discourage efforts to adopt electronic health records because some of the proposed standards are impossibly high and the risk of failure is great. They pleaded with the administration to take a more gradual approach and reward incremental progress.
 At least 27 senators and 245 House members echoed those concerns in letters to the administration.
 Administration officials said they took the concerns seriously, but refused to say whether they would relax the proposed requirements. 
 ''We want to strike a balance,'' said Jonathan D. Blum, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ''We will provide flexibility for doctors and hospitals, but push them to elevate their performance. Final rules will be out in early summer.''
 Anthony A. Barrueta, the vice president for government relations at Kaiser Permanente, said his company, the nation's largest nonprofit health plan, had years of experience with electronic health records, but could not meet all the criteria for incentive payments.
 Dr. Brent E. Wallace, chief medical officer at Intermountain Healthcare, in Utah, said the administration's criteria were ''too rigid, requiring too much change in too short a time.''
 President Obama has repeatedly praised Intermountain as a model. But Dr. Wallace said, ''At this date, Intermountain could not meet 36 of the 48 meaningful use requirements.''
 Administration officials said the standards were needed to meet an ambitious goal set by Mr. Obama. In a speech in January 2009, two weeks before taking office, Mr. Obama said, ''We will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that within five years, all of America's medical records are computerized.''
 Dr. David Blumenthal, the national coordinator for health information technology (who used to work at Partners HealthCare), said, ''We are on track'' to achieve that goal.
 Doctors and hospitals agree with Mr. Obama's statement that electronic records can save lives by reducing medical errors. But they said the stringent federal criteria would, in effect, require them to have an advanced, sophisticated system of electronic health records to obtain the money they need to install even a basic system.
 ''The criteria for achieving meaningful use of electronic health records are too aggressive,'' said Dr. John R. Maese, a leader of the New York chapter of the American College of Physicians. ''The time frame to adopt the technology is unrealistic.''
 Dr. Steven M. Safyer, president of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said his hospital had been a leader in the use of electronic health records. ''But even as an early adopter of this technology,'' he said, ''we find ourselves struggling to meet the federal standards.''
 Dr. Safyer said the Obama requirements were laudable as an ultimate goal, but untenable as a starting point. To comply with the federal criteria, he said, Montefiore would have to install new technology at its main hospital and at 75 sites in the Bronx.
 Federal incentive payments become available to hospitals in October and to doctors in January. To qualify under the administration plan, doctors would have to meet 25 criteria, or objectives, and hospitals would have to meet 23. In general, a doctor can receive up to $18,000 next year and $44,000 over five years.
 Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties if they are not using electronic health records.
 Kristianne B. Wilson, vice president of the Billings Clinic in eastern Montana, which includes a hospital and 240 doctors, said health information technology was included in the economic recovery package because Mr. Obama and Congress wanted to improve care and create jobs with a quick infusion of money. But, she said, if few hospitals qualify, ''that objective will not be achieved.''
 To qualify for the federal payments, doctors and hospitals would have to check insurance eligibility and submit claims electronically for most patients. Doctors would have to provide patients with ''an electronic copy'' of their health information, including diagnostic test results, on request. Doctors and hospitals would have to show they can ''electronically exchange key clinical information.''
 But Carolyn N. Gaughan, executive director of the Kansas Academy of Family Physicians, said, ''At this time in Kansas, physicians have no one with whom to exchange data.''

HEADLINE: Keeping the Artists in Williamsburg While Attracting the Wealthy Buyers

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Some New Yorkers -- no matter how uncreative their jobs and lives may be -- love to mention how they live in neighborhoods once romantically settled by poets, painters and musicians.
 Developers often talk up these histories when selling apartments.
 But while many of them think of artists as place holders for lawyers and investment bankers, Douglas Steiner, one developer struggling to sell units in the vastly overbuilt Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg, is betting it pays to keep artists in the neighborhood even after wealthier buyers move in. He is hoping the deal he struck with the choreographer Elizabeth Streb will help the sales of his $1 million-plus town homes and apartments. 
 ''She's part of what makes Williamsburg attractive,'' Mr. Steiner said while he and Ms. Streb sat in her warehouse, which was filled with dancers swinging from candy-colored curtainlike ribbons and troupe members rehearsing on a yellow steel mouse wheel contraption called the Whizzing Gizmo. ''We wanted to preserve that artistic character.''
 Mr. Steiner and Ms. Streb make an unlikely pair. Mr. Steiner, the reserved heir to an industrial real estate fortune and chairman of Steiner Studios, jokes about how his father's definition of a beautiful building is property with ''positive cash flow.'' Ms. Streb speaks in bursts of enthusiasm about how ''action is a panacea'' for children and how she runs her troupe like a contrarian Lincoln Center.
 Ms. Streb has plenty of reasons to dislike landlords: For more than a decade she fought to stay in her rented 3,000-square-foot SoHo loft, finally winning the right to buy it for $130,000 in 2008. 
 When Mr. Steiner bought the North First Street building that houses Ms. Streb's studio and performance space in 2006, she had been there for three years paying $5,000 a month in rent. A former food storage center, it was overrun by pigeons and squirrels when she moved in and smelled so strongly of tamari that Ms. Streb had the scent sandblasted from the concrete floors. The concrete walls were so porous that on some winter days she sent dancers home because it was too cold to rehearse.
 Even though Ms. Streb thought her studio was doomed to become a residential development, she boldly asked Mr. Steiner to sell her the building. He refused. Then he realized he needed the backyard for a development project he was assembling, but Ms. Streb was entitled to use it for at least three more years under her lease. 
 So over lunch close by at Fabiane's Cafe, Ms. Streb told him she would let him have the backyard if he would sell her the building. They sealed the agreement with a handshake and a cherry Tootsie Pop that Mr. Steiner gave to Ms. Streb. In 2007, the troupe, Streb Extreme Action, closed on the purchase with financial help from the city and the borough president's office; if the troupe sells the building, it must be to another nonprofit organization.
 Mr. Steiner said he did not make money on the deal because he sold the property to the troupe for the same amount he had paid for it, $1.3 million. But he did keep the backyard space. And he said that the recession meant he would lose money on the broader development project: nine town houses on North First Street, 114 luxury apartments at 80 Metropolitan Avenue and 50 apartments at 58 Metropolitan that are all tucked around Ms. Streb's building. But he said he would like to build in Williamsburg in the future, which he said had not become ''homogenized'' like Manhattan.
 He also formed a friendship of sorts with Ms. Streb. Mr. Steiner attends Ms. Streb's annual fund-raisers and calls them among the best parties of the year. He marvels at how the dancers climb on walls, and how at Ms. Streb's building he met Philippe Petit, who keeps part of the wire he used to walk between the World Trade Center towers and who holds clinics at the studio. Ms. Streb is even considering selling her SoHo loft, which would probably fetch more than $1 million, and buying a neighboring town house Mr. Steiner built.
 By then, Ms. Streb could be one of only two people from her troupe in the neighborhood, where she would join Fabio Tavares Da Silva, the associate artistic director. He has been able to stay because his partner's friend works in real estate and helped them find an affordable rental. Other troupe members commute from Washington Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Philadelphia.
 But some local families have connected with Ms. Streb's studio. Jenny Williams, a painter who has lived in the neighborhood since 1992, has been sending her son, Whitman, 10, and daughter, Clementine, 8, to classes there since the studio opened. She said her daughter learned to do splits, and her son became more coordinated. Most of all, the family has a place to go.
 ''When people ask me why I would want to raise kids in New York City, it's one of those places that is sort of the reason,'' she said.
 That is what Mr. Steiner is counting on. In December, Nanette Guarda moved into a $1.125 million apartment at 80 Metropolitan with her husband, Michael Guarda, her 7-year-old daughter, Natasha, and her 6-month-old daughter, Gemma. Ms. Guarda said Natasha already ''peeks in there every time we go by.'' For her family to take classes there, she said, ''it's really a matter of time.''

HEADLINE: In New Space Race, Enter the Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- At the Bigelow Aerospace factory here, the full-size space station mockups sitting on the warehouse floor look somewhat like puffy white watermelons. The interiors offer a hint of what spacious living in space might look like.
 ''Every astronaut we have come in here just says, 'Wow,' '' said Robert T. Bigelow, the company founder. ''They can't believe the size of this thing.''
 Four years from now, the company plans for real modules to be launched and assembled into the solar system's first private space station. Paying customers -- primarily nations that do not have the money or expertise to build a space program from scratch -- would arrive a year later.
 In 2016, a second, larger station would follow. The two Bigelow stations would then be home to 36 people at a time -- six times as many as currently live on the International Space Station. 
 If this business plan unfolds as it is written -- the company has two fully inflated test modules in orbit already -- Bigelow will be buying 15 to 20 rocket launchings in 2017 and in each year after, providing ample business for the private companies that the Obama administration would like to finance for the transportation of astronauts into orbit -- the so-called commercial crew initiative.
 President Obama's budget proposal for 2011 calls for investing $6 billion over five years for probably two or more companies to develop spacecraft capable of carrying people into space. Then, instead of operating its own systems, like the space shuttles, NASA would buy rides for its astronauts on these commercial space taxis.
 ''This represents the entrance of the entrepreneurial mind-set into a field that is poised for rapid growth and new jobs,'' Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in February. ''And NASA will be driving competition, opening new markets and access to space and catalyzing the potential of American industry.''
 Officials have been careful not to say their commercial crew plan relies on a market beyond NASA, but for now, Bigelow appears to be the only non-NASA buyer for commercial crew services. 
 ''Nobody,'' Mr. Bigelow said of competition he sees on the horizon.
 Thus, the rosier promises of the president's plan rest on this enigmatic, 100-employee company located on 50 acres of desert not far from the casinos and strip clubs and the ability of Mr. Bigelow, an iconoclast who made his fortune in real estate including the Budget Suites of America hotel chain, to get his dreams off the ground. 
 He has spent about $180 million of his own money so far and has said he is willing to spend up to $320 million more. An expansion of the factory will double the amount of floor space as the company begins the transition from research and development to production.
 Mr. Bigelow only occasionally gives interviews, and except for Michael N. Gold, the director of Bigelow's Washington office, the employees almost never speak publicly. A company document titled ''Some Important Bigelow Aerospace Cultural Values'' implores employees, ''Keep your work and the work of your co-workers very private from people outside the company.'' (Mr. Gold said that the confidentiality stems from federal regulations designed to protect technological information and that the engineers are busy working.)
 The Las Vegas site is hemmed by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards.
 The soundness of the business case is unknown to outsiders. Mr. Bigelow declines to say if he has firm commitments from any countries or companies to rent space on his space stations. In recent years, he has played down the notion that he is building a space hotel for rich tourists, although he says space tourism could provide a part of his business. 
 Over the past year, Mr. Gold visited countries like Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, England and Sweden to gauge interest. A stay on a Bigelow station, including transportation, is currently priced at just under $25 million a person for 30 days. That is less than half the more than $50 million a seat that NASA is paying for rides alone on Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station. Doubling the stay to 60 days adds just $3.75 million more.
 For a country or company willing to sign up for a four-year commitment, the lease for an entire six-person module would cost just under $395 million a year, and that would include transportation for a dozen people each year. ''You see why this is attractive for the sovereign client market,'' Mr. Gold said.
 The Bigelow prices are good through 2018, and Mr. Bigelow said the prices would drop by then if, as he expects, rocket prices drop.
 ''We're very comfortable with our numbers,'' he said, although he declined to discuss the details. Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, which is the most optimistic in reducing launching costs, estimates that rides to space on its Falcon 9 rockets would be $20 million a seat.
 ''You have to trust a little bit that we're making these investments because we think it's going to make sense economically at the end of the day,'' Mr. Bigelow said. ''We won't execute our business plan if those numbers aren't there.''
 His space stations are not his only interest in space. ''I've been a researcher and student of U.F.O.'s for many, many years,'' Mr. Bigelow said. ''Anybody that does research, if people bother to do quality research, come away absolutely convinced. You don't have to have personal encounters.'' 
 He added: ''People have been killed. People have been hurt. It's more than observational kind of data.''
 Other views that run counter to mainstream science include a belief in the power of prayer and a disbelief in the Big Bang theory.
 The idea of inflatable spacecraft dates back almost to the beginning of the space age, solving a stubborn conundrum with putting stuff in space. Rockets are tall, but not particularly wide. With inflatable spacecraft, the structure can be packed tightly into the payload and then filled with air once in orbit.
 NASA's Echo I and Echo II satellites, launched in 1960 and 1964, were large Mylar balloons. NASA commissioned Goodyear to build prototypes of an inflatable space station, which looked like a big rubber inner tube. 
 The rubber space stations never flew, in part because of an obvious design weakness -- they could pop if hit by meteoroids.
 The idea remained dormant until the 1990s, when NASA started exploring how to build living quarters for a human mission to Mars. William C. Schneider, then the senior engineer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, returned to the inflatable design.
 Instead of rubber like the 1960s Goodyear design, Dr. Schneider used an airtight bladder surrounded by Kevlar straps. ''It dumps its pressure load into the straps,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''Those two together make a very efficient design.''
 Outside the straps, alternating layers of aluminized fabric and foam absorb and disperse the impacts of micrometeoroids, providing better protection than metal structures, Dr. Schneider said.
 Even though he was sure the design was sound, he built two prototypes of the TransHab module and demonstrated their resilience in a swimming pool and a vacuum chamber. ''People would think of it as a balloon,'' said Dr. Schneider, who now is a visiting professor at Texas A&M University. ''In cases, it was six times as good as needed. It's absolutely verified.''
 In the meantime, the Mars plans were shelved as too expensive, and TransHab was reimagined as a crew quarters module for the International Space Station. Then the space station costs grew, and in 2000, Congress prohibited NASA from spending any more money on TransHab.
 Mr. Bigelow, 66, said that he was inspired by NASA's successes of the 1960s, culminating with the Moon landings, and that he always hoped to invest in space someday. He read about TransHab in 1998, and learning of the project's imminent demise, he established Bigelow Aerospace in 1999 and bought an exclusive license to the NASA patents.
 Dr. Schneider joined Bigelow as a consultant. The Bigelow designs are essentially very close to his NASA work, Dr. Schneider said, with some changes like replacing the Kevlar with Vectran, another bullet-resistant fabric. There are also some notable improvements like the addition of small windows, already tested on the Genesis I and II test modules that were successfully launched from Russia using converted ballistic missiles.
 ''He had great manufacturing capability,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''They have some real good engineers as well. I'm sure they will be very successful.''
 The biggest hole in his plans, Mr. Bigelow said, is the one not entirely in his control: getting to and from the space stations.
 For a while, Bigelow and Lockheed Martin were collaborating on a small capsule that would launch on an Atlas V rocket, which currently launches Air Force satellites and other payloads. Lockheed Martin won the NASA contract for building the Orion crew capsule for NASA's Constellation program and dropped out of the work with Bigelow. 
 Mimicking the $10 million X Prize that spurred the development of the suborbital spaceplane SpaceShipOne, Mr. Bigelow offered $50 million to anyone who could build an orbital spacecraft. No one tried to claim the prize before it expired in January.
 Bigelow is collaborating with Boeing using $18 million that NASA has provided for preliminary design of a commercial crew capsule.
 Keith Reiley, the program manager at Boeing for the capsule, said he was not very familiar with Bigelow's space station plans, but was impressed with what Bigelow has contributed to Boeing's capsule. ''They're a lot more entrepreneurial than we are,'' Mr. Reiley said, ''and it's refreshing for us.''
 If the Boeing spacecraft is ready by 2014, that is when the dance of Bigelow space station modules will begin. 
 A habitat called Sundancer, with an inflated volume of about 6,400 cubic feet, would launch first. A separate rocket would then carry two Bigelow astronauts to take up residence in Sundancer as additional pieces -- a second Sundancer, a larger habitat of about 11,700 cubic feet, and a central connecting node -- are launched. The modules are to dock by themselves with the astronauts present to fix any glitches.
 Once the stations are up, Bigelow still needs to demonstrate that it can juggle the logistics of supplying food, water and air, as well as fix the inevitable glitches that will arise. Mr. Bigelow said that he would hire people with the needed experience and skills, and that space stations were not all that different from hotels.
 ''I've had four decades of serving people, tens and tens and tens of thousands of people, all over the southwest part of the United States,'' he said. ''I have four decades of building all kinds of things. The principles are the same.''
 As a private company, Bigelow can operate space stations much more efficiently than NASA and its governmental partners can operate the International Space Station, Mr. Bigelow said. (Another of the company values declares: ''Make up your mind quickly. Don't take forever, people are waiting, the company is waiting, the future is waiting and time costs money.'')
 NASA's interest in inflatables has also been revived once again. Among several large technology demonstration projects proposed in the president's 2011 budget is an inflatable module for the International Space Station. Bigelow is currently talking to NASA about that.
 Mr. Bigelow envisions variations of the inflatable modules being used for a Moon base or a mission to Mars.
 ''Our hope is that we can serve NASA,'' he said. ''Because we can do it so much more economically.''

HEADLINE: 4 Palestinian Divers Killed Near Gaza by Israeli Navy

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris, and Fares Akram from Gaza.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Four Palestinian militants suspected by Israel of planning an attack by sea were killed near the Gaza shoreline early on Monday, an illustration of Israel's continuing control and concerns for security after last week's deadly raid on a Turkish ship of activists bound for the Palestinian coastal enclave.
 The Israeli military said that an Israeli naval force spotted what it called a ''squad of terrorists wearing diving suits'' and fired on them. 
 Palestinian medics said four bodies had been retrieved. Palestinian rescue crews said two fishermen who were working off the coast had disappeared and their boats were found pockmarked with bullet holes.
 The Gaza branch of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, a militant group nominally associated with the mainstream Fatah movement led by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the four were among its members. 
 The Israeli military said the militants were ''on their way to execute a terror attack,'' but it did not offer details. 
 It was not clear whether the militants posed an immediate threat. An Israeli military spokeswoman, speaking anonymously according to army rules, said the men were close to the shore when they were hit. The military would not comment on whether the militants were armed. 
 The group said that the divers belonged to its marine unit and that they were training at the time they were hit. 
 Abu al-Walid al-Jabari, a spokesman for Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, said an Israeli naval vessel hit the divers' boat with gunfire from about 100 yards. 
 Israel has enforced a strict naval blockade of Gaza, saying it is essential to stop weapons smuggling by Hamas, the Islamic militant group controlling the territory. 
 There are frequent clashes along the Israel-Gaza border, where militants from various groups try to lay bombs and fire rockets into southern Israel. Israel has also accused Hamas of building a series of tunnels close to the border, designed to facilitate infiltrations. But infiltration attempts by sea have been rare. 
 Monday's shootings came amid heightened tensions after the Israeli commando raid at sea, which turned violent and left nine activists dead. The events aboard the Turkish ship, the Mavi Marmara, caused a crisis in Israel's relations with its once close ally, Turkey, and spread concern far beyond the region, prompting calls for an international inquiry and a lifting of the blockade. 
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Monday that the United States was ''consulting closely with Egypt, as well as our other partners, on new ways to address the humanitarian, economic, security and political aspects of the situation in Gaza,'' according to news reports. He issued the statement after meeting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik.
 Egypt and Israel have enforced the land and sea blockade of Gaza since Hamas took full control there in 2007. 
 Responding to public outrage over the Israeli raid, Egypt opened its border crossing with Gaza, at Rafah, allowing passengers to flow through until further notice. Any goods coming to Gaza from Egypt still have to pass through an Israeli-controlled land crossing at Kerem Shalom. 
 On Sunday, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, suggested a European Union role in checking cargo on board ships heading to Gaza in return for the lifting of the blockade. 
 Mr. Kouchner spoke after a meeting in Paris with his British counterpart, William Hague. 
 ''We can check the cargo of ships heading toward Gaza -- we can do it, we want to do it, we would gladly do it,'' Mr. Kouchner said, according to news reports. There was no immediate response from Israel or from the Hamas authorities in Gaza. 
 France has been seeking a more prominent role in Middle East diplomacy. President Nicolas Sarkozy called the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to seek his agreement on an international role in an investigation into the killings aboard the Turkish vessel. 
 In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu has been discussing options for some kind of inquiry with his top ministers, but no decisions have been immediately publicized. 
 Pro-Palestinian activists have vowed to keep sending ships to try to breach Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu has said that opening up the Palestinian territory to unchecked sea traffic would be like having an Iranian port in Gaza.
 In another potential challenge for Israel, the Iranian Red Crescent said it would send three aid ships to Gaza in a bid to break the blockade, according to news reports. It said it would also send a plane carrying 30 tons of medical equipment to Egypt for onward delivery to the Palestinian enclave. 
 The Red Crescent's director for international affairs, Abdolrauf Adibzadeh, told the Iranian news media that two ships would leave for Gaza this week, followed at a later date by a third vessel, according to Agence France-Presse.
 He said the first two would carry aid workers, food and medicines, and the third would be equipped with an onboard operating theater.

HEADLINE: Pushing a Liberal Agenda, With Democrats as Target

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From the capital to Arkansas, liberals plan to spend this week aiming some not-so-friendly fire at President Obama and Congressional Democrats. 
 Up to 2,000 liberal activists began assembling here on Monday for a conference to press the White House and Congress to fight harder for an ambitious progressive agenda, including a generous jobs bill, even as Democrats returned from a holiday recess to resume talks on further shrinking the proposed legislation to satisfy deficit-conscious colleagues.
 But if things in the capital were not going as the activists wanted, they held out hope for change should Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat they deem too conservative, lose in a runoff on Tuesday night for her party's nomination. Liberal groups had mobilized behind her rival, Bill Halter, in what they called ''a shot across the bow'' to other centrists who obstruct or weaken the Democratic agenda. 
 As dismayed as the left-leaning groups are by Congress's Democratic leadership, which they see as too conciliatory to party conservatives, many of them ultimately blame Mr. Obama for not standing up more forcefully to Republicans.
 ''This is the greatest reform president since Lyndon Johnson, and every progressive in the movement is dismayed and disaffected,'' said Robert L. Borosage, the co-director of the liberal Campaign for America's Future. ''Some of that is expectations that were shattered'' -- by Mr. Obama's lack of support for a public health insurance option and liberalized rules for union organizing, and his escalation in Afghanistan.
 ''But some of it is a broader question,'' Mr. Borosage added, ''which is you have these really historic reforms -- the biggest recovery plan ever, the most comprehensive health care reform since Medicare, what will be the most comprehensive financial reform since the '30s, the largest increase in student aid since the G.I. Bill -- and none of them are sufficient to the cause that they address.''
 That liberal lament is loudest right now on the issue of the government's role in creating jobs.
 A debate that has been simmering for months -- between those who want more stimulus spending and tax cuts to avoid an economic relapse, and those who fear the economic and political fallout of deeper debt -- is flaring now in Congress's struggle to enact another measure to create private sector jobs and preserve many in the public sector. 
 Mr. Obama supports a jobs measure larger than the one likely to pass in Congress -- though not as large as liberals want -- that would extend compensation to the long-term unemployed through the rest of the year, aid strapped cities and states that are slashing payrolls and provide $23 billion to prevent the layoffs of up to 300,000 teachers. 
 Yet Democrats in Congress are paring all those pieces to reduce the package's size and thus secure Democratic votes in the face of Republicans' near-united opposition. 
 Liberals say the president has prematurely encouraged the Democratic deficit hawks in Congress by his own anti-deficit rhetoric.
 ''The Congress is not stepping up and the president isn't leading,'' said Roger Hickey, Mr. Borosage's co-director at the Campaign for America's Future, which is sponsoring this week's gathering. ''He is not taking this to the country and saying, We've got to prevent the country from falling back into another recession.'' 
 The activists will not be happy, then, to learn on Tuesday that just as they are demanding more jobs-related spending, Mr. Obama is calling for additional steps to reduce overall federal spending. Previously, and unsuccessfully, they opposed his initiatives for a three-year domestic spending freeze, a pay-as-you-go law requiring offsetting savings for new spending and a bipartisan fiscal commission on reducing the debt, which the liberals view as a threat to Social Security.
 Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, in a speech to the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, will direct each federal agency, domestic and military, to identify under-performing programs equivalent to 5 percent of its department's appropriations. Also, for a second year the non-security-related agencies must show how they would budget if they were held to 5 percent below the planned freeze. 
 Mr. Orszag, in an interview, said that would give the administration options as it prepares its next budget for release early next year to either chop an agency's budget or ''nip and tuck'' various programs within it.
 ''I strongly believe that we need to be acting aggressively to address the twin deficits we face -- the jobs deficit in the short run and the fiscal deficit in the medium and long term,'' Mr. Orszag said. ''We ignore either one at our peril.''
 In truth, none of the cuts in annual appropriations will significantly reduce the long-term deficit projections. Those are driven mostly by escalating costs for the benefit programs that liberals most aggressively protect -- Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- and by insufficient tax revenues to support them.
 For all their criticism, the activists say their conference also will aim to get out the liberal vote in November to prevent a Republican takeover of Congress.
 ''We cannot afford to let our disappointments get in the way of organizing,'' Mr. Borosage said. ''At least, for the first time in 30 years, real reforms are on the table.''

HEADLINE: If the City Had One Wish to Make, It Wouldn't Be for a Clarinetist

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Starting at its highest political reach, New York has put muscle into a campaign to lure LeBron James, considered by those who are schooled in basketball to be among LeBest players of all time. The Cleveland Cavaliers have him. But Mr. James becomes a free agent in three weeks. After that, he may go where he wishes.
 His imminent availability has given rise to a breathless campaign called ''C'mon LeBron.'' Come to New York. It is an odd exercise. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other prominent New Yorkers have turned themselves into mendicants, all but getting down on one knee to beg the Ohio-born Mr. James to abandon his home state and grace us with his talent. 
 In one sense, the supplicant impulse is understandable. The professional basketball teams here are painful embarrassments. The Brooklyn-bound Nets of New Jersey established themselves this season as one of the worst bunches ever assembled. The New York Knicks have gasped through nine straight losing seasons, routinely providing about as much entertainment as a mugging.
 When you wander endlessly in the wilderness, you might grow frantic looking for a savior. That is where Mr. James comes in. Single-handedly, he is supposed to lead New York to basketball's equivalent of the promised land.
 Of course, many New Yorkers don't give a dribble about basketball. For their benefit, the numbers-loving Bloomberg administration has come up with an analysis to show that Mr. James's presence would be a boon to the local economy. It is potentially worth $57.8 million a year, the city's Economic Development Corporation says.
 The corporation arrived at this curiously precise figure by estimating the extra money that fans would spend on restaurants and hotel rooms should the Jamesian Knicks not only make it to the post-season playoffs -- something that right now would require God's dropping everything else -- but also go all the way to the finals. This analysis may be taken with a shaker of salt. It rests on several rocky assumptions, including the competence of a team whose name could reasonably be spelled Nix.
 Nonetheless, the strenuous effort being poured into ''C'mon LeBron'' raises a question. If so much energy can be expended on a basketball player, why can't the same be done in a range of endeavors, including some that are of far greater interest to many New Yorkers?
 For example, the New York Philharmonic has been without a principal clarinetist since the retirement in September of Stanley Drucker, who had the job for 60 years. The orchestra has been auditioning a series of possible successors.
 Mr. James is not the only major talent in Cleveland worth stealing. City Hall could beat the tympanum to pry Franklin Cohen from the Cleveland Orchestra, where he is the much-admired first clarinetist. In the LeBron mode, this campaign could be called ''Get Goin' Cohen.'' Surely, the Philharmonic deserves as much mayoral attention as do the Knicks.
 In the world of pop music, the city could go all out to persuade Justin Bieber to relocate here. He's a 16-year-old singer, the latest teen/tween heartthrob. He was born in Canada and lives in Atlanta. On Friday, something like 12,000 screaming girls filled Rockefeller Center to see a free Justin show. Move him to New York, charge hefty prices for his performances, and he could be a gold mine for the city -- until the next teen idol comes along, anyway.
 Couldn't a case be made that the Dalai Lama, who visits New York fairly often, would do better living full time in exile here rather than in Dharamsala, India? Isn't it time that Alice Waters gave up on California and brought her principles of sustainable dining to this, the restaurant capital of the country? Hasn't Prince Charles grown tired of hanging around London waiting, waiting, waiting to become king? Is there no way to persuade Warren Buffett that Wall Street needs him as a physical presence? The Oracle of Omaha could be the Guru of Gotham.
 We know: None of these moves are likely to come to pass. Neither is a LeBron relocation to New York. He has already said that Cleveland ''does have an edge'' in keeping him.
 Maybe he is been influenced by a new show that is scheduled to begin next week on the TV Land network. It is called ''Hot in Cleveland.'' 
 Could it be that everyone in self-absorbed New York has been wrong this whole time about what's hot and what's not?

HEADLINE: Bernanke Forecasts A Fitful Recovery

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The American economy will probably be slow to recover, with joblessness remaining high for some time, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Monday evening. 
 ''My best guess is that we'll have a continued recovery, but it won't feel terrific,'' Mr. Bernanke told the broadcast journalist Sam Donaldson in a question-and-answer session at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 
 Although he said that economic forecasting was a bit like reading entrails, Mr. Bernanke warned that the unemployment rate could remain near double digits for a while. He added that the central bank would probably have to start raising interest rates before the economy returns to full employment. 
 ''Even though technically we'll be in recovery and the economy will be growing, unemployment will still be high for a while and that means that a lot of people will be under financial stress,'' he said.
 Asked about the debt crisis in Europe, Mr. Bernanke pointed to the recent drop in the American stock markets. ''Investors aren't completely convinced that this problem can be taken care of,'' he said. ''All I can say is that we are watching it very carefully.''
 Mr. Bernanke also reiterated his position that the United States has to make difficult choices to rein in its deficit. ''We can see what problems can arise in a country if investors lose confidence in the fiscal position of that country, so it is very important that we address this problem,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke also endorsed the financial regulatory measures that have been passed by the House and Senate. ''The acid test of the reform will be: Will it manage, will it control, 'too big to fail'?'' he said. He said the bills sought to reduce the likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts by raising capital and liquidity standards for banks, creating a process for dismantling them, and requiring that they provide ''living wills'' that would spell out their orderly demise.
