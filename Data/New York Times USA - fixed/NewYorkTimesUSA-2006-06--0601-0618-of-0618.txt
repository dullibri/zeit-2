HEADLINE: Mexico's Presidential Election Pits Promise Against Fear

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 28 

 BODY:
Mexico's polarizing presidential campaign ended officially on Wednesday and, with four days to go before the vote, it has come down to a contest between a gritty, charismatic advocate for the poor and a well-educated technocrat. 
 Like many elections, this one is a struggle between promise and fear and remains too close to call. On one side is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the former mayor of Mexico City who has traveled little outside Mexico and says he is inspired by Gandhi and Franklin D. Roosevelt. On the other is Felipe Calderon, the former energy minister with a Harvard degree who talks of fitting Mexico into the globalized economy.
But for many voters the choice is complicated because Mexico only emerged six years ago from seven decades of single-party, autocratic rule and there are some who say that what is at stake on Sunday is the survival of still-fragile democratic institutions. 
 ''My fear is that with Lopez Obrador we could end up very soon with an all-powerful president again,'' Enrique Krauze, an author and historian, said Monday at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, adding that Mr. Lopez Obrador was ''very ignorant'' and ''inward looking'' and ''dismisses the rule of law as something made by the bourgeoisie to oppress the poor.'' 
 Such accusations and concerns -- and many consider them nothing short of fearmongering -- have defined the race for many voters. 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador has been hit with advertisements depicting him as a spendthrift populist with a tendency to foment violent protests. His opponents have compared him to President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and have suggested that he is an autocrat. Many of Mr. Calderon's supporters acknowledge they are voting out of fear of what a maverick leftist like Mr. Lopez Obrador might do, rather than enthusiasm for Mr. Calderon, a dapper man who speaks with all the fire of an economist. 
 ''It's more of a vote against Lopez Obrador than for Calderon,'' explained Jorge Valenzuela, a cab driver in Mexico City. ''Lopez Obrador seems to me like a well-intentioned person, but he's very violent.''
 The most recent polls last week showed that Mr. Calderon and Mr. Lopez Obrador each had about 35 percent of the vote, with a third candidate, Roberto Madrazo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, trailing behind with the support of fewer than a quarter of likely voters.
 Recently, Mexico's most important business group has released advertisements suggesting that Mr. Lopez Obrador's slate of welfare programs will bankrupt the state and lead to an economic collapse like the ones in 1982 and 1995. He has promised to crack down on tax evasion and waste, and reduce government salaries to pay for $20 billion in social programs and public works.
 Mr. Calderon has offered a starkly different vision, promising to create jobs through private investment. He calls for sticking with the tight monetary, free-trade and pro-business policies of President Vicente Fox. He also proposes cutting income tax rates for businesses and the rich to spur investment.
 Still, at his last campaign rally here in the capital on Sunday, speaking to more than 80,000 people, Mr. Calderon spent much of his speech attacking Mr. Lopez Obrador, suggesting he was a throwback to the populist presidents of the 1970's and 1980's and charging that his plan would lead to financial collapse. 
 ''This picture we have already seen, and it was a horror show, for which all Mexicans paid dearly,'' Mr. Calderon said. ''The lesson is clear. Those peoples who do not remember their history are condemned to relive it.''
 Mr. Lopez Obrador, who leads the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, has dismissed these assertions. He notes that he balanced the budget of Mexico City during his five years as mayor, paying for new social programs with better tax collection, just as he wants to do on the federal level. 
 Indeed, in recent days, he has charged that Mexico's big businesses are in league with President Fox's National Action Party in trying to scare voters, calling them ''white-collar criminals'' who have gotten rich through influence peddling.
 ''What are they afraid of?'' he asked supporters in Toluca on Tuesday. ''That they'll lose their privileges. I would tell them, 'Calm down, be serene, nothing's going to happen.' Vengeance is not my forte. I'm not going to invent crimes. We're not going to hunt down anyone. The only thing that will happen is that Mexico will not be a country of privileges, the government will not be at the service of a minority.' ''
 Mr. Lopez Obrador finished a grueling whistle-stop campaign Wednesday with a giant rally here in the central square. While he has been more charismatic on the stump, his opponents have outspent and outflanked him on television and radio. 
 Mr. Madrazo has tried to position himself as a moderate alternative, emphasizing his experience as former governor of Tabasco State and ability to ''get things done.'' 
 But his Institutional Revolutionary Party, the machine that ruled Mexico with only token opposition for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000, has been plagued with infighting and defections. 
 Mr. Calderon, meanwhile, has garnered the support of a handful of the county's most prominent intellectuals, among them the former foreign minister, Jorge G. Casteneda, and Mr. Krauze, the historian. 
 These critics worry a charismatic figure like Mr. Lopez Obrador, who has said he identifies with Christ and talks about the need for ''the purification of public life,'' could roll back the democratic changes Mexico has made in the last decade by ignoring Congress and courts and appealing directly to the masses for support. 
 Others, like Homero Aridjis, a poet and environmentalist, worry that Mr. Lopez Obrador's sharp talk about the gap between rich and poor could provoke civil unrest. ''The peace of Mexico is held up by toothpicks,'' Mr. Aridjis said.
 Other intellectuals note that in the past two decades Mexico's central bank, supreme court, electoral commission and Congress have become strong, independent institutions.
 ''I am confident that were he to try, our institutions, constructed in the last 20 years, and the citizens at large would not allow for that to happen,'' said Rossana Fuentes Berain, the editor of the Spanish edition of Foreign Affairs. ''I am not one of those who thinks he's a danger for the country.'' 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador said it was absurd to contend that he would undermine a democracy he had spent much of his life fighting to build. 
 ''It's not true,'' he said in a recent interview. ''One must respect the institutions. I am in favor of the division and the balance of powers. I have said many times I come from the opposition who asked for this. I have written it. It's a conviction.''
 ''But moreover, no one in Mexico can put himself above the institutions, not even being a general and mounting a coup, not even that way,'' he added. ''This country would not permit it.''

HEADLINE: Give a Lot, Get a Little: The Budget Negotiations 

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Like a prom king and queen, the beaming couple descended the steps of City Hall to a burst of applause on Tuesday evening, touching each other gently and later embracing with genuine warmth and chaste kisses. 
 After the pleasantries announcing their agreement on a new $52.9 billion budget, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn started revealing some of the details. Their accord suggests that the two share a similar vision of government characterized by fiscal restraint, a commitment to children's programs and a belief that strong police programs are essential for economic growth.
 Mr. Bloomberg seems delighted by their relationship, but for Ms. Quinn, her accommodating approach may carry political risks. Some detractors question whether she places her own ambitions above the Council's interests. Several council members have complained privately that Ms. Quinn should have been able to secure more money for Council programs, given this year's $3.5 billion surplus, one of the largest in city history. 
 At least publicly, though, most council members said they were satisfied with her handling of the budget talks. ''They went along with her strategy of being nice to the mayor, and the mayor was nice to her,'' said John LoCicero, a longtime lobbyist. ''The strategy worked this year, big time.''
 The skill with which Ms. Quinn won over the mayor and created consensus among council members during the budget process has renewed speculation that she may have ambitions for higher office, or may even seek to stay on as speaker by moving to extend the two-term limit. Most council members support the idea of a third consecutive term, but Mr. Bloomberg has rejected it.
 In a departure from budget negotiations of recent years, this year's unfolded in utmost secrecy. Members said Ms. Quinn had demanded that they refrain from revealing budget details to lobbyists and reporters camped out at City Hall, insisting that the Council's bargaining position would only be weakened if the budget were ''negotiated on the steps.''
 ''Members know she is the authority figure and are fearful of running afoul of her,'' said George Arzt, a lobbyist and former press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch.
 Much of the budget remains unclear, but it does not appear to be appreciably more generous than in past years. The budget accord for the fiscal year that begins Saturday is $233 million greater than the executive budget the mayor proposed on May 4. 
 Last year, the negotiations added an almost identical amount, $230 million, to Mr. Bloomberg's proposed budget of $49.7 billion for the fiscal year that ends tomorrow. 
 Full details on the budget will be available today when the council members receive and vote on the actual budget, which includes a document known as Schedule C listing specific programs that were restored or added. During budget negotiations this week, members were given summaries of the various spending items to review but had to return them before leaving the room.
 Ms. Quinn's strategy and management style are starkly different from those of the previous speaker, Gifford Miller, who ran unsuccessfully last year for mayor. He was antagonistic to Mr. Bloomberg; she was conciliatory. He publicly voiced his disagreements over budget details; she all but took a vow of silence. He lost control of his members; she commanded their respect, if not yet their affection.
 In her first months in office, Ms. Quinn has already collaborated with Mr. Bloomberg on efforts to rein in lobbyists, restrict illegal gun traffic, and promote public awareness of domestic violence, among other things. Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly praised her leadership at news conferences and on his radio show.
 Ms. Quinn's supporters contend that she has proved to be tough underneath her agreeable demeanor. ''In the past, there were so many lines drawn in the sand that some things could not get done,'' said Councilman Michael E. McMahon, of Staten Island. ''The speaker understands the art of negotiation and in many cases can capitalize on the good will she's created with the mayor.''
 Ms. Quinn pressed the mayor during the negotiations to end the annual ''budget dance,'' in which his administration proposed cuts to programs and services only to see the Council restore them. Mr. Bloomberg himself gave Ms. Quinn credit for persuading him to incorporate programs for libraries, summer jobs and trash collection into his ''baseline'' budget from now on. 
 Still, by any measure, it was only a modest victory since Ms. Quinn had initially sought to include dozens of programs like counseling for former inmates, more day care slots, and a college scholarship program honoring a former Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone. 
 ''I think we could have stood up stronger to the mayor and not bowed to this annual budget dance process that we go through,'' Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn said.
 Ms. Quinn achieved only some of the policy priorities that she outlined in her April 6 budget response. Probably her greatest achievement in this budget cycle was persuading the mayor to appropriate $9.9 million to purchase 18,000 bullet-resistant vests for police officers. 
 Ms. Quinn had only mixed success in other areas as well. She had called for $135 million a year, to be phased in over three years, to enable 34,000 4-year-olds enrolled in half-day prekindergarten classes to join full-day programs, but she got only $7 million for 2,000 spaces. 
 She managed to get $2 million in aid for ''child advocacy centers'' where neglected and abused children receive medical treatment and talk with the police, lawyers and social workers, though it was less than the $7.5 million she had sought. Ms. Quinn got $4.2 million restored to the budgets of the five district attorneys, but no money for them to hire child advocates, as she had requested.
 Ms. Quinn secured $81,200 for farmers' markets, but failed to get an Office of Food Policy.

HEADLINE: Concerned About Inflation, Fed Raises Rate Again

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve on Thursday raised a key interest rate for the 17th consecutive time and signaled that further rate hikes may still be needed to fight inflation.
 The central bank boosted the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, by a quarter-point to 5.25 percent, the highest level in more than five years. When the Fed started its credit tightening campaign two years ago, the funds rate stood at a 46-year low of 1 percent. 
In the statement explaining the decision, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues said that "some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks."
 The committee said that "some inflation risks remain" even though it was likely that a moderation in economic growth "should help to limit inflation pressures over time."
 The Fed's rate hikes have raised the borrowing costs for millions of Americans on everything from home mortgages to auto loans.
 Commercial banks were expected to quickly follow the Fed announcement by raising their benchmark prime rate by a quarter-point to a five-year high of 8.25 percent.
 The latest rate hike had been widely expected given comments Bernanke made on June 5 in which he called a rise in the rate of inflation an "unwelcome" development, a comment that contributed to a one-day 199-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
 Bernanke, a former Princeton economics professor and chief economist for the Bush White House, took over for venerable Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on Feb. 1. Bernanke's first five months on the job have seen some rocky times as he has alternately sent markets soaring or plunging based on his comments.
 Some economists have complained that Bernanke, in an effort to be more open about the Fed's thinking, is actually increasing confusion.
 In its statement explaining Thursday's action, the Fed noted that recent indicators suggest that "economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."
 But at the same time, the statement said that "readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months."
 Analysts said the Fed could raise rates for an 18th time at the Aug. 8 meeting if those inflation reading continue to be above the Fed's comfort zone and the economy has not shown further signs of slowing.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise On Words From Fed

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
After weeks of being tugged between worries of slower growth and higher inflation, investors showed that they had regained a measure of optimism and confidence yesterday as the Federal Reserve appeared to indicate that it might be ready to end a two-year campaign to raise interest rates.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.2 percent -- its biggest one-day gain in almost three years. The other major benchmarks also rose 2 percent or more. Advancing issues led declining ones by more than five to one on the New York Stock Exchange. Treasury prices and crude oil also rose. 
The market was up early yesterday after the Commerce Department said that the economy grew faster in the first quarter than it had earlier estimated. 
 The gains accelerated in the afternoon after the Fed raised short-term interest rates a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent. What heartened investors in particular was the Fed's statement that any further increases were not certain but conditional ''on the outlook for inflation and economic growth.''
 ''Wall Street is the only place I know that loves the phrase 'the end is near,' '' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research.
 The relief brought by the Fed statement appears to be turning investors' attention to the upcoming quarterly earnings reporting season, which starts in about two weeks.
 ''There's a sense that this is another rate hike behind us and now we can concentrate on something else,'' said Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. ''We can forget about the Fed for a little while.''
 Mr. Stovall of Standard & Poor's said he expected average profits for the 500 companies in the S.& P. index to rise 9 percent from the quarter a year earlier. (Other analysts expect the jump could be as much as 12 percent, which, though slower than in recent quarters, would be a robust performance.)
 Some of the biggest gainers of yesterday's rally were companies like McDonald's, up 5 percent yesterday, and Monsanto, up 8.8 percent, which are showing stronger sales and profits. 
 The shares of companies in rate-sensitive industries like finance and housing also moved higher. Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 3.9 percent, while mortgage lender Countrywide Financial climbed 2 percent. 
 Still, analysts expected Wall Street worries to remain heightened that higher interest rates could damp an already slowing economy.
 The economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual pace in the first quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 5.3 percent. But rising interest rates have sapped that strength, particularly in the housing market, where sales are falling and prices are cooling in many previously hot markets.
 And rising energy prices are another persistent concern for the economy. 
 Yesterday, crude oil prices jumped $1.33, or 1.8 percent, to $73.52 a barrel, a day after the Energy Department said petroleum inventories fell noticeably last week. Inventories are closely watched, especially during the peak summer driving season.
 The Fed statement noted that higher energy prices ''have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.'' 
 It noted that its decision to raise rates would be contingent upon ''the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.''
 ''The question we still don't have clarity about is how much we might have to slow growth before we have inflation under control so we can sustain growth,'' said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds. ''That's going to be rough'' for the markets, he said.
 Based on Fed funds futures prices yesterday, investors remain convinced that policy makers will raise interest rates once more this year, but they were slightly less certain about a quarter-point increase at the Fed's next meeting on Aug. 8.
 As that date gets closer, Mr. Stovall says the market may hit a rough patch. 
 The earnings season will be over and investors will again turn their attention to inflation fears and worries about higher interest rates' slowing the economy.
 ''That will decide whether we finally have this 10 percent correction that has eluded us for three years,'' he said, referring to a market correction that has been anticipated. 
 ''You can't eat without swallowing,'' he said. ''At least not for too long.''
 The S.& P. 500 index is down 3.9 percent from its high for the year on May 5, even with yesterday's gain. 
 Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 26.87 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,272.87. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 2.7 percent, 62.54 points, to 2,174.38, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 217.24 points, or 2 percent, to 11,190.80. The Fed decision came after European markets were closed, but markets in Brazil and Mexico rose sharply yesterday.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 5.19 percent yesterday from 5.24 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: After Losses, Turkey Faces Its Investors

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Hell hath no greater fury than an emerging markets investor scorned. 
 Or so may have been the view of Durmus Yilmaz, the new governor of the central bank of Turkey earlier this week, when he faced a room full of disgruntled investors in Manhattan, many of whom were nursing heavy losses from a recent plunge in Turkish bond and equity markets.
Just last year Turkey was one of the world's best-performing markets, and foreign investors, seduced by a robust currency and quiescent inflation, invested there with abandon. 
 Now, in the wake of a mini-devaluation and a 47 percent stock market collapse from its peak this year, investors wanted answers. 
 Over lunch at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, they questioned Mr. Yilmaz about his ability to defend the Turkish lira and the prospect of a surge in inflation, according to people who attended.
 Investors are notoriously fickle, especially in the spasmodic world of emerging markets where one year's sweetheart can quickly become a pariah as rapid-fire billions head for the door. In the last three years, Turkey, together with India, Russia, Brazil and China, has seen its stock market soar on the back of stable currency and a fast-growing economy. 
 But higher interest rates in the United States have prompted investors to become more risk-averse. Turkey, generally seen as one of the more volatile of emerging markets, has suffered a more severe sell-off than its peers. 
 While the losses in Turkish stocks have captured more attention, it has been the pain sustained in the local bond market that highlights how foreign investors, including top hedge funds and the trading desks of big Wall Street firms, have been caught unaware in Turkey despite numerous warning signs. As with the losses encountered by investors in Indian oil and Brazilian telecommunication companies, the headlong rush by foreigners into Turkish treasury bills, historically seen as one of the riskiest asset classes in emerging markets, is one more indicator as to how investors have misjudged risk in these countries. 
 After a three-year bull market, the yields on Turkish treasury bills have shot up to 22 percent, from 14 percent, and taken together with a 20 percent devaluation in the lira have resulted in major losses for investors. 
 For those who had come to believe that Turkey's improving political climate, increased levels of foreign direct investment and aggressive privatization program had inoculated the country from the financial shocks it had suffered in the past, the reversal has been hard to swallow and perhaps explains the dyspeptic mood of investors at the meeting with the central bank governor.
 ''There was too much euphoria, they were saying it's different this time,'' said Atif Cezairli, the director of research at EFG Securities, a brokerage house based in Istanbul. ''People were saying that a country can afford to have a bigger current-account deficit without triggering a foreign currency crisis. It was as if nothing could go wrong.''
 But, as is often the case in emerging markets, especially Turkey, which lived through wrenching market meltdowns in 1993 and 2001, something did go awry. 
 To be sure, the turnaround in the Turkish economy has defied expectations. Long hobbled by double-digit inflation rates, punishing budget deficits and political infighting, the Turkish economy has been transformed in recent years, with inflation plummeting to single digits. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country has opened itself up to the world, pursuing integration with the European Union and attracting a wave of foreign investment.
 Still, warning signs have been plain to see. The current-account deficit had increased to 7 percent of gross domestic product this year, spurred by an unusually strong currency. High levels of liquidity, foreign and domestic, and growth pressures in the economy had resulted in a small increase in inflation. 
 As investors withdrew from emerging markets en masse last month, Turkey suffered more than others, forcing the central bank to raise rates aggressively to defend the suddenly vulnerable currency, which had attracted the attention of hedge funds taking short positions on the belief the currency would fall further.
 The popularity of Turkish treasury bills over the last few years underscores how the risk perception for Turkey has changed. In the 1990's, when inflation hovered around 60 percent and the currency would lose about that value each year, rates for Turkish paper reached levels of 80 percent. High as they may have been, such rates attracted only the bravest of foreign investors, who when they did invest, mostly took their chances with bonds that had maturities of less than a year.
 The improving economy more recently set off a rerating in Turkish debt. Yields plummeted, maturities lengthened and foreigners piled in. By February of this year, foreign investors held $23 billion in Turkish treasury bills, according to public data. Three months later, the rout more or less complete, foreign investor holdings had decreased to $15 billion.
 Mr. Durmus's rocky encounter with investors notwithstanding, his sharp increase in rates has stabilized both the currency and the markets, giving heart to investors that the worst may have passed. ''While the governor's lunch presentation may not be recorded in the annals of the best public speeches,'' wrote Serhan Cevik, an economist for Morgan Stanley who organized the gathering, ''his actions have already spoken louder.''

HEADLINE: Detroit Takes Different Turn Onto Green Road

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., June 29 

 BODY:
Detroit auto companies, which have lagged far behind their Japanese rivals in developing and selling hybrid vehicles, are taking a new direction in a bid to emerge as leaders in their own right on environmental issues.
 The latest sign of this shift occurred Thursday, when the Ford Motor Company confirmed that it would not meet its widely publicized goal of selling 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010, a goal set last fall when energy prices spiked after Hurricane Katrina.
Instead, Ford plans to focus its attention on flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on gasoline and another type of fuel such as ethanol, William Clay Ford Jr., its chief executive, told employees in a memo distributed Wednesday. 
 Ford was the first Detroit company to sell hybrid models and it will continue to develop them, Mr. Ford said in an interview here. But that will be part of a broader program to produce cleaner, more efficient vehicles, he said. 
 ''This is in no way a lack of commitment to hybrids,'' Mr. Ford said. ''It's an expansion of our commitment to other technologies.''
 Mr. Ford, known for his lifelong interest in environmental causes, acknowledged that he would be criticized for the move. But, he said, ''The goal all along is a sustainability goal. It is not a hybrid goal.''
 Environmental groups, as expected, were quick to criticize the company. The Sierra Club said it was ''appalled'' that Ford was pulling back on its commitment to hybrids in favor of flexible-fuel vehicles.
 Daniel F. Becker, director of the group's global warming program, said that because Ford had already backed off a previous promise to build more fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles, the company was ''rapidly becoming the automaker that cried wolf.''
 In 2000, Mr. Ford pledged that the company would achieve a 25 percent increase in the fuel economy of its S.U.V.'s by 2005. But it stepped away from its pledge two years before the deadline. Mr. Ford later said in an company report that it was unable to develop fuel-saving technology as quickly as it had hoped.
 Ford is not going down the flexible-fuel path alone. On Wednesday, chief executives of the Detroit auto companies sent a letter to Congress, pledging to double their production of flexible-fuel vehicles to two million a year by 2010. The two largest Japanese carmakers, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, do not sell flexible-fuel vehicles in the United States. 
 In recent months, General Motors and the Chrysler Group have each increased their emphasis on flexible-fuel models, even though they have been developing hybrids.
 G.M., in particular, has been aggressively marketing the fact that some of its models, like the Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo midsize cars, are able to run on E85, a mixture of ethanol, which is grain alcohol derived from corn, and gasoline. 
 Earlier this year, it introduced a splashy marketing campaign, ''Live Green. Go Yellow,'' that promotes G.M. vehicles that can run on the corn-based fuel. 
 Meanwhile, Chrysler dealers, who already sell flexible-fuel minivans, are asking for more models that can run on ethanol, the Chrysler chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, said last week. He said the company's new Sebring sedan would be available in a flexible-fuel version.
 Auto companies began making flexible-fuel vehicles in 1988, after Congress passed legislation giving them credits toward meeting corporate average fuel economy standards for each vehicle they sold. 
 Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club said Thursday that Ford's shift was motivated by a bid for more credits. But Mr. Ford noted there were tax credits for buyers of hybrid vehicles as well. ''It's not a credit-driven thing,'' he said. ''We get credit either way.''
 More than five million flexible-fuel vehicles now are on American roads, according to the Web site Edmunds.com, even though many consumers may not be aware that their automobiles can run on something other than gasoline. 
 The renewed flexible fuel emphasis makes business sense at a time when G.M. and Ford are losing hundreds of millions of dollars on their automotive operations in North America, analysts said.
 Flexible-fuel technology is essentially paid for, while it would take years and extensive investments in hybrids for American automakers to catch up to Toyota and Honda. ''It's a pretty inexpensive and easy way to make your product line more green -- not nearly as expensive as doing the hybrid thing,'' said John Paul MacDuffie, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
 Toyota has sold more than 600,000 hybrids worldwide since 2000. Honda has sold about 150,000 hybrids worldwide in that same period.
 Ford has sold about 30,000 Escape hybrids since they went on sale in 2004. Hybrids make up less than 1 percent of Ford's sales, compared to about 5 percent of Honda's sales and 6 percent of Toyota's sales in the United States.
 This focus on ethanol does offer bragging rights for Detroit auto companies, since Japanese companies have not sold flexible-fuel vehicles in the United States, with the exception of the Nissan Titan pickup. That may soon change. Toyota plans to sell a flexible-fuel vehicle in Brazil, where ethanol is widely used, during the coming year. Its engineers are looking at all sorts of new technologies.
 ''It's a horse race,'' said Jo Cooper, a Toyota group vice president for government and industry affairs. ''Everyone in the auto industry wants to have a light-bulb idea.''
 Ms. Cooper said Toyota would maintain its emphasis on hybrid vehicles, which appeal to customers for a variety of reasons. ''Fuel economy is one,'' she said, ''But people love them for the technology. People love them because they're different. They love them because they feel like they're making a contribution'' to helping the environment.
 Neither hybrid nor flexible-fuel technology is expected to be the ultimate answer to America's dependence on foreign oil, since both rely in part on gasoline, analysts said. 
 And both have drawbacks: hybrids generally cost more than cars with conventional gasoline engines, while only 600 of the nation's 180,000 service stations sell E85, and those are primarily in the Midwest.
 The scarcity of E85 fuel is an important reason why Detroit's automakers should not expect a significant lift in sales by emphasizing flexible-fuel vehicles, said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
 And since they have a lock on the market, Detroit's automakers might simply end up competing against each other, rather than taking sales away from Japanese vehicles. 
 For now, G.M. is maintaining its goal of offering a dozen hybrid models by 2010. It already sells hybrid pickup trucks and will offer a hybrid version of the Saturn Vue sport utility later this summer. 
 But persuading car shoppers that American brands offer fuel-efficient vehicles is a challenge, Mark R. LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president for North American sales and marketing, conceded this week. 
 ''The Japanese reputation for fuel economy really got set back in the '70s,'' Mr. LaNeve said during a conference call Tuesday. ''This shows you how long it takes, how embedded some consumers' opinions are, and how long it takes to change those opinions.'' 
 For his part, Mr. Ford said it was important for car companies to continue developing all types of vehicles so they could keep pace with advancements in fuels. ''We need to keep a hand in everything so that when a break comes, we can move fast,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Text of the Fed Statement on Interest Rates 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:
 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/4 percent.
Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.
 Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months. Ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remain contained. However, the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.
 Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate, to 6 1/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas.

Previews and Openings

'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' In previews. Opens on Thursday. Based on historical fact, Jose Rivera's new play is about two days that Che Guevera spent trapped in a one-room schoolhouse. A co-production with the Labyrinth Theater company. John Ortiz and Patricia Velasquez star. (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200.

'SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL' Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. Fifteen emerging playwrights, including Peter Morris and Etan Frankel, strut their stuff in this eclectic annual showcase. Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.

Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of cliches set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with elan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ARABIAN NIGHT' A blonde in a German apartment building sleeps too much; the super takes an unexpected trip to the desert; and a peeping Tom is properly punished in this stylish comedy whose title turns out to make perfect sense (1:05). The East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates)

'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16; closes on Sunday. (Hunka)

'ELVIS AND JULIET' This opposites-collide tale by Mary Willard and starring her husband, the television actor Fred Willard, looks like community theater and is just as unoriginal. The title characters are young lovers, he the son of an Elvis impersonator, she the daughter of overeducated snobs. Fred dons an Elvis suit, but it's not enough (2:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'GETTING HOME' Anton Dudley's Valentine's Day card to New York, in which three lonely lovers finally find love in unexpected places, directed by David Schweizer. Determinedly angst-free (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closes tomorrow. (Hunka)

'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Gates)

'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

* 'THE MOST WONDERFUL LOVE' Blue Coyote Theater Group has a rollicking good time with this inventive tale of domestic disintegration by Matthew Freeman. Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), after long years together, decide to ''unmarry,'' which isn't quite the same as divorce but just as unsettling for their already unsettled youngest child (Josephine Stewart). But that doesn't begin to convey how nutty this play is. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'NERVE' In Adam Szymkowicz's romantic comedy, an online couple's first date is a frightening but satisfyingly comic escalation of confessions and demands (1:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow.(Gates)

'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'SATELLITES' This tough-minded, soft-hearted and very likable play by Diana Son (''Stop Kiss'') portrays a world in which traditional ethnic, social, economic and sexual boundaries have become so porous that people are never quite sure who or where they are. Sandra Oh and Kevin Carroll play a couple who move into a Brooklyn brownstone that refuses (literally) to stay still. Michael Greif directs the appropriately fluid ensemble. (1:40). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)

* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)

'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)

'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

* 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in this gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with hand-held cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden) 'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)

'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)

* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)

'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)

* 'GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS' (No rating, 103 minutes) Affected but elegant, this digital video ''Death in Venice'' follows an art historian and her lover as they grapple, frequently in the buff, with life, death and the iconography of Bosch. (Lee)

'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)

'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)

'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses cliches and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael Garcia Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)

'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)

'LAND OF THE BLIND' (R, 111 minutes) Watching this simplistic Orwellian fable set in a composite Everycountry that swings politically from extreme right to extreme left is like poring over a quadruple exposure. It's a jumble of ideas and images. (Holden)

'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)

'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)

* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carriere's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)

* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)

'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)

'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiance home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)

'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)

* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)

* 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)

'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)

'SAY UNCLE' (R, 90 minutes) A comedy about a suspected gay pedophile is something even Mel Brooks might balk at, but ''Say Uncle'' would have benefited from his ability to turn bad taste into a good feature. When a childlike artist (Peter Paige, who also writes and directs) indulges his unhealthy, if innocent, interest in other people's children, a lynch mob of local moms is formed to hunt him down. Aspiring to address gay persecution and social paranoia, the movie mostly comes off as a study of arrested development. (Catsoulis)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

* 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of Joao Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)

'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)

'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)

* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)

'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

* BELLE AND SEBASTIAN (Tuesday) For a decade now, these members of Scottish indie royalty have made some of the most tasteful chamber pop on the planet: calm and elegant and clever, though sometimes a little bloodless. But the band loosened up a bit for its latest, ''The Life Pursuit'' (Matador), adding some bluesy vamps and -- could it be? -- some rock 'n' roll. At 3:30 p.m., the Lawn at Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free, but tickets are required. (Ben Sisario)

KURTIS BLOW (Thursday) The City Parks Foundation's series of free concerts in parks throughout the five boroughs begins in Brooklyn with Kurtis Blow, who became one of the first heroes of rap with strutting and innocently street-smart rhymes like ''The Breaks'' (''Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car/ Breaks to make you a superstar''). At 7 p.m., Von King Park, Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (212) 360-8290; free. (Sisario)

BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Toronto collective has mastered a kind of free-associative indie-prog, following melodies and rhythmic patterns along endlessly fascinating tangents. The band plays a benefit concert for the Celebrate Brooklyn series, with the Hidden Cameras, another inventive and well-populated Toronto band. At 6 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882 or (866) 468-7619; $30. (Sisario)

JOHNNY DOWD; MARY LORSON AND SAINT LOW (Thursday) Johnny Dowd applies his stoic Texas twang to songs about passion, sin and death; his band plays a version of honky-tonk that sounds as if it has been dragged through a swamp and encrusted with misfiring electronics. Mary Lorson, who was at the core of the band Madder Rose, has a pensive undertow behind her airy voice, floating in tunes that blend a folky delicacy with the lilt of jazz. Fans of Suzanne Vega or Mazzy Star owe it to themselves to discover her. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $12. (Jon Pareles)

FUTUREHEADS (Tonight) The Futureheads, from the northern English city of Sunderland, play tight, nervy and exhilarating little tantrums of guitar, with four-part chants and an endless supply of clever riffs. The band's first album, released two years ago, was one of the best by the many recent bands to resuscitate the angular postpunk of Gang of Four and Wire, and its new one, ''News and Tributes'' (Star Time/Vagrant), shows that it was no accident. With the French Kicks. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario)

GIPSY KINGS (Thursday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $31.50 to $81.50. (Pareles)

* JOSE GONZALEZ, JUANA MOLINA, PSAPP (Monday) Connoisseurs of hip television soundtracks might recognize some of the music on this bill. Jose Gonzalez, an Argentinean Swede, plays haunting, austere confessions with precision guitar picking and a deadpan hush; his song ''Crosses'' was played in the soap-opera season finale of ''The OC'' this spring. Juana Molina is another whispery Argentine, whose gentle, swirling lullabies draw a listener directly into her reveries. The English duo Psapp places soft vocals over beats constructed from found sounds like splashing water, creaking floorboards and even squeaking cats, creating a kind of hyperintimate electronica; ''Grey's Anatomy'' uses one of Psapp's songs as its theme. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario)

JOE JACKSON (Tonight) In songs like ''Is She Really Going Out With Him?'' and ''Steppin' Out'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, Joe Jackson made his reputation as a cold-eyed master of British soul, bringing a cutting new-wave minimalism to stories of lonely lovers who cry that they are ''so tired of all the darkness in our lives.'' Since then he has proved remarkably versatile, releasing, among other projects, settings of the Seven Deadly Sins and a Grammy-winning recording of his Symphony No. 1. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario)

* SALIF KEITA (Tonight) Salif Keita, from Mali, has long been celebrated for a cosmopolitan ear and a voice that can melt hearts, but lately, with a devotion to acoustic guitars, his work has been even more entrancing than usual. His new album, ''M'Bemba'' (Decca), has songs of love and tribute to ancestors, its guitars joined by instruments from Hawaii, the Caribbean and even medieval Europe. At 8, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $39 and $49. (Sisario)

ANGELIQUE KIDJO, VUSI MAHLASELA (Tomorrow) Angelique Kidjo, from Benin, has a raw, gutsy voice, charisma that lights up a stage, and the determination to reach the world. Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)

BAABA MAAL (Sunday) Baaba Maal, one of the great singers and bandleaders from Senegal, merges the incantatory vocals and twinkling guitar lines of griot songs with elements of rock, reggae and Afro-Cuban music. His fusions embrace the world without leaving Senegal behind. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $34 in advance, $38 at the door. (Pareles)

* MADONNA (Sunday and Monday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $354.50 . (Sisario)

MATES OF STATE (Thursday) Most of the time Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the married couple who make up Mates of State, sing insistent, almost nagging chants propelled by quick-pulse organ and drums; their latest, ''Bring It Back'' (Barsuk), also has some soothing, affectionate piano songs. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)

MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tonight through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing continues tonight with western swing by the Bob Wills's Texas Playboys (who have continued since Wills's death 21 years ago); tomorrow features salsa with Alex Torres y Su Orquesta, a 13-piece band; on Tuesday, Jo Thompson sings swing favorites with the J. C. Heard Orchestra; Beth Mead's Big Bandjo, on Wednesday, plays -- can you guess? -- classic swing songs in banjo-led arrangements; and Thursday features plena, the traditional Puerto Rican form of singing, dancing and social commentary, with Plena Libre. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15 each night. (Sisario)

AMY RIGBY, ROBBIE FULKS (Tonight) After years in various New York country-rock groups, Amy Rigby emerged on her own. She has made six worthy albums of succinct, tuneful songs about struggling through adulthood, when jobs, romance and motherhood aren't exactly what she'd hoped for. Robbie Fulks is fond of honky-tonk and the Beatles, and he comes up with tuneful, neatly phrased songs about near-psychotic characters. At 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Pareles)

* TV ON THE RADIO, MATT POND PA (Tonight) One of Brooklyn's finest and most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. The band has a fantastic and long-awaited new album, ''Return to Cookie Mountain,'' which is due to be released by Interscope Records later this year. Matt Pond PA adds some interesting colors to its indie-rock songs with touches of cello and strings. At 6:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)

RHONDA VINCENT (Wednesday) Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin and pushes bluegrass in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 538-6667; free. (Pareles)

WALKMEN (Tonight) The Walkmen emerged five years ago, playing exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. The band's new album, ''A Hundred Miles Off'' (Record Collection), begins intriguingly, with festive Mexican horns, but pretty soon it's back to the familiar guitar-bleached anguish. At 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $17.50. (Sisario)

GARY WILSON AND THE BLIND DATES (Wednesday) The point is often made that not all the bands at CBGB in the late 1970's sounded like the Ramones. But perhaps no one was less like the Ramones than Gary Wilson, who played a kind of shattered lounge music with angst-ridden, unhinged vocals. (He also sometimes wrapped his face in plastic and wore two sets of sunglasses, something that might have actually looked cool on Joey Ramone.) Mr. Wilson disappeared from the scene in the early 80's but has played occasional dates since his re-emergence four years ago. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario)

Cabaret

Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)

* Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45 and 10:45, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden)

* JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) A theater singer with jazz chops, Ms. Molaskey combines sophisticated wit, fierce intelligence and a lightly swinging voice that hovers on the keen edge between happy and sad. A hybrid of the bossa nova standard ''Desafinado'' and Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls'' performed Brazilian style is the pinnacle of a show whose material she describes as ''limbo songs.'' At 9 and 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the 9 p.m. shows; $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

THOMAS ANKERSMIT, BENTON-C BAINBRIDGE, BOBBY PREVITE (Tomorrow) Throughout July, the Issue Project Room in Brooklyn will present works specifically designed for its cylindrical space, and for the ceiling-hung 16-channel speaker system installed there.

At 8 p.m., Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen)

CYRUS CHESTNUT TRIO (Wednesday through July 8) Mr. Chestnut is a stalwart straight-ahead pianist with a penchant for gospel and blues shadings. He is most comfortable with a trio; this one includes Michael Hawkins on bass and Neil Smith on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and July 8. (Chinen)

THE CLARINETS (Tomorrow) Three clarinetists walk into a bar and manage to make music that's not only serious but also mysterious and broadly textured. The clarinetists are Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed, and their improvisational chemistry is no joke. At 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

GEORGE COLLIGAN AND MAD SCIENCE (Tomorrow) Last year Mr. Colligan, a keyboardist with a powerful rhythmic presence, released a modernistic organ trio album called ''Realization'' (Sirocco Music). He pursues a similar purpose here, with the guitarist Tom Guarna and the drummer Kenny Grohowski. At 10 p.m., Ace of Clubs, 9 Great Jones Street, between Broadway and Lafayette Streets, West Village, (212) 677-6963, www.aceofclubsnyc.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

ERIK FRIEDLANDER'S BROKEN ARM (Thursday) This tribute to the bassist Oscar Pettiford and the pianist Herbie Nichols features Mr. Friedlander's pizzicato cello playing against a simple rhythm backdrop of bass (Kermit Driscoll) and drums (Mike Sarin). The name is an oblique reference to Mr. Pettiford; both Mr. Friedlander's arms are fine. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

BEN GERSTEIN COLLECTIVE (Sunday) Mr. Gerstein, a trombonist, has led this free-improvising ensemble for the last half-dozen years, enlisting bright young players like Jacob Sacks (on keyboards), Eivind Opsvik (on bass) and Jacob Garchik (on accordion and electronics). At 8 and 10 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5. (Chinen)

CURTIS HASSELBRING'S NEW MELLOW EDWARDS/JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Sunday) Two smart ensembles that harness the forward thrust of rock in the service of an almost chamberlike group cohesiveness. The trombonist Curtis Hasselbring's group is the more raucous of the two; the Claudia Quintet, led by the drummer John Hollenbeck, is the more refined. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)

VINCENT HERRING QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Herring, an alto saxophonist, rolls out a locomotive brand of post-bop with the help of Anthony Wonsey on piano, Richie Goods on bass and Joris Dudli on drums. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)

MALABY/SANCHEZ/RAINEY (Tonight) A trio that treads a middle ground between lyricism and abstraction, with Tony Malaby on saxophones, Angelica Sanchez on piano and Tom Rainey on drums. At 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

JOHN MCNEIL/BILL McHENRY QUARTET (Sunday) Mr. McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mr. McHenry, a tenor saxophonist, mostly play obscurities by the 1950's West Coast pianist Russ Freeman in this solid and often delightful quartet, with Tom Hubbard on bass and Jochen Ruckert on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Night and Day, 230 Fifth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 399-2161; cover, $5, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

DAVY MOONEY TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Mooney has a coolly casual tone on guitar, and a vocal style to match. He offers an accessible and thoughtful variety of small-group swing, with Mark Anderson on bass and Ari Hoenig on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

* PAUL MOTIAN BAND (Through Sunday) This luminous ensemble consists of two contrasting pairs of improvisers (the tenor saxophonists Mark Turner and Chris Cheek, and the guitarists Steve Cardenas and Ben Monder); a couple of stabilizers (Jacob Bro and Jerome Harris, also guitarists); a lone anchor (the bassist Ben Street); and a mastermind (Mr. Motian, on drums). The band's last ECM album was excellent; its last Village Vanguard appearance, in January, was even better. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow, $20 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

RALPH PETERSON SEXTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a drummer, Mr. Peterson is a steamroller; as a bandleader, he's more like a sergeant. He has a way of producing strong results, as he probably will with this ensemble, featuring the trumpeter Igmar Thomas, the saxophonists Tia Fuller and Donald Lee, and the brotherly team of Zaccai and Luques Curtis on piano and bass. At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

HERLIN RILEY AND FRIENDS (Through Sunday) Few contemporary jazz drummers groove as naturally as Mr. Riley, who presides here over a quartet composed of other strong musicians with ties to Wynton Marsalis: the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Victor Goines, the pianist Eric Reed and the bassist Reginald Veal. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

PETE ROBBINS AND CENTRIC (Tomorrow) ''Waits and Measures'' (Playscape), the new album by the alto saxophonist Pete Robbins, is an intimate sort of jazz-rock hybrid complete with Fender Rhodes electric piano and artfully fuzzed-out electric guitar. The group plays here without its guitarist, but is otherwise intact. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $6, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

GONZALO RUBALCABA TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Rubalcaba can be an astonishing pianist technically, and he plays with a sense of dramatic flourish instilled by the music of his native Cuba. He works here with a rhythm section that recently distinguished itself under the aegis of the alto saxophonist Greg Osby: Matt Brewer on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30; $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)

ROMAN SKAKUN QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Skakun, a newly minted graduate of the New School jazz program, features his vibraphone playing and a few of his original compositions in this ensemble, which is impressively stocked with supporting players: the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenon, the pianist Bruce Barth, the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Jason Marsalis. At 10 and midnight, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

TYFT (Monday) This adventurous trio -- the guitarist Hilmar Jenssen, the alto saxophonist and bass clarinetist Andrew D'Angelo and the drummer Jim Black -- fashions roughly contoured music out of grainy texture and surging pulse. Their energy level is unflaggingly high, as is the caliber of their musicianship. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)

KEVIN UEHLINGER QUARTET (Wednesday) Biochemistry and the I Ching are hardly common themes in jazz, but Mr. Uehlinger, a keyboardist, has used aspects of both in his compositional framework. He has also employed musicians independent enough to strain against those constrictions: the trumpeter Nate Wooley, the bassist Keith Witty and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

* RANDY WESTON'S AFRICAN RHYTHMS TRIO/ELDAR (Wednesday through July 9) Mr. Weston, the pianist, has been one of the principal agents of an Africanized jazz aesthetic since his fateful first visit to Nigeria more than 40 years ago. He has an unfailingly expressive outlet in the ensemble African Rhythms, which appears here in trio form. Also on the bill is Eldar, a piano prodigy from Kyrgyzstan celebrating the release of his new trio album, ''Live at the Blue Note'' (Sony Classical), in the most appropriate setting. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

STEVE WILSON QUINTET (Tuesday through July 9) An alto saxophonist with a dry tone but a rounded sense of phrase, Mr. Wilson recruits an established rhythm section -- Bruce Barth on piano, Ed Howard on bass and Adam Cruz on drums -- and locks horns with the fine trumpeter Terrell Stafford. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 next Friday and July 8, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

LAKE GEORGE OPERA (Tonight through Thursday) ''Our Town,'' Ned Rorem's opera based on the Thornton Wilder play, is getting its first professional production from a company that may not have all the resources of the music school (Indiana University's) that gave it its world premiere. The company's other two offerings of its summer season are ''I Pagliacci'' and ''The Barber of Seville.'' ''Our Town,'' tomorrow at 8, Wednesday afternoon at 1; ''Barber,'' tomorrow afternoon at 1, Thursday night at 8; ''Pagliacci,'' tonight at 8, Sunday afternoon at 1.

Classical Music

ASTON MAGNA (Tonight and tomorrow) This 34-year-old festival dates back to the early days of the period-instruments movement. Mozart, the ubiquitous birthday boy this year, is the focus of the first of the season's six concerts; it includes some perennial favorites (''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' and ''Exsultate, Jubilate'') as well as ''Bastien and Bastienne,'' the singspiel he wrote when he was 12. Dominique Labelle, a fine soprano, is one of the soloists. Tonight at 8, Olin Humanities Building, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7425; tomorrow afternoon at 5, Daniel Arts Center at Simon's Rock College, Great Barrington, Mass., (800) 875-7156. $35. (Midgette)

Dance

Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

* AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow; Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) The last three performances of Kevin McKenzie's ''Swan Lake'' are tonight and tomorrow. On Monday begins a mere four-performance run (the house will be dark on Tuesday) of Frederick Ashton's ''Sylvia,'' which was a critical hit last summer but which Ballet Theater apparently feels cannot sustain a full week's run. Instead, next weekend, there will be three more performances of ''Le Corsaire.'' The ''Sylvia'' is worth seeing, though, both for itself and to provide a contrast to Mark Morris's version, coming next month with the San Francisco Ballet. Ballet Theater's season continues until July 15. Tonight, tomorrow night and Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or abt.org; $23 to $100. (John Rockwell)

* BARD SUMMERSCAPE (Tonight and tomorrow night) This summer arts festival features two new dances by Donna Uchizono, performed by her company and by the guest artist Mikhail Baryshnikov, whose Hell's Kitchen arts center commissioned one piece.

At 7 p.m. (Garden tour at 6:30 p.m.) Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200 or www.wavehill.org; free with admission to the center: $4; $2 for students and 65+. (Dunning)

LO-LO LO-LO DANCE PERFORMANCE COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) From Japan, the company is making its New York City debut in ''As an Ugly Duck,'' a quintet choreographed by Kazumi Taoka that explores love and force by using bodies, space, eye contact, touching and voice. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students. (Dunning)

* LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) This eclectic whirl of a downtown-dance festival continues at three theaters in the La MaMa complex with ''Mavericks in Motion,'' whose choreographers include Abby Chen, Bhavani Lee and Deborah Lohse (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.); the highly recommended ''Dancing Divas'' program of choreography by Pat Catterson, Ellen Fisher, Keely Garfield, Sally Gross, Deborah Jowitt, Jodi Melnick, Yvonne Meier and Vicky Shick (tonight at 10); ''Children of Ur,'' which includes dances by Karinne Keithley, David Neuman, Nicky Paraiso and the program curator, Chris Yon (tomorrow at 5:30 p.m.); ''Burlesque,'' whose stars include Julie Atlas Muz and Dirty Martini (tomorrow at 10 p.m.); ''Duet,'' with a roster of five pairs of dancer-choreographers (Sunday at 5:30 p.m.); and ''Border Jumping,'' with work by six artists, including Bill Irwin, representing the United States (Thursday at 7:30 p.m.). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 475-7710 or www.lamama.org; $10 (Dunning)

NICHOLAS LEICHTER ( Tomorrow) For its 10th-anniversary season, the company Nicholasleichterdance presents four pieces commissioned by Dance New Amsterdam, which date from 1997 (''Animal'') to 2006 (''Sweetwash Special''). It is an opportunity to see how much both the choreographer and Dance New Amsterday, which was formerly known as Dance Space and now has splendid new digs downtown, have grown. At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200 or www.dnadance.org; $20, or $15 for members. (Erika Kinetz)

* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 for this month and next, through July 30. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Sunday at 5 p.m.; Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)

(Through July 9.) Opening night, Wednesday, is a shared program; Battleworks performs alone on Thursday.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)

COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 24. A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Ken Johnson)

* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

* met: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710. (Kimmelman)

* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)

Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)

Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Johnson)

* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through January. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second in a trio of exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)

New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliotheque Litteraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)

NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)

Galleries: Uptown

* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)

* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through next Friday. (Johnson)

* Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naive immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)

EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too.

HEADLINE: India to Import Wheat After a 6-Year Hiatus

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, June 29 

 BODY:
In an effort to quell escalating prices and replenish its alarmingly low stockpiles, India is preparing to import wheat for the first time in six years. 
 The government has completed deals to buy 2.2 million tons of wheat from five international bidders including the world's largest grain trading company, Cargill, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., and the Archer Daniels Midland Company, with headquarters in Decatur, Ill.
Scientists, policy analysts and politicians say they view India's efforts to import a large quantity of grain, after a gap of six years, as the beginning of the end of food security in the country. 
 India had planned to buy three million tons of wheat. But this week, the government announced that it would not seek any further global offers.
 India had been a Green Revolution success story in the 1970's, when production of staple foods multiplied several times and the nation achieved self-sufficiency. 
 But in recent years, wheat production, about 70 million tons annually, has not been able to keep up with swelling consumption and population growth in a country where wheat and rice are the staple diet for 1.1 billion people.
 A combination of the shortfall and rapidly climbing prices has made it necessary to import wheat. Last week in New Delhi, the grain was priced at 850 rupees (about $18.50) per 100 kilograms, a rise of 100 rupees ($2.20), or nearly 12 percent, in the last three months. The price of atta, the wheat flour that is the primary ingredient in Indian breads, has climbed more than 30 percent this year.
 The situation worsened when the government allowed private traders to buy directly from farmers this year, leading to tight supplies for state-owned agencies acquiring stocks for the government's public distribution system. Since India's farmers produce only one wheat crop in the year, the government maintains a large cushion of grain to keep prices in check. 
 In the past, the government has adhered to a well-publicized goal of food security by ensuring that staple grain is available to the poor at an affordable price. The government's distribution system dispenses subsidized food to the poor through a nationwide network of ''ration shops.''
 The government tried in May to buy the grain through an international tender. That was not a success, as there were too few bidders and the government was able to secure only 0.8 million tons.
 The decision to bring in foreign grain has provoked a clamor of criticism. Devinder Sharma, a New Delhi-based farm policy analyst, said, ''The government is putting the ax on its own green revolution.''
 M. S. Swaminathan, a farm scientist who is acknowledged as the architect of country's green revolution, said, ''Such large-scale import of staple food grain is a wake-up call.'' Mr. Swaminathan, chairman of the National Commission on Farmers and co-chairman of the Hunger Task Force of the United Nations Millennium Project, said, ''All is not well in the heartland of the green revolution.''
 The heartland states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in northern India produce most of India's wheat. 
 The rise in wheat prices countrywide this year, reflects in part the government relaxation of some rules that allowed multinationals like Cargill and private domestic companies like ITC Limited to buy wheat directly from the farmers. The companies offered rates higher than the government's prices, leading to a deficit in the government's procurement. 
 The usual total annual procurement is 16 million tons, but the government was able to only buy 9.5 million tons from the farmers.
 Now, critics are pointing out that the government is paying far higher prices for wheat in the international market than it offered to the country's farmers. 
 Mr. Swaminathan in a telephone interview from Chennai said that critics fear that the government was offering farmers low prices, while allowing private traders to pile up stocks, and that its seeking bids globally to make up for its shortfall is being done in a way that may create artificial shortages.
 Some experts see a more worrying pattern. The government's gradual withdrawal of various production-related support structures for small farmers as part of a broad overhaul of the economy has worsened ''the problems of food insecurity, rural income inequality, and the alarming urban-rural gap that is ever widening for the last decade and a half,'' said Vamsi Vakulabharanam, a food security expert and an assistant professor of economics at Queens College of the City University of New York.
 After the first international solicitation of bids failed, the government considerably relaxed its stringent conditions. Quality specifications on toxins, pesticides and weed seeds were loosened, bringing in sellers like Cargill, which bid for 405,000 tons, and ADM, which offered to provide 300,000 tons. Others like Switzerland-based Glencore and the German company Toepfer also participated. The prices quoted were more than $196 a ton, including freight. The grain will arrive in the country beginning in September. 
 The wheat deals have become politically controversial. While the country has modernized on many fronts, with the services and manufacturing sectors accounting for 60 percent of economic output, about two-thirds of its 1.1 billion population still live off farming.
 ''In India, farming is not just about producing food, it is a livelihood,'' said Mr. Sharma, the analyst. Thousands of farmers have committed suicide in the last few years in India in response to low crop prices and heavy debts. 
 For many, the large-scale imports of wheat hark back to the days of the Great Bengal Famine, the world's worst recorded food disaster, which occurred in 1943, when the British ruled India. That year, an estimated four million Indians died of hunger. The country's successive governments became determined to ensure that the country be able to feed itself. 
 Food security through self-reliance is critical, said Usha Tuteja, an economist who directs an agricultural economics institute at Delhi University. Imports should be an emergency measure only since special problems arise when India buys staples like wheat. ''There are just a few growing countries with a surplus,'' Ms. Tuteja said.
 The agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, defended the imports as a necessity because total production did not meet the country's requirement. The decision to import was taken in the interest of the ''common man.''

HEADLINE: America the Contradictory

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
''I LIVED in the first century of world wars,'' wrote the American poet Muriel Rukeyser. You and I, of course, were born in that bellicose century too. So was the Whitney Museum of American Art, which celebrates a significant birthday this summer with ''Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,'' an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces from the permanent collection. 
 The work is mostly arranged by loose theme rather than date, an approach I like. It enlivens objects by setting them in unexpected, often energizing company. And it points up the basic arbitrariness of orthodox art history and critical opinion. An unfamiliar little piece off to the side is revealed to be every bit as interesting as a celebrated big piece in the center of the room.
 The important thing the show does, though, is deliver the story -- a story -- of American culture through art. It is a culture of staggering contradictions: idealism and amnesia, censure and unruled pleasure. It is diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make discord inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord. It is about how harmonious America never was. 
 American modernism was itself forged from antagonisms and turf wars. The version the Whitney initially championed was deeply provincial. The museum's founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, prided herself on supporting a native-grown avant-garde. It was personified for her in Robert Henri. But look at Henri's 1916 portrait of her; it's in the museum's lobby. Done three years after the revolution that was the Armory Show, it is a case study in terminal old-masteritis. 
 And then there's Edward Hopper. For the present occasion he is given the whole fifth floor (apart from the mezzanine level) for a survey that stretches from youthful drawings to his textbook paintings of buildings and rooms carved from slabs of light. For many people Hopper is the Whitney. To me he's a period illustrator with something extra. Like most effective graphic design, his pictures grab the eye, spark an emotion and get into your system, all in a flash. But too often the first look is the best look, and the first emotion -- with Hopper, a rush of generalized nostalgia, a soft-centered melancholy -- the only one. It's an experience; it's not nothing. I just wish it were more.
 The effect of the rest of ''Full House'' is, naturally, more: lively, varied, layered. Much is familiar, some not. Certain pieces have been in the collection for a while but have not been seen in a long time. Novelty comes from the mix. Most of the art dates from World War II onward. Some of it is about loss and time: Robert Bechtle's '' '61 Pontiac'' is Hopper without the melodrama. But there are many other elements in play: battles, farces, crimes, sex, jokes, accusations, meditations, breakdowns. Blood, time and money flow. 
 So does a kind of natural energy on the second floor. When the elevators open, we are in the oceanic realm of 1940's and 50's abstraction. To your right is Pollock's classic ''Number 27, 1950,'' a maelstrom of black, white and pink. Joan Mitchell's ''Hemlock'' hangs beside it: green leaves in a restless stream. Rothko's ''Four Darks in Red'' is a pool, hot, deep, absorbent; de Kooning's ''Door to the River,'' an aqueduct of sapphire and flesh.
 Some would say that American modernism ends here, at an Olympian peak. But not everything is so Olympian. De Kooning's ''Woman and Bicycle'' (1952-53), as much a period piece as anything by Hopper, is an aggressive sexual joke. At roughly the time it was painted, another American artist, Louise Bourgeois, was producing phallic sculptures shaped like clubs and needles. You can understand why.
 You'll find Ms. Bourgeois's work in a second gallery (along with fine pieces by Carroll Dunham, Paul McCarthy and Sue Williams, younger connoisseurs of subversive abjection). In the context of the 1940's and 50's she is the Resistance. But even her art yields no evidence of the reality of a world at war. 
 You only learn about that on the third floor, in Jacob Lawrence's 1947 ''War Series,'' a dozen small paintings recording combat service in World War II. But the paintings aren't about fighting, they're about surviving. There is no victory. As Lawrence paints it, war is a delirium, a nightmare you wake from exhausted. 
 The Whitney curatorial team -- Carter Foster, Barbara Haskell, Henriette Huldisch and Dana Miller, led by Donna De Salvo -- has given the third floor an umbrella title: ''The Pure Products of America Go Crazy.'' And from the opening images of Old Glory and cosmetic surgery (Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol, respectively) the ensemble does indeed feel more than a little unhinged. 
 Some of the dementia is just zaniness, crazy-lite. This would describe Man Ray's surrealist ''La Fortune,'' with its billiard table zooming like a flight deck off into space; and Laurie Simmons's photomontage of a walking camera; and a bunch of quirky short films by Jack Goldstein, who died in 2003. (He's one of several recently deceased artists in the show: Mark Lombardi, Agnes Martin and Nam June Paik are others.) 
 Yet certain of Goldstein's films are creepy: in one, a steel knife seems slowly to fill with blood like a syringe. Agitation is in the air. Wherever you turn in the gallery, appetites are addressed (have a Coke, have sex, have fun), and bodies are under assault. A billboard-size piece by Barbara Kruger has an image of a pin being pushed into a giant finger. In a sculpture by Robert Gober, a dead-white leg protrudes from the wall. 
 And there's war. It's ethnic in Ben Shahn's 1930's painting of thuggish officials standing over the dead Sacco and Vanzetti, and racial in Jean-Michel Basquiat's ''Hollywood Africans'' (1983), a painting with the word ''gangsterism'' written across its surface. And it's about gender and class in a ferocious painting by David Wojnarowicz, who died of AIDS in 1992.
 Writing in the 1960's, Rukeyser -- Jewish, feminist, bisexual -- caught the tone:
 I lived in the first century of world wars,
 Most mornings I would be more or less insane,
 The newspapers would arrive with their careless stories,
 The news would pour out of various devices
 Interrupted by attempts to sell products to the unseen.
 I would call my friends on other devices ;
 They would be more or less mad for similar reasons.
 The temperature drops on the fourth floor, where the focus is on Minimalism and its permutations. Donald Judd, Robert Morris and Tony Smith form the foundation here. They don't look terrific together. Minimalism was a big-foot art, bulky, competitive and territorial. 
 It was also, for all its insistent materialism, a house built on sand. 
 Smith's ''Die'' (1962), a giant cube of solid steel, brings to mind, as the artist himself said, a mausoleum, a cenotaph for an aesthetic that can attain no purer form than this. But in fact reductivism accommodates endless impure variations. It turns spiritual in Ad Reinhardt's ''black paintings,'' consumerist in Jeff Koons's vacuum cleaners, and organic and corporeal in David Hammons's 1992 sculpture of sprouting wands of human hair. 
 I would have put the Hammons piece right next to ''Die.'' Or even better, downstairs beside the Pollock, where it would instantly point to the pervasive, enriching presence of African-American culture in 20th century American art, jazz being but one of its many channels of influence. 
 Maybe the Whitney will tell that story in depth another time. American art is a mansion of many rooms. Ms. De Salvo and her colleagues have cracked the doors onto several of them. You can approach the show checklist-style: love X; hate Y; where's Z? Or you can take it as a working essay on what one selection, from one collection, in one institution, has to say about a culture. 
 Rukeyser would have gone for the essay. In 1949, at almost exactly mid-century, she said something about American poetry that is also about American art. It is ''part of a culture in conflict,'' she said. ''We are a people tending toward democracy on the level of hope; on another level, the economy of the nation, the empire of business within the republic, both include in their basic premise the concept of perpetual warfare. It is the history of the idea of war that is beneath our other histories.'' 
 But entwined with this history is another, ''the history of possibility,'' she continued. ''Not vaguer than the other principle, it leads to definite things, but since these are future things, they cannot be described under the present daylight.'' 
 Or maybe they can be described. Aren't Rukeyser's ''future things,'' with their cargo of histories, and promise of alternative histories for a new century, exactly what's filling the Whitney to the brim this summer? I like to think so. As the poet said, ''Indications are here.'' 

''Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75'' remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue (at 75th Street), through Sept. 3. (800) 944-8639.

HEADLINE: Stepping Off Plane, Man Is Arrested in '01 Queens Murder 

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Mick Meenan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Five years ago, the fatal beating of Edgar Garzon, a gay man, as he walked home from a bar in Jackson Heights sent tremors through the gay community in Queens. But the crime soon faded from public attention after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The police said they did not forget, and on Wednesday night they arrested John L. McGhee, 38, at Kennedy International Airport, as he stepped off a plane from London. Mr. McGhee, an ex-convict, was charged with murder, manslaughter and attempted robbery, the authorities said.
The police said that Mr. McGhee fled the United States for England soon after the beating of Mr. Garzon. It is unclear when Mr. McGhee became a suspect, but in the last year detectives in New York, acting on tips, tracked him to London and began cooperating with their British counterparts, law enforcement officials said. 
 When Mr. McGhee applied for citizenship there -- and lied on his application by not revealing his criminal history -- there was an opportunity to bring him home, the officials said. Authorities in London told Mr. McGhee to leave England or face prosecution there, the officials said.
 On Aug. 15, 2001, Mr. Garzon, 35, a restaurant owner, had been walking home from the Friends Tavern, a gay bar, when two men followed him in a red car, officials said. They said one of the men beat him with a blunt object and fractured his skull. Mr. Garzon went into a coma, then died on Sept. 4, 2001. 
 A law enforcement official said that elements of the beating, including the fact that Mr. Garzon made a comment to one of the men about wanting a date, according to a witness at the time, led to theories that it was a hate crime. 
 Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said yesterday that prosecutors were still investigating the murder as a ''possible hate crime.'' 
 Detectives from the 115th Precinct in Jackson Heights, led by Detective Daniel Corey, led the push to find Mr. Garzon's killer, officials said yesterday. Mr. Garzon's father, Armando Garzon, 72, praised the police yesterday, saying that they had ''persisted in solving the case that in the beginning lacked substantial evidence -- only a video snippet of a red car,'' he said.
 Details of Mr. McGhee's life in London were not available yesterday, except that he lived, at some point, in a house by a park in London and was unemployed at the time he left, according to officials. His history of arrests in the United States stretched back to 1987, though the details of those arrests, at least five in New York, were not immediately known.
 At some point before Mr. McGhee left for London, he bragged of the killing to a friend, officials said. 
 Mr. Garzon's father, who splits his time now between his native country, Colombia, and New York, said his son, a restaurateur, was a ''happy, carefree man who never had a single enemy.'' Speaking in Spanish, he spoke proudly of his son's accomplishments, and said that he and his family ''have focused on persisting.''
 ''The murder trial and its resolution will give me final peace of mind,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Panel Unanimously Recommends Cervical Cancer Vaccine for Girls 11 and Up 

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
A federal vaccine advisory panel voted unanimously yesterday to recommend that all girls and women ages 11 to 26 receive a new vaccine that prevents most cases of cervical cancer.
 The vote all but commits the federal government to spend as much as $2 billion alone on a program to buy the vaccine for the nation's poorest girls from 11 to 18.
The vaccine, Gardasil, protects against cancer and genital warts by preventing infection from four strains of the human papillomavirus, the most common sexually transmitted disease, according to federal health officials. The virus is also a cause of other cancers in women. 
 Gardasil is manufactured by Merck and should be available within days. Girls as young as 9 can receive the vaccine if doctors wish, the panel voted.
 But Gardasil's benefits could be blunted by a complex brew of practical, economic and religious considerations. On the practical side, Gardasil is supposed to be given as three shots over six months. While pediatricians and government health agencies have long been successful in having parents adhere to complex vaccination schedules for infants, older children are more difficult to manage.
 Another challenge is Gardasil's price. At $360 for the three-shot regimen, it is among the most expensive vaccines ever. Because cervical cancer is mostly a disease of poverty, those in most need of the vaccine will be the least able to afford it. State vaccination programs, already under financial strain, may refuse to provide it.
 ''This vaccine will be more expensive than all other childhood vaccines put together,'' said John Schiller, a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, whose discoveries underpinned Gardasil's development. ''How do you make sure it gets to the poor women who need it the most?''
 Because Gardasil prevents a sexually transmitted disease, some religious groups have sounded reservations about vaccinating young girls. 
 ''You can't catch the virus, you have to go out and get it with sexual behavior,'' said Linda Klepacki of Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian group based in Colorado Springs. ''We can prevent it by having the best public health method, and that's not having sex before marriage.''
 Ms. Klepacki's group opposes mandating Gardasil vaccinations. States and school districts have the power to decide whether to mandate vaccinations, but such decisions are usually not made until at least a year after a vaccine is introduced.
 In a news conference, the federal panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the immunization program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the panel's approval of Gardasil historic and ''a breakthrough for women's health.''
 Though the vaccine is costly, studies presented at the meeting showed that its widespread use would save more in health expenses than the cost of buying the vaccine. In the United States, 9,710 women contract cervical cancer each year, and 3,700 die. Millions of women have annual Pap smears to test for cervical cancer, and tens of thousands undergo further expensive testing and procedures after receiving false positive tests. 
 Such testing will continue in part because the vaccine's preventive effects are years away but also because Gardasil does not protect against viral strains that cause up to 30 percent of cervical cancers.
 Cervical cancer is far more deadly in the developing world. Worldwide, it affects 470,000 women and kills 233,000 each year. Merck and some international health groups have said they are committed to making Gardasil available in the developing world, but the World Health Organization is already struggling to provide a worldwide $3.50 vaccine against five major killer diseases.
 In the United States, health insurers will probably cover the cost of vaccinations, Dr. Schuchat said. Poor girls without insurance should be able to get the vaccine through Vaccines for Children, a federal program that distributes nearly half of all vaccines. 
 In fact, the panel's vote all but commits the federal government to buy vaccines for as many as seven million girls at a total price that could exceed $2 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services must confirm this decision, but such affirmations are routine.
 After the government initiates a ''catch-up'' campaign focusing on girls from 13 to 18, it will seek to vaccinate all 11- and 12-year-olds routinely. The vaccine is most effective if given before girls first have sex. 
 Girls who are not poor enough to qualify for the federal program but who do not have adequate private insurance may have difficulty obtaining Gardasil. Most states have programs to vaccinate those who fall between the health system's cracks, but budgets are already strained.
 Merck also hopes someday to receive approval to have boys vaccinated with Gardasil, which protects against two strains of virus that cause 90 percent of genital warts. 
 Although a few religious groups have expressed mild reservations about the vaccine, many conservative organizations support it.

HEADLINE: Error Disrupts Bond Trading In Japan 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 29 

 BODY:
A computer error crippled trading in Japan's government bond market for more than two hours on Thursday, just months after the Tokyo Stock Exchange suffered a run of similar flaws.
 Japan Bond Trading, a specialized brokerage firm that oversees trading in Japanese government bonds, said the error halted trading for two hours and 25 minutes on Thursday morning. Analysts estimate that Japan Bond Trading handles about 60 percent of all trading in Japan's treasury market, the world's largest.
The error raises new concerns about the ability of Japan to handle its role as Asia's largest and most sophisticated financial market. It also highlights, once again, the failure of Japanese financial companies and exchanges to make timely upgrades of many of their outdated and complex computer systems. 
 ''It's another of those embarrassing incidents that hurts Japan's image as having a modern capital market,'' said Neil Katkov, an analyst specializing in financial technology in the Tokyo office of Celent Communications, a Boston-based consulting company. ''It points to a weakness in market infrastructure.''
 The problems have come as trading volumes have surged with the recovery of Japan's economy from a decade-long slump.
 In December, the president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange resigned to take responsibility for computer failures that briefly shut the exchange in November and later caused a $350 million trading loss by the Mizuho Securities brokerage firm. After his resignation, the exchange's system crashed again for an entire day in January when an accounting scandal at Livedoor, an Internet portal, started an avalanche of sell orders.
 The exchange says it plans to have a new computer system in place by 2009. Its current system was custom-built by Fujitsu, the same company that also built Japan Bond Trading's computer system.
 The company said that the error this time was caused by an employee's mistyping the settings in one of the brokerage firm's servers. It said that the problem prevented the computer system from starting during the morning trading session. The company said that the setting was finally fixed and that normal trading resumed in the afternoon.
 The company said the problem was not related to higher trading volumes. Still, Mr. Katkov and other analysts say the persistence of computer errors threatens to scare away investors just as financial markets here are coming back to life.
 Trading volumes have soared in Japan's bond market, partly because of expectations the nation's central bank will raise interest rates for the first time in six years to prevent the economy from overheating. In May, trading in Japanese government debt reached 273.1 trillion yen ($2.38 trillion), up 42 percent from a year earlier, according to the Japan Securities Dealers Association. 
 Japan has the largest treasury market in the world, with $5.6 trillion worth of publicly held securities, compared with $4.3 trillion in Treasuries in the United States, according to United States and Japanese government statistics.
 In both the United States and Japan, bond markets do not have exchanges like stock markets. Japan Bond Trading was created by Japan's 92 largest brokerage firms and banks to work as a sort of surrogate market, giving treasury prices and handling buy and sell orders. The 40 percent of trading not handled by the company goes through similar systems at other brokerage firms or takes place directly between dealers, Mr. Katkov said.

HEADLINE: A Secret the Terrorists Already Knew

BYLINE: By Richard A. Clarke and Roger W. Cressey. 
Richard A. Clarke and Roger W. Cressey, counterterrorism officials on the National Security Council under , Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, are security consultants.

 BODY:
COUNTERTERRORISM has become a source of continuing domestic and international political controversy. Much of it, like the role of the Iraq war in inspiring new terrorists, deserves analysis and debate. Increasingly, however, many of the political issues surrounding counterterrorism are formulaic, knee-jerk, disingenuous and purely partisan. The current debate about United States monitoring of transfers over the Swift international financial system strikes us as a case of over-reaction by both the Bush administration and its critics.
 Going after terrorists' money is a necessary element of any counterterrorism program, as President Bill Clinton pointed out in presidential directives in 1995 and 1998. Individual terrorist attacks do not typically cost very much, but running terrorist cells, networks and organizations can be extremely expensive. 
 Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and other terrorist groups have had significant fund-raising operations involving solicitation of wealthy Muslims, distribution of narcotics and even sales of black market cigarettes in New York. As part of a ''follow the money'' strategy, monitoring international bank transfers is worthwhile (even if, given the immense number of transactions and the relatively few made by terrorists, it is not highly productive) because it makes operations more difficult for our enemies. It forces them to use more cumbersome means of moving money. 
 Privacy rights advocates, with whom we generally agree, have lumped this bank-monitoring program with the alleged National Security Agency wiretapping of calls in which at least one party is within the United States as examples of our government violating civil liberties in the name of counterterrorism. The two programs are actually very different.
 Any domestic electronic surveillance without a court order, no matter how useful, is clearly illegal. Monitoring international bank transfers, especially with the knowledge of the bank consortium that owns the network, is legal and unobjectionable. 
 The International Economic Emergency Powers Act, passed in 1977, provides the president with enormous authority over financial transactions by America's enemies. International initiatives against money laundering have been under way for a decade, and have been aimed not only at terrorists but also at drug cartels, corrupt foreign officials and a host of criminal organizations.
 These initiatives, combined with treaties and international agreements, should leave no one with any presumption of privacy when moving money electronically between countries. Indeed, since 2001, banks have been obliged to report even transactions entirely within the United States if there is reason to believe illegal activity is involved. Thus we find the privacy and illegality arguments wildly overblown.
 So, too, however, are the Bush administration's protests that the press revelations about the financial monitoring program may tip off the terrorists. Administration officials made the same kinds of complaints about news media accounts of electronic surveillance. They want the public to believe that it had not already occurred to every terrorist on the planet that his telephone was probably monitored and his international bank transfers subject to scrutiny. How gullible does the administration take the American citizenry to be? 
 Terrorists have for many years employed nontraditional communications and money transfers -- including the ancient Middle Eastern hawala system, involving couriers and a loosely linked network of money brokers -- precisely because they assume that international calls, e-mail and banking are monitored not only by the United States but by Britain, France, Israel, Russia and even many third-world countries. 
 While this was not news to terrorists, it may, it appears, have been news to some Americans, including some in Congress. But should the press really be called unpatriotic by the administration, and even threatened with prosecution by politicians, for disclosing things the terrorists already assumed? 
 In the end, all the administration denunciations do is give the press accounts an even higher profile. If administration officials were truly concerned that terrorists might learn something from these reports, they would be wise not to give them further attention by repeatedly fulminating about them.
 There is, of course, another possible explanation for all the outraged bloviating. It is an election year. Karl Rove has already said that if it were up to the Democrats, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi would still be alive. The attacks on the press are part of a political effort by administration officials to use terrorism to divide America, and to scare their supporters to the polls again this year. 
 The administration and its Congressional backers want to give the impression that they are fighting a courageous battle against those who would wittingly or unknowingly help the terrorists. And with four months left before Election Day, we can expect to hear many more outrageous claims about terrorism -- from partisans on both sides. By now, sadly, Americans have come to expect it.

HEADLINE: FED RAISES RATES, BUT SCALES BACK TALK OF INFLATION 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the 17th consecutive time on Thursday, but kicked off a powerful celebration in the stock market by lowering its alarms about inflation.
 As expected, the central bank raised its crucial lending rate another quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, and left itself room to raise it again before stopping. But for the first time since it began lifting rates two years ago, the Fed stopped short of signaling that further interest rate increases were all but certain.
In what traders described as a huge ''relief rally,'' the Dow Jones industrial average surged 217 points, or 2 percent, in its biggest one-day jump in three years. Other stock and bond market indicators also rose, as interest rates on long-term bonds edged down. The dollar fell against major currencies, with foreign investors reducing their calibrations for interest rates in the United States. [Page C1.]
 The turnaround on Wall Street was the latest example of heightened volatility in financial markets and heightened uncertainty about Fed policy under its rookie chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. 
 Investors are looking for signs that Mr. Bernanke, like the veteran Alan Greenspan who preceded him at the Fed, can manage a tricky transition, achieving a ''soft landing'' from a period of strong economic growth and rising inflation to an era when underlying inflation slows without throwing the economy into a tailspin.
 ''The central bank is caught in the middle,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics. The Fed is trying to maintain ''a cautious tiptoeing between a moderating economy and elevated core inflation.''
 The Fed has stumbled along the way, said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig, the research unit of the investment bank ITG, but Mr. Bernanke now appears to have regained his balance.
 ''This gets him back to Square 1,'' Mr. Barbera said. ''What it takes away is the notion that they're hellbent to squeeze the economy because of an obvious inflation problem. That's not a fair characterization of the economy, and it's not a sensible Fed response.''
 In late April, Mr. Bernanke rattled bond markets with statements that struck many as being too soft about a general rise in prices, excluding food and energy, known as ''core'' inflation. Over the last month, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials sent markets tumbling as they sought to signal tougher action.
 Describing recent price trends as ''unwelcome,'' ''unacceptable'' and ''a warning flag,'' Fed officials prompted some investors to speculate that the overnight interest rates the Fed uses as its guidepost might climb as high as 6 percent. 
 In its statement on Thursday, the Fed adopted a more nuanced view. It said that recent price trends had been ''elevated'' and that ''inflation pressures remain.'' But it also acknowledged that growth appeared to be slowing, which in turn should ease inflation.
 ''Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace,'' the Fed's policy-making committee said. It said the slowing growth stemmed from a ''gradual cooling'' of the housing market, the lagged effects of previous interest rate increases and higher energy prices.
 What galvanized investors was a change in the Fed's language suggesting that additional rate increases may no longer be needed. Instead, it spoke hypothetically about what it would do if increases were still necessary.
 ''The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation and economic growth,'' the central bank said. In May, by contrast, it flatly declared that ''some additional firming may be necessary.''
 Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues left themselves ample wiggle room to raise rates at their next policy meeting in August. But their tone was less urgent. Instead of warning that inflation posed a powerful threat, they suggested that the job of preventing inflation from accelerating may not be quite finished. 
 ''People were expecting something very consistent with the hawkish rhetoric we had heard earlier,'' said Richard Berner, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. The markets ''were pricing in a more hawkish statement.''
 Inflation has crept up in the last six months, in part because of the spike in energy prices but also because of increases in housing prices.
 The Fed's preferred measure of underlying price trends is core inflation, excluding the volatile prices for food and energy, as calculated in the government's estimates of the gross domestic product. By that measure, prices have climbed about 2.4 percent over the last 12 months.
 Mr. Bernanke, an advocate of setting explicit inflation targets, has said he would like to keep inflation at 1 to 2 percent a year. 
 At the same time, the economy seems to have slowed significantly from the torrid growth rate during the first three months of this year.
 On Thursday, the government released its final estimate of growth in the first quarter, elevating growth from an annual pace of 5.3 percent to 5.6 percent, far above the pace that most economists consider sustainable without rising inflation.
 But many forecasters contend that growth has slowed to something closer to 3 percent in the second quarter and will remain near that level for the rest of the year. 
 Job creation has slowed sharply in the last three months, to an average of about 125,000 jobs a month from an average of over 160,000 during 2005, and sank to only 75,000 additional jobs in May.
 Though housing starts have bumped up and down in recent months, inventories of unsold homes have swelled and sales prices are climbing far more slowly. Construction employment fell sharply last month, and there are signs that consumer spending has slowed as a result of high gasoline prices and fewer cash-out home refinancings.
 By some measures, short-term interest rates are back in line with historical norms after being cut to extraordinary lows from 2001 to 2004. At 5.25 percent, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks is almost 3 percentage points above the central bank's preferred measure of core inflation. Two years ago, it was only 1 percent and below the core inflation rate.
 Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, said the fed funds rate has on average been about 2.33 percentage points higher than core inflation since 1987. 
 But Fed officials face multiple quandaries. On the one hand, inflation is still slightly above Mr. Bernanke's ''comfort zone'' and many Fed officials are convinced that it would be far more difficult to combat higher inflation expectations than it would be to correct a slowdown if they push interest rates too high.
 But some analysts predict that the combination of higher energy prices and higher interest rates has already set the stage for a slowdown that could be deeper than the soft landing that policy makers are seeking.
 David Rosenberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, recently estimated that the chances of a recession later this year were about 40 percent. Most analysts are far more sanguine, though many predict that the growth will slow and unemployment will edge up from its currently low level of 4.7 percent. 
 In a sign that Fed policy is beginning to pinch, the National Association of Manufacturers pleaded for the central bank to stop raising rates.
 ''Evidence of a slowing economy is widespread,'' said David Huether, the trade association's chief economist. ''With manufacturing already facing higher costs at home compared to our major competitors abroad, today's news of higher interest rates will only further burden U.S. industry.'' 
 The uncertainties mean that the opportunities for a mistake on policy are higher than they have been for several years. 
 ''Last year a monkey could have run monetary policy,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. ''What did you have to do? You just had to push the 25 basis points button. Now, just in time for Bernanke to take over, the serious decisions have to be made. How much do you put the brakes on?''
