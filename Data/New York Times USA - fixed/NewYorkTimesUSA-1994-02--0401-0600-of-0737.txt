HEADLINE: U.S. TAKING ACTION AGAINST JAPANESE IN ONE TRADE CASE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration decided today to initiate sanctions against Japan for failing to live up to promises to allow Motorola Inc. to penetrate the lucrative Tokyo cellular phone market.
The decision on Motorola, which officials said would be announced on Tuesday, had been in the works for months, with a deadline that happened to fall on Feb. 15. It involves a 1989 trade agreement between the United States and Japan and was not part of the eight-month-long broad-based talks intended to open Japan's markets for autos, telecommunications, insurance and medical equipment. Those talks collapsed on Friday, after a meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to resolve differences.
 
 
A White House Warning
 President Clinton warned today that he would soon decide on other measures intended to force Japan to open markets. 
 Asked if he was afraid that American sanctions on Japan in the Motorola case might set off a trade war, Mr. Clinton did not rule out the possibility. But he warned Tokyo that with its weighty dependence on the American export market it would have a lot to lose from such a tit-for-tat.
Speaking of the prospect of the United States' and Japan's slapping one another with punitive tariffs, Mr. Clinton told reporters at the White House: "It could be. But I think they would have to think long and hard about it."
The mounting trade tensions have been pushing the dollar lower against the yen for some time, and the decline accelerated today with the dollar plunging 4.7 percent, to a six-month low. [Page D1.]
 
Interesting Timing
 Administration officials said that even if the broad-based talks had succeeded, Washington probably would have decided anyway to retaliate now against Japan for its failure to live up to the 1989 agreement to give Motorola equal access to the lucrative Tokyo cellular market.
But in view of the failure of the trade talks, Administration officials welcomed with relish the chance to use the Motorola decision to send a rapid-fire signal to Japan that if Washington could not open Japanese markets through negotiations, it would find other means.
In the Motorola case, the Administration is likely to impose punitive tariffs on Japanese phone makers that sell in the United States, until Motorola is given equal access to the Japanese market.
President Clinton told reporters of the Motorola dispute: "While it's coincidental, it is a problem which is illustrative of our general problem. There's no question that Motorola provides a world-class product fully competitive in quality and price on that."
While the Administration continued to review what additional steps it might take against Japan, Mr. Clinton said: "I'm going to make a decision within a few days. We need to clarify what America's approach is going to be. There are a number of options open to us, including some that have not been widely discussed that may offer great promise."
In the meantime, the Administration's strategy appeared to be to try to raise as much anxiety, and uncertainty, in Tokyo as possible -- in hopes of driving up the value of the yen and driving down the Tokyo stock market. Administration officials apparently hope that uncertainty about what Washington will do might create pressure from the Japanese business community that will force the Government to make concessions, and obviate the need for further American sanctions.
A stronger yen tends to make Japanese exports to the United States more expensive while making American exports to Japan cheaper -- a quick way to ease the trade imbalance.
Administration officials denied that they were deliberately trying to talk up the value of the yen. But, then, they do not have to. Just the uncertainty of the moment is enough to spur speculators to act.
President Clinton added fuel to that mood of uncertainty today by refusing to rule out a broad array of sanctions on Japan. "I'm not ruling anything out," he told a news conference.
Mr. Clinton stressed that Japan's reluctance to set numerical standards for determining whether Japan was really opening its markets was "an unsustainable policy."
The speculation about a possible trade war, in which two countries pile ever-higher tariffs on one another's goods, arose after Japan and the United States reached an impasse last week over the Administration's demands for new approaches to opening Japanese markets. Such conflicts tend both to drive down the level of trade and increase consumer prices.
The Motorola situation has its roots in the 1988 Trade Act. That act requires the United States trade representative to review by March 31 of each year the effectiveness of all trade agreements regarding telecommunications products and services, to make sure countries are in compliance with the terms.
 
Quarrel Over Access
 In early January, the trade representative's office advised Tokyo that it would move up to Feb. 15 its annual review of the 1989 agreement betweeen Japan and the United States on cellular phones. It was moved up in hopes that the meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa might be able to resolve a dispute over the 1989 agreement, which stipulated that there should be the same access for North American cellular equipment in the Tokyo-Nagoya market as there was for Japanese companies.
The 1989 agreement grew out of American complaints that Motorola was being frozen out of the Japanese market to give Japanese companies a chance to catch up with Motorola's leading-edge cellular technology.
The dispute over the 1989 agreement arose because the Japanese set up a competition between two consortiums for the huge Tokyo-Nagoya market, where 60 percent of Japan's population resides. One consortium was led by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, or N.T.T., and included the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, known as IDO, a Japanese cellular phone provider.
The other consortium was led by IDO, and Motorola was assigned to this consortium by the Japanese Government, even though Motorola did not see a need for a partner and was competing effectively elsewhere in Japan. In other words, the leader of Motorola's consortium was also a prinicipal player in the competing all-Japanese consortium.
Not surprisingly, IDO sided with its partner N.T.T. by favoring its transmission technology over Motorola's. This was in part because N.T.T.'s system was compatible throughout Japan, while, American officials say, Motorola's had been prevented by the Japanese Government from having such broad access. As a result, the number of Tokyo residents who have signed up for cellular phones supplied by the N.T.T.-compatible system is 318,000 and the number for the Motorola-compatible system is 12,000.
 
Working on a Product
 In the meantime, as N.T.T. was seizing market share and customer loyalty, it was also able to develop a line of cellular phones that experts say has a strong resemblance to the market leader -- Motorola's Micro-Tac lightweight fold-up design.
The United States trade representative's office reviewed the situation and decided Japan was in noncompliance with the 1989 accord. Now that the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting failed to produce a breakthrough, the trade office has decided to act.
Once the trade office declares Japan in noncompliance, the office has 30 days to publish a list of Japanese products that might be subject to retaliatory sanctions. That list would probably include Japanese cellular phone products sold in the United States. Those Japanese manufacturers, and their American customers, have the right to a hearing to argue against sanctions, but if the trade office is not convinced, it can then impose sanctions.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance Despite Trade Tensions

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The winter skies cleared over Wall Street yesterday as the stock market rose despite the darkening trade relations between the United States and Japan.
The tensions between the two nations pushed the dollar down by nearly 5 percent against the yen, with much of the selling coming in the afternoon. Stock prices also stumbled briefly, But most of the major market indicators recovered in heavy trading. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 3,904.06, up 9.28 points.
Some stock traders may have interpreted the selloff in the currency markets as beneficial to stocks, at least in the short run. The cheaper dollar is expected to help American exports. But the surge in the Japanese yen could also hurt Japan's ability to rebound from the recession.
 
 
'A Bad Thing'
 "For the U.S. economy, people are going to erroneously see this selloff as a piece of good news" because it lowers the price of American exports, said David F. DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "I'm not a diplomat, I'm just a trader. But this is a bad thing because it's in our interest to see Japan come out of this terrible recession."
Stock traders are likely to focus on the turbulent currency markets today, even though much of the economic news this week is expected to be good. The Government is to report on January's industrial production today and January's Consumer Price Index on Thursday.
Investors continue to be skittish because of the rise in short-term interest rates. "The market is looking for an excuse to trade down," said Gregory A. Nie, vice president of technical research at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. "It's looking to get disappointed."
Meanwhile, some traders are looking for the yen to possibly reach a historic level of fewer than 100 to the dollar if the Japanese central bank does not intervene to support the American currency.
 
 
Dow's Retreat
 Yesterday's sharp selloff in the dollar culminated around 2:15 P.M. in a sharp drop in the bond market, possibly because of fear of renewed American inflation if Japanese-made goods rise in price. That in turn cascaded into a 15-point retreat in the Dow industrials within 15 minutes.
Currency traders were astonished to see the Clinton Administration follow up the bitter breakup of the trade talks on Friday with the threat of sanctions. Traders interpreted the threats as a deliberate attempt to bring the yen-to-dollar ratio to 100.
Still, the stock market recovered somewhat from the afternoon shakeout. Along with the Dow, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed with a slight gain for day, up 0.05 of a point, to 470.23. The Nasdaq composite index also closed up, rising 4.06 points, to 785.45.
But the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 0.05 point, to 261.26. The American Stock Exchange composite index closed down 2.32 points at 474.91.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 263.2 million shares, up from 213.7 million shares on Friday, when a severe snowstorm in New York City forced stock trading to end 90 minutes early.
Paramount Communications was the most actively traded stock yesterday, closing down 3/4 at 76 1/8 on volume of 4.7 million shares. Traders and analysts widely expected Viacom to win the long battle for Paramount after QVC Network reiterated yesterday that it would not sweeten its bid for Paramount.
Spectrum Information Technologies, the troubled company shaken by management disputes following the sudden resignation of its chief executive, John Sculley, was the second-most-active stock at 4.7 million shares. It closed up 1/16 at 37/16 .
 
 
Rockefeller Center
 A notable decliner yesterday was Rockefeller Center Properties, which fell 1 3/8, to 6 3/8, on volume of 1.93 million shares. An article in Barron's questioned whether Rockefeller Center was recovering enough from its rent to cover its interest payments.
Investors bid up the shares of economically sensitive stocks yesterday. Led by United Technologies, which rose 2, to 67 3/8, such companies as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Philip Morris, Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, I.B.M. and General Motors contributed the most to the 9.28-point rise in the Dow average.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with longer maturities lower on concerns that economic data due this week would be strong enough to signal another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
The breakdown of trade talks between Japan and the United States also worried the market, analysts said. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 1/2, to 9715/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.44 percent, from 6.40 percent on Friday, when many markets closed early as a result of the snowstorm that hit the Northeast.
The intermediate maturities were unchanged to slightly higher, and short-term maturities were mixed.
Matthew Alexy, a goverment trading strategist at CS First Boston, believes the market's task on the economic reports this week will would be to sort through weather-related distortions while waiting for data on inflation.
With the last increase in short-term interest rates still fresh on investors' minds, traders are waiting to see if this week's reports will give the Fed grounds to tighten credit again. The central bank has already made it very clear that it will take a tough stand against inflation and economists believe that the Fed would rather have a weak economy than to have rising inflation from a strong one.
This week's economic reports begin with January industrial production today, followed by January housing data tomorrow and the January Consumer Price Index on Thursday. The index, considered the most important report of the week, is expected to be up three-tenths of a percent, according to economists surveyed by the Reuters news service , compared with two-tenths of apercent in in December.
Some traders say the data should cause the 30-year bond to trade in a range between 6.25 and 6.50 percent, with the range holding at least until the February economic data starts to come in, they said.
The market is also concerned that the Fed's last interest rate increase may have been one sign in a series, traders said. '
'I think we have reached some turning point with the psychology of professional traders turning negative," said Mark J. Grant, managing director for fixed income at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "Any statement by the Fed on the short will be felt by the long end as well."
Bad inflation numbers could force another move by the Fed in February or early March, he said. But he does not see an exodus from the fixed-income market. "About 70 percent of fixed-income money remains some place in the debt market without any great dislocation," he said.
Mr. Grant said the market lacked any follow-through trading on concerns that a trade war might develop between the United States . and Japan after trade talks collapsed on Friday.
The Japanese stock market, which closes hours before the United States market opens, was down sharply in what was seen as disappointment over the failure of the talks. "This may have set the tone for our own market at the opening bell," Mr. Grant said.
Analysts at C. J. Lawrence said some people in the market believed that the dollar's drop against the yen could cause Japanese investors to sell dollar-denominated holdings, much of which are in Treasury securities.
 
Release of Economic Report
 The only economic report released yesterday was the December business inventories report, which had little impact on bond prices. Besides being old data, the number was unchanged from the six-tenths of 1 percent rise in November, and pretty much what the bond market expected.
Elsewhere, yesterday's weekly auction of new Treasury three- and six-month bills was regarded by some as another solid auction, while others viewed it a little sloppy that left dealers holding a sizable chunk of the auction issue.
The average rates at auction rose a few basis points from the previous week, with the three-month bill up to 3.28 percent from 3.24 percent. The rate on the six-month bill rose to 3.43 percent from 3.40 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	 	 		3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	99.171	98.266	Discounted Rate	3.28%	3.43%	Coupon Yield	3.35%	3.54%	High Price	99.176	98.271	Discounted Rate	3.26%	3.42%	Coupon Yield	3.33%	3.53%	Low Price	99.171	98.226	Discounted Rate	3.28%	3.43%	Coupon Yield	3.35%	3.54%	Accepted at low price	20%	23%	Total applied for	$58,559,455	$54,681,946	Accepted	$12,213,977	$12,276,380	Noncompetitive	$1,269,679	$955,768

Employer Health Costs Still Rise

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The growth in medical spending by employers is easing, but their costs are still rising much faster than the 3 percent general inflation rate, according to a national survey released yesterday.
The survey showed that the average cost of care was $3,781 an employee last year, an increase of 8 percent, compared with 10.1 percent in 1992 and ending a five-year string of dougle-digit growth. 
 Corporate benefits managers said that in spite of efforts to control costs, health care continued to be a big problem for them and their employees.
 
 
Costs 'Out of Line'
 "We still have a crisis," said Margaret Jordan, a vice president for health care and employee services at Southern California Edison, a unit of SCEcorp. "Costs that are almost three times the rate of inflation are out of line."
Employers and politicians are closely watching the cost trends as Congress weighs proposals for sweeping changes in the health care system.
David Rahill, a principal at Foster Higgins, the benefits consulting firm that conducted the survey, suggested that some Clinton Administration cost estimates were unrealistically low. He said an employer's average insurance premium for a single employee would be $2,175 in 1994, nearly 13 percent higher than the Administration's projection of $1,932.
But Walter Zelman, a senior health care adviser in the Administration, said premiums were high "because millions of uninsured people are being paid for by those who are insured." In the new system, he said, "more people will be insured and the cost of each policy will come down."
 
 
Rise for Open-Ended Plans
 A growing number of employers have shifted to lower-cost health maintenance organizations and managed-health-care plans, which include networks of doctors and hospitals that offer discounted fees. The steepest price increases were in the increasingly popular open-ended H.M.O.'s, which permit members to select an outside doctor if the patient pays more of the costs.
The survey of 2,395 employers was conducted by Foster Higgins with help from the Research Triangle Institute, a nonprofit research organization in North Carolina.
Mr. Rahill attributed the slower growth in employer spending last year to rising competition among managed-care plans and a movement by doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to delay price increases temporarily "in the hopes of heading off Draconian health care reform measures in Washington."
 
Varying Rates of Increase
 Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University health care economist, said medical inflation typically abates when the subject is being debated in Congress, only to "explode whenever a medical cost law is written and the lawyers and accountants teach everyone how to get around it."
The cost per employee of traditional health plans, which give employees complete freedom to choose a doctor, rose 7.1 percent, to $3,500. The discount networks, called preferred-provider organizations, were up 5.5 percent, to $3,317, and costs for H.M.O.'s without the open-ended feature rose 6.5 percent, to $3,276.
Open-ended health maintenance organizations were the least expensive, at $3,266 an employee, but their cost increases averaged 8.9 percent.
Health care costs in the Northeast were highest, at $4,267 a worker, up 10.1 percent, the survey said, compared with $3,262 in the South, the least expensive region. The increase in the South was only 6.6 percent.
Donna Lynne, executive director of the New York Business Group on Health, a group of employers, said the greater prevalence of open-ended H.M.O.'s in the Northeast might account for the big jump in costs for that region.

HEADLINE: Fight Looms on Tax Cuts in New Jersey

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
New Jersey residents are virtually certain to get some level of state tax relief this year. But a struggle over the form and size of any tax cut is just beginning.
In the month since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, took office with a pledge to deliver the largest tax cut in state history, even the Democrats have weighed in with tax-cutting plans of their own. 
 With Republicans controlling the State House and the Legislature, whatever tax-cut plan emerges will bear their stamp. But a number of Republican legislators have questioned, as have the Democrats, whether the Whitman plan goes far enough to help the middle-class taxpayer.
Some Republicans have also openly hinted that with former Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, removed as a political foil, they might be more willing to listen to Democrats' ideas than they were during the last two budget debates.
 
Other Plans Follow Whitman's
 In her inaugural address on Jan. 18, Mrs. Whitman surprised the audience and many legislators with a call for tax cuts retroactive to Jan. 1. They would reduce the state income tax by 5 percent for all taxpayers, eliminate income taxes entirely for people making $7,500 (the cutoff now is $3,000) and cut the state's corporate tax rate to 9 percent, from 9.375 percent. She said it was the first step toward keeping a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1.5 billion, including the state income tax by 30 percent for some taxpayers, in her first three years in office.
Since then, four tax-cut plans have emerged in as many weeks -- two unified and nearly identical Republican bills that would give the weight of law to Mrs. Whitman's ideas, and two separate and widely differing bills sponsored by two high-ranking members of the Democratic minority who say their ideas are more equitable to the middle class.
"It should be encouraging for Whitman that she now has many of the people in her camp who were arguing that she couldn't or shouldn't cut taxes," said Dr. Milton Leontiades, dean of the Rutgers University School of Business at Camden. "The argument now is over details."
There is a wealth of politicking behind each party's tax-cut plans.
 
G.O.P. Has to Follow Through
 Republicans took control of the Legislature two years ago by campaigning against Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, and Mrs. Whitman was able to unseat Mr. Florio last November largely on the basis of her late campaign promise to cut taxes.
With their political fortunes on the line, the Republicans, especially Mrs. Whitman, are compelled to follow through on some kind of cut, even in the face of daunting fiscal problems, including a potential $2 billion gap in the next state budget.
"It's relatively easy when you are running for office to say you are going to cut taxes," said Dr. Leontiades, the Rutgers business school dean. "The devil's in the details, and that's what Mrs. Whitman is up against now.
"The first retroactive pay cut of 5 percent is going to be the easy one because there is money left over from the Florio administration to pay for it," he said. "The next one is the 10 percent income-tax cut and she doesn't have the money set aside, and that is going to cause a little more head-scratching. And the third cut is really going to run into problems."
Politically, the Democrats -- who backed Mr. Florio four years ago in the largest tax increase in New Jersey's history -- hope to use taxes in the same way the Republicans did against them.
Even if the Democrats' tax-cut plans do not reach the floor for a vote, they will still gain political capital by publicizing the disparity of benefits in the Republican plans between middle-class taxpayers and wealthier ones. If the Republicans are pressured into adopting some of the Democrats' ideas, it will give the minority party clout far beyond its numbers.
Asked during a news conference last week about Democratic tax-cut plans, the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, initially responded that they were "dead on arrival," but immediately backed off and said they would be considered.
Mrs. Whitman has asked the Legislature to have her initial tax-cut plan in place by March 15, the date of her budget address. The new budget must be completed by July 1, the start of the state's fiscal year.
Prodded by Mr. Haytaian, the Assembly moved within a week of the inauguration to back the Republican Governor and introduced a three-bill package that would achieve Mrs. Whitman's first year tax-cut goals.
Senate Republicans introduced an identical package on Feb. 1, but went one step further than the Governor and the Assembly by committing $285 million in surplus money to pay for the proposed cuts.
Last Tuesday, the Assistant Senate Democratic Minority Leader, Richard J. Codey, introduced tax-cut legislation that he said would shift the financial benefits away from the wealthy and toward lower- and middle-income taxpayers.
Two days later, Mr. Codey's Democratic counterpart in the Assembly, Wayne R. Bryant, offered a fourth tax-cut plan in which middle- and lower-income taxpayers would benefit through increased deductions instead of lowered tax rates.
Each of the plans has been advertised as a middle-class tax cut.
But previous legislative attempts to fashion tax cuts to benefit middle- and lower-income taxpayers have been more about politics than windfall benefits for those economic blocs. In part, that is because of the state's graduated tax structure.
For example, each plan would eliminate income tax entirely for people making $7,500 or less, producing an average tax saving of $66 a year for them. But it also would mean that the first $7,500 of everyone's pay would be exempt from state income taxes, regardless of income. The same standard would apply throughout the ranges of tax liability.
 
Whitman Cuts Favor Richest
 According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, that would mean that under Mrs. Whitman's plan, the nearly 1.5 million families in the income range of $7,501 to $40,000 -- the largest single bloc among the nearly 3.2 million resident tax filers in New Jersey -- would save, on average, $24 a year. Resident filers making $150,001 to $300,000 -- there are 63,347 of them -- would average $517 in tax savings.
The centerpiece of Mr. Codey's plan is a proposal to cap Mrs. Whitman's 5 percent tax cut at $100,000 in income for married couples and at $50,000 for single taxpayers. He would then give bigger tax breaks to those with less income -- 6 percent cuts to those making $50,001 to $80,000; 7 percent for income levels of $20,000 to $50,000; and 9 percent to those making below $20,000.
Under Mr. Codey's plan, those in the $7,501 to $40,000 income range would save $40 a year on average ($16 more than under the Whitman plan), and those with $150,001 to $300,000 would save $216 (more than $300 less than in Mrs. Whitman's plan.)
Mr. Bryant has gone far afield of the other plans by abandoning all tax-rate reduction strategies except for the idea of exempting those taxpayers making $7,500 or less. Instead, under Mr. Bryant's plan, deductions for a married couple making under $150,000 would double to $2,000 and the dependent deduction for each child would double to $3,000.
He also would allow a deduction up to $100 for income interest and dividends, in a bid to give middle-class families an incentive to save.

Diagnosis for a Dismal Emergency Room: Incurable

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
HBO Showcase drifts into commercial-television territory with "State of Emergency," the kind of hospital story that has been a staple of prime time ever since we all loved Lucy. There is a difference. Not in thrall to advertisers, HBO can be grittier and tougher. Starring Joe Mantegna, a leading member of David Mamet's personal repertory company, as a bitterly overworked and underappreciated physician in a Los Angeles public hospital, "State of Emergency" refuses to play television's typical uplift game. It can next be seen on HBO tonight at 8.
Dr. John Novelli (Mr. Mantegna) is already juggling 20 patients when a Mr. Anderson (Paul Dooley) is wheeled into the overcrowded emergency room, the victim of a car accident. Suffering from head injuries, Anderson desperately needs a CAT scan, but the hospital's apparatus is not working. That's not unusual, but this case is different. Neither poor nor desperate, Anderson is a middle-class executive with a wife (Melinda Dillon) not about to tolerate what she deems to be neglect and incompetence. 
 When bad gets worse, Dr. Novelli, who insists that "it's not my fault that trickle-down economics never got around to trickling down," finds himself trapped in the hospital's ambitious and -- as the film implies -- immoral plan to close its public clinics and evolve into a high-tech facility. In theory, everybody should have a place to go when they're sick. In practice, this is just, as someone says, "another crummy public hospital" costing the taxpayers money. "State of Emergency" should be required viewing for all lawmakers considering new health policies.
The film can get preachy. "It's a war zone down there," we're told. "Too many people and not enough resources." And some of its statistics sound strained. Supposedly, one in three Americans will wind up in an emergency room this year. That's hard to believe. Some, obviously, will be more frequent visitors than others.
But this HBO presentation vividly illustrates that the average hospital emergency room is, as Dr. Novelli puts it, "your basic apocalypse." It's hardly surprising to learn that Lance Gentile, who is listed as co-writer with Susan Black, is himself an emergency-room doctor. His harrowing portrait is brought powerfully to life by Mr. Mantegna and company.

HEADLINE: A Piece of Fiscal Folly

 BODY:
Two Senate hearings are scheduled today on one pesky proposal -- a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. This idea is fiscal sleight-of-hand at its most devious, a solemn pledge by the current crowd that some future Congress will finally balance the budget.
The amendment stipulates that the budget must be balanced two years after ratification -- or in 2001, whichever is later -- and forever after, except in wartime or unless three-fifths of both the Senate and the House approve a deficit. 
 The amendment's rigidity is folly. Fiscal policy must be flexible; the amendment is not. The sponsors say it doesn't rule out deficits in recession years -- if a three-fifths majority in Congress approves. But that means a two-fifths minority could call the shots, refusing to go along with a deficit unless the budget met minority members' demands. In effect, this would raise the rationale of the Senate's hoary filibuster rules to the level of national fiscal policy.
Proponents also argue that state governments live with balanced-budget requirements; why not the Federal Government, too? States typically balance revenues and operating expenses, but borrow for capital expenses. The Federal budget does not separate the two. States also concoct all sorts of gimmickry to make unbalanced accounts appear to be balanced. The amendment would invite the same kinds of trickery in Washington, starting with spurious estimates of anticipated spending and revenues.
Finally, if a deficit developed without prior approval, how would the amendment be enforced? Courts are not equipped to make fiscal policy, and Federal judges are not elected; they are Presidential appointees, for life. If indeed there were a "violation," they would be asked for political decisions: What did Congress mean by a "receipt"? An "outlay"? The effect would cripple the constitutional separation of powers.
The amendment's chief sponsor is Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, with hearings at 8:30 A.M. today. The 54 co-sponsors are liberals, conservatives and in between. If the full Senate approves their simplistic scheme, by the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution, it is expected the House would, too. It would then have to be ratified by 38 states.
The President is against it. So are George Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington. So is Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, whose hearings start 90 minutes after Senator Simon's.
According to the Constitution that Senator Simon wants to amend, Federal spending and revenues are the business of the President and Congress. Cluttering the document with mischievous language will not get them off the hook.

HEADLINE: Misperceptions Permeate and Poison Our Relations With China

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Chinese Economy Threatens to Pull Ours Down" (letter Feb. 3), C. K. Chen attributes the growing United States trade deficit with China to China's failure to reform its internal markets more rapidly. In doing so, he repeats an error that permeates and poisons our relations with China: that is, treating China as different, distinct, unique. 
 Any economist will verify that our $23 billion trade deficit with China has at least two other, more important causes:
(1) It reflects simply a spreading around of our traditional imbalance with Japan and Taiwan, a deficit in excess of $100 billion, which is now shifting to China as the manufacturing facilities of those countries move to the mainland. Why blame China?
(2) Our "East Asian" trade deficit is in effect forced upon these countries by our own Government, which enters the bond market every year to borrow the roughly $200 billion needed to finance our budget deficit. When United States savers prove insufficiently abstemious to come up with such sums at home, where else can we look but to our Asian neighbors (who love to save)? Why blame Asia?
But how much easier, always, to place blame elsewhere. And so we hear the drumbeat begin, calling together an improbable triad of anti-Communists, human rights activists and domestic protectionists, who hope to force tariffs on China's exports up to Smoot-Hawley levels. I agree that we must engage with China on all these issues.
However, using most-favored-nation status to induce change in China is about as finely calibrated as a car bomb. Push the button, and the impact, on us and on China, will be disastrous.

HEADLINE: What Is 'Universal' Is Center Of Fight Over a Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Universal insurance coverage has become the touchstone of the debate over health care. President Clinton threatens to veto legislation "that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away."
But what precisely does universal coverage mean? How would it be administered? Would everyone voluntarily enroll in a health plan? Would the Government force people to buy insurance? 
 By exalting universal coverage as the paramount goal of a health plan, the President has made the definition of the term a central part of the political fight developing on Capitol Hill.
 
Every Legal Resident Protected
 Mr. Clinton's plan calls for every legal resident of the United States to have protection against health care costs at all times. Employers would bear most of the costs for their workers by paying health insurance premiums, but workers and other consumers would be expected to contribute. The Government would raise new revenue by increasing tobacco taxes and would subsidize coverage for low-wage workers and the unemployed.
Other proposals before Congress are also intended to provide universal coverage.
Nearly 39 million Americans, representing 15.4 percent of the population, lack health insurance on any given day, acccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization whose members include businesses and labor unions. Over the course of a year, as many as 53 million people may be without insurance for a month or more, the institute says.
There are many reasons universal coverage may not equal 100 percent. Finding everyone to be covered is one problem. The Census Bureau tries to count everyone in the country, but by its own estimate it missed at least 1.6 percent of the population in 1990, with larger undercounts in earlier censuses.
Getting people to pay the insurance premiums is another potential problem. While nearly everyone is eligible for Social Security, many domestic workers are not covered because their employers did not withhold Social Security taxes from their pay as required by law.
And strange as it may seem, the people who run social programs have found they must make aggressive efforts to induce people to sign up for benefits to which they are entitled, like food stamps and Medicaid. Millions of poor people, homeless people and immigrants do not avail themselves of care for which they are now eligible at community health centers.
 
Access to Insurance
 Administration officials say the requirement for universal coverage distinguishes Mr. Clinton's plan from others that seek merely to increase access to health care. Yet Mr. Clinton's plan and most of the other health care proposals pending in Congress fall short of universal coverage in one sense: They generally do not cover illegal aliens, of which the Census Bureau estimates that there are four million.
Mr. Clinton would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of health insurance premiums for their workers. Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, has introduced a bill that would make insurance easily available to most people. But that bill, which has bipartisan support, would not require consumers to buy insurance or employers to pay for it and so would not guarantee universal coverage.
Mr. Cooper's bill would create large pools of consumers to buy insurance voluntarily, and he estimates that 80 percent of the uninsured would obtain coverage by this means within a few years. Under his bill, a Federal agency would study the remaining uninsured population and advise Congress how to achieve fuller coverage.
Thus, Mr. Cooper says, "our plan can achieve universal coverage on the same timetable as the President, by 1998, without an employer mandate." White House officials and Congressional supporters of the Clinton bill dispute that.
Nothing in the bill would prevent people from delaying the purchase of insurance until they needed care. But there would be a penalty for those who did: coverage of their existing medical problems could be denied for six months. Such people might then have to spend more of their own money on treatment.
 
Waiting for an Emergency
 Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of Social Security, says: "Universal coverage means that every legal resident of the United States would have protection against health care costs at all times, as in Canada or Britain. That is feasible. There is no reason why anybody should be left out at any time."
But Robert J. Myers, who served as chief actuary of the Social Security Administration from 1947 to 1970, predicted that some people would remain uninsured and "wait till a medical emergency occurs, then go to a hospital and get free care."
Anticipating this, the Clinton plan would establish procedures to enroll people at the precise moment they seek health care. As a penalty for their failure to obtain insurance earlier, the plan would have these people pay twice the amount of all the premiums they would have paid if they had enrolled when they were supposed to.
Hawaii has made a commitment to see that all of its 1.2 million residents have health insurance. To do so, it created the kind of requirement for employers to provide coverage that has been a point of bitter contention in the Clinton plan.
By most accounts, Hawaii's program has been a success. But the state's health director, Dr. John C. Lewin, says 3 percent of Hawaiians still lack coverage, and the Census Bureau estimated that 6.8 percent of Hawaiians were uninsured in 1990-92.
Mr. Clinton's plan requires consumers to get health insurance. It says, "Each eligible individual (other than a Medicare-eligible individual) must enroll in an applicable health plan for the individual and must pay any premium required." .
Moreover, the Clinton proposal says health plans may not cancel, limit or restrict coverage "for any reason, including nonpayment of premiums."
Obviously, Mr. Clinton assumes that most people want health insurance and would voluntarily sign up for it. But under his bill, the enforcement power of the Federal Government would be available if needed to make consumers and employers pay for coverage.
The President's plan says the Labor Secretary shall provide the regional insurance-buying pools with "such technical and other assistance as may promote the efficient collection" of premiums. Such assistance could include fines of up to $5,000 or three times the amount of the liability owed, whichever is greater.
 
Alternative Proposals
 Under a bill introduced by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, every citizen and lawful permanent resident would have to obtain coverage by Jan. 1, 2005.
Another bill, sponsored by Senator Don Nickles, Republican from Oklahoma, offers tax credits to help consumers buy health insurance. "Under our plan," Mr. Nickles said, "everybody would have to have health insurance to cover expenses above $1,000." Consumers would lose the personal tax exemption, $2,350 for 1993, if they did not buy such insurance.
A third bill, by Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, would enroll all people in a national health insurance program by 1995. The program would be designed and financed by the Government, and children would be automatically enrolled at birth. Mr. McDermott has proposed a variety of tax increases to pay for this "single-payer" scheme.
 
Social Security Comparison
 The Clinton plan would provide health insurance for the 38.9 million people who have no coverage. At the same time, millions of people who now get coverage through their employers would switch to new insurance bought through the regional cooperatives, which could be either state government agencies or private nonprofit organizations. Companies with more than 5,000 employees could operate their own health plans.
Such sweeping changes would be much different from the gradual process by which Social Security was expanded to cover nearly the entire population over three decades. The program was created in 1935, and in its early years, it did not cover agricultural workers, domestic workers or the self-employed.
"Our thinking back then," Mr. Myers said, "was that we wanted to get the system going, keep records and collect taxes, then extend coverage to other groups. In theory, everybody should be covered. But in practice, let's do what's doable. That was our thinking."

CLINTON PLAN:
 White House's proposed legislation. Goal: Universal coverage by 1998.
 
Approach: All American citizens and legal residents would have to obtain a comprehensive health benefits package. Most people would get coverage through large insurance purchasing cooperatives called health alliances.
 
Financing: Businesses would required to pay at least 80 percent of premiums for their employees. Small companies, early retirees and people with incomes below certain levels would get Federal subsidies..
 
SINGLE-PAYER PLAN
 Sponsored by Represenetative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, and Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota. Goal: Universal coverage by 1995.
 
Approach: All American citizens and legal residents would be automatically enrolled in a national health insurance program established by the Federal Government and administered by the states.
 
Financing: Private insurance premiums would be replaced with a combination of payroll taxes on employers (4 percent for small companies and 8.4 percent for larger ones), a 2.1 percent tax on individuals' taxable income and new or steeper taxes on tobacco, handguns and ammunition.
 
COOPER PLAN:
 Sponsored by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. Goal: Universal access to health coverage. Sponsors say that with insurance more afforable, 80 percent of uninsured would voluntarily get coverage.
 
Approach: Relies on a voluntary program to cover all American citizens and legal residents through insurance reforms, the creation of insurance purchasing cooperatives and subsidies for the poor.
 
Financing: Would pay for subsidies by reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending. Would cap tax deductions that employers may take for contributions to employee health plans.
 
CHAFEE:
 Sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. Goal: Universal coverage by 2005.
 
Approach: All American citizens and legal residents would have to buy coverage through a qualified health plan. All employers would be required to offer their employees enrollment in a qualified health plan, but would not have to pay for it. Subsidies would be available for low-income individuals.
 
Financing: Would pay for subsidies by reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending. (pg. A11)

HEADLINE: North Koreans Agree to Survey Of Atomic Sites

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Acting to avert a confrontation with the West, North Korea reversed itself today and told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would permit a full inspection of seven sites that are thought to be part of a nuclear-weapons program.
The surprise announcement came less than a week before the agency's board is to meet in Vienna, where it was expected to declare that North Korea's refusal to allow inspections violated international accords. 
 United States officials had said that such a declaration would have sent the issue to the Security Council, where the possibility of economic sanctions had appeared increasingly likely.
 
Taking Edge Off Tension
 United States officials in Washington welcomed North Korea's decision but said the Administration would delay any steps to improve ties with North Korea until the inspectors complete their work. [Page A8.]
The decision seemed to defuse much of the tension that had built up over North Korea's refusal to permit inspections, particularly since the North had said repeatedly that sanctions would be regarded as an act of war.
While the announcement will solve the short-term impasse with the atomic energy agency, it falls far short of meeting all the West's demands.
The inspections, for example, would be limited to sites that North Korea has already declared part of its nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital. They would not cover two other sites that the United States suspects are waste dumps for weapons-grade plutonium.
In effect, North Korea agreed today to accept the first step in an inspection process that was ordered a year ago, when the Government abruptly said it would pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty because of what it said were unwarranted intrusions on its sovereignty. North Korea later "suspended" its withdrawal from the treaty but still refused to allow inspections.
 
Question of 'the Bomb' Remains
 Even if inspections are conducted at the seven sites, they almost certainly will not solve the most vexing question: whether North Korea has a nuclear bomb.
"If the intelligence agencies are right and they have built one or two, they are certainly not at Yongbyon," one senior United States intelligence official said recently.
In a statement today in Vienna, its headquarters, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the objective of its inspection would be "to verify that nuclear material in these facilities has not been diverted since earlier inspections."
The agency also said its team would reload cameras at the sites "to facilitate future verification." But it was unclear whether North Korea had agreed to anything beyond a one-time inspection.
The negotiations leading up to North Korea's decision today have been complicated and melodramatic, with reports of breakthroughs followed by reports of new impasses.
In January, for instance, the Clinton Administration said it had won agreement for an I.A.E.A. inspection of North Korea's nuclear sites, and it proclaimed the accord a major step forward that might lead to reciprocal measures, including cancellation of military exercises that North Korea deems threatening.
Later, however, the International Atomic Energy Agency said North Korea had refused to agree to the terms that the agency had laid out for a full inspection.
After a standoff that lasted for weeks, North Korea agreed today to inspection of the seven sites after all.
Some analysts said that, for all its heated threats, North Korea was afraid the Security Council would impose economic sanctions.
"I think they realized that their chances in the Security Council did not look very good," a United States official who has been deeply involved in the talks said today. "But this inspection will only set the base line. It will not solve the fundamental questions. We still have a long way to go."
 
Survey Could Take 3 Weeks
 Officials also said more information about North Korea's intentions could come from a visit to Pyongyang later this week by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, a California Democrat and chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Dellums is expected to meet with President Kim Il Sung, who rules North Korea like a dictator.
If North Korea finally allows inspections, officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency said, it would take at least three weeks for the team of six or seven inspectors to complete their survey.
A satisfactory report should clear the way for talks between North Korea and the United States over broader inspections and North Korea's return to the treaty, in return for economic and political incentives.
Inspectors last visited Yongbyon during the summer. Their access was sharply limited, and they have been barred from returning.
Since early January, after it reached what appeared to be a significant agreement with the United States, North Korea has angrily refused to go along with the conditions set by the atomic energy agency, which is an arm of the United Nations.
 
Strong Words From the North
 The Government repeatedly denounced the agency as a "lackey" of the United States. But today Yun Ho Jin, a North Korean diplomat in Vienna, delivered a letter to the agency declaring that his Government had accepted the agency's explanations about why it must conduct thorough inspections of all seven sites and replace batteries and film in surveillance cameras.
"There was no explanation," said David Kyd, a spokesman for the agency. "They simply agreed to all of the measures. They seemed to want to keep the process moving."
Officials speculated that today's announcement was timed to circumvent any talk of sanctions at next week's meeting of the agency's board.
The director general of the agency, Hans Blix, had been preparing to declare that the North had broken the "continuity" of inspections, language that would have forced the Security Council to take up the issue.
Such a move may yet be necessary. In the United States and among its Pacific allies, many officials have argued that North Korea was simply bluffing, holding the agency at bay, then allowing inspections at the last possible moment, but still not revealing its full hand.
Many believe the inspection announcement today may just be another step in that process, buying the North a few more weeks.
 
A Taste of the Carrot
 On the other hand President Kim, who is 81 and a canny survivor, may have decided that the economic opportunity of an opening toward the United States was too great to pass up. With the economy in shambles -- the gross national product has declined four years in a row -- Mr. Kim needs investment more than he needs bombs.
Assuming the inspection takes place without problems, the United States is likely to try to cajole the North into implementing its agreement with South Korea to keep the peninsula free of nuclear weapons. Washington has already said it would offer an assurance that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons. But it is still unclear if the North would agree to inspections so rigorous that they would crimp its ability to extract plutonium.
One possible incentive to the North may be an offer from Washington to cancel this year's joint military exercise with South Korea, an exercise that the North regularly denounces as a "nuclear war preparation." Even without an inspection agreement, American and South Korean officials had planned a vastly scaled-down exercise in an effort not to provoke the North.
But it is unclear if the United States would go ahead with its planned deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. That deployment is to begin in March, but officials have hinted that it, too, might be reconsidered.

HEADLINE: The Yen's Rise Forces a Reassessment in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Just days after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's firm stand against American trade demands met widespread approval at home, the damaging surge in the value of the yen has sent waves of anxiety through the business community and reversed sentiment about the wisdom of a confrontation with the United States.
Corporate executives and economists initially extolled the pluses of a more assertive Japan after trade talks with the United States collapsed last Friday. Mr. Hosokawa had rejected President Clinton's demand that Japan guarantee increased levels of imports, or targets, to insure reductions in Japan's yawning trade surplus. 
 But by Monday, after the yen had jumped more than 4 percent against the dollar, they were focusing on the pain the soaring yen is likely to inflict in the form of falling exports and an even weaker economy in the midst of a deep recession.
 
Prime Minister Criticized
 Many experts are now saying the Prime Minister should have prevented the sudden jump in the yen's value by countering with his own program for reviving the faltering economy and removing the blanket of regulations that hampers entry to foreigners. Such initiatives might have averted the sudden rise in trade tensions and the resurgent yen.
Since there was no agreement, traders and investors have pushed the value of the yen higher and the dollar lower because they assume that the Clinton Administration will favor this as an alternative means of pressuring the Japanese back to the bargaining table.
"I fully support Hosokawa's rejection of market targets," said Toshihiro Kiribuchi, the executive managing director of the Omron Corporation, a leading electronics manufacturer. "But at the same time I fully support the United States point of view on the general economic issues. Mr. Hosokawa should have come up with a counterproposal with a concrete schedule for removing regulation over the economy and for more stimulus."
Kazuo Nukazawa, the managing director of Keidanren, Japan's leading business lobbying organization, added: "Mr. Hosokawa is not much of an economist, but certainly his sense of urgency might be increased by what is happening with the yen. What we want is more expansionary measures and that they be taken as swiftly as possible."
The rise of the yen halted today, at least temporarily, after the Bank of Japan reportedly spent nearly $1 billion buying dollars and selling yen in an effort to halt the surge. In New York trading, 100 yen were worth 96.3 cents, down from 97.8 cents Monday. In the traditional way of expressing the exchange value, the dollar rose to 103.85 yen, up from 102.25 yen on Monday, a six-month low for the dollar and high for the yen and just off the record low for the dollar since World II.
But the one-day stabilization of the yen did not calm the stock market. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 484.65 points, or 2.5 percent, to 18,974.60 and is down more than 5 percent in the last two days.
[Stocks rebounded here somewhat on Wednesday. The Nikkei rose 77.51 points, or about four tenths of 1 percent, to 19,052.11.]
 A strong yen is a powerful but blunt weapon for the United States. It makes imported goods less expensive for Japanese consumers and raises the price of Japanese exports, thus crimping overseas sales of Japanese goods.
It can also force manufacturers to cut prices at home because of competition from cheap imports. That would tend to reduce Japan's trade surplus, but would also slow economic growth.
If President Clinton was consciously using exchange rates to pressure Japan into action -- something many people here suspect -- it appears to be working.
The front pages of all the big newspapers this afternoon carried articles prominently listing the latest yen exchange rate, with warnings of its negative impact on the already fragile economy.
Economists were predicting that if the yen remained at its current levels, it would deepen the two-year-old recession, increase unemployment and possibly put the stock market into a prolonged tailspin.
"If we continue to have a strong yen for the next few months, there's no recovery," Hirohiko Okumura, the chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said. "Even the strongest electronics companies cannot make money at these levels."
He said that while he had forecast economic growth this year of as much as 1 percent, a strong yen could turn that into a 1 percent decline, a big setback for the world's second- largest economy.

HEADLINE: Cabinet Officers Assail Balanced-Budget Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Jabbing at every exposed political nerve it could find, the Clinton Administration told Congress today that a Federal balanced-budget amendment would imperil the national defense, increase crime, cheat veterans, squeeze the elderly and weaken the economy.
Analyzing how cuts would affect the economy and their departments, five Cabinet officers testified today against a proposed amendment that would require the Federal budget to be balanced, probably by the year 2001. The Senate plans to begin debating the measure next Tuesday, and neither side is sure how the vote will go. 
 The Cabinet officers appeared before Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee and is the amendment's staunchest enemy. He variously called the amendment "seductive," "simplistic," "this monstrosity" and "this nefarious proposal."
Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, who is the amendment's chief sponsor, sought to counter Mr. Byrd's display with a hearing of his own. He told the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, which he heads, that "no one can study the past 25 years of successive deficits without recognizing that there has been governmental abuse that must be halted."
 
Injection of Discipline
 Mr. Simon's leading witness was Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator and Presidential contender, who said the amendment was a necessary "mechanism of discipline" to make Congress undertake the sacrifices required to balance the budget.
"This deficit is all too real, this debt all too crippling," Mr. Tsongas said. "Only a balanced budget amendment can inject the discipline to achieve this indispensable end."
A two-thirds vote, or 67 if all senators vote, is required to pass a Constitutional amendment. The House is expected to take the measure up later this year. If both chambers pass it with two-thirds majorities, then it would become part of the Constitution if approved within seven years by the legislatures of 38 states.
The Administration and Mr. Byrd are working to mobilize opposition to the proposal, which does not specify how the budget should be balanced. That gives different supporters the chance to offer different solutions, or none at all, which was what Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, offered today when Mr. Byrd asked him how he would eliminate the current fiscal year's deficit, now about $220 billion.
 
Grim Pictures
 On Monday at the White House, Administration officials told reporters of their opposition to the proposal. Today, the Administration took the battle to Capitol Hill, with Leon E. Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, painting a grim picture of the uncertainties the amendment would thrust on the economy and four other Cabinet heads outlining probable cuts in their departments. Each assumed that their departments would have to share in spending cuts in proportion to how much they now spend.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry outlined more troop cuts, of 60,000 to 270,000, listed weapons that would have to be abandoned and said the amendment would inject "great uncertainty, and, I do not think it is hyperbole to say, chaos, into our defense planning."
Attorney General Janet Reno asserted that the amendment would undermine the Justice Department's ability to fight violence and that its passage would lead to "gutting the heart and soul of the Senate-passed crime bill."
She said that with such an amendment, prison spending would be reduced and violent offenders released to prevent crowding.
Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, predicted that 20 Veterans Administration hospitals would be closed, burial in national cemeteries denied to 12,000 veterans a year, and the average annual compensation paid to veterans with service-related disabilities reduced to $4,968 from $5,602.
Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, warned that the amendment, which permits deficit spending but only with three-fifths votes in both houses, would force the deepest cuts in "safety net" programs when they were needed most, in a recession.
In a similar vein, Mr. Panetta said that by forbidding any lift to the economy with an infusion of Government spending during a recession, "we would be doing exactly the wrong thing."
Chiding the amendment's supporters for requiring a three-fifths majority to allow deficit spending, Mr. Panetta asked, "Why can't they get a majority to tell us how they would cut the budget?"

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Meets Again With Burmese Dissident

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The American lawmaker who was allowed to meet om Monday with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi at her home in Myanmar said today that he was "cautiously optimistic" that the Burmese military Government would soon agree to negotiate with her.
The lawmaker, Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, led the first delegation of foreign visitors permitted to see Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi since she was placed under house arrest in 1989 for her efforts to promote democracy in her country. 
 The delegation met with her for three hours on Monday, and Mr. Richardson had a second, two-and-a-half hour meeting with her today.
"I am cautiously optimistic that the proposal for a face-to-face discussion with Aung San Suu Kyi will be accepted," Mr. Richardson said in an interview after arriving here today from the Myanmar capital, Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon. "Aung San Suu Kyi is the key to a solution."
In the conversations with her visitors, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi did not outline specific issues she would discuss in any direct meetings with the Government. But she suggested she would seek freedom for imprisoned supporters of the democracy movement she had led and would work toward the multiparty democratic system promised by the military when it declared the 1990 elections void.
While she was under detention, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won the election by a landslide, but the military government refused to accept the results. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
Representative Richardson said that while the Burmese military had made a "useful positive gesture" in allowing Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to speak, "deeds must follow words."
"It does not substitute for significant discussions on political reconciliation, and it does not substitute for the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi," he said.
 
Response to Clinton Letter
 Mr. Richardson said that during today's meeting, he received her response to a letter from President Clinton that he delivered on Monday.
The American Congressman also met twice on Monday with Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of Burmese military intelligence, and said that he had urged the general, who is regarded by many diplomats as the nation's new strongman, to deal with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi directly.
While Mr. Richardson would not characterize the general's response to the proposal, American officials said they believed that General Khin Nyunt was leaning toward direct negotiations, but that he would not be able to commit himself until he had the approval of other junta members.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi (pronounced awng san sue chee) has had no direct contact with high-level Burmese Government officials. A lieutentant colonel who visits her occasionally has served as her liaison with the Government.
During her meeting with the delegation on Monday, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said she had always been willing to negotiate with the junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, on all issues except the question of whether she would remain in Myanmar. The military has said she may go free if she promised to leave the country.
 
Congressman Awaits Response
 Representative Richardson, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who has been active in human rights issues, said today that he would return to Washington and would await a response from General Khin Nyunt.
He said he had concluded that Burmese concern about the Clinton Administration and its policies toward Myanmar was the reason officials had allowed an American-led delegation to be the first to see Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
In her remarks Monday, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi expressed her thanks to the Clinton Administration, which has repeatedly called for her release, but she also said that she hoped to see from the United States a "more clear-cut policy in favor of the movement for democracy."
While the United States cut off all Government aid to Myanmar in 1988, it maintains trade links and limited diplomatic ties, despite the military leadership's abysmal human rights record. Several large American corporations do business in Myanmar.
 
Question of Sanctions
 Asked whether the United States and other nations should consider economic sanctions against Myanmar to protest its human rights policies, she said that foreign governments should consider whether their trade with Myanmar is "really helping the people or is it simply helping the Government to dig in its heels. This is the question to be asked."
Too many nations, she suggested, use economic carrots, and not sticks, to encourage improvements in Myanmar's human rights record. She asked her guests to remember that "you can stuff a mule to death with carrots."
While Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi appeared to be in generally good health despite her years of isolation, Western diplomats said that they were trying to determine, on the basis of her comments on Monday, whether she is receiving adequate medical care.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said that her Burmese doctors had told her that she was suffering from spondylosis, a degenerative joint disease that results in a hardening and stiffening of the spinal column. "I can't sew any more because it gets at the shoulders," she said. "It's a bit of discomfort all the time."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Urges 'Dialogue'
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States urged Myanmar's military leaders today to "build on this small step" of Representative Richardson's meeting by "beginning a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and moving toward genuine democratic reform."
In a statement, the Administration added: "The President regards the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and all other prisoners of conscience in Burma as unacceptable and renews his call for their immediate and unconditional release."
The White House also released a copy of a letter from President Clinton that Mr. Richardson delivered to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday in which Mr. Clinton praised the Burmese for her courage and expressed concern about her welfare.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says North Korean Decision Is Welcome

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
American officials said today that they welcomed North Korea's decision to allow international inspectors to visit its nuclear sites, but said the United States would wait until the inspectors gave Pyongyang a clean bill before improving ties.
Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said that in response to Pyongyang's move, the United States had taken the modest action of restarting informal, low-level talks today in New York with North Korea. 
 He said that only after the inspections were completed and North Korea began talks with South Korea about denuclearizing the Korean peninsula would the United States give Pyongyang the two things it has asked for: suspending military exercises with the South and beginning high-level talks aimed at improving economic ties.
 
Paving the Way for Talks
 "We look forward to these inspections as soon as possible," Mr. McCurry said at the daily State Department briefing. "Satisfactory completion of the inspection at the earliest possible date and resumption of the North-South dialogue on denuclearization will pave the way for the next round of U.S.-North Korea talks."
American officials said that as a result of the announcement today, they had put on hold their preparations to persuade the United Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea. The Clinton Administration repeatedly threatened to push for such sanctions unless the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which meets next Monday in Vienna, could certify that North Korea had not diverted atomic material.
Administration officials said they would still seek sanctions if the international inspectors found that North Korea had diverted nuclear material from its atomic energy program to a suspected nuclear weapons program.
North Korea's decision, after months of refusing to allow inspections, came as a surprise to the Administration.
"The North Koreans saw they could follow two different roads," a State Department official said. "One road would lead them into being an outlaw nation, while the other leads them back into the community of nations."
Now that North Korea has agreed to allow inspectors to visit seven declared nuclear sites, the Clinton Administration said it would push, at any new high-level round of talks, for inspections at two other sites where American intelligence officials suspected improper diversion of nuclear material.
American officials said that the announcement today was an important step toward getting the inspections back on track, but they acknowledged that North Korea had still not agreed to the regular, ad hoc inspections called for under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Several officials vowed that they would continue to push for such inspections.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
A Subwaycentric Lens on History

BYLINE: By David Gonzalez

 BODY:
"SEE Spot run" may have been the first words read by lots of children, but not by Paul Fritz.
"Express," "via" and "local" hold that place of honor in his life. 
 "My parents didn't drive, so we went everywhere by subway," explained the 39-year-old Brooklynite. "I could read a subway map before anything else."
A buff was born.
He eventually outdid most buffs, trading the vicarious adventures of studying and riding trains for the real life of a subway motorman. He also improved upon his earliest reading matter, sketching out over the last 11 years an intricate map of the New York City subway system at the height of its complexity in 1937 when three separate systems competed for commuters.
Of course, some New Yorkers might quibble and say the system is never more complex than when they are swimming through the crowds at the Times Square Station during a soggy winter rush hour, frantically looking to make a transfer. But his map details elevated lines, stations and spurs that were razed or closed long ago in the wake of the city's consolidation of systems.
"I'm thinking from the perspective of the historian, not the straphanger," he said of his map, which he designed for researching the system's evolution. Thinking back over his creation, he calls it the "greatest map ever made," but then corrects himself, lest he be accused of bragging. Instead, he points out its accurate geographical perspective, with islands that include one offshore terminal of a totally different nature.
"Mine is the only subway map to include Potter's Field."
Maybe it's best not to have his map hanging in a subway car.
The world of dark subway tunnels and clacking elevated lines held a special lure for Mr. Fritz as far back as he could remember, which in his case is an IRT ride home to Brooklyn when he was 2 years old. He came to associate what most New Yorkers thought of as a mundane means of transportation with nothing less than power, and the mysteries of being a grownup -- like his father, an economist who took the train to work each morning.
"The train was a forbidding, adult environment," he said. "The straps were too high for me to hold. Everything about it was for grownup people."
Forbidden to ride alone, he soon began to draw subway scenes. In his room he could have a train in front of him whenever he wanted.
By then trips became an end in themselves, like when his family, which had then moved to Jackson Heights (on the Flushing IRT line), would visit the Bronx Zoo. The real attraction for him was seeing the gigantic, curved trestles near West Farms Square on the White Plains IRT line. With a smile, he recalled how that Bronx scene was the genuine IRT.
"I felt cheated because I lived on the Flushing line, because that wasn't the real IRT," he said. "It used different cars. It didn't go up to Harlem or the Bronx. To me, the IRT had to go uptown, to where the BMT didn't go. There was something wimpy about the BMT."
But life on the Flushing line was still better than what awaited him in his teen-age years, when his family moved to Great Neck, L.I. There were people there, he said, who had never been on a subway car. And they were proud of it.
"I felt like an oddball," he said. "To me, a person who's never been on the subway is someone who's never opened their eyes."
That's the truth.
After stints teaching public school and driving a cab, Mr. Fritz gave in to his hobby and took a job with the Transit Authority in 1982. His schooling -- a college degree in writing -- nonetheless shows. He may be one of the few transit workers to pepper his speech with words like "anomie" (what motivates graffiti writers) and "milieu" (for the underground world of trains and tracks).
With access to the yards, tracks and tunnels he had only glimpsed from passing trains, he began to work on his idea for the map. Memo pad in hand, he rode the front of trains, sketching out the curves of current lines. Visits to libraries, with their own maps and photos, helped him flesh out his project, and he even took to exploring some abandoned tunnels to insure that no detail escaped his attention.
The finished project shows it. The old Myrtle Avenue line to downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan is on it, as well as the Bronx Zoo and Bronx Park IRT spurs that once took visitors directly to their destinations. Different colors show the various train lines, as well as indicating whether they were underground or not.
He's now thinking of doing more drawings of old-time subway scenes, evoking the same kind of period detail that made subway cars interesting before they become more standardized. To make his point, he dashed off a quick sketch of an old R-1 subway car -- the kind that had soft, incandescent lights and rattan seats.
For him, it's the system's history that appeals to him -- like the late 1950's when the subway cars and stations still had some character.
But he admits there's a bit of the 1960's that appeals to him, too.
"In the blackout of 1965, I was envious of the people who were stuck on the tracks and could walk on the tracks," he said. "I really envied the people who were stuck in the river tubes and had to walk distances in the tunnels."

HEADLINE: VIACOM'S VICTORY;
Rival Bidder Diller Says: 'It's History'

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
When did Barry Diller finally let go of the dream he had been nursing for so long to merge his company with Paramount Communications and oust an old rival while he was at it? In an interview, a prickly Mr. Diller would not say. "I don't want to get into any of that," he said from QVC Network Inc.'s offices in West Chester, Pa. "It's history."
But Brian L. Roberts, the president of the Comcast Corporation and a partner of Mr. Diller's in his five-month quest to take over Paramount Communications, said the fateful decision came shortly before Feb. 1, when final bids were due. 
 Mr. Diller's advisers had concluded that victory was within their grasp if they simply promised to pay an extra $1 billion to Paramount's shareholders if QVC's stock tumbled after the deal -- matching Viacom's bravado.
But even though victory would mean settling an old score for Mr. Diller -- he had quit Paramount in 1984 after falling out with its chairman, Martin S. Davis -- Mr. Diller was all business.
 
Some 'What Ifs'
 As Mr. Roberts recalled, "Barry told everybody -- and we didn't quarrel -- 'It may work out. But what if the United States starts a war and stocks go down? What if interest rates go up? What if Clinton starts a trade war? You'd owe $1 billion you didn't have.' "
The stream of doubts did not surprise Mr. Roberts. "In the end, Barry didn't want to spend all his waking hours worrying about financings that come due in six months," Mr. Roberts said. "He wanted to spend his days worrying about which new shows to put on television and which movies to make."
Diane von Furstenberg, a designer who is an investor in QVC and is featured on it, had similar recollections of Mr. Diller's resolve: "By the time he didn't get it, he didn't want it anymore. He drew the line and that was it."
As a veteran programmer, Mr. Diller's reluctance to take a big financial risk may stem from the years he spent trying to build the Fox television network for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation under a crushing debt load. "Murdoch went right to the edge and Barry told me, 'I never want to get there again,' " Mr. Roberts said.
When he left Fox two years ago, he said he wanted to be his own boss, an odyssey that led him to QVC and ultimately into his unsuccessful fight for Paramount.
In a world where appearance is everything, Hollywood's image makers went to work yesterday on a furious campaign to persuade the world that the home shopping executive was not tarnished by the loss.
Herbert Allen, his investment banker, argued that Mr. Diller should get credit not only for driving up the bidding but also for creating many of the assets at Paramount years ago that Sumner M. Redstone, the rival head of Viacom, ultimately wanted so badly.
 
Losers Aren't Weepers
 Ms. Von Furstenberg went further, arguing that Mr. Diller's many backers were actually "excited by the prospect" that Mr. Diller was now free to pursue other alliances. "There's a lot of opportunities out there, so I wouldn't worry," she said.
Like politicians who argue that being the also-ran does not have to hurt a career, the logic of Mr. Diller's supporters was essentially that losers do not have to be weepers -- so long as they become household names from the experience.
"Here, in Hollywood," said Laurence Mark, a Hollywood producer, "it has only heightened his profile and heightened the profile of his company."
Mr. Diller's first order of business, friends and analysts agree, is to hunker down at QVC and preside over his company's coming introduction of Q2, a new, more upscale shopping channel.
The debut, scheduled for this May, is crucial, since Mr. Diller's ability to finance acquisitions depends heavily on QVC's stock price, which rose yesterday by $1.75, to $50.25, in Nasdaq trading. Mr. Diller could also get his hands on a $1.2 billion war chest without too much trouble simply by leveraging QVC's $200 million in cash flow, according to Craig Bibb, a Paine Webber analyst.
Protecting QVC's position in the home-shopping arena may also mean approaching Home Shopping Network, its main competitor, to talk about dusting off the $1.35 billion merger that the two companies temporarily abandoned when Mr. Diller's interest in Paramount grew serious.
Bankers and analysts get wide-eyed thinking about the possibility of Mr. Diller making a run at any number of giant media companies from big networks like CBS and NBC to hooking up with Seagrams through its mutual bankers at Allen & Company to buy Time Warner.
Others are less charitable. They say Mr. Diller made tactical blunders in the way he pursued his deal from sloppily bidding against himself at one point to losing a minor timing advantage by waiting five days to start a hostile offer he had made.
Mr. Diller will have none of it, arguing that none of those decisions cost him the victory. "The mistake we may have made is that we decided not to pay more," he said. "God knows, that might be the giant mistake of all time. Time will tell."


GRAPHIC: Viacom Inc.'s final, successful offer to buy Paramount Communications is now worth $78.29 to $82.17 a share in cash and securities, assuming all shares are eventually tendered to Viacom.
Chart: "Viacom's Winning Bid"
 Any shareholders who fail to submit their shares to Viacom by the extended deadline of March 1 will receive no cash, only getting the securities, which are worth far less. If that happens, shareholders who did submit in time will get cash for a slightly higher proporation of their shares.
 
CASH PORTION
 50.1 percent of the outstanding shares will be bought for $107 each.
 
SECURITIES PORTION
 Remaining shares will be exchanged for a package of Viacom securities that is now worth $49.46 to $57.23. The wide range reflects Wall Street's sharply divergent views both of Viacom's prospects and the attractiveness of the various securities.
 
Common stock. 0.93065 Viacom class B share, valued at $26.06 based on yesterday's closing stock price of $28.
 
Convertible debt. $17.50 principal amount of 8 percent exchangeable convertible debenture due in 12 years. If Viacom's pending merger with Blockbuster is not completed by the end of 1994, Viacom could convert the debentures into preferred stock paying only a 5 percent dividend. Estimated to trade at $14.88 to $18.03.

HEADLINE: Assisting The Needy Amid Guns

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Bernard Hanson, an art historian who lives in New Haven, believes in gun control so strongly that he has considered putting bumper stickers on his pickup truck calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
"But I'm afraid I'd get my window bashed or something," said Mr. Hanson, who calls New Haven "the northern branch of the South Bronx" because of the crime and guns that have invaded even his cloistered neighborhood of 19th-century houses and walled yards. 
 When Mr. Hanson learned in December that a Manhattan carpet merchant, Fernando Mateo, had launched a campaign to stem the tide of gun-related violence -- by offering toy-store gift certificates in exchange for guns -- he was so moved that he wanted to do something in Mr. Mateo's honor.
"It meant a lot to me that this was a private citizen who felt strongly enough to do something," said Mr. Hanson, who decided to send $100 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, his very first contribution, because of Mr. Mateo's efforts.
Mr. Hanson is one of several people who have contributed to the Neediest Cases Fund in honor of Mr. Mateo, whose idea helped the police in the 34th Precinct in upper Manhattan bring in more than 1,500 guns in December and January.
By giving to the fund, which supports seven of the city's largest social-service agencies, the contributors bolstered programs that provide food, shelter and medical care to tens of thousands of the poorest New Yorkers.
The Times pays the overhead of the campaign, which is in its 82d year, so that every dollar is given directly to the agencies to help people.
But as the appeal enters its final two weeks, the ability of the fund to continue providing help is in danger because contributions are lagging about $90,000 behind where they were last year at this time.
Individual contributors are now keeping pace with the amount they gave last year: 11,624 donors have given $3,192,722, or about $1,000 more than last year. But donations from estates and trusts, which fluctuate depending on interest rates, have decreased.

HEADLINE: The Trade Frustrations of Motorola

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
When the United States and Japan agreed to open a big part of Japan's cellular telephone market to Motorola Inc. in 1989, Robert A. Mosbacher, the Commerce Secretary at the time, hailed the pact as "a model for future negotiations."
But rather than a model of success, the cellular telephone agreement has become an example of what American trade negotiators have long found frustrating about dealing with Japan: first, when one barrier seems to be swept away, another obstacle seems to arise to take its place; second, agreements often seem to fall apart when it comes time actually to put them into effect. 
 Now, citing a lack of market access for Motorola, President Clinton has decided to put sanctions on Japan. And, in retrospect, it is clear the cellular agreement was not as strong as Washington believed.
 
A Crucial Market
 A big flaw from the American perspective is that Motorola's penetration of the market in the crucial Tokyo-Nagoya corridor was left in the hands of a cellular phone service company that had little incentive to push Motorola products.
"No one liked it, but it was take it or leave it," Robert M. Orr Jr., director of government affairs for Motorola's Japanese subsidiary, said of the arrangement. Mr. Orr, who was not with Motorola in 1989, said that in retrospect, "It doesn't look like a good agreement."
The cellular phone service company, the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, known as IDO, was building a mobile phone system using a rival technology developed by N.T.T., the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. It agreed, under considerable prodding from Japan's Government, to build a separate system using Motorola technology.
But IDO could not easily afford to build two systems, so it concentrated on the one using N.T.T. technology. As a result, as of last month it had 400 base stations for the N.T.T.-compatible system compared with 110 for the Motorola system. The N.T.T.-compatible phones can be used in 94 percent of the service area compared with 61 percent for the Motorola phones.
Given this disparity, it is little wonder that more than 310,000 customers have chosen the N.T.T.-compatible phones and only about 10,000 the Motorola phones. It is this lack of sales that Washington says violates the "comparable market access" that Japan promised.
Yoshio Utsumi, director general for international affairs at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said that "comparable market access" meant only that Motorola would get equivalent radio frequencies. How many Motorola phones are actually used is strictly a matter between Motorola and IDO, he said.
Mr. Orr of Motorola disagreed, saying that since Japan arranged the shotgun marriage between Motorola and IDO, the Government was responsible for the results.
In 1987, the United States and Japan reached an agreement that would allow Motorola to sell its system, with the Japanese deciding to allow one competitor for N.T.T. in each region.
The DDI Corporation, a maverick discount long-distance company that decided to use Motorola's equipment, won the franchises for Osaka and much of Japan. But IDO won the high-density Tokyo-Nagoya corridor, which is home for most Japanese businesses and most potential cellular phone users; IDO decided to use the N.T.T. technology.
The matter seemed to be settled. But Motorola was not completely happy -- DDI customers in Osaka could not use their Motorola phones in Tokyo or Nagoya.
 
A Compromise
 The 1989 agreement called for granting frequencies for a Motorola system in the Tokyo-Nagoya region. But rather than let DDI provide the service in the Tokyo-Nagoya area, which would have meant a third competitor in the market, the telecommunications ministry persuaded IDO to offer a Motorola-based service.
IDO is building 80 base stations for the Motorola system, to be completed by April, and another 100 are scheduled by April 1996. That will put coverage of the Motorola system at 93 percent of the service area, about what the N.T.T. system has.
Still, Mr. Orr of Motorola called the plan "too little too late."

HEADLINE: Calm in Currency Markets Bolsters Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
After the White House moved to calm the turbulent currency markets, stock traders strongly bid up most of the main stock indicators in heavy trading.
With bond and currency markets more stable, equity investors continued to pour funds into economically sensitive stocks like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Allied Signal and Goodyear Tire and Rubber. 
 "A little more reality has set into the currency markets" compared with Monday's trading, said Kevin J. Lawrie, a foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "The fundamentals, like a recovering economy, favor the dollar, so people are a little less keen on dollar weakness."
But John K. Nelson, director of global foreign exchange at Barclays Bank, remained cautious. "Until the Clinton Administration says forcefully that it will not politicize the dollar, the dollar will remain under pressure," with possible effects on the stock market, he said.
 
Dow Industrials Up 24.21
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.21 points, to 3,928.27, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.29 points, to 472.52. The smaller-stock Nasdaq composite index rose 4.67 points, to 790.12. The American Stock Exchange market value index declined slightly, down 0.07 point, to 474.84.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.10 points, to 262.36, on volume of 306.8 million shares. Advancing stocks led decliners by 1,198 to 882.
Stock and bond traders had feared that turmoil in the currency markets, roiled by worsening trade relations between the United States and Japan, would spill over into stocks and bonds.
But the Treasury Department reiterated late Monday night, around noon on Tuesday Tokyo time, Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's policy that markets, not governments, should dictate foreign exchange rates. The announcement helped ease fears that the Clinton Administration was deliberately talking down the dollar.
Also, the Bank of Japan yesterday stepped in decisively, spending as much as $2 billion to bolster the dollar, currency traders said. The action helped keep the dollar from plunging below 100 yen, although the dollar traded as low as 101.9 yen in overnight trading. It settled yesterday at 103.85 yen to the dollar, up 1.6 yen.
 
Economic Reports Ignored
 The news in yesterday's economic reports was expected, so the markets ignored it. The Federal Reserve Board reported that industrial production rose five-tenths of a percent in January, better than the consensus estimate of four-tenths of a percent. January factory use came in as expected, at 83.1 percent.
Six Dow component stocks rose 1 point or more, including Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 2 5/8, to 108 1/2; Allied Signal, up 1 3/4, to 79 3/4, and Goodyear Tire and Rubber, up 1 1/2, to 47 1/2.
American depository receipts of Telefonica de Espana were the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange after the company sold more A.D.R.'s. They rose 1/8, to 44, on a volume of 9.1 million A.D.R.'s. One Telefonica A.D.R. equals three ordinary shares.
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine's A.D.R.'s were the second-most-active stock on the Big Board after a public sale of 9.5 million new A.D.R.'s. They rose 1 1/8, to 36 3/4, on a volume of 4.65 million A.D.R.'s. One A.D.R. represents half of an ordinary share of the French oil and gas company.
As widely expected, the winner in the battle for Paramount Communications saw its share prices fall and the loser saw its price rise. Shares of QVC Network, the loser, rose 1 3/4, to 50 1/4. Class B shares of the winner, Viacom fell 1 7/8, to 28, while class A shares fell 3/4, to 34 1/8. Blockbuster Entertainment, Viacom's prospective merger partner, saw its shares rise 3/8, to 25 1/4.

HEADLINE: An Apron for a Squeegee

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that squeegee men should go out and get jobs in restaurants instead of trying to wash car windshields.
"There are plenty of jobs available," he told an interviewer on WBAI radio. "A person who's a squeegee operator could work in a restaurant." He added, "Maybe the hours are a little longer and then you've got to pay taxes and there are a whole bunch of other things that are involved, but you really shouldn't fuel the impression that the people who are doing squeegees just really don't have a job." 
 Mr. Giuliani first raised the squeegee workers as an issue during his campaign for mayor, saying they menaced drivers and reduced the quality of life in the city. And since taking office, Mr. Giuliani's Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, has made clear that he expects officers to deal not just with major crimes but panhandlers, squeegee workers and even truants.
An eight-week police department study of squeegee men, based on a survey of 41 of them, showed that police can easily drive them away from the entrances to bridges and tunnels through aggressive patrolling.
The study also concluded that the squeegee users "are of a population that is largely beset with alcohol and drug abuse, economic marginality and unemployment." Many, it said, "appear to be unemployable save some heroic efforts that go beyond any rehabilitation technologies." And for about half, "arrests for serious criminality" are a problem.
Mr. Giuliani, however, said he "knew of situations in which people have turned down jobs in restaurants because they felt they had more flexibility" with their squeegees. And he said his administration expects "more of people."
"Don't stand on a corner squeegeeing," he said. "Go to a restaurant. Get a job at a restaurant. There are plenty of restaurants in this city that will employ people at wage levels that make sense, that offer some degree of a career.
"I know people who own restaurants that started by washing dishes. I've washed dishes in restaurants. It's an honorable, decent, terrific thing to do, a lot of self-fulfillment that you're working 10, 12 hours a day and you kind of like working steadily and moving toward the possibility of moving up, becoming a waiter."

HEADLINE: U.S. Hoping to Use Fears of Trade War To Pressure Japan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The initiation today of formal United States trade sanctions against Japan for protecting its cellular phone market touched off a new wave of anxiety about a trade war -- just the reaction the Clinton Administration appears to be trying to generate to get Japan to return to the bargaining table on American terms.
At a news conference attended, to the Administration's delight, by television networks from around the world, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announced that his office would publish within 30 days a list of the Japanese companies that would be punished in the American market, unless Japan fully opens its cellular phone market to Motorola Inc. 
 Mr. Kantor's news conference, attended by more than 100 journalists, underscored the immense international interest in the trade rift between the world's two largest economies. The attention fit into what appears to be the Administration's strategy: to create as much uncertainty and anxiety in Japan as possible about Washington's next moves, in the hope that this will drive up the Japanese yen and put pressure on Tokyo to return to the negotiations on American terms, before any more sanctions need be applied.
The uncertainty has already driven up the value of the yen against the dollar by about 6 percent since Thursday. That potentially makes all Japanese exports 6 percent more expensive -- which is the most onerous sanction of all because it is the equivalent of a 6 percent tariff on everything Japan sells in the United States. This, in turn, adds to recessionary pressures in the Japanese economy and eats away at some of the stimulus package the Japanese Government announced last week.
The Clinton team would like to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war with Japan. Such a conflict could sour economic relations, hurt American consumers, complicate political cooperation with Tokyo on crucial issues, like Korea and Russia, and possibly undercut the Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who Mr. Clinton basically believes wants to overhaul and open Japan's economy over the long run.
The trick for the Clinton Administration is to squeeze Japan into accepting the American negotiating framework without doing irreparable damage to the relationship. Hence its current strategy, which might be called constructive uncertainty.
 
The Currency Factor
 "I think that the Administration has concluded, correctly, that time works in their favor because of the impact of the higher yen on the Japanese economy," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "That higher yen reduces the competitiveness of Japanese exports, boosts their imports and squeezes profits. Therefore, I think Washington can afford to wait, and let the yen do their talking -- without having to take any new sanctions."
The danger, Mr. Hormats added, is that if this anxiety and uncertainty last too long, tensions could build, there could be a nationalistic reaction from Japan, and things could get out of hand -- possibilities that are causing the Administration to hope the Japanese will act quickly.
Indeed, the Treasury Department issued a statement Monday denying that the United States was intervening in the markets to drive up the yen. But the Treasury does not have to intervene. The surge is a result of speculators anticipating that the United States may take such a move in the future as part of a trade war.
In any case, the net effect on Japan is the same. That explains reports today that the Japanese central bank was busily buying dollars and selling yen to push down the yen's value against the dollar.
From an American point of view, this all suggests that the strategy is taking hold. White House officials are clearly going out of their way to give Tokyo time to draw its own conclusions from these events. They pointedly note that the President's advisers are still putting together a menu of sanctions that Mr. Clinton could use against Japan.
They also note that the list will not be on the President's desk before the end of this week, at the earliest. Mr. Clinton will then want to take his time and study the options before he makes up his mind about which, if any, to choose, the officials said.
Some or all of the sanctions presumably would be aimed at Japan's telecommunications industry since the case involves American accusations that Motorola is being discriminated against in Japan's cellular telephone market. American officials are supporting Motorola's complaint that it has been effectively shut out of the huge and lucrative Tokyo cellular market because of business arrangements forced on it by Japanese officials and because the Japanese have deliberately favored cellular technologies that differ from Motorola's.
When Administration officials say they want the Japanese to return to bargaining on American terms, they mean that they want them to accept not only the principle of opening their relatively closed markets -- particularly in insurance, autos, medical equipment and telecommunications -- but also to accept numerical indicators for measuring whether Japan is keeping its promises.
For instance, in autos, the United States would like Japan to accept as one measure of whether it is opening its markets a regular accounting of how many Japanese car dealers offer foreign models.
Japanese officials are afraid that what Washington calls numerical indicators will be not just yardsticks to measure Japanese auto imports, but also targets that Japan will be held to, accompanied by punishments for not reaching the goal. That is what happened with an agreement on semiconductors.
The crux of the matter is that the two sides no longer trust each other. And if the talks are to resume, under whatever pressures, a level of trust will have to be built -- so that Japan can agree to indicators that it is sure will not be held up as market targets, and so that the United States can have indicators it considers reliable in determining whether Japan is really opening its markets.
So far, American officials say, there have been no feelers from Tokyo about returning to bargaining, but, they add, it is still very early.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Government Securities Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of government securities were mixed yesterday, as investors and dealers remained worried about a weaker dollar against the yen.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 1/16 yesterday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.45 percent, a tick higher than 6.44 percent on Monday. The prices of most of the intermediate maturities rose, while shorter maturities were unchanged. 
 The dollar plunged against the yen on Monday after tough trade talk by the Clinton Administration sent tremors through the global currency markets, but the dollar made a comeback against the yen yesterday. The bond market's chief concern is that a weaker dollar against the yen could encourage Japanese investors to sell dollar-denominated securities.
According to MMS International, Treasury data compiled through the end of the third quarter of 1993 show Japanese investors bought $10 billion in United States Government securities.
The yen's strength against the dollar is also viewed as inflationary because it makes Japanese imports more expensive in the United States. That, in turn, gives American manufacturers more leeway in raising prices at home, analysts said.
Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said the danger of Japanese investors selling dollar-denominated securities looked less ominous even though the market remained concerned.
"Most people are coming to the consensus that it would be hard for a strong yen to be sustained over a period of time," Mr. Alexy said. "This is not a change in fundamental outlook in the world currency market. It is more about yen strength, than the dollar weakness."
A country's currency is a reflection of its economic strength, he noted, and "presently, our economy is further along than theirs."
"Trading was firm," said David A. Ader, a managing analyst at the Technical Data division of Thomson Financial Services. "But like the half glass of water, its performance depended on how you looked at it," he said. "Is it half full? Or is it half empty?" He said it was remarkable that trading had stayed in a narrow range while going through a series of significant events, including an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, the government's record quarterly borrowing, the Producer Price Index and the rise of the yen. "Despite all that, the market is still holding to its tight range," Mr Ader said, "with the yield of the 30-year bond having moved about 15 basis points." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Ader said recent trading had been dominated by professional traders who are only jockeying for position. Investors who moved to the sidelines weeks ago are waiting for Wall Street to define the market's trend.
The Government reported yesterday that industrial production climbed in January for the eighth consecutive month despite the limiting effects of severe winter weather in the East and by the California earthquake. Overall capacity rose to 83.1 percent.
 
Corporate Bonds
 In the corporate debt market, a $250 million sale of 10-year notes by Colombia marked the first time a Latin American country had sold investment-grade debt in the United States market.
The offering may be a sign that Latin American economies have reversed their misfortunes of the 1980's, when many were heavily leveraged.
David L. Roberts, an analyst with the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company, said Colombia was virtually the only Latin American country to meet all its scheduled debt payments in the 1980's. He said the successful sale of this issue would bring other Latin American countries into the United States market.
Traders outside the underwriting group, which was led by Merrill Lynch, said the issue was well received and quickly sold. The issue was given a 7.25 percent coupon and priced at 99.196, to yield 7.365 percent, or about 148 basis points more than a Treasury issue with a like maturity.
The noncallable note is rated Ba-1 by Moody's Investors Service, BBB- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation and BBB by Duff & Phelps.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Yen, But Fall Is Seen Resuming

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen yesterday after plunging to a six-month low on Monday amid fears of a possible trade war between the United States and Japan.
"There is some sentiment that it was a little overdone," Hillel Waxman, a vice president at Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York, said of the dollar selloff on Monday. 
 The dollar crashed to an intraday low of 101.20 yen on Monday and ended trading in New York at 102.25 yen. It recovered yesterday, rising to 103.85 yen, as traders took profits on the soaring yen. But many dealers believe the dollar still is set for a test of the 100-yen level.
 
 
Support From Bank of Japan
 The dollar apparently received considerable support yesterday from the Bank of Japan, which reportedly spent nearly $1 billion buying dollars and selling yen in an effort to halt the Japanese currrency's surge.
Dealers said the currency markets were jittery ahead of an afternoon statement by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, on American retaliation against Japan for violating its promise on opening its cellular telephone market.
But the statement, when it came, did little to alleviate worries that the United States might still use the exchange rate as a lever to exact trade concessions from Japan. Mr. Kantor said only that the White House would announce proposed retaliatory measures against Japan in 30 days.
"People were looking for the Administration to come out with something concrete," said Peter Carruthers, an analyst at Credit Suisse. In the absence of firm talk of sanctions, traders believe the United States will resort to talking the dollar lower against the yen, he said.
A lower dollar would cut the cost of American goods in Japan and make Japanese goods in the United States more expensive.
The dollar also received support from comments by a a Federal Reserve governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., who said American inflation remained too high and must be brought down. The remarks encouraged dealers to buy dollars against other currencies on the premise that the Fed might raise rates again soon. Higher American interest rates make dollar-based assets relatively more attractive than foreign investments.
The dollar finished at 1.7283 German marks in New York trading, up from 1.7240 on Monday. The British pound fell to $1.4755 in New York, from $1.4865 on Monday.
Meanwhile, gold prices slipped, with gold for April delivery falling 10 cents, to $385.80 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Up In January

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The nation's industrial output climbed for the eighth consecutive month in January despite severe weather, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
Factories ran at their highest operating rates in four and a half years last month, the Fed said. Total industrial production in January rose by five-tenths of 1 percent, lower than a revised gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in December but enough to keep going a string of monthly increases that began in mid-1993. 
 "These are really solid numbers despite the cold and show the underlying momentum in economic growth carrying into early 1994 from early 1993," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York.
 
 
Steady Monthly Increases
 The economy surged in late 1992 but then lost strength in early 1993. But steady monthly rises in industrial production from last June through January strongly suggest the pattern will not be repeated this year.
In January, factories ran at 83.1 percent of their maximum capacity, up from 82.9 percent in December and the highest rate since 83.2 percent in August 1989.
Mr. Jones said the capacity number suggested that price pressures would gradually accelerate in coming months as companies seek higher profits. Raw materials will become more expensive, and businesses must start hiring soon instead of relying on overtime as they strain to meet demand.
"I think businesses are eager to test the markets on prices," Mr. Jones said, "They've gone about as far as they can on every variety of cost-cutting."
Industry would have produced goods at an even faster clip last month if the weather had been better.
The Fed said a series of crippling East Coast storms in January, coupled with the devastating California earthquake, held growth in output at manufacturing plants at two-tenths of a percent, compared with an average monthly advance of nine-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. .
"Steel, appliances and motor vehicles and parts were among the industries with the most significant disruptions," the Fed said. Many auto makers shut down assembly lines for a day or more because employees could not get to work.
But production increased at mines, and output soared at gas- and electricity-producing industries to meet strong residential demand.
The National Association of Manufacturers said a boom in computers and new production equipment added to the buoyancy in industrial output.
A separate Federal Reserve System survey showed rising loan demand from companies of all sizes in January.
The Fed survey of 77 American and foreign-owned banks reported a significant increase in companies and individuals seeking loans since November.

HEADLINE: Inflated Worries?;
Fed Is on the Case, but the Markets Give Hints of a Message Misread

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Inflation, Wall Street would have us believe, is not good for brokers, bond traders and other living things. Why, then, did blue-chip shares take their biggest one-day drop in two years on news that the Federal Reserve was nudging up interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against the dread condition? And why, two weeks later, despite repeated assurances from the economics establishment that inflation is nowhere in sight, do professional investors wait with bated breath for the dribs and drabs of price data released periodically by Washington?
One answer is that after three years of benign neglect of prices and another year of words without deeds, even the delicate squeeze on credit signaled by the Fed was bound to shock. "The move was a surprise in its timing" if not its direction, concluded Lesley Daniels Webster, a securities trader and economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland. 
 Another answer is that subtle messages can be misinterpreted easily. In spite of copious evidence that inflation is under control, the very fact that times have looked so good on Wall Street for so long may be bringing out the pessimists. "Perhaps the bond traders said, 'Gee, maybe the inflation threat is worse than we thought,' " Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, speculated.
The other possibility -- by far the most important to Americans who don't make a living trading securities -- is that the Fed is breaking the bad news gently. If that is indeed the case, said David Hale, an economist at the Kemper Financial Group, "this was only the first step in a continuing process" of tightening money and credit.
The Federal Reserve can influence interest rates on everything from A.T.& T.'s multibillion-dollar debt to Joe Sixpack's mortgage in a variety of ways. The way it chose this time was the most delicate and most common: a change in the Federal funds rate (the rate big banks pay to borrow one day at a time) brought about by the sale or purchase of Government securities from the public.
College sophomores are taught that the value of corporate shares is largely a product of expected future earnings to which the owners are entitled -- an expectation that might go up or down on news of higher interest rates. But day-to-day changes in stock prices are apparently dominated by a combination of psychology and the supply of loose savings looking for a profitable home. And from this perspective the Fed's move was unambiguously bad news.
Mr. Steinberg points out that the grand surge in stock prices over the last few years has been powered by savers -- mostly pension and mutual funds -- who were unwilling to settle for the 3 or 4 percent interest from money market funds and insured bank deposits. Hence an increase in interest rates, especially one that might presage more increases, made bank deposits a little more attractive and stocks a little less.
The impact on bond prices is more of a puzzle. Those who lend their money for 20 or 30 years in return for a fixed semiannual payment have every reason to remain vigilant of future inflation. There is hardly a greater nightmare for investors, after all, than being stuck earning, say, 6 percent interest for decades when prices are escalating at 15 percent. Why then, Mr. Steinberg asks, didn't the bond market say "thank you" when the Fed reminded Wall Street that it was not asleep at the inflation switch?
Ms. Daniels Webster points to the sort of day-to-day factors that influenced the stock market. The Fed's announcement, she notes, came just a week before the auction of some $40 billion in bonds. And any surprise, any news from the Fed that makes the plausible range of future interest rates less certain, is likely to make bond buyers more cautious in the short run.
"It's John Maynard Keynes's old story," said Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale who specializes in the psychology of markets. "The price of securities is what people think other people think they should be." (Ponder that one at the risk of a headache.)
All this might suggest that however great the immediate shock, the Fed's action and the securities' markets reaction was nothing more than the sort of "midcourse correction" that economists, not to mention journalists, pontificate about when they have nothing much to say. But there is the more daunting possibility that inflation is a clearer and more present danger than the consensus soothsayers have been forecasting.
On the one hand, Mr. Hale pointed out, there is little objective evidence that inflation is a significant threat. "We still have a weak world economy," he noted, one in which Americans' rising demand for, say, autos, can be met easily with imports. Equally important, the remarkable 6 percent growth rate of the last quarter of 1993 was accomplished without a surge in hiring or pressure on wages -- a fact that Mr. Hale interprets as evidence that the economy's underlying capacity to produce more goods with less capital and labor is greater than believed in recent years.
 
Some Disquieting Signs
 On the other, Mr. Hale detects disquieting signs in the prices of a handful of industrial commodities and increased investor interest in stocks like mining companies that could serve as a hedge against inflation. And at least in some minds, January's four-tenths of a percent uptick in the underlying prices that businesses charge other businesses carries the same message: Consumer prices are almost certain to grow more rapidly, suggesting that yesterday's 3 percent inflation may become tomorrow's 5 percent inflation.
Mr. Hale said he thought the Fed would lean more firmly against the wind if the economy continued to grow faster than the 2.5 to 3 percent consensus view of growth in long-term productive capacity. The quarter-point increase in interest rates will be followed by more of same that, he said, could raise the cost of borrowing by a full percentage point by the end of the year.
Predicting the behavior of the Federal Reserve is almost as rash an exercise as predicting the behavior of the economy. Still, many Fed watchers see the Fed's move as "the beginning of the end of cheap money," as Barron's magazine recently put it. Though producer prices in January remained moderate, many economists predict that at some point they will kick up a bit in response to strong demand -- and that the Fed will ratchet up rates still further.
That would be bad news or good news, depending on whose shoes fit. Mortgage and car payments would indeed go up, and businesses that borrow heavily would feel the pinch a bit. But it would mean higher bank rates for those living on savings. More important, it would reinforce the self-fulfilling sense that strong economic growth is here to stay, that the long period of three steps forward and two steps back that cost millions of Americans (including George Bush) their jobs, is finally over.

HEADLINE: Demand Up For Loans

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Loan demand rose and banks were more willing to lend in January as the economy improved, according to a Federal Reserve survey released today.
"The survey results again showed an easing of terms and standards on loans to businesses and households by a significant proportion of respondents," said the Fed, which conducted a similar survey in November. "A significant number of respondents reported an increase in credit demand over the past three months." 
 The survey of senior loan officers at 59 United States banks and 18 branches of foreign banks found that demand for commercial and industrial loans was up sharply from November. All sizes of companies were seeking credit, the Fed said.
In response, banks eased their qualifications for commercial and industrial loans, although standards for commercial real estate loans were unchanged from November. Consumer loans also were easier to get.
Bankers were more willing to make business loans mainly because of the brighter economic outlook and growing competition from other banks. Weak demand in their home countries made a few foreign banks more eager to lend in the United States.

HEADLINE: A Classic Chardonnay Returns to New York

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
THE chardonnay of Hanzell Vineyards, one of the most influential producers in California's wine-making history, is staging a comeback in the New York region.
The 37-year-old Sonoma County boutique winery, famed for powerful chardonnays that age as long and as well as the best white Burgundies, is aggressively placing its delicious 1991 chardonnay in stores and restaurants. 
 "I haven't seen Hanzell for years," said Michael Aaron, president of Sherry-Lehmann, the Manhattan wine store. "It's the granddaddy of them all, but it has become a forgotten vineyard."
Bob Sessions, Hanzell's wine maker and general manager since 1973, said that the winery, resting on its laurels, paid little attention to changes in the New York market and let the brand virtually vanish here.
In the affluent 80's, Hanzell chardonnay that was not sold to mailing-list customers was rationed nationwide to shops and restaurants and was hard to find. The 90's economic crunch, making sales harder, forced Hanzell to join a sales consortium with four other small producers, and it took on a new distributor.
Hanzell, which produced its first commercial vintage in 1957, is generally credited with introducing modern chardonnay-making techniques in California. Its founder, James D. Zellerbach, popularized the use of small oak barrels for aging wines. He was also the first California producer to use temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks to ferment chardonnay grapes and to use nitrogen, a preservative, when bottling his wines.
His first wine maker, Ralph Bradford Webb, carried out seminal experiments with secondary fermentation (technically called malolactic fermentation), which adds depth and smooth texture to wine.
 "Today, most chardonnay making in California is Burgundian, with heavy use of barrel-fermentation and aging in new barrels," said Mr. Sessions, who joined Hanzell in 1973 and has barely modified its style. Mr. Sessions uses a modified Burgundian approach: only 10 percent of the grapes are barrel fermented, although everything is barrel aged for at least a year. But he works with a lighter hand than many colleagues.
"Our emphasis is in bringing the chardonnay fruit into the wine rather than having a heavy barrel presence," he said. "We do have a wood presence, but it is in the background."
That was plain in a tasting of the 1966, '71, '74, '78, '81, '85, '90 and '91 chardonnays last week. A defining theme shone through all of them: rich, mouth-filling fruitiness; subtle flavors; smoothness; balance, long aftertaste -- in short, elegance. (Always made from very ripe grapes, these whites have high, but not intrusive, alcohol levels: 14.5 percent in the 1991.)
"I've not tasted California chardonnays that have aged so gracefully," said Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at the Montrachet restaurant in Manhattan, who sampled the series. "I can't get over how fresh the old ones are."
He put the '91 on the wine list at the restaurant at $55 a bottle.
Mr. Sessions said, "I like to drink my chardonnays between 8 and 15 years after the vintage." At a minimum, he added, consumers should uncork them four to six years after the vintage. The jury is still out on the ageability of many of today's California chardonnays, because many wineries are too young to have established a record.
The Hanzell winery is an architectural gem. It was built by the late Mr. Zellerbach, president of Crown Zellerbach, the giant forest products company, and Ambassador to Italy in the Eisenhower Administration. He was a devotee of the great Montrachet wines from Burgundy's Cote d'Or; the facade of his winery replicates the face of a building at the historic Clos de Vougeot vineyard in Burgundy.
With new plantings, the estate, now owned by a young Englishman, projects an output of 2,000 cases of chardonnay annually, beginning with this year's harvest.
Because of high production costs, Hanzell chardonnays have always been expensive. The New York distributor, Lauber Imports, has priced the '91 at $32 a bottle in stores; in restaurants, with their markups, it sells for even more.
In Manhattan, Crossroads is discounting the '91 chardonnay at $26. The wine will be around $30 at Sherry-Lehmann and Ambassador Wines and Spirits, as well as at Liquorama Wine Cellars in Hyde Park, N.Y.; Home Liquors in Verona, N.J., and Shoppers Discount Liquors in Madison, N.J.

HEADLINE: Forecast Warns Of Inflation Clouds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Fed Goes for Overkill" (Op-Ed, Feb. 8), James K. Galbraith maintains there is no justification for the quarter-point boost in short-term interest rates announced by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, "to forestall an inflationary threat that all agree has not appeared." I do not agree. 
 Professor Galbraith is looking in the rear-view mirror. Past movements in inflation are not a reliable guide to imminent cyclical turns in inflation. Far more reliable is a series of leading inflation indicators that have individually and collectively had a stellar record in predicting cyclical turning points in inflation.
For example, in January commodity price inflation rose sharply; the percentage of purchasing managers reporting higher prices jumped from 51 percent to 60 percent; the percentage of these same managers reporting slower deliveries -- a sign of tightening supply lines -- also rose significantly, and the ratio of employment to population headed upward.
In addition, the percentage of those in business who are expecting higher selling prices rose in the last quarter. Also, import prices, which were declining in the early part of last year, are now rising, and so as well is the growth rate of total Federal and non-Federal debt.
These indicators are all components of the leading inflation index, which was developed by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research. This index, which has had an extraordinarily reliable record in forecasting upturns and downturns in inflation, rose sharply last month, and it is growing at its fastest pace in eight years.
Therefore, it is fallacious for Professor Galbraith to maintain that there is no justification for the Fed's minuscule rise in interest rates. There are early warning signs of a cyclical upswing in inflation.
Indeed, if the tentative signal given by our leading inflation index is confirmed by subsequent data, we can expect inflation to start rising later this year.

As you note, the proposed trolley would connect major destinations from the United Nations to the Javits Convention Center and would be "faster, cheaper, cleaner" than current transportation options. 
 We agree that midtown Manhattan needs improved transportation if it is to continue to serve as the center of our region's enormous economy. We too strongly advocate creation of the proposed trolley line. But the current proposal contains the potential for an even greater vision for the center of Manhattan and the region.
Instead of terminating at the Convention Center, the trolley could run down the waterfront along the planned Hudson River Esplanade, turn back into Manhattan and travel to Herald Square, where it would turn up Broadway toward Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center.
This route would connect Pennsylvania Station, Herald Square, Times Square, Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center to the major tourist sites and destinations on 42d Street. It would unify the core of Manhattan, physically and visually integrating pedestrian and surface transit circulation through a unifying civic design. Additionally, it would reduce traffic on Broadway and would also ease gridlock at Herald and Times Squares.
The proposal also makes great sense for commuters. It would better connect Grand Central, the Port Authority, Pennsylvania Station and PATH. It would also accommodate an increase in the number of New Jersey commuters using ferries to get to the west side of Manhattan.
The 42d Street light-rail proposal opens the door to improvements for the entire region. It should be approved now, so we can begin creating a stronger and more confident midtown as the center of a stronger region.

HEADLINE: REPORT TO CLINTON SEES VAST EXTENT OF HOMELESSNESS

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A draft of the Administration's plan to end homelessness says the problem is "far larger than commonly thought" and calls for spending large, though unspecified, new sums on housing, mental health and tax credit programs.
The plan was ordered last spring by President Clinton and drafted by an interagency group headed by three Cabinet Secretaries. It represents a departure from a 12-year standoff between advocates for the homeless and Government officials about the scope and cause of homelessness. 
 If the draft is embraced by President Clinton, it would mark the first time the Government has called homelessness a large-scale problem that demands a large Federal response.
In what advocates for homeless people called an effort to minimize the scope of the problem, Republican Administrations had said that about 600,000 Americans were homeless on any given night, with the majority suffering from drugs, drink or mental illness. The Administration's report, by contrast, endorses recent estimates that as many as seven million Americans were homeless at some point in the late 1980's.
 
Chronic and Complex
 And while the report agrees that drugs and mental illness are common among the homeless, it also argues that poverty, racism and past budget cuts are pushing many families into the ranks of the dispossessed.
"Homelessness has become a structural problem in America: chronic, continuous, large scale, complex," said Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and chairman of the group drafting the plan.
The vice chairmen are Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Jesse Brown, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Cisneros agreed to discuss the plan today after an official from another agency provided a copy of the draft report to The New York Times.
The report is under review by the Office of Management and Budget and other White House officials, who may revise it at a meeting on Thursday before passing it on to the President.
Administration officials conducted extensive consultations with local governments, academic experts and advocacy groups, many of whom are giving the draft high marks for its analysis of the problem.
"It doesn't just talk about mental illness and substance abuse, it also talks about housing and poverty and racism," said Fred Karnas, director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. "It really does say what we've been trying to say for a long time."
The draft, titled "Priority: Home! The Federal Plan to End Homelessness," does not specify the amount of new spending needed to solve the problem. But it said the Department of Housing and Urban Development would spend an additional $40 billion a year if its budget had kept pace with inflation since 1980. The department spends $25 billion a year.
"We should undertake an aggressive housing development program," the report said.
The report begs a question at the heart of the ambitious Clinton agenda: where will the money come from?
 
Middle-Class Subsidy
 This task force wants to increase spending on housing and programs to prevent homelessness. But the group drafting Mr. Clinton's welfare plan recently suggested cuts in some of the same programs, to provide new programs for people on welfare.
Mr. Cisneros, who is not involved in drafting the welfare plan, said he would oppose such cuts in housing assistance. "We will make that clear, that we shouldn't be working at cross purposes," he said.
The plan for dealing with homelessness raises a politically sensitive issue in noting that prosperous homeowners receive far more in housing subsidies than poor people do. The vehicle for the middle-class subsidy is the deduction of interest on home mortgages, which the plan said cost the Federal Treasury $41 billion last year.
Of that amount, the report said, 85 percent went to the most affluent quarter of American taxpayers, who earn more than $50,000 a year. The homelessness plan does not call for ending those subsidies, but it does argue that the Government is misdirecting its resources.
 
People at Risk
 The Clinton report says the emptying of mental hospitals and the rise of crack abuse have contributed to homelessness. But it also talks about the decline in public assistance payments, which leave many women on welfare unable to afford rents, and the decline in wages for working Americans without high school educations.
"It's remarkable, in contrast to the Reagan and Bush years, in its recognition of the scope and complexity of the homeless problem," said Martha Burt, an analyst with the Urban Institute.
The plan, which was largely written by Andrew M. Cuomo, an assistant housing secretary, differentiates between two pools of people at risk of homelessness. The smaller but more visible pool, it says, are the addicts or mentally ill, many of whom inhabit public places.
The larger, but often hidden group, it says, are those suffering from chronic poverty, who can be plunged into homelessness by a sudden crisis, like a fight with a family member.
As a result, the plan recommends "increasing H.U.D.'s housing assistance budget to make up for past budget cuts." It also suggests including housing costs when figuring the tax credits alloted to low-income workers.
That potentially expensive provision, a back-door way of expanding housing assistance, has not been reviewed by the White House budget office.
The plan also calls for a sweeping reorganization of the main Federal spending program for homeless people, the McKinney Act. It calls for services to homeless people to be delivered by nonprofit groups, rather than Federal or local governments.
And it recommends expanding programs for the mentally ill, including aggressive efforts at "outreach efforts" to get disturbed people into treatment.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Delay Work Permits For Immigrants Who Seek Asylum

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they plan to charge people seeking political asylum a $130 fee and to delay issuing work permits for 150 days to try to to deter new applicants and cut the backlog of asylum claims.
The fees would make the United States the only nation in the world to charge an application fee for people who contend that they are fleeing persecution in their homelands, according to the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. 
 The Deputy Immigration Commissioner, Chris Sale, who described the proposed changes, said current asylum procedures were "encouraging people to abuse the system."
Existing procedures generally make it easy for immigrants to apply for asylum but place them in a legal no-man's-land awaiting hearings. Ms. Sale said the long delays in the system were also "damaging the bona fide candidates" for protection under the asylum laws.
Ms. Sale said that a work permit was a prize sought by fraudulent asylum-seekers and that delaying the permit would deter the fraud. Immigration officials say they expect word of the fees and the work-permit delays to go out on a global grapevine, slowing the flood of new asylum applicants.
Without a work permit, asylum applicants who wish to live within the law must depend on a fragile network of church groups, family or friends, since they are not entitled to welfare or any other Government assistance.
The filing fees would help pay for a proposed doubling of the corps of 150 asylum officers. The fledgling asylum corps now faces a backlog of 364,000 asylum applications. The backlog has been growing at a rate of 10,000 a month. The immigration service said that last year 18,110 claims were denied and 5,105 were approved.
Advocates of immigrants' rights applauded the agency's effort to increase the asylum corps and ease the officers' administrative burdens. But they said filing fees and restrictions on work permits were the wrong ways to combat fraud and would unfairly penalize tens of thousands of legitimate asylum-seekers.
"To wait six months for a work permit -- how will they survive?" asked Jeanne Butterfield of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
Critics who seek a far more restrictive asylum policy derided the proposed measures as mere tinkering.
 
Right to Political Asylum
 "So long as you permit anyone to invoke the asylum process simply by getting to the United States, any administrative change is doomed to failure," said Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports legislation pending in Congress that would summarily reject most asylum applicants now arriving at airports or border stations.
The right to political asylum is guaranteed under international law and treaties signed by the United States. Under Federal law, political asylum can be granted to an alien who can prove that he or she has been the victim of persecution or has "a well-founded fear" of persecution on the basis of race, religion, political belief or membership in a particular organization.
Last year, 150,386 people from 154 nations sought political asylum in the United States. Most came from places like Guatemala, El Salvador, the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Haiti and Liberia, nations not noted for their respect for human rights.
Tens of thousands of the applicants were really fleeing persecution, but tens of thousands clearly sought to abuse the asylum system, immigration officials say.
Under the law, most were allowed into the United States immediately, physically on free soil, but legally without a country. By invoking a claim of asylum, they were generally free to enter; most could receive a work permit within 90 days, immigration officials and lawyers say. But because of the backup in the asylum system, more than half had no foreseeable hope that their claims would be resolved.
 
Cases of Fraud
 Many applicants could use their work permits to buy phony driver's licenses, invent identities and disappear into the underground economy. Those caught at an airport with phony travel documents and no credible claim for asylum are generally detained and deported; in such cases the airline they flew in on often bore the cost of their return.
The American asylum system was altered three years ago to do away with cold-war procedures that granted protection almost exclusively to those fleeing Communism. The backlog of asylum applications that the Clinton Administration inherited included tens of thousands of people whom Federal judges found had been denied due process in the 1980's.
But the new system received little money from Congress. The asylum corps, far smaller than its counterparts in Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Holland, Norway, Sweden or Switzerland, survives on fees raised by other immigration programs.
Its top officers say it cannot cope with the growing numbers of legitimate and illegitimate asylum-seekers; nor can it readily distinguish the victims of political terror from the potential terrorist.
"The system in the past year and a half has just collapsed under its own weight," said Carol Wolchok, director of the American Bar Association's center for immigration law. She said the immigration service needed millions of dollars to increase, train and equip the asylum corps.
A working corps would insure a quick, full hearing for all asylum applicants, she said, adding that this would be both a deterrent to fraud and the fairest way to deal with genuine asylum applicants, she said.
"Once it's in place, there will be a dramatic drop in false claims," she said. "The system would be used by the people it's intended for."
The new filing fees and work-permit strictures proposed by the immigration service are to be published soon in the Federal Register, the digest of proposed Government rules, and could take effect as early as Oct. 1. It is unclear under what procedures the agency might waive a filing fee or grant a work permit more speedily.
If Ms. Sale is correct, the new rules would deter thousands of fraudulent asylum seekers and lighten asylum officers' burdens. But if proponents of stricter laws are right, they will do little to control false claims. And if immigrants' advocates are correct, they could force asylum applicants, who cannot receive welfare or other Government assistance, to work illegally or go hungry while they wait for an overburdened system to notify them that their day for a hearing has arrived.

HEADLINE: SAUDI AIR TO BUY $6 BILLION IN JETS BUILT IN THE U.S.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
After intense lobbying by President Clinton and his top advisers, the Administration announced today that Saudi Arabia had decided to replace its fleet of commercial jets with American planes. The $6 billion sale should provide jobs for tens of thousands of Americans.
Announcing the decision at the White House with Saudi Arabia's Ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, by his side, President Clinton said the sale was an example of how his Administration intended to campaign for contracts for United States businesses as ferociously as European and Asian governments have done for theirs. 
 The yearlong competition for the contract for some 50 planes for Saudia Airlines was one of the biggest global business contests in a decade, pitting the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation against the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
 
'A Gold Medal'
 The Europeans had urged Saudi Arabia to split the deal at least 50-50, but under heavy pressure from the United States, King Fahd threw all the business Washington's way.
Mr. Clinton, who had lobbied King Fahd for months with phone calls and letters, sounded today like a victorious commander just back from the trade wars. Evoking the Olympics, Mr. Clinton declared the agreement "a gold medal win for America's businesses and workers."
What won the Saudis over, American officials said, was a combination of financing provided by the Export-Import Bank and Washington's position as Saudi Arabia's principal arms supplier. Riyadh thus has an interest in maintaining the health of the United States aerospace industry.
Indeed, the $6 billion contract will temporarily resuscitate the aerospace industry. [Business Day, page D1.]
 
The Ties That Sell
 For Saudi Arabia, which is flanked by two dangerous foes, Iran and Iraq, the deal is like buying insurance: It strengthens the economic bond between Riyadh and Washington and improves the chances that the Clinton Administration would come to the kingdom's defense, just as the Bush Administration built a allied coalition against Iraq in the gulf war.
Prince Bandar alluded to this, saying Saudi Arabia felt a responsibility to be "a strategic asset and not a strategic liability" for the United States. Thus, he said, Riyadh is ready to share the burden of maintaining the quality of the United States aerospace industry.
Mr. Clinton said the Export-Import Bank, a Government institution that helps to finance United States exports, was prepared to guarantee financing for most of the total cost of the planes. This, he said, will support "tens of thousands of American jobs in Washington, California, Kansas, Missouri, Utah, Arkansas and several other states." The Administration estimates that every $1 billion in exports creates or maintains about 20,000 jobs.
 
A Big Guarantee
 It is not clear how much of the loan guarantees Saudi Arabia and their United States suppliers will use. The bank is ready to guarantee up to $6.2 billion of the final price, which may include extras like service contracts. If the Saudis and the two companies take the full amount, it will be the biggest loan guarantee ever by the bank.
The bank stepped in last July when it became apparent that Airbus Industrie was offering government-backed financing from its members -- Spain, France, Britain and Germany.
The bank guarantees repayment of commercial loans that Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Saudi Arabia might need to complete the contract. This guarantee lowers the interest rates commercial banks would normally charge. There is virtually no cost to the American taxpayer unless Saudi Arabia should default, which is unlikely.
 
A Shift in Emphasis
 Saudi Arabia has had some economic problems, however, brought on by a drop in oil exports because of a worldwide glut, a fall in oil prices and years of heavy spending that has eroded its cash reserves.
Though other Administrations have lobbied foreign governments on behalf of big exporters, the focus was usually on arms sales. With the arms trade shrinking and exports now playing a more vital role in the United States economy, the Administration has taken a higher profile in such efforts.
Saudi Arabia has invited Boeing and McDonnell Douglas officials to Riyadh on March 20 to negotiate the final details of which planes are wanted and at which price. United States officials say they expect the Saudis to split their business evenly, buying about $3 billion worth of 747's from Boeing and $3 billion worth of the 300-passenger MD-11's and smaller MD-80's and MD-90's from McDonnell Douglas. Boeing is based in Seattle, McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, Calif.
 
A Chat in the Oval Office
 Given Saudi Arabia's cash-flow problems, delivery of the jets could be stretched out over the rest of the decade. The contracts will also benefit the Pratt & Whitney division of the United Technologies Corporation in Connecticut and the General Electric Company in Ohio, which build engines for the planes.
The deal began to come together in July when Prince Bandar was brought to the Oval Office to hear a personal sales pitch from the President. Mr. Clinton, aides said, told the Ambassador that the deal would be critical in helping both the aerospace industry and the United States economy.
A month later, Mr. Clinton telephoned King Fahd and made the same pitch.
In August, King Fahd tentatively promised Mr. Clinton that he would give the United States his business, and news to that effect leaked out. But it was not confirmed by Riyadh, and it turned out to be only the beginning.
 
What the King Wanted
 King Fahd first wanted a commitment from the Export-Import Bank, which he soon received. Then, the King asked for time to work through some of Saudi Arabia's financial problems and to deal with the Europeans.
It was not until Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France visited Riyadh in December, on a sales trip of his own, that King Fahd finally told him that Airbus Industrie would get nothing. United States officials believe the Saudis were miffed at efforts by France to improve ties with Iraq.
But the Saudis still would not complete the deal until Washington worked out an agreement to reschedule $9.2 billion in payments due for Saudi arms purchases from five United States companies. The Saudis said falling oil prices had forced them to slash annual spending by 20 percent and they needed to stretch out their payments, primarily for 72 F-15 fighter jets, which are made by McDonnell Douglas. That deal was completed two weeks ago.
The chairmen of the two companies, Frank A. Shrontz of Boeing and John F. McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas, also attended today's ceremony. In a bit of understatement about the pressure behind the scenes, Mr. Shrontz said, "I'd like to thank you and your Administration, Mr. President, for helping to communicate to our customers the importance of this transaction."

HEADLINE: With New Republican Allies, Cuomo Pushes Medicaid Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo renewed his push today for a complex plan to ease the large and growing costs of Medicaid on New York City and county governments and offered to sweeten the deal with more money sooner from the state.
Mr. Cuomo said an improving economy would give the state unexpected revenues, allowing it to give New York City and the 57 other county governments a total of $110 million in the state's fiscal year, which begins on April 1. That would be a small fraction of the $3.4 billion that those governments are expected to spend on Medicaid in the coming fiscal year. 
 Mr. Cuomo said that two-thirds of the $110 million, or about $73 million, would go to New York City, which is looking for $265 million in state aid to help close a projected gap of $2.3 billion in its budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
 
Rising Burden on Counties
 New York is one of the few states that require local governments to pay a share of the cost of Medicaid, the federally mandated health insurance program for the poor. The program's rising cost has become a huge financial burden on New York City and on many county governments, particularly during the recent economic downturn.
The broad strokes of the Cuomo plan, which the Governor has tried and failed before to get through the Legislature, call for the state to take over the local share of Medicaid over the next seven years while also taking some of the revenue produced by local income or sales taxes.
While they would have to give up some taxing power, local officials, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, generally favor the deal because most forecasts suggest that Medicaid costs will continue to climb faster than the revenues from taxes, so they will get more than they give up. But if that turns out to be wrong, the Governor's plan calls for the state to assume all the risk by promising never to take more tax revenue from local governments than it sends them in Medicaid relief.
In addition, the trading of taxes for Medicaid takeover would not begin for four years, so in the first three years the localities would gain help from the state at no cost.
Despite the considerable local support, the Republicans who control the State Senate have repeatedly blocked Mr. Cuomo's plan. But the situation has changed in two ways this year: The Governor has attracted the support of a group of influential local Republicans, led by Mr. Giuliani, and he proposed today for the first time to put up state money in the first year of the plan, sweetening the deal for localities.
The announcement by the Governor, a Democrat, was a significant tactical victory for the Mayor, a Republican, who had lobbied Mr. Cuomo aggressively to include the money in his budget for the 1995 fiscal year. It set the stage for a major test of Mr. Giuliani's influence with his fellow Republicans in the Senate, who had opposed Mr. Cuomo's earlier proposals. Mr. Giuliani's aides predicted today that it would be far more difficult for the Senate to reject a Medicaid takeover now that Mr. Cuomo essentially had put money up front to begin paying for it.
"The fact that there's money in now makes for a completely new chapter," said Robert M. Harding, Mr. Giuliani's lobbyist in Albany. "It automatically makes it legitimate for discussion."
It is far from certain today that the Legislature will agree with Mr. Cuomo's call to spend the new money on a state Medicaid takeover, rather than on other popular election-year programs like aid to schools, tax cuts, anti-crime efforts and jobs programs.
 
Cuomo Changes Course
 Leaders of both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-majority Senate refused to make commitments, saying only that they would consider a Medicaid takeover plan in coming budget negotiations along with other proposals.
The Governor's announcement reversed the course he set in his Jan. 18 executive budget proposal. That plan did not include money to finance a Medicaid takeover plan in the next fiscal year.
Mr. Cuomo has proposed a state Medicaid takeover every year since 1991. But under his past proposals, New York City and the county governments would have benefited financially only starting in the second year of a seven-year plan. What changed today is that they would profit in the first year, providing immediate budget relief for Mr. Giuliani and the state's county executives.
In a year when Mr. Cuomo is running for a fourth four-year term, the change was seen in Albany as a nod to local government leaders who have blamed Mr. Cuomo for forcing them to increase property taxes by cutting unrestricted state aid to cities, counties, villages and towns. Some legislators and lobbyists said the decision also seemed to be a direct appeal by Mr. Cuomo to Mr. Giuliani's supporters, including the moderate Republicans and Independents he may need to win in November.
 
Dinkins Got Less Help
 "I think he feels pressure so he's putting it out there," said the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan.o
But the Governor's announcement left some aides to former Mayor David N. Dinkins wondering why Mr. Dinkins did not receive the same financial help from his fellow Democrat, especially in the 1993 election year. "We were arguing vociferously for it from the day we got in office," said Norman Steisel, the former First Deputy Mayor.
Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference today that there was only one difference: "We have more money this year."
Mr. Cuomo argues that there are sensible reasons for what may seem a complex maneuver, whose financial benefit to localities could be achieved far more simply if the state just wrote a check to each one.
 
State Taxes Called Fairer
 But that would not give the state control of the $10 billion Medicaid program, which Mr. Cuomo argues is necessary to control costs truly. In structuring his takeover this way, Mr. Cuomo would get control of Medicaid but not have to bear the entire cost from current state revenue.
Mr. Cuomo also argues that the state's tax base, broader and more reliant on the progressive income tax, is fairer than the property taxes most localities use to support Medicaid.
Under Mr. Cuomo's seven-year plan, the state and local governments would work to reduce Medicaid costs during the first three years, largely by increasing the use of managed care programs by Medicaid patients. During that period the state also would begin to pay for local administrative costs for the Medicaid programs. The $110 million would be part of that.
In the last four years, the state would gradually begin to pick up the actual local share of Medicaid payments to health-care providers, while begining to collect local tax revenue from New York City and the counties.

HEADLINE: Storming the Snow In a Family Humvee;
Gulf War Car Wins Civilian Sales

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LITTLE FALLS, N.J., Feb. 15

 BODY:
It may be nearly as wide as a semitrailer truck, as heavy as two ordinary cars and as expensive as a modest home in some parts of the country. But in a car culture in love with four-wheel-drive vehicles, and in a winter that has often defeated conventional automobiles, it has been embraced by a devoted few as the thing to drive.
"I have five cars in my family," said Audray Baker of Flemington, N.J., "but this winter, it's the only one that can get up my driveway." 
 Mrs. Baker is one of a small but growing group of drivers who own Hummers, the big-shouldered, civilian version of the military's High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle -- the darling of the Persian Gulf war. At $50,000 apiece, seven feet wide and weighing three tons, Hummers -- the civilian version has been available for 18 months -- seat only four people and may strike some as laughably expensive and wildly impractical.
This winter, as the ice has followed the snow, time after time, Hummers have also gained a reputation as one car that will not get stuck, as well as being a sports-utility vehicle -- the fastest-growing segment of the car market -- that the neighbors are unlikely to have.
Which would help explain why Bob Greces, president of the Princeton Motorsport dealership in Lawrenceville, N.J., who normally sells just one Hummer per month, has sold six this month alone. Mr. Greces's two Hummer agencies -- the other is in Lyndhurst, N.J. -- are part of a chain of three outlets in the New York region for Hummers; the other is in Fairfield, Conn.
 
Winter Is Great for Sales
 "I would expect sales to be picking up anyway, now that the vehicle is getting established," Mr. Greces said, "but the weather this winter has just been terrific for sales."
Over all, AM General has sold about 1,000 Hummers since their introduction in the fall of 1992. Of those, 162 were sold nationwide by 36 dealers just last month, said Susan Carney, a spokeswoman for the manufacturer. AM General was originally part of the American Motors Company, which was in turn a descendant of the Willys Company, builder of the original World War II Army jeep. In addition to the Hummer, AM General builds heavy trucks for the military.
The United States military has been using the trucks, which they call Humvees, for nine years. It was during the gulf war that the blunt, desert-colored Humvees were in nearly every picture, introducing them to the country's automotive consciousness.
The war and its remembered glory got Joseph P. Gutilla on the telephone to the manufacturer as soon as production of the civilian version was announced. He wasn't fast enough to beat Arnold Schwarzenegger, however; the actor was at the top of the list for the first one. But Mr. Gutilla, who owns a trucking firm here, did manage to buy one of the first Hummers that year, and then traded it in for a new, red one this winter.
"I've been through a bunch of four-wheel-drive vehicles," Mr. Gutilla said, "but when I saw these things on TV during the gulf war, and being a vet myself, they made an impression on me. They're like the American spirit, and when people see them, it gives them that feeling again. It's nothing like driving a Range Rover."
To begin with, the Hummer on close inspection is nearly all wheels and motor. To achieve its 16-inch ground clearance under the chassis, the manufacturers have moved the engine and transmission into the passenger compartment. That leaves room for four bucket seats at each corner of the interior, with the engine and transmission housing extending front to back, rather like a refrigerator laid between the seats.
Sharing the inside of a car with a big hump for the motor and transmission was hardly a problem for the military, which likes its machine guns and anti-tank weapons mounted high enough for a clear line of fire anyway. For Mrs. Baker, however, there was some trepidation about buying when she realized that the vehicle's roomy outward appearance camouflaged very limited interior passenger room. Still, her four grown sons prevailed on her to consider a Hummer as a replacement for the family Isuzu Trooper.
 
Growls but Likes Puppies
 "At first I was surprised, because you expect something that wide to have loads of room to seat people," she said. "I thought, 'This is going to be a problem.' But I found you can still stuff groceries and bags and puppies in there."
The Hummer's diesel engine growls but is not obtrusive. And with automatic transmissions, power steering and brakes, along with such modern necessities as air conditioning and stereo sound systems, the Hummer is, except for its width, like any other car to drive. Among its several unusual features is a central tire inflation system that allows the driver to lower tire pressure for driving on sand, and then to re-inflate the tires while driving.
"It feels very safe to me," said Mrs. Baker, who commutes daily to a nighttime nursing job in her Hummer.
In fact, Mr. Gutilla pointed out, in last week's snowstorm the only problem he had in his Hummer was getting around stuck cars. The problem was easily solved. He had only to mount an old truck tire in front of his Hummer, and help the others get on their way.

HEADLINE: Saudi Sale Should Brighten Aircraft Makers' Dark Days

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's decision today to purchase $6 billion in commercial aircraft from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Boeing Company will temporarily revive an industry facing one of its worst downturns.
The deal is expected to increase sluggish production at McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, the country's two biggest plane builders, and to preserve thousands of jobs at the companies and their subcontractors. 
 But the deal is not expected to dramatically improve the broad economies of the Seattle or Los Angeles-Long Beach areas, where the two manufacturers have big plants.
McDonnell and Boeing won the contract over the European consortium Airbus Industrie, amid heavy lobbying by the Clinton Administration. President Clinton announced the deal in Washington today, saying it would sustain jobs for tens of thousands of Americans.
Company officials and economists said that it was too early to know if the aircraft order would create new jobs, but that at a minimum, it would let McDonnell Douglas and Boeing avoid near-term layoffs.
Specifics of the sale were not released and were expected to be negotiated at a meeting next month among Boeing, McDonnell and Saudi officials to determine the number and type of planes to be bought.
American trade officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the Saudis were likely to buy 50 to 60 aircraft and that 60 percent of the $6 billion was expected to go to McDonnell Douglas.
While officials of the companies declined to say what the Saudi sale would mean to the companies' overall finances, some analysts predicted that it would increase their revenues about 10 percent a year over a two- to three-year delivery period.
The Saudi deal is likely to mean more to St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest military supplier, whose commercial aircraft division has been struggling. McDonnell's commercial jet unit, based in Long Beach, has had few new orders for planes in recent years. Its manufacturing costs are high, and it does not have the money to develop jets.
Many aircraft-industry analysts have questioned whether McDonnell Douglas can sustain production with so few orders, and some industry experts have predicted that the company will quit the commercial aircraft business sometime this decade -- an assertion McDonnell dismisses.
McDonnell Douglas officials said today that the Saudi order would stabilize employment at its commercial division and throughout its network of suppliers. The company has reduced its commercial aircraft work force to 11,000 employees from a peak of 42,000 in 1990.
 
Two Approving Views
 Don Hanson, a McDonnell spokesman, said the Saudi deal was a "very important milestone because it will help to fill a lot of gaps in production lines in the years ahead."
An analyst for Paine Webber, Jack Modzelewski, also applauded the deal. "This deal was critical for McDonnell Douglas's survival," he said. "They have no new products in development, no partnership as of yet, and very few orders. They are on a life-support system."
Economists said that while the Saudi deal might not have an immediate effect on the Southern California economy, they expected it to stem the loss of jobs in the long term, particularly because many Boeing and McDonnell subcontractors are situated in the region. For example, Rohr Industries, which makes the pylons for McDonnell's MD-11, is based in San Diego, and the Northrop Corporation, based in Los Angeles, makes the fuselage for the Boeing 747.
Lynn Reaser, chief economist for First Interstate Bank, said that "because we are still on a downward trend in terms of defense cuts, the net effect of the Saudi deal will be to help balance things out -- to offset some of the job losses and economic losses that are coming."
Commercial aircraft jobs have dropped 40 percent in Los Angeles County, to 74,000 now from a peak of 126,000 jobs in 1987. The manufacturers are getting scant help from passenger airlines, most of which are ordering few jets these days.
Shares of McDonnell Douglas closed today at $118.875, up $1.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing's shares finished the day at $46.50, up $2.125.
Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice president for planning and international development, said he expected the Saudis to order several Boeing 747 jets, but did not know if they would also buy the 777 or other new models.
In Seattle, economists said that the Saudi deal might end Boeing's layoffs, which have kept the region in an economic rut. Last year, Boeing reduced its work force to 87,160 employees from 98,325 in 1992. The company has said it plans another 7,000 layoffs this year. Boeing officials did not know if the new order would reduce the planned layoffs.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers, Happy, Still Fear Bureaucracy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Officials of American pharmaceutical companies active in Russia today welcomed the pact with the United States on marketing drugs as a way to ease the delays and expenses of obtaining sales approvals from the Russian Government.
But some business people who have run the gantlet of the Health Ministry expressed skepticism that the agreement could cut through a bureaucracy hampered by a lack of computers and the stampede of applicants seeking entry into the Russian market. 
 "I think it is a healthy step, because until now it has been very, very hard to understand the registration system," said Sergei A. Tsvetkov, a partner in Sarmite U.S.A., which holds distribution rights here for Rugby Laboratories Inc., a manufacturer of generic drugs in Rockville Centre, L.I. "There is not one room where they will tell you how to do it, whom to approach first, in short, 'Where's Papa?' Someone still will be keeping the people who have lined up in order."
If the agreement works, Eli Lilly & Company should quickly win approval to market five pharmaceuticals in Russia, the medical director for the company in Moscow, Aleksei V. Sergeyev, said. The drugs include glucagon, which has been used to treat diabetics in the United States for 20 years and has a close analog in use here.
But Mr. Sergeyev said, "We all have doubts as to whether it will really be implemented because we all have experience working here in Russian circumstances."
 
From One to Two Years
 Registering a drug with the Health Ministry has usually taken American companies one to two years, depending on whether the ministry orders clinical trials and on how many connections a company has. At least three committees in the ministry have had roles in awarding quality certificates and sales licenses. Clinical trials, which have to include a minimum of 50 patients, can cost $200 to $1,000 a patient.
Under the new system, companies applying to register drugs that the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved have just to file the proper documents with the Health Ministry. The ministry will continue to monitor the quality of the medicines.
Mr. Sergeyev said the agreement could also help Russian concerns, which would could cooperate with American businesses to produce pharmaceuticals. Like other sectors of the Russian economy, the pharmaceutical industry has been hit hard by the collapse of centralized control of production and the privatization of some factories.
Pharmacies have to pay hard currency to buy drugs previously available from republics like Lithuania and Ukraine and East European countries like Bulgaria, East Germany and Hungary. "Prices have risen 1,000, 1,500 times over the last few years," said Lina D. Kochalayeva, director of a 24-hour pharmacy on Peace Prospect in Moscow. "Still, we can offer a much richer assortment today." In part that is because many foreign companies recognize the market's importance.
Distributors of generic drugs said the accord could help their sales and would help bring down prices. "Now if you have a good product and good prices, you can get into the market," said Natasha F. Kuznetsova, a vice president of Mypharm, a distributor. "It will be the F.D.A., and not some bureaucrat, giving the green light."

HEADLINE: Russia Allows Sale of Drugs Made in U.S.

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The Administration announced today that Russia had agreed to allow the sale of virtually all drugs made in the United States and approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
The agreement, which takes effect immediately, was described by the F.D.A. as the first in which any nation has formally agreed to rely so heavily on another nation to insure that drugs sold are safe and effective. 
 Any prescription or nonprescription drug made in the United States and approved by the F.D.A. will be assured of approval within 90 days in Russia. Pharmaceutical companies are simply required to give the Health Ministry documentation of the approval.
 
Ready to Apply and Ship
 Dr. Mary K. Pendergast, the deputy F.D.A. commissioner who led the negotiations with the Russians over the last year, said that important medicines like antibiotics, insulin and drugs to combat high blood pressure were in extremely short supply in Russia and that American companies were ready to apply soon to ship those drugs.
The agreement is also expected to be a boon for American drug companies that have faced obstacles entering the Russian market, particularly if Russia can stabilize its economy.
Russia buys $300 million to $400 million in foreign drugs annually in a poorly supplied and chaotic marketplace, the F.D.A. said, and American drugs account for $7 million of that total. Countries like France and Italy each have total drug markets of about $12 billion annually, the industry says. The United States market is $58 billion annually.
 
'A Big Market'
 Richard R. Saul, assistant vice president for Europe at the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association here, said the market in Russia had been very unstable and frustrating for years.
"It is very hard going," Mr. Saul added. "But potentially it could be large. Companies view this as a very long-term investment, and the prize in the end is a share of a big market."
Under the previous system in Russia, companies had to submit data in Russian on all chemical, animal and human tests, duplicate the human experiments inside Russia and submit the entire package to the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry. The process was expensive and took years, and the outcomes were unpredictable. Of thousands of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 40 have been approved for sale in Russia.
But beginning today, Ms. Pendergast said, the Health Ministry has agreed to approve American-made and F.D.A.-approved drugs within 90 days of the submission of a basic description of the drug and its action, a copy of the official approval letter and the latest Federal inspection reports from the manufacturer.
 
Unresolved Liability Questions
 The F.D.A. is trying to devise a way to inform the Russians by computer about safety problems that arise involving drugs it has approved. Ms. Pendergast said that Russia had little civil, property or contract law and that questions about liability had not been resolved.
Vice President Al Gore said the agreement was a breakthrough in "our efforts to open new doors and forge new partnerships that recognize how the world has changed."
Dr. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an interview: "The public-health dimension of this cannot be stressed enough. We have enormous respect for the Russian scientists and we hope to help them help the Russian people."
American drug companies were elated because the agreement gives them a potential advantage in Russia and because it is a strong shot in the competition for world markets.
Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents large drug companies in Washington, said that this was the first time that one nation had accepted the regulatory approval of another, but that European nations would soon be doing so among themselves. The rules would be established in the European Union under which a drug approved by one nation would be assumed to be approved by other members, unless there were special circumstances.
 
Consistency in Testing
 The F.D.A. has set up an international conference on "harmonization," trying to assure that studies of animals and humans by drug companies can be used to have drugs approved in more than one country. Now, for example, one country may require a two-year study of a drug's effects in beagles and a rodent study with 2,000 animals, while another country requires a seven-year dog study and work with 500 rodents.
The United States and Japan are also working to establish common requirements. "The ultimate goal," Mr. Mossinghoff said, "is that we would accept each other's drug approvals. But Russia is right there today, and that is a big step."
The accord with Russia was executed by an eight-page memorandum of understanding signed by the Food and Drug Commissioner, Dr. David Kessler, in Washington on Jan. 28 and signed by the Russian Health Minister, Eduard A. Nechayev, on Tuesday.
The agreement covers all drugs and biological products, but not homeopathic medicines or medical devices. It states that for drugs and biological products, "The Russian Federation participants will accept F.D.A.'s decisions and regulations on premarket approval, licensing, monographs and related matters, as well as F.D.A.'s product-quality standards and enforcement of manufacturing controls and other requirements."
 
Influence in Other Countries
 If a company provides the documentation to Russia, "the Russian Federation participants will not require, as a condition of importation, the conduct of any additional clinical or analytical review or testing."
F.D.A. approval carries great weight for health ministries around the world. Many nations, especially in the third world, use the approvals as informal guides about the safety and effectiveness of drugs.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved 2,500 prescription drugs, of which 200 account for 80 to 90 percent of total sales, said Jeff Warren of the manufacturers' group.
Also covered by the agreement are thousands of over-the-counter products like cold remedies and hemorrhoidal compounds. About $13 billion of thosedrugs are sold in this country each year. The provision that the drugs and products be manufactured in the United States restricts the agreement to the plants that the F.D.A. regularly inspects.
 
Possible Additional Accord
 The agreement also states that the F.D.A. and the Russian ministry will sign a memorandum in six months to cover medical devices and some food additives. Many devices are virtually unregulated in the United States, making an agreement on acceptance more difficult to reach, as the agency cannot vouch for their safety and effectiveness.
The obstacles for American drug companies to selling drugs in Russia over the years have been large. In the Soviet Union the Government tightly limited access, and most drugs were manufactured by Eastern bloc countries and a few favored sources, including India and Japan.
In the post-Soviet era some countries that have been selling to the region for years have been able to obtain drug approvals from the Russians more easily than others. The new agreement will shift that balance and may give American products a significant advantage.
But more important obstacles to sales are the chaotic state of the economy, the lack of money and the problems in distributing and selling products in Russia.
"It will be at least 10 years, if things go well, before all this will be sorted out," said Mr. Saul, of the manufacturers' group. "But it is a great chance."

HEADLINE: Arafat Must Ask Who's a Friend, Who's an Enemy

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TUNIS, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Dogged by enemies who have vowed to gun him down, a financial crisis so severe he can no longer pay salaries and difficulties in his talks with Israel, Yasir Arafat says he is struggling to keep the rancorous P.L.O. from disintegrating even before it takes control of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
"The Israeli Government is not in a hurry to implement this agreement," he said in an interview today, "but this is a dangerous policy that could backfire." 
 The 65-year-old guerrilla leader, his eyes watery and red with fatigue, said he has lurched from one disappointment to another since signing the Palestinian accord with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in September. The agreement was to have led to Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho by Dec. 13, but the withdrawal is still being negotiated with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
 
Blaming Washington
 Mr. Arafat spoke about his difficulties as he sat, well after midnight, in his office in Tunis, slumped forward in a gray swivel chair. Most of Tunis, where he has his headquarters on a quiet, tree-lined street, had gone to bed.
Mr. Arafat, who spoke in both English and Arabic, said he could not understand why so much had turned so sour on the eve of triumph. "The only thing that has not been a surprise," he said during the hourlong interview, "is the 18-hour days."
The P.L.O. chairman pinned much of the blame for the delay on what he said was the passivity of the Clinton Administration.
"We asked the Americans to play a positive role," he said. "We asked them not to leave us alone with the Israelis. But the Americans have not intervened to make sure that what was signed in Washington, under the auspices of President Clinton, is implemented. The Americans have intervened in the negotiations for the Syrians, the Lebanese and the Jordanians. They have intervened for everyone except the Palestinians."
Mr. Arafat, a pistol strapped to his right hip and a compact black machine-gun tucked behind his desk, said Prime Minister Rabin was correct when he cautioned that negotiations were at least a month away from being concluded.
"The size of the security force and the police force are still one of the problems which have not been settled," he said. "The size of the Jericho area has not been settled. We have not determined the size of the security zones around the Jewish settlements or the differences between the bridges that cross the Jordan River and the border crossing with Egypt at Rafa. There are problems concerning the administration, security and the liaison bureaus."
 
Guns, Guns Everywhere
 But what seemed to bother Mr. Arafat most was the struggle to keep the Palestinian movement from tearing itself apart. He referred repeatedly to weapons that he said are pouring into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, blaming the Israelis for not halting the arms traffic. The arms, coupled with the delay in carrying out the agreement, could push the occupied territories into anarchy, he said.
"This weapons trade is being carried out under the auspices of some Israeli officers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip," he said. "This is part of a wicked plan. Once the Israelis withdraw, these weapons will not be used against the Israelis, but against whom? It could lead to another Afghanistan among the Palestinians. This is a very serious game."
Israeli officials have denied any involvement in arms trafficking.
Mr. Arafat dismissed the harsh criticism of the P.L.O. peace accord by Syria and Libya, saying, "Only the Palestinians and the Israelis shall have the power to damage the agreement."
But he also said the P.L.O. was in trouble, racked by dissent and by a serious lack of money. The hundreds of millions of dollars the P.L.O. chairman once spent lavishly to cement alliances, maintain offices in European and Arab capitals and keep dissidents mollified have dried up.
 
$50 Million Would Help
 The financial crisis became serious when the Persian Gulf states ended their huge contributions because of Mr. Arafat's sympathy for Iraq during the gulf war. Disastrous investments, including banana groves in Somalia and chicken farms, compounded the losses.
Mr. Arafat said he now pleads for money just to keep operating, adding that Saudi Arabia, after a recent reconciliation, had promised $100 million but that no money had arrived. Western donors have also promised hundreds of millions of dollars once the self-rule begins, but for now the P.L.O. is broke.
"If I could just get $50 million, it would solve so many of my problems," he said, gesturing with a pale hand.
Mr. Arafat several times recalled the loss of important lieutenants: Khalil Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, was killed in 1988 by agents believed to be from Israeli intelligence; Salah Khalaf, known as Abu Iyad, was killed in 1991 by gunmen believed to be in the service of the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.
 
Mourning '11 Martyrs'
 When Mr. Arafat was told last October that another aide, Assad Saftawi, had been assassinated in the Gaza Strip, the third associate killed since the peace accord was signed, he shut himself in his suite at Le Crillon Hotel in Paris and wept, according to those who were with him.
"In this march I have lost my nearest and greatest brothers and leaders," he said, "and I am still paying a price. There are so many we have lost, 11 martyrs so far."
The threat of assassination is never far from the minds of his security detail, who hovered in the room and stood outside the door of his sparsely furnished office, which is filled with huge color pictures of Jerusalem. Black-uniformed troops, under the glare of floodlights, patrolled in front of the modest stucco house where Mr. Arafat lives and works.
"What we fear most is not these dissident groups," said one aide, "but some crazy Palestinian with a gun."

HEADLINE: VIETNAM'S EXODUS IS DECLARED OVER

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The era of "boat people" from Vietnam has been declared over, and Vietnamese fleeing their country will no longer be entitled to at least temporary asylum as political refugees.
"A chapter is coming to an end in Indochina and Southeast Asia," Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said earlier in the week at the conclusion of a special meeting at the United Nations refugee organization's Geneva headquarters. 
 Less than two weeks since the United States lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam, the refugee group's steering committee ruled that from now on, Vietnamese who flee would no longer be automatically entitled to consideration for a grant of asylum as political refugees but would be treated as asylum-seekers from any other nation. This means that if the country where the migrants land rules that they are not refugees from persecution they can be sent home immediately.
"The conference stated that the international community will not and cannot pay indefinitely to provide free food, free housing and free medical care for these people," the High Commissioner's office announced.
 
Special Status for 'Boat People'
 Until now, "boat people" were generally given special treatment, with a right to at least temporary asylum until their cases could be studied.
"The Vietnamese cannot be treated any differently from other groups of asylum-seekers," Mrs. Ogata said. She cited "generally positive trends" of development in Vietnam.
Since 1986, when aid from the Soviet Union began dwindling, Hanoi has encouraged the establishment of a market economy and opened its doors to participation by foreign investors and businessmen. The lifting of the American economic embargo on Feb. 4 is expected to bring a more rapid rise in living standards in a country where the average citizen earns little more than $200 a year.
Only about 60,000 "boat people" remain in camps in Asia, and most of them have been determined to be economic migrants rather than refugees. They will be returned to Vietnam, even against their will. The High Commissioner's office reported that last month, 2,844 Vietnamese were voluntarily repatriated. Since the refugees are given no alternative, the use of the word "voluntary" has been a subject of protest by humanitarian organizations.
Only 55 persons fled by small boats in 1992. The number rose to 777 last year. They fled mainly to Japan, prompted by rumors here that Tokyo would either allow them to work there or return them with large cash payments. Most of the refugees of the last decade have been North Vietnamese, with no connection to the former South Vietnamese Government or its American backers, and have had relatively safe passages from the region of the port city of Haiphong along the Chinese coast to Hong Kong.
 
Mass Exodus in 1970's
 At its height, from the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 to the early 1980's, the stream of "boat people" was a dramatic flight of hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese ready to throw their lives and that of their children on the mercy of the South China Sea, mainly in fishing boats not built to withstand such rigors. How many of them perished cannot be known.
After China invaded northern Vietnam in 1979, the Vietnamese authorities singled out the ethnic Chinese minority for particular pressure to emigrate. They loaded ancient freighters with thousands of ethnic Chinese, who had to pay in gold for their forced flight, and sent them onto the sea. The arrival of such ships led to extended disputes between Western and Southeast Asian countries before the passengers were granted temporary asylum, usually in Malaysia.
Nearly 800,000 refugees from Vietnam reached safety, mainly in Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong. Many did so after watching fellow refugees die from hunger, thirst or exposure. Many others were killed, raped, robbed, brutally beaten and subjected to indignities by fishermen, mainly Thai, who found preying on refugees more rewarding than their normal occupation. Others lost their lives when hostile security forces drove them from their shores or towed them back onto the open sea.
 
Most Came to U.S.
 The great majority of the "boat people" found refuge in the United States. After flying out 135,000 Vietnamese in the final days of the Saigon Government, the United States accepted almost no further refugees from its former allies in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, until press reports of their plight in 1977 caused the Administration of President Jimmy Carter to open immigration quotas for them. At the peak of admission to the United States, 168,000 refugees a year entered.
Under international pressure, Vietnam agreed in 1979 to the "Orderly Departure Program," which made possible legal emigration, usually to reunite divided families. Nearly 500,000 Vietnamese have emigrated under the program since 1980, more than 350,000 of them to the United States.
The American total includes two groups admitted to the United States under agreements between the two countries. They are people who say they are the offspring of Americans who served in South Vietnam before 1975 and Vietnamese women, and their relatives, and former officers and officials of the Saigon Government who were confined in rugged and isolated areas termed "re-education camps," as well as their families.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
As the Japanese have grown increasingly torn by the confrontation over trade with the United States, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is defending his stand by depicting it as just one of the sweeping changes that he has sought to bring to the scandal-ridden political system. He has cast the battle as part of his campaign to bring fundamental reform to Japan.
But for many Japanese who have grown disillusioned by the continuing strife within Mr. Hosokawa's governing coalition and signs that he is more of a conservative at heart than a reformer, a series of trials in a stark courtroom less than a mile from the parliament may say more about where the real push for change is coming from. 
 More than 36 prefectural governors, mayors and construction executives are facing charges of corruption over public construction. The prosecutors have made clear, however, that they are not attacking isolated venality, but the collusive heart of the way that Japan has worked for 40 years.
The effects of the trials on the actions of Mr. Hosokawa have been considerable, because the disclosures of corruption helped him to push through changes aimed at curbing the influence of cash contributions from industrial to political leaders and parties.
 
Recantation of Confessions
 But despite some clear moves toward change, even many supporters of Mr. Hosokawa say they have been disappointed at the way that he has struck compromises with the conservative Government bureaucrats or the power brokers of the Liberal Democratic Party, which ruled Japan for decades until Mr. Hosokawa ousted them last year. The party has been heavily implicated in the corruption trials, which are under way in Tokyo District Court.
However the trials on the 41 indictments turn out -- several defendants have pleaded not guilty, saying earlier confessions had been coerced -- there is little doubt that they played an instrumental role in ending the 38-year rule of the Liberal Democrats last summer. In fact, it is dawning on some here that the real force for fundamental change here may be not the vision of the Prime Minister or the will of Parliament, but the prosecutor's office.
 
'To Clean Out the Sewers'
 "Our role," an important prosecutor in the case, Yusuke Yoshinaga, said, "is to clean out the sewers."
There have been influence-peddling scandals in Japan before, of course, and some have brought down governments. The scandal today is different, because it involves the construction industry. Contractors have been central to the ways of politics in a country that has been called a "doken kokka," a phrase that could be translated roughly as a nation built around the construction industry.
Among the largest single expenditures made every year by the national and local governments is construction -- for a total of $350 billion last year. The largest single contributors to politicians are construction companies. Many of the Government contracts are let through bid rigging, a practice known as dango, that the Government acknowledges is widespread.
The chief Cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, who had been Governor of Shiga, recalled once that the pressure to accept cash for contracts was unrelenting. "Once they set their sights on you, they use every trick in the book," Mr. Takemura said of the construction companies. "Anyone might eventually give in to temptation."
"Other countries have some kind of bid rigging at times, but in Japan dango is part of the industry's structure," said Yoshitsugu Kanemoto, a professor of economics at Tokyo University.
 
Politicians as Steerers
 Kunio Maeda, a former construction executive and now a professor at Fuji University, has estimated that Government construction costs in Japan are 30 to 40 percent higher than in the United States because of the bid rigging. Much of that extra money, of course, is paid to the politicians who steer contracts.
Those practices have led to suits and threats of sanctions by United States negotiators seeking to gain access to the construction markets for American companies.
The first close peek into how the system works was on March 6, 1993, with a raid by prosecutors on the home and office of Shin Kanemaru, a former deputy prime minister and Liberal Democratic kingmaker. The Government found millions of dollars of gold bars, cash and bearer bonds.
Mr. Kanemaru was charged with tax evasion, and the prosecutors said most of the money was from construction companies. The public was outraged. Finally most politicians began to realize that they courted disaster if they did not support a campaign to stamp out the corruption.
The prosecutors then raided the offices of 18 construction companies, taking a total 4,600 cardboard boxes filled with documents. That led to the first indictment, on June 29, of Toru Ishii, Mayor of the northern city of Sendai.
Perhaps the most shocking arrests were of executives of the Kajima Corporation, the most influential company in the industry because of its tight links with the bureaucracy and politics. Seven top executives, including the president, are former Construction Ministry bureaucrats, and the children of several former top executives have married into politically influential families.

HEADLINE: Cold Curbs A Rebound In Housing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Hampered by the nation's third-coldest January in a century, builders slowed the pace at which they broke ground for homes by 17.6 percent, matching the biggest decline in 10 years, the Commerce Department reported today.
The Northeast was the hardest hit, with housing starts diving 32.8 percent to a pace below that of January 1993. 
 But economists and housing analysts expressed no alarm, citing what they consider an unsustainably robust December -- revised still higher today -- as well as the earthquake in California and severe winter weather that extended well into the South.
 
Expectations Unchanged
 "This isn't that hard to deal with," David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said of today's figures. He said his association's February survey of builders' sentiment found 54 percent expecting "good or better" conditions in the next six months, a reading virtually unchanged from January.
Permits for future construction fell 7.9 percent, less than half the plunge for starts. Both sets of figures are adjusted for normal seasonal variations but these by definition do not capture exceptional developments.
"January numbers have proven to be notoriously fickle over the years," said Robert D. Barr, deputy chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. In addition to the effects of severe weather, the January figures suggest the economy is "taking a breather" following a sizzling fourth quarter, he said.
 
December Starts Revised
 The January starts were 1,294,000 at an annual pace, fewer than what analysts had predicted, but the percentage drop was exaggerated by a revision that carried December starts to 1,571,000, the fastest pace since January 1989.
December was only the second month in the last 13 years in which starts of single-family homes exceeded surpassed a rate of 1.3 million.
Starts of single-family homes dropped 15 percent in January, to a rate of 1,147,000. Apartment house construction was even weaker, with dwellings in buildings of five or more units plunging 38.4 percent, to a rate of 125,000.
The 32.8 percent drop in Northeastern starts, to an annual pace of just 90,000, compared with a 22.9 percent drop in the Midwest, to a 262,000 pace, and with a 15.6 percent drop in the South, to a rate of 65,000. The Southern region, which extends up to Delaware and Maryland, had a considerable amount of bad weather.
 
West Virtually Unchanged
 Groundbreaking in the West was virtually unchanged last month at a rate of 377,000 dwellings a year but analysts said there surely would have been a gain had it not been for the California earthquake.
But the housing rebound since late last summer is likely to at least hold its gains when better weather arrives, various analysts said.
"I don't see a slackening" in underlying activity, said Robert Davis, chief economist for the Savings and Community Bankers of America, a trade group representing mortgage lenders.
Building permits were issued at a rate of 1,360,000 last month: 587,000 in the South, 356,000 in the West, 315,000 in the Midwest and 102,000 in the Northeast. This was a decline for all regions but the West, with permits falling most in the Northeast, where a 42 percent plunge resulted in the lowest pace since March 1993.
Although permits are often regarded as forecasting home building activity in coming months, Mr. Seiders and other industry professionals have found it an indicator with little predictive value.
 
Faster Than a Year Ago
 Despite last month's big drop in groundbreaking, the pace exceeded that of January 1993 by 10.6 percent, the Commerce Department's survey also showed.
Actual housing starts -- with no seasonal adjustment or annualization -- were 77,100 last month, 9.4 percent ahead of January 1993. Only 4,900 of these were in the Northeast.
Having raised his forecast in early January, just before the industry's annual convention, Mr. Seiders predicts starts for 1994 will total 1.43 million, with single-family homes up 9 percent and the multifamily category up 11 percent from its depressed state.
The December advance, a jump now put at 11.7 percent, benefited from a rise in interest rates that while relatively modest, jolted many buyers into action. This is a typical response when rates stop declining and consumers suddenly decide that they risk missing favorable terms if they don't act.
Except for a same-size drop in January 1991, last month's tumble was the biggest since starts dropped 26.4 percent in March 1984.

HEADLINE: Stocks Edge Up on Currency Reassurance

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders nudged up shares across the board yesterday, as the Clinton Administration continued to reassure the currency markets that it was not politicizing the dollar and bond markets were relatively calm. The best movers were economically sensitive stocks like United Technologies and Alcoa.
Still, bears were turning ever more bearish. Harrison Roth, a senior options strategist at Cowen & Company, derided the notion that the stock market would get to or near the 4,000 level on the Dow because the market was awash in money. Last year, individual and other investors poured a record $128 billion into stock mutual funds. 
 "The perceived wisdom is that equities is the only game in town, but the fact of the matter is there's more than one town," Mr. Roth said. He cited record dollar inflows into bond funds as well as foreign equity funds, especially those in emerging markets like Mexico and Southeast Asia.
Anthony F. Dwyer, chief market strategist for Sherwood Securities Inc., said: "This is the perfect time to be a contrarian, when everyone is putting money into stocks. Pretty soon the buying power of this market is going to run out, probably by the end of the first quarter."
 
Utilities Average Down
 Indeed, yesterday the Dow Jones utilities average, an avidly scrutinized market barometer, declined 2.70 points, to 212.76. When the average, comprising a group of power companies including Pacific Gas and Electric, declines, it is said to signal higher interest rates, which would hurt stocks. Utilities, rich in dividends, act like stocks but also somewhat like fixed-income bonds, analysts say, making utilities useful as an indicator.
The Dow industrials rose 9 points, to 3,937.27, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.27 point, to 472.79. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.50 points, to 792.62 and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.48 point, to 475.32.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.19 point, to 262.55, on volume of 295.5 million shares. Advancers exceeded decliners by 1,183 to 965.
The economic news of the day was generally ignored because traders expect January and February economic data to be distorted by the severe winter in the Northeast and the ruinous California earthquake.
The Commerce Department reported that January housing starts plunged to an annual rate of 1.29 million units, far worse than the expected 1.38 million units. There was some encouraging news. January building permits, running at an annual rate of 1.36 million, fell less sharply than those of housing starts, indicating more robust building later this year.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, hurt by a slump in demand for jets, got a $6 billion order yesterday from Saudi Arabia, which had been actively courted by the United States.
Details of the accord were not released but are likely to favor the far larger Boeing, whose stock rose $2.50, to $46.625 a share, in active trading. McDonnell Douglas's stock rose $1.875, to $118.875. The stock of United Technologies, a major aerospace contractor, also benefited, rising $2.625, to $71 a share. United Technologies accounted for 5.9 points of the 9-point gain in the Dow.
Intel was the most active stock, with volume of 8.2 million shares, in over-the-counter trading. The microchip maker's share price rose $2, to $67, in part because of traders' expectations that a recovering economy would lift its sales of advanced microprocessors.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Mixed Ahead of Price Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond trading was subdued and prices mixed yesterday as dealers and investors sat on their hands ahead of today's report on January consumer prices.
A report that showed a sharp 17.6 drop in January housing starts lifted prices in early trading, but most market participants had already suspected that severe winter weather would take its toll on home building for the month. 
 An upward revision in the December number showed growth in that area continuing. Analysts say that once the weather improves it is likely the economy will see a spurt in housing starts again.
The Treasury's 30-year bond traded at 97 13/32 to yield 6.45 percent, unchanged from the previous day. The shorter maturities were unchanged, while the intermediate maturities were mixed.
 
 
Consumer Price Index
 The market stayed focused on today's Consumer Price Index. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said bond trading ahead of the index's release "was about as exciting as going into work on a weekend."
The consensus of analysts' estimates of the index calls for a gain of three-tenths of a percent over all, and a gain of three-tenths of a percent in the core inflation report.
Traders said it was possible the figure could be lower because of a new method of calculating inflation. Many economists have already lowered their Consumer Price Index forecast because of the new method.
In any case, the Federal Reserve is likely to be cautious in interpreting the economic data because of weather-related distortions.
Analysts say the threat of a near-term interest rate increase by the Fed is minimal. Some market watchers suspect a tightening may come around the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel, on March 22.
In an interview yesterday, a Federal Reserve governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., told reporters that he expected the Fed's most recent tightening on Feb. 4 would ultimately curtail inflationary expectations and hold down interest rates.
"If the bond market feels that the Fed is dragging its feet, bond yields will rise further," Mr. Fine of Chase Securities said. "The only way yields are dropping further is if the economy makes a U-turn."
 
 
Currency Market
 The market has also been following the currency market. The breakdown of trade talks between the United States and Japan caused the dollar to plunge against the yen on Monday before regaining some stability.
Analysts at MMS International, however, said they believed that the potential for a substantial trade confrontation between the United States and Japan was minimal despite concerns in the currency market about an impending trade war between the two. Among the reasons they list: a Japanese Government that is primarily focused on domestic issues; the current Government coalition is too weak to make significant changes in trade law, and a confrontation would probably prove nearly as costly to the United States as to Japan.
The Federal Government yesterday set the terms for next week's auction of two-year and five-year notes, cutting the size of the five-year auction back to $11 billion, after increasing it by $1 billion, to $12 billion, in January because of the bond call. The two-year auction was left at $17 billion.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 4.47 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.38 percent.

Dollar Eases in Expectation Of Action by German Bank

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar eased against most European currencies yesterday on expectations that the Bundesbank, the German central bank, will hold interest rates steady at its meeting today.
But the dollar remained stable against the Japanese yen after a round of aggressive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan. Tokyo is trying to stem the soaring yen after trade talks with Washington failed. 
 In New York, the dollar dropped to 1.7237 German marks, from 1.7283 on Tuesday. It also ended at 103.80 yen, down slightly from 103.85 yen.
Meanwhile, gold prices also slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the April gold contract, which is the most active, settled at $385.30 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Many analysts believe that the Bundesbank may be loath to ease credit until current wage negotiations with a huge engineering union are completed and the outlook for inflation becomes more clear.
They also pointed to the Bundesbank's February report, which said the central bank would continue to consider rate cuts but must act to maintain confidence in the mark.
Lower German interest rates would make mark-based assets relatively less attractive than foreign investments, including those denominated in dollars.
 
Dollar Steadies Against Yen
 The dollar remained relatively stable against the yen, primarily as a result of purchases by the Bank of Japan. Dealers said many traders were still scrambling to buy back dollars sold in a hurry after the trade meeting between the United States and Japan leaders ended last Friday without an agreement.
"People are still short dollars looking for more bad news on trade," Christopher Wilson, a senior dealer at Union Bank in Los Angeles, said. "Most are interested in seeing tomorrow's December trade deficit figures."
Dealers said the trade gap between Japan and the United States would drive the dollar's direction against the yen. If the gap widens, dealers are likely to sell dollars on the idea the White House might push for a stronger yen to help trim the deficit.
The Clinton Administration has repeatedly denied that it wants a strong yen, but dealers remain skeptical.
Meanwhile, the British pound was unchanged in New York at $1.4755 yesterday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4537 Swiss francs, down from 1.4550; 5.8675 French francs, down from 5.8850.

HEADLINE: Broadway Pays Big Dividends, Study Says

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The Broadway theater contributes $2.3 billion a year to the economy of New York City, or about a fourth of the total economic impact of all of the city's cultural activities, according to a study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to be released today. The report is the first comprehensive analysis of Broadway's economic impact by an independent authority.
Port Authority researchers said that during the 1992 season Broadway shows attracted 1.7 million tourists and 782,000 suburbanites, who spent more than $266 million on restaurants and $242 million on hotels and more than $35 million on taxicabs. 
 About 25,000 jobs are linked to the economy of Broadway, ranging from stagehands and theatrical suppliers to hotel and restaurant workers, the report said, and the business that Broadway generates yields $142 million annually in state and local income taxes, hotel occupancy taxes and sales taxes from visitors' patronage in restaurants and retail stores.
"These are considerable figures, when you consider that there are only a few dozen theaters," said Catherine Lanier, a Port Authority consultant who did the analysis and wrote the report for the agency's Office of Economic and Policy Analysis.
 
Impact of Films and TV
 Theater is not, however, the city's most rubust entertainment industry. The Port Authority puts the economic impact of film and television production in New York City at $2.6 billion.
The release of the report, which draws its conclusions from the 1992 theater season and does not include figures from 1993, comes when half of Broadway's 35 theaters are dark, the result of a generally bleak fall season in which a number of shows closed quickly. January and February, traditionally slow months, have been hit hard by the weather, and attendance is down even at perennial sell-outs like "The Phantom of the Opera." Six plays, six musicals and at least two solo shows are scheduled for the spring season.
Ms. Lanier said that the report was conducted independently of public-policy considerations, defending it as an accurate portrait of economic activity involving the theater. "It's a conservative study," she said, "since we're focusing on those who came to New York specifically for the theater."
Nonetheless, the report is likely to strengthen the perception of the theater's importance to the city economy at a time when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's aides have placed a new emphasis on the economic value of cultural institutions. Some of the sponsors of the report may use the findings to lobby for greater public and private support for theater-related activities.
 
A Draw for New Money
 A major finding of the report is that theater draws new money into the New York region, "from everywhere from France to Ohio, and that's important to economic health," said Ms. Lanier.
She contrasted the theater economy "with industries that pass money around in the same region," like dry cleaners or local restaurants, "which recirculate money without adding money to the region."
"You can't have regional growth based on that kind of economy," she said.
The report is a sequel to a Port Authority study released last October, sponsored by the agency along with the Alliance for the Arts, the New York City Partnership and the Partnership for New Jersey. That report, which did not analyze specific data about Broadway, estimated that the total economic impact of the arts and cultural activities was $9.2 billion in New York City, including television and motion-picture production, and the effect of cultural institutions like museums, art galleries and auction houses.
 
The Role of Tourists
 The new study was based in part on an analysis of the production and operating budgets of 22 Broadway plays and musicals during the 1991-92 season. Additional findings on tourism were based on some 3,200 questionnaires returned by theatergoers during the 1991-92 season.
Of the tourists surveyed by the Port Authority, slightly more than half said that attending cultural activities was the main purpose of their trip, and three-quarters of that group said they had come expressly to see Broadway shows. The authority estimated this audience to be about 1.7 million people, who spent $686 million in the city in addition to the purchase of theater tickets.
Road productions of Broadway shows also added to the city's economy, the report said. The direct annual expenditures by Broadway producers for shows in New York, both commercial and nonprofit, were $311 million (including payments for labor, sets, equipment rental, transportation, advertising and theater rentals). An additional $127 million was spent in New York City to mount touring productions, and benefited the city through profits, royalties and salaries, "money that stayed in our region's economy," said Ms. Lanier. "Such productions ultimately were paid for by people out of town."
The effect of Broadway spending "ripples through the economy," said Ms. Lanier, "as firms doing business with production companies make purchases from additional businesses, and as employees spend their wages and salaries."

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
INDOOR/OUTDOOR living, though dear to the heart of most suburban homeowners, rarely gets its due as a design issue.
The standard suburban architectural formula for connecting the two realms: knock a hole in the wall, add a picture window or sliding doors and hope for the best. It's like hooking up nature as though it were cable television. But the standard stuff seldom delivers on its promises -- great views, freedom of access -- or adds anything imaginative to either side of the setup. 
 Robert Kahn, a New York architect whose recent projects include the interior redesign of the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center last year, struck a delicate balance between indoors and outdoors when he built a small house in St. Louis for his parents, Jane and Dr. Lawrence Kahn. The house has a roomlike garden at the center embraced on three sides by actual rooms. Opening on one side is the living room, whose view is centered on the garden. The living room and the garden operate as halves of the same space, connected like interior salons by french doors.
In season, one wanders freely from one end of the space to the other as though the two areas were one large room, used for gardening, reading and entertaining. Off-season, the french doors partition the space decoratively. The passageway between the areas feels natural -- not window or door in a wall, but part archway, trellis and picturesque landscape view.
Mr. Kahn was addressing a greater issue at the time -- the empty nest. With their children grown and gone, his parents wanted a smaller, more manageable house. The Kahns are gardeners, so a condominium apartment was out of the question. They bought a small lot in an older suburb of St. Louis -- "a classic city lot, 60 feet by 120 feet," Dr. Kahn said -- and hired their son to design a house that would give them the two things they wanted in retirement: privacy and a place to garden, neither of which seemed possible on a sixth of an acre.
"They're no fools," Mr. Kahn said of his parents. "They waited until I had done a few houses to hire me."
Mr. Kahn faced a bit of friendly competition -- his parents' fond memory of their previous house, designed with a student of Frank Lloyd Wright's. It employed "a classic Prairie house concept -- indoor/outdoor, a band of windows all around," Dr. Kahn said, adding that with the new house, he and Mrs. Kahn wanted a garden and, again, a lot of light.
Mr. Kahn designed a complete inverse of a small suburban house. Rather than creating a box divided into rooms that look out across narrow yards to immediate neighbors, he built a series of long rooms and halls that form a "U." The "U" shape embraces the 30-by-40-foot garden on three sides. The combination living/ dining room is to the west, the kitchen is to the south and the master bedroom and carport are to the east. A latticed fence and planted bamboo screen the north side.
The plan allows for complete privacy, despite large exposures of glass. And every room has a view of the garden -- a neat double play.
"The house looks in on itself, like a Roman courtyard house," Mr. Kahn said. "If one goes to Pompeii, there's one house after another, which is in many ways a suburban problem. What's pleasant is that the house is centered on a space of open air."
Nowhere is the Kahns' open communication with their garden more apparent, or more mutually beneficial, than in their living room, because of Mr. Kahn's careful approach to a common solution: french doors. In fact, the doors are part of a larger frame that includes eight clerestory windows above the doors, creating a hybrid of door and window in the wall.
"The idea was to open up the wall as much as possible," Mr. Kahn said. "But the problem with an enormous exposure is that you feel like everything is always exposed. A framed view is much more interesting than having all the view all the time. It's not how much you look at the outdoors; it's how you look at the outdoors."
Mr. Kahn used four independently framed and individually opening french doors that effectively remove the wall. The doors -- 6 feet 8 inches by 2 feet 10 inches -- are made of 1 3/4-inch-thick Ponderosa pine with 1/2-inch thermal glass panels. Unlike sliding glass doors, they look and act like a secure wall when closed, in addition to being handsome.
"The doors are very large and heavy," Dr. Kahn said. "The hardware is all commercial grade -- big hinges, locks. Those things give a good feeling of strength of construction."
The door frames were left unstained. "The fact that they're natural has a lot to do with the fact that you connect them to the outdoors," Mr. Kahn said. The eight clerestory windows are an equally important element of the frame. The window panels are compositions of glass, crafted by Kenneth Von Roenn, a Louisville architect and glass designer who is a friend of Mr. Kahn's from their student days at Yale University. Each panel employs both clear and sand-blasted glass laminated with squares of dichroic glass that refract the daylight like prisms, throwing "marvelous colors on the wall as the sun goes down," Dr. Kahn said, and dappling the living room with leafy color and light as though it were part of the garden. At night, the glass border becomes a kind of illuminated frieze.
The garden itself is densely planted with miniatures: small spruces, hollies and Korean lilacs. Two tall crimson maples intimately dominate the space like a small French public square, providing an awning for the garden and shading the living room from summer sun and heat. A fountain with a lion's-head spout sits in the garden, creating roomlike ambiance with sound.
The overall result is both practical and poetic: an easily maintained garden within an arm's length of any part of the house; a manageable house with an urbane, private, parklike setting, and a good landscape picture hung in every room.
In the Kahns' living room, the four french doors give the appearance of a four-panel folding screen, with a natural view -- a nice allusion to classical representations of a garden. "I'm lucky," Mr. Kahn said. "I have parents who appreciate art and architecture. Maybe that's why I'm interested in it. This house wasn't an uphill battle."
 
Specs
 THE big secret to the french doors? "We designed them so that they'd open and close," Robert Kahn said.
Funny, but not a joke. It's said about doors on good cars: they feel heavy, snug and secure when one closes them. They have a good fit, right down to the sound. Exterior doors on houses are as important, especially in hard winter weather. Mr. Kahn used weatherstripping made of neoprene, a synthetic rubber, instead of more common metal strips, at the top, on the hingeless side and in a groove at the bottom of each door.
"One of the places in a project where I don't think it's good to economize is on hardware," Mr. Kahn said. "Quality of hinges -- and how many -- handles, etc. Those things don't cost that much more." Mr. Kahn often favors commercial-grade hardware for its quality of construction and durability. "Doors are things you can be sure people are going to use every day," he added. "Economizing on how thick a door is or how well made -- it is not a good savings."
For garden doors, ease of use seemed particularly important. "If doors work beautifully, satisfyingly, you're going to use them more," Mr. Kahn said.
The estimated cost of the living room's four french doors and eight clerestory windows, without Kenneth Von Roenn's custom art glass, is $6,500 (a wall without any openings would have cost about $1,000). The doors were custom made, but Mr. Kahn said that standard good-quality french doors could have been used. WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

Labor Talks to Start. Labor Talks to Start.

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Fourteen months after they thought they were starting negotiations for a new labor agreement, representatives of the Players Association and major league club owners will meet March 7 to begin negotiations for a new labor agreement.
Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, and Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, said yesterday that they would meet in Tampa, Fla., a familiar site for negotiating sessions during spring training. Fehr likes to hold talks near training camps so players can attend them. 
 Negotiations appeared to begin last year with two sessions in January, a month after the owners voted to reopen the collective bargaining agreement. But the talks were suspended while Ravitch tried to get the owners to agree to share more of their local revenue among themselves. Now that Ravitch has achieved that goal, he will resume working toward a new labor agreement.
Although the owners will seek the players' agreement to a salary cap, Ravitch will most likely not go to the Tampa meeting with a proposal in hand. He declined to comment on what his agenda would be, but he is expected to discuss the owners' recent approval of a new revenue-sharing plan and how they have linked it to a salary cap.
 
A General Discussion
 Rather than present a specific proposal for what the owners call revenue participation, Ravitch will likely discuss caps generally, explain the owners' economic need for one and invite the players to offer their thoughts on what a cap should be like.
But the players will likely respond that they have rejected a cap in the past and plan to continue to reject it unless the owners can show a legitimate need for what would be a major change in the way they are paid.
Although the owners' adoption of the revenue-sharing plan was contingent upon the players' acceptance of a salary cap, the players contend that the owners can share their revenues without help from the players. The union further argues that the creation of a ceiling on payrolls would simply return to the wealthier clubs the money they would give to the poor clubs under the revenue-sharing plan.
The Tampa meeting will come less than a week after Ravitch meets with the owners in Scottsdale, Ariz. The owners will hold their regular quarterly meetings there from Feb. 28 to March 2. At Ravitch's session with them, he and the owners will discuss and establish their strategy for the negotiations.
 
A Committee's Fate
 The owners are also expected to decide at that meeting the current status of the Player Relations Committee, which has been the clubs' labor arm. Under the restructuring report outlining the commissioner's duties, the committee is eliminated and labor relations placed under the commissioner.
But the owners do not plan to hire a commissioner until they have a new collective bargaining agreement. That leaves the relations committee in an ambiguous state.
But the restructuring report also calls for the creation of a commissioner's standing committee on player relations so that Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, and the executive council may appoint owners to that new committee. They would likely be the same owners, or at least mostly the same owners, who are on the existing committee.
Meanwhile, another committee is planning a meeting of sorts for Florida during spring training. The Senate Judiciary Committee has said it will hold a hearing on baseball's exemption from antitrust laws during this Congressional session, and the tentative plan is to have it in Tampa, possibly on March 21. The hearing may focus on the powers of the commissioner.
Nancy Coffey, an aide to Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, acknowledged that the hearing will likely be in Florida. But she added that the site and the date haven't been definitely set.

HEADLINE: Back From the Brink Again

 BODY:
Ending yet another bout of brinkmanship, North Korea acceded on Tuesday to international inspections of its declared nuclear sites. That is a hard-earned victory for U.S. diplomats who are trying to persuade the North to give up any ambition to build bombs.
North Korea agreed to let inspectors into all seven of its declared sites. They can conduct repeated visits if necessary, but only to assure that nuclear safeguards are intact -- to verify that no nuclear material has been diverted to bomb-making in the year since their last visit and to check seals and replace film in cameras designed to inhibit diversions in the future. 
 Once the inspectors are reassured and talks between North and South Korea resume, the stage will be set for a new round of tough talks between Washington and Pyongyang to bring the North into full compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Clinton Administration needs to prepare a package of incentives to get North Korea to comply, starting with cancellation of this year's Team Spirit military exercises, conducted jointly with South Korea.
The North's response comes none too soon. The board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees nuclear inspections, is scheduled to meet Monday. If it were unable to certify Pyongyang's compliance with nuclear safeguards, it would refer the matter to the United Nations Security Council, which has the authority to impose economic sanctions.
The North views sanctions as an attempt to strangle it. Imposing them would almost surely derail diplomatic efforts to gain unimpeded access to all its nuclear sites and would increase the risk of instability, if not war, on the Korean Peninsula. For these reasons the North's neighbors, China, Japan and South Korea, have been reluctant to impose a tight embargo.
The Clinton Administration was wise to cut a diplomatic deal instead. Its strategy is working so far. But the hardest bargaining lies ahead. It rightly wants North Korea to allow more thorough regular inspections of all its declared nuclear sites, to keep it from turning nuclear material into bombs.
It is especially important to resume regular inspections by summer, when North Korea will have to shut down its reactor and replace the fuel rods. At that time, inspectors will be able to weigh and assay the nuclear material to find out whether any of it was diverted in the past, and if so, how many bombs' worth.
Special inspections of suspected North Korean nuclear waste sites might also be necessary for that purpose. Those too would have to be negotiated.
The Clinton Administration should be prepared to pay a reasonable price to gain such access -- by meeting the North's demands for improved relations, giving security assurances, providing reactors that are less proliferation-prone, and offering trade and aid. Diplomacy will cost a lot less than confrontation, and it just might get what the world wants -- a nuclear-free Korea.

HEADLINE: Hard Times, Not Fraud, Explain Loan Defaults

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your "Looting Student Aid" series (front page, Feb. 2-4) points out the impossible task for the Department of Education to monitor more than 7,000 higher education institutions adequately with limited staff and an inadequate information system. We compliment you for recognizing this. 
 Unfortunately, Congress has not seen fit to allocate funds so that the department can do the job of assessing the administrative and financial capability of the colleges, universities, professional and trade schools that make up the world's leading higher education community.
As head of a privately owned education organization with some 14,000 students in major United States cities and in Europe, and about 1,800 staff and faculty members who own a substantial part of the company, I am very familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the Federal student aid programs. A fundamental problem with student aid is that our political leadership has yet to make the decision that our citizens are our most important natural resource -- the one resource we won't run out of -- and that we need to invest in the productivity of our citizens, which will have a direct impact on our future. This includes investing in students through the aid programs.
The central point about student loan defaults is that we are making loans to poor people. The Federal education scholarship program -- the Federal Pell Grant -- has not kept pace with inflation, so that today it is worth less than half what it was worth in the 1970's. It should be no surprise that with student loan volume way up, the dollar volume of student loan defaults has grown accordingly. The real dollar loan default rates have fluctuated over a narrow range for 15 years.
Every study we have done indicates that the tendency to default has everything to do with whether or not the student has the financial means to complete a chosen academic program, and whether or not there is a state grant program to supplement Federal Pell grants.
Yes, there have been instances of fraud, many of them before 1992, when Congress made significant changes in the Higher Education Act, which governs Federal student aid. But has the Government ever quantified the magnitude of losses to the student aid funds as a result of fraud, as opposed to the result of low-income students borrowing money in a difficult job climate? Or as the result of the Federal Government's failure to provide adequate oversight? It's time to start dealing with the real problems in the Federal student aid programs.

HEADLINE: Hard Times, Not Fraud, Explain Loan Defaults;
Heroic Jordan College

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 4 article on the default rates in Federal student loan programs unfairly portrays Jordan College. You state only that Jordan is not accredited -- true but misleading. You should also have noted that the college has been granted conditional accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Jordan is well on its way toward formal accreditation. 
 This conditional status is treated the same as fully accredited status by the Department of Education in determining an institution's eligibility for student aid.
One of the themes in your series was that a reason for the Department of Education's problem is pressure from politicians not to act against schools with high default rates in their own states, using my fight for Jordan as an example. As I told your reporter, I have favored closing fly-by-night schools that hurt students and taxpayers with substandard educations. Yes, even in my own state.
Jordan is well respected by educators and has earned strong support of such independent groups as the Association of Independent Colleges. For reasons I don't understand, your reporter declined to talk to the association director after assuring he would.
Jordan is not a school bilking its students while its officers live high on the hog. It is a nonprofit institution, whose officers and trustees have accepted low wages and put personal assets on the block to support the institution financially.
Jordan's student population has a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged and minority students than some historically black colleges and universities. It seeks out students who have had little or no opportunity, including a large percentage of single mothers. It helps people who otherwise would not get an education, that other schools don't reach.
Because of the heroic way Jordan College lives up to its mission, the college continues to have my strong support.

HEADLINE: Liberate Cuba. Liberate Us. Lift the Embargo, Now.;
Give Castro A Carrot

BYLINE: By Andrew Zimbalist; Andrew Zimbalist is professor of economics at Smith College.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration lifts the trade embargo against Vietnam and considers easing travel restrictions to Cuba, Libya, Iran and Iraq, its economic embargo against Cuba is being increasingly criticized. Yesterday, the United Nations released a report concluding that far from encouraging political or economic reform, the embargo is doing the opposite.
Indeed, it is widely recognized that the policy not only flagrantly violates international law, which proscribes trade sanctions based on political ideology, but also is counterproductive. Two months ago in Mexico, Vice President Al Gore defended the North American Free Trade Agreement by arguing that more open trade would promote the development of democratic institutions in Mexico. The same argument applied in the former Soviet bloc, China and Vietnam, and would apply, if given a chance, in Cuba. 
 President Clinton isn't fooling anyone when he says that the reason for Cuba's market-oriented reforms in recent years is economic pressure from the U.S. embargo. Cuba has been opening its economy gradually since 1989 because it has no choice.
As a small island country with limited natural resources, it must trade to survive, and to trade it must adapt to the rules of the world marketplace. Cuban reforms like encouraging foreign investment and allowing small private enterprise are gaining momentum and will continue to do so with or without the embargo. Ending the embargo, however, would accelerate Cuba's economic transition, as it would encourage openness and improve the chance for peaceful change.
The alternative will either be prolonged agony for ordinary Cubans or a political explosion accompanied by instability and potentially a large-scale immigration problem for Florida.
It is no accident that recent reports from the Inter-American Dialogue, the Rand Corporation, the 20th Century Fund, the Army War College and the Center for International Policy, among others, all advocate the dismantling of the embargo. Each report endorses a step-by-step loosening of the embargo in return for piecemeal concessions by President Castro, leading to the grand finale, a Nicaraguan-style presidential election.
There are many reasons why this quid pro quo gradualism is ill-conceived, but two stand out. Once the U.S. takes its first significant step -- lifting travel restrictions or allowing trade or investment in medical products -- Mr. Clinton will have burned his bridges with the ultra-conservative Cuban American National Foundation. Virtually the only reason that the embargo is still in place is the political clout of this well-financed organization. Once Mr. Clinton alienated it, the political constraint on a rational policy toward Cuba would disappear.
More importantly, as the Administration made its first clear move toward normalization, foreign capital from Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia would pour into Cuba, as investors moved to exploit opportunities that would come with the prospective opening of the U.S. market.
Over the last three years, Cuba has received $500 million in foreign capital through 112 joint ventures in tourism, mining, agriculture, and manufacturing.
Yet the present value of U.S. properties nationalized from 1959 to 1961 in Cuba, when far fewer opportunities for profitable investment existed, is more than $5 billion. With 11 million people, a disciplined and well-trained labor force and proximity to the U.S. market, Cuba offers additional billions of dollars in prospective investments. A gradual lifting of the embargo would preserve the existing advantage of overseas companies and give them a jump-start on exploiting these new opportunities while U.S. capital continued to have its hands tied.
It makes political and economic sense simply to lift the embargo all at once. The U.S. can retain leverage through carrots instead of sticks: setting a higher sugar import quota, offering economic aid or most-favored-nation trade status, negotiating frozen Cuban assets or waiving compensation for nationalized properties.
How can President Clinton call for democracy in Cuba when his own policy is determined by a handful of reactionary exiles? This is Mr. Clinton's chance to manifest clarity and courage in his foreign policy.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Pressure Grows on Croatian Army Troops to Get Out of Bosnia, Too

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Feb. 17

 BODY:
United Nations observers said today that Croatia appeared to have made little effort to withdraw its regular army troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina despite a sharp warning two weeks ago to start pulling them out or run the risk of economic sanctions.
A senior official at the headquarters of the United Nations Protection Force for the Former Yugoslavia said that rather than withdrawing, regular army troops might be masking their presence by removing their insignia from vehicles and uniforms. 
 While international attention has focused on the threat of air strikes against the guns of Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo, the reports by United Nations observers based here may be the first step toward a much tougher stance toward Croatia.
Up to now, Croatia has had relatively good relations with the United States and the 12 members of the European Union, especially Germany. But there has been growing criticism of Zagreb's links to the most extreme factions of the Bosnian Croats, who continue to wage a fierce battle for control of Mostar, in southwestern Bosnia.
 
8 Army Units Reported
 United Nations observers estimate that Croatia has sent 5,000 troops across the border to aid their ethnic brethren in central Bosnia, where the Muslim-led Bosnian Army has made some gains in the last six weeks. The Bosnian Government puts the figure much higher, upwards of 20,000 troops.
A United Nations official here, speaking on condition of anonymity, said observers had identified soldiers from eight regular Croatian Army units operating in Bosnia. The troops are not part of full Croatian brigades or under the direct control of Croatian command posts, he said.
On Feb. 3, the Security Council sharply condemned the presence of regular Croatian troops in Bosnia and requested a report by the Secretary General on "progress toward the complete and full withdrawal" of the Croatian forces from Bosnia.
Depending on that report, the United Nations could begin to take steps against Croatia, including economic sanctions like those imposed in 1992 against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation.
 
Half an Admission
 Although Croatia has said it has sent only "volunteers" to fight on the side of Bosnian Croats, Foreign Minister Mate Granic offered last weekend to withdraw troops from border areas near Mostar in exchange for United Nations guarantees of safety for Croatian civilians caught in central Bosnia.
United Nations observers said earlier this month that they had seen a Croatian convoy, including more than a dozen trucks and weapons like mortars and antiaircraft guns, crossing the border from southern Bosnia into Croatia. But they said they did not consider this a sign that the Croats had initiated a significant movement of troops.
[In a letter sent Thursday to the Security Council, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported that "there may still be 5,000" regular Croatian Army troops in Bosnia. He also said Croatia had failed to present proposals for monitoring the withdrawal of forces from Bosnia.]
The United States has been especially critical of Croatia's military involvement in Bosnia. The Ambassador, Peter W. Galbraith, said at a forum tonight in Zagreb that Croatia has undermined the sympathy it had drawn as a victim of Serbian aggression in 1991.
 
The Serbs in Croatia
 "How can Croatia expect the international community to support its demand for Serb withdrawal from Croatia when its army is in the sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina?" Mr. Galbraith asked. "How can Croatia expect the international community to expend vast resources to uphold Croatia's frontiers when it seeks to violate those of another country?"
About 30 percent of Croatia is still occupied by Serbian troops as a result of the fighting that broke out between the Yugoslav Army and Croatia after the federation broke up in 1991.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
A Plea From Belgrade
 Arguing that sanctions were threatening the "very existence" of ordinary people, Yugoslavia's Prime Minister appealed yesterday to the Clinton Administration to take the pressure off Belgrade.
Even if international sanctions were lifted this year and the economy grew 4 percent a year, Yugoslavia would not regain its previous level of production until 2012, the Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, said in an address to the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan.
The United Nations imposed the sanctions in May 1992 in retaliation for Belgrade's aid to the Serbian nationalists' forces campaign in Bosnia.
Mr. Kontic said Yugoslavia, which now includes only Serbia and Montenegro, had lost about $25 billion in output as a result of the embargo, and expects to lose $15 billion more this year.
He said the sanctions had produced "a sharp social stratification into a small group of rich war profiteers and smugglers and a vast population whose very existence is threatened." Mr. Kontic also said the embargo had strengthened the hand of political extremists and racketeers.
Mr. Kontic called on the Clinton Administration to become more involved in persuading Bosnia's Muslim-led Government to accept the peace plan put forward by the European Union and international mediators.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Aides and Yankees Meet to Discuss Stadium Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
After the first face-to-face meeting between officials of the Giuliani administration and the New York Yankees, the team expressed optimism about the city's plans to keep the franchise at Yankee Stadium beyond the end of its lease in 2002.
"It went very well," said David Sussman, the team's general counsel. "It was very informative, but it'll still very formative." 
 The city's latest package of inducements to persuade the team to stay in the Bronx includes plans to renovate Yankee Stadium, restoring much of the ball park's 1923 look; adding scores of new luxury suites; improving the Major Deegan Expressway and other roadways, as well as building a garage for several thousand more cars, a Metro-North Commter Railroad station, and a retail arcade or major regional shopping mall.
The three Yankees officials who met at City Hall with Deputy Mayor John Dyson did not include George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the principal owner, who will make the final decision on staying in the Bronx or moving.
"Some parts of their plan were definite, others were just concepts," Mr. Sussman said. "Now they're looking to see what the Yankees and George want." Mr. Steinbrenner, a vice president of the United States Olympic Committee, returned yesterday from Norway, where he was attending the Winter Olympics.
Mr. Dyson refused to estimate the cost of renovating Yankee Stadium and its environs, although estimates from other city officials are from $250 million to $300 million.
"We don't know what it will cost," Mr. Dyson said. "It'll be a lot of money but worth every nickel."
The cost will be borne in unequal parts, by the city, state and perhaps the Federal Government, for road reconstruction.
Despite a huge budget deficit facing the city and the possibility of municipal layoffs, Mr. Dyson said the city can justify spending to keep the Yankees in the Bronx as part of an economic development effort to revive the downtown Bronx.
"The money for this would be spent four or five years into the future," Mr. Dyson said. "The city will be straightenend out and we'll be able to handle the borrowing."
"Five or six" private developers have been approached "to find out if some of our ideas are feasible and would they invest in them," Mr. Dyson said.
As he left City Hall yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who did not attend the meeting, said: "The city and the Yankees have to meet and talk and understand exactly what the issues are. The bottom line is the Yankees are very important to the city and the city is very important to the Yankees."
Asked what he would do if the Yankees left New York City, Mr. Giuliani said, "It would be very embarrassing to see a grown mayor cry."
City officials believe their chances of keeping the Yankees in New York have been enhanced by statements from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey that the state would not make a deal to build a stadium for the Yankees if it required using taxpayer money. She recently refused to proceed with a plan to build an arena for the Philadelphia 76ers in Camden because she felt taxpayers would incur a liability.
"I don't think we'll be in a competitive battle with New Jersey," Mr. Dyson said. "We're in a competitive battle with ourselves, rather than worry about what the competition is doing."
In part because of the perceived threat posed by New Jersey's Sports and Exposition Authority, the race to keep the Yankees in their 71-year-old home heated up last summer. City and state officials started to respond regularly to Mr. Steinbrenner's desires to generate more revenues from luxury suites and for improved parking, security, roadway access and sanitation.
In addition to presenting ways to renovate "The House That Ruth Built," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo at one point suggested building a $530 million stadium and garage complex south of the Jacobs Javits Convention Center on Manhattan's West Side.

HEADLINE: Inflation Nervousness Sends Stocks Sliding

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The inflation news was so startlingly good yesterday that bond traders did not believe it. So bond prices tumbled and, after some hesitation, so did stock prices.
A wide range of blue-chip stocks that have benefited in the recent rally dropped in price, including I.B.M., Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Philip Morris and General Motors. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.63 points, to 3,922.64; the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 2.45, to 470.34, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.38, to 790.24.
Trading was heavy at 340 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, whose composite index fell 1.17 points, to 261.38. Declining stocks led advancing stocks by 1,251 to 882. The American Stock Exchange market value index also fell 0.86 point, to 474.46.
 
Rebound Is Expected
 But analysts expect a recovery in both the bond and stock markets today, when there are no economic statistics scheduled for release.
"If the bond market is any good on Friday," said Frederic I. Leiner, bond market strategist for Continental Bank in Chicago, "it'll dig itself out of this hole quickly, in maybe one or two trading sessions, and probably lift the stock market."
Don Hays, the stock investment strategist for Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond, said yesterday's fall was good for stocks because it would make for a more solid advance later. "The Dow should rally 18 points Friday, even if the bond market doesn't rally," he said. "It's a real bruised market after the Fed raised interest rates. It's healing, but it's still tender."
Yesterday, before the stock market opened at 9:30 A.M., the Labor Department reported that the prices consumers pay for goods and services were unchanged in January, the first time the Consumer Price Index failed to climb in five and a half years.
Government economists explained that if they had retained a previous method of calculation, the Consumer Price Index would have risen three-tenths of a percent, which is what Wall Street had expected.
 
Another View on Prices
 By 10 A.M., however, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia released its February Business Outlook Survey, indicating that manufacturing was strong and prices were rising. Later in the morning, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a television briefing at the White House that the United States economy probably grew faster in the final three months of last year than was previously estimated.
Both reports fed bond traders' anxiety about inflation. After falling briefly, the yield on the closely watched long bond, a key indicator of inflation concerns, surged to a six-and-a-half-month high.
That quickly fed stock traders' anxiety about inflation, ending three consecutive rising sessions for the Dow industrials, the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index. Shortly after 1 P.M., the Dow began falling in earnest.
Telephone, financial services, automobile and computer stocks were all off sharply and helped drag down the S.& P. 500.
In the 30-stock Dow industrials, five components made the biggest contribution to the fall: I.B.M., which dropped 1 7/8, to 52 3/4; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which dropped 1 1/2, to 108; Philip Morris, which fell 1 1/4, to 58; General Motors, slipping 1 1/8, to 59 7/8, and Procter & Gamble, declining 1 1/8, to 58.25.
There was no discernible news about the companies, besides worries over inflation, to account for the price drops.
The United States Surgical Corporation was the most active stock on any exchange at 10.7 million shares after it lost an important patent case Wednesday and then warned of a worse-than-expected quarterly loss. It fell 3, to 18 1/2 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lotus Development was the second-most-active stock on any exchange at 8.2 million shares. The computer software company rose 6 1/2, to 66 1/2, after an analyst recommendation and a trade press report that Lotus was talking with A.T.& T. to jointly develop sophisticated computer-messaging equipment for corporate users.

HEADLINE: Greece Closes Macedonia's Main Trade Route

BYLINE: Special to The New York TimesAP

DATELINE: ATHENS, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Greece forged ahead in its fight with Macedonia today, closing the former Yugoslav republic's main trade route and drawing angry protests from other members of the European Union.
European Union officials criticized Greece for acting without consulting other nations in the organization, which agreed last year to cooperate in developing a common foreign policy. 
 Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, furious over Western diplomatic recognition of Macedonia, on Wednesday ordered that the northern port of Salonika be closed to all goods bound for landlocked Macedonia except for food and medicine.
Greece contends that Macedonia's name and national symbols are historically Greek and thus imply a desire to control the northern Greek province that is also called Macedonia. Greece is trying to press its neighbor to change its name and guarantee that it will not make claims on Greek territory.
"We want this crisis to be an opportunity to solve the problem," said Foreign Under Secretary George Papandreou, the Prime Minister's son.
Macedonia, which denies having designs on Greek land, accused Greece of "taking advantage of our position as a landlocked country."
Greek officials at the border said goods moving to and from Macedonia were being blocked. Port officials in Salonika, about 43 miles south of the border, said ships had stopped loading and unloading Macedonian shipments.
Most of Macedonia's foreign trade moves through Salonika, including about two-thirds of its oil. Officials in Macedonia said they had oil reserves for about two months, and reports from Skopje, the capital, said long lines were already forming at gasoline stations.
The embargo is likely to increase friction in the 12-nation European Union, in which Greece currently holds the six-month rotating presidency.
"It is not good for European construction," said Bruno Dethomas, a spokesman for the Union's Commission, its executive agency in Brussels. "We will ask for clarifications."
Foreign Minister Helveg Petersen of Denmark called the embargo "seriously alarming" He said he would raise the issue at an European Union meeting on Monday. "I must suggest the Greek Government regain its composure and withdraw its decisions regarding Macedonia -- especially the one about economic measures," Mr. Petersen said in New York.
A spokesman for the union's External Affairs Commissioner, Hans van den Broek, said the issue also would be discussed Friday at a previously scheduled meeting between the Greek, Belgian and German Foreign Ministers and Mr. van den Broek.

HEADLINE: U.S. Indicts G.E. and De Beers in Diamond Pricing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury indicted the General Electric Company, De Beers Centenary A.G. and two European businessmen today on a single count of conspiring to raise and fix prices in the half-billion-dollar-a-year worldwide industrial diamond industry.
The two companies control about four-fifths of the international market for industrial diamonds, which are mainly produced synthetically from carbon under extremely high pressure and temperature, and which are embedded in saws and drills for use in cutting stone and concrete. 
 The indictment, by a grand jury in Columbus, Ohio, accuses the companies of having used the two European businessmen to exchange list prices in order to raise prices early in 1992. It is one of the biggest cases that the Justice Department has ever filed charging an international violation of United States antitrust law.
Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the department's antitrust division, said the Government "will not tolerate anticompetitive acts by two firms who dominate their worldwide markets, or sophisticated schemes that are used to fix prices and to disguise criminal activity."
"The division will actively prosecute such international cartels," she said.
General Electric denied wrongdoing, arguing that the case was based on recently recanted allegations by a dismissed executive.
"The Government has no direct evidence or testimony of price-fixing," it said in a statement.
The executive referred to is Edward J. Russell, a former General Electric vice president who ran the company's industrial diamond division. He sued G.E. nearly two years ago for wrongful dismissal, saying he lost his job for objecting to price-fixing in the industrial diamond market.
But Mr. Russell dropped his suit and signed an affidavit on Wednesday stating that he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing. In return, General Electric agreed to grant him the medical and life insurance benefits it gives to retired executives and paid part of his legal bills, said Joyce Hergenhan, a spokeswoman for the company.
"This is an effort by the Government," Ms. Hergenhan added, "to salvage its two years and millions of dollars by filing a case that has no merit."
A Justice Department spokeswoman, Gina M. Talamona, called Mr. Russell's suit "a separate matter." Mr. Russell did not return calls today to his home in Dublin, Ohio.
Calls to De Beers Centenary, at its headquarters in Lucerne, Switzerland, were not answered. The company has ownership links with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African corporation best known for its dominance in the natural diamond industry.
The two indicted businessmen could not be reached for comment. One of them is Peter Frenz, a German citizen and the managing director of the European operations of General Electric's industrial diamond business. The other is Philippe Liotier, a French citizen and the former chief executive of Diamant Boart S.A., a Brussels-based tool manufacturer that buys industrial diamonds from General Electric and De Beers. The Justice Department said Mr. Liotier was also a former director of a company with ownership links to De Beers.
In Columbia, S.C., an official of Diamant Boart America, said, "We really can't comment because of the ongoing investigation."
In the past, De Beers Centenary has denied any wrongdoing in the industrial diamond market.
 
Possible Penalties
 Companies found guilty of violating the antitrust law involved in this case are subject to fines up to $10 million, or twice any gain from a crime or twice the cost to the victims, whichever is greater. Individuals are subject to fines up to $350,000 and as long as three years in prison.
Ms. Hergenhan, the G.E. spokeswoman, said the industrial diamond division accounted for less than one-half of 1 percent of the company's sales last year.
The indictment was announced at midafternoon today, while United States financial markets were still open, but well after the closing of South African and European exchanges. In Nasdaq trading, the American depository receipts of De Beers Consolidated Mines closed down 87.5 cents, at $23.625. General Electric shares closed at $109.125, up 37.5 cents, on the Big Board.
No estimate of General Electric's or De Beers' allegedly illegal gains were given in the indictment, and Ms. Talamona of the Justice Department declined to provide estimates.
G.E. said in a statement that differences between the prices of its industrial diamonds and De Beers' products had increased during the months after the alleged price fixing. Before early 1992, 64 percent of saw diamond sales involved products with the same list price, while almost no sales have been at the same list prices since then, the company said.
As imports and exports account for a growing part of the United States economy, the Justice Department has expressed more and more interest in pursuing international antitrust cases. The department in 1992 ended a self-imposed restriction against filing cases.
Speaking of today's indictment, James R. Loftis 3d, an antitrust lawyer at Collier, Shannon, Rill & Scott here, said, "This signals no fear going against large companies in complicated international settings."

HEADLINE: Serious Subway Crimes Continued Falling in 1993, Transit Police Say

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Serious crime reported in the subways fell by 11.2 percent last year, and has declined by more than one-third since 1990, the transit police announced yesterday. But the police and various officials, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, predicted that few New Yorkers would believe it.
Felonies reported to the police, including homicides, rapes and attempted rapes, robberies, serious assaults, burglaries and grand larcenies, fell to 11,763, from 13,250 in 1992. The figure equals about 32 felonies a day, down from 50 a day in 1990. 
 "Confrontational crime, the kind our customers fear the most, is now at its best level since 1979," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent body of the agency that runs the subways and buses.
There were more arrests for carrying weapons and drugs, but that is good news, the police said, because most of those suspects were caught jumping turnstiles. Catching them at the entrances, said the Chief of the transit police, Michael F. O'Connor, means they are stopped "before proceeding to begin felonious conduct."
Chief O'Connor and others attributed the decline to an increase in officers, to 4,300 now from 3,800 in 1990, and $40 million in 1991, mostly for overtime, training, better radios, cars and emergency vehicles, and a computerized mug-shot system.
Alan F. Kiepper, the president of the Transit Authority, said that ridership was up by more than 3 percent last year and by more than 5 percent since the low point in July 1992, and that reduced crime was a factor. "If crime had kept going up, people wouldn't have come back," he said. Another reason, he said, was an improving economy.
The Governor, after praising the transit police at the news conference where the figures were announced, said "most people will rebel" at the idea that the subways are getting safer. "It sure don't feel that way out on the streets, and in life generally," he said. But he said reported robberies, by far the largest category, were down by 4,000 over three years. "That's 4,000 people who were not robbed, or it might be less than 4,000 people who were not robbed more than once," he said.
Mr. Cuomo spoke for 10 minutes on the need for gun control and life terms without parole for people convicted of three serious felonies. "If you are convicted three times of a violent crime, it is because you have probably committed 50 or 100 violent crimes," he said.
 
Better Feelings About Service
 Mr. Cuomo's reading of public feeling about the subway parallels the findings of an annual survey taken last May by the M.T.A. The telephone survey of 1,200 city residents, representing a cross-section of people who make at least four one-way trips a week by some mode of transportation, determined that attitudes about personal security on the subways had been about the same since 1991. People felt a little safer at night last year than in previous years, but less safe during the day on weekends.
But according to the survey, they also felt better about overall subway service, cleanliness and lighting in the stations and other factors that affect feelings of security, like the presence of homeless people and panhandlers in stations and cars.
A less scientific sample drawn from subway platforms yesterday afternoon showed skepticism and some cautious optimism.
"I don't believe it," said Johnnie Walker, a 65-year-old machine presser who commutes from his home on West 148th Street to his job near Times Square. "It looks like the same old thing is happening."
Philip Bares, 42, a real-estate broker who uses the No. 1 and No. 9 trains from Chelsea to take his daughter to preschool near Columbia University, said: "I guess it's good. It's positive. I feel reasonably comfortable."
"I've been riding the subway for 16 years, and I can say they've become cleaner over the last 3 to 4 years," he said. "Even the acoustics in some of the stations have improved."
Whatever the public perception of crime, the numbers come at a good time for the transit police. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed merging it with the Housing Authority's and the city's police. The transportation authority opposes the merger, and Chief O'Connor said yesterday: "Why fix what's not broken? We're an effective department."

HEADLINE: Year's Trade Deficit Widened; December's Shrank

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
The American trade deficit shrank in December, but the United States still posted its largest deficit ever with Japan last year and its biggest overall trade deficit since 1988, the Commerce Department announced today.
The shrinkage of both deficits in December came as American exports continued their five-month climb. As a result, Wall Street economists generally welcomed today's announcement as a sign that foreign demand for American goods remained strong and that American economic growth in the fourth quarter might have been even greater than the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 5.9 percent. 
 But the focus was more on the annual deficit with Japan, which is likely to provide fresh ammunition for the Clinton Administration's trade battles with Tokyo. The deficit with Japan widened last year to $59.32 billion, the biggest bilateral trade gap that the United States has ever accumulated with a foreign country. The Japanese economy has been in a deep recession that has curbed Japanese demand for imported goods, while the expanding American economy has left businesses and individuals here more willing to buy cars, clothing and other products from abroad.
 
Fifth-Largest Deficit
 The nation's overall merchandise trade deficit broadened last year to $115.77 billion, the largest since 1988 and the fifth largest ever. The largest American trade deficit, in 1987, was $152.12 billion.
The December trade deficit was $7.41 billion, down from a revised November level of $9.68 billion. Economists attributed the decline partly to a surge in aircraft exports that may not be repeated soon.
"I think that we will be back to somewhere in the $9 to $10 billion range," for monthly trade deficits in the first quarter of this year, Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said.
President Clinton said in a radio interview from the White House this morning that in trade talks with Japan, "We're going to try to pursue a much more aggressive policy now, which will actually open markets."
Top officials from a half-dozen Federal agencies met here Wednesday night to begin drafting a list of retaliatory measures that the United States might take against Japan following the failure of talks last week between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
"We are reviewing our unilateral options, and we will undoubtedly be taking one or more steps in the short and medium term," possibly next week, said a senior Administration official who requested anonymity.
One likely option for American action against Japan, the official said, would be for President Clinton to reinstate a section of American trade law, known as Super 301, that sets a fast timetable for opening certain foreign markets and mandates sanctions if it is not met.
But a more controversial step mentioned by President Clinton last year -- raising tariffs on imported minivans and sport utility vehicles from the 2.5 percent rate charged on passenger cars to the 25 percent rate charged on light trucks -- is not being actively considered as a near-term option, the official added.
In today's radio interview on the "Imus in the Morning" program, broadcast on WFAN in New York, President Clinton criticized Japanese trade policies at length, saying: "They simply cannot continue to pursue the policy that they pursued when they were a poor country growing rich -- they're now a rich country, and they can't, you know, export to the rest of the world and keep their own markets closed. And I think they know that. And, you know, we're going to work hard and try some different things to push that market open."
The United States exported goods worth $42.23 billion in December, a record, and imported goods worth $49.63 billion. For all of 1993, American exports were $464.77 billion and imports totaled $580.54 billion.
The Commerce Department also revised upward today its estimate of exports in November, the previous record, to $40.24 billion. Stephen L. Cooney Jr., a trade analyst at the National Association of Manufacturers, said that rising American exports in recent months reflected a bottoming out of recessions in several Western European nations, led by Britain, and continued demand from Southeast Asian nations like Thailand that have been little affected by the recent economic sluggishness in the industrialized world.
Today's figures covered trade only in physical goods, like cars or television sets. Beginning with the trade figures for January 1994, the Commerce Department will begin calculating an overall monthly trade balance in goods and services, as well as the merchandise trade balance.

HEADLINE: Japan Looking for Ways To Avert U.S. Trade War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Under growing pressure to prevent the outbreak of a damaging trade war with the United States, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan seems to be hoping that progress, even modest progress, in opening markets will end President Clinton's threats of a trade war.
That strategy became clear today as Mr. Hosokawa asked his top trade bureaucrats to bring him a plan in the next several days for opening markets in sectors of the Japanese economy in which the Government has the most control. He is also dropping hints of returning to the bargaining table. 
 The developments came as the United States reported a record trade deficit with Japan for 1993 and its biggest overall trade deficit since 1988, even though, the Commerce Department announced, the nation's trade deficit shrank in December. [Page D4.]
 
Business Is Screaming
 But while the Prime Minister appeared to be taking the initiative, the proposals his Government is considering -- from new Government procurement rules to drives to import more and new measures to deregulate the Japanese economy -- appear cobbled together from old proposals that the Clinton Administration has already rejected as insufficient.
"Hosokawa is in a very, very tight spot," one of his senior policy advisers said tonight. "He is destitute of a good policy, business is beginning to scream, and he's got to come up with something pretty fast."
The chief Cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, said that the Prime Minister and his advisers "agreed that the ball is in Japan's court." Mr. Takemura suggested that Mr. Hosokawa may soon send another "special envoy" to Washington, much as he did before last week's meeting, to explain to President Clinton what he is doing. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations meet on Feb. 26 in Frankfurt, and the presumption is that Japan would like to have the outlines of a plan ready by then.
The effort to come up with a plan, however, marked a shift in Japan's strategy, fueling a sense that the broad initial support for Mr. Hosokawa's tough response to President Clinton last week is eroding, as the cost to Japanese business mounts.
The yen's sudden lift, along with Mr. Clinton's comments Wednesday that he would be reviewing a series of options for further retaliatory steps, has begun to rattle confidence. One evening newscast here said that Mr. Hosokawa "must be slowly realizing now what his decisions have cost."
If the 5 percent increase in the value of the yen since the trade talks broke down last week is sustained, it would undo Japan's domestic economic stimulus package and could deepen the recession. Corporate profits would be squeezed even further.
That is exactly the pressure that Mr. Clinton's economic team has been trying to bring since Tuesday, when the United States initiated sanctions against Japan in a cellular telephone dispute and sat back as the yen soared. But American officials said it was still too early to declare that their strategy was producing results.
Oddly, perhaps, Mr. Hosokawa is turning for his new alternatives to the very men whom Washington views as the source of the problem: Japan's elite bureaucrats. Neither the Prime Minister nor his staff has much grasp of the intricacies of the trade issues involved, meaning that the policy is still being controlled by the conservative bureaucracy that has opposed the kind of large-scale market changes Mr. Clinton wants. Moreover, Mr. Hosokawa has little choice: The bureaucrats can so easily subvert any plan that is put into effect -- especially deregulation plans -- that he must make them a central part of the decision-making process.
 
Bureaucrat Disappointed
 Today one of those top bureaucrats, Koichiro Matsuura, the deputy minister for foreign affairs, expressed disappointment that Mr. Clinton did not accept an offer the Japanese made to him last week: to resolve several issues "on which we were very close" and produce a compromise in which some market openings would be announced and others deferred for later talks. But Mr. Clinton's team refused to accept any deal that did not include specific pledges for measurable progress in reducing the trade deficit.
In a revealing moment, Mr. Matsuura said that he still saw an enormous gulf between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa's views about the depth of the trade problem.
The problem for Prime Minister Hosokawa is that he lacks the power to bring about the kind of market openings Washington wants. He can only tinker around the edges of the economy.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS: New Fears Emerge Amid Low Inflation;
Bond Prices Dive After Early Rally; Yields Up Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Bond traders, looking for bad news on inflation, found it yesterday, despite the Government's report that January consumer prices were unchanged.
As a result bond prices fell and the yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.54 percent, its highest level since August. 
 Traders said prices of Treasury securities surged in early trading after the Consumer Price Index showed inflation was not growing, easing investor fears of another increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
 
Another Survey Consulted
 But the rally faded as quickly as it started, as hints of inflation reappeared in another Government report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's February Business Outlook Survey. A jump in oil prices added to the reversal.
While long-term interest rates are now the highest since early August, analysts said they did not see them moving as high as 7 percent as long as economic growth does not surge. But the selloff yesterday did indicate to others that there is little chance of the yield falling to 6 percent until traders and investors are assured that inflation will remain in check.
"What the bond market is telling us, is that it remains fearful of potential new inflation," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, a division of Gruntal & Company. "And since the outlook is clouded about what happens next in the economy, the easy answer for investors is to sell."
Mr. Battipaglia said he believed this period of volatility would not have dire consequences. "I think the market is probably establishing a new level of equilibrium, with the yield on the 30-year bond, I think, trading between 6.25 percent and 6.75 percent."
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said he was surprised by the market's selloff yesterday. He said he was always concerned when markets sold on bad news and ignored good news. He said he saw the yield on the long bond in the second quarter at least lower than yesterday.
Mr. Crandall said he did not rely too much on the price index from the Philadelphia Fed because it covered only the early part of February and might have been affected by last week's crippling East Coast storm, which could have contributed to the rise in material prices.
"The last time the market reacted the same way was in early February when the Purchasing Managers Index also showed sharp price gains," Mr. Crandall said. "Investors' reaction to the data today perhaps was as much a response to the memory of the P.M.I., than to the number."
The price of the 30-year bond fell a point and 4/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped from 6.45 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 10-year note also fell sharply with the yield ending at 5.98 percent, up from 5.88 percent. The yield on the two-year note was 4.47 percent, up from 4.40 percent.
Since the Fed raised short-term interest in early February, traders and investors had been trying to divine whether long-term rates would continue to rise or stabilize on the belief that the Fed would keep inflation in check. But because many analysts now think that the rally of 1993 is over, there is a tendency to pay more attention to bad news.
Another concern is whether the trade dispute with Japan will push up consumer prices here. "The Japanese are a very important reason for why we have low inflation," Mr. Battipaglia said. "Their products are very much a part of the consumer-buying pattern and any increase in tariffs or lower trade limits raises prices."
 
Trade Deficit Shrinks
 Other favorable news yesterday included the December merchandise trade data, which showed that the trade deficit shrank to $7.41 billion from a revised $9.68 billion, mostly because of surging exports.
On the Consumer Price Index, the market consensus was for an increase of three-tenths of a percent in January. But when it turned out to be unchanged, many traders and investors concluded that any additional move by the Fed to raise short-term rates could be delayed.
Traders said the early morning rally was fueled solely by the index, which appeared positive throughout. The core rate, excluding food and energy, rose a modest one-tenth of a percent. This was below the two-tenths of a percent increase in December, which itself was revised downward from the previously reported gain of three-tenths of a percent.
Some economists said they did not think the unchanged consumer index would effect the Fed's monetary policy. This is because the January data was, in part, the result of a new method of calculating seasonal adjustment factors that sought to get rid of the sharp -- and usually misleading -- jumps in prices over the last several years in the reports for January, February, March and April.
As a result, investors turned to the inflation data in the Philadelphia survey for signs of how price trends were moving in February. Analysts at MMS International said the Philadelphia data on overall business conditions appeared to be distorted by the weather, as inventories surged and delivery time rose, while shipments and employment fell, all consistent with the impact of severe winter weather.
But it was the rise of the price index in the Philadelphia report thatdrew concern and cut short the rally set off by the Consumer Price Index.
In when-issued trading yesterday the two-year note to be auctioned next week was being offered at a price to yield 4.54 percent, while a five-year note, was offered at a price to yield 5.49 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Selective German Rate Cut Sends the Dollar Up a Little

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar gained slightly against the mark yesterday after the German central bank reduced a benchmark interest rate but signaled that money-market rates would only fall slowly.
The Bundesbank said it would cut the discount rate, the rate charged for loans to commercial banks, by half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent. Lower German interest rates make investments denominated in marks less attractive than those in other currencies, notably dollars. 
 But dealers viewed the rate cut with little enthusiasm, some asserting they had already expected the central bank to continue its policy of gradually easing borrowing. In addition, the bank said it would keep its other benchmark rate, the Lombard, unchanged at 6.75 percent. That is the central bank's rate for lending emergency funds to banks, and it acts as a ceiling on the money market.
In New York, the dollar settled at 1.7265 marks, up from 1.7237 on Wednesday.
"The Bundesbank is trying to reassure the markets that interest rates are coming down in Germany at some point," said Avinash Persaud, currency analyst at J. P. Morgan in London. "But it couldn't deliver them today because it's still very concerned about money-supply growth and wage negotiations."
Gold prices fell yesterday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the April contract, which is the most active, settled at $384.30 an ounce.
 
U.S. Bond Prices Decline
 The dollar got little help from a Treasury market selloff that sharply increased yields on long-term bonds and thus depressed their prices. The bond prices fell even though the Labor Department said consumer prices had been unchanged in January.
The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen. But dealers said the market was very quiet as the market awaited news on trade from United States and Japanese officials. In New York, the doillar settled at 104.35 yen, up from 103.80 yen on Wednesday. The British pound was at $1.4775 in New York, up from $1.4755 on Wednesday's. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday, included: 1.4575 Swiss francs, up from 1.4537; 5.8665 French francs, down from 5.8675; $1.3377 (Canadian), down from $1.3508 (Canadian), and 1,674 Italian lire, down from 1,678.

HEADLINE: From France, Depardieu as God And Other Joys

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
MANY in the French film industry think Gerard Depardieu is God, but only Jean-Luc Godard has dared to take the idea literally. In "Helas Pour Moi" ("Woe Is Me"), the actor plays an ordinary man named Simon whose body is briefly inhabited by God, or so it seems when God's gravelly voice comes out of Simon's mouth, speaking "thine" and "thou," to the astonishment of his wife.
No road company of "The Odd Couple" could have come up with a less likely pair than these two men. The cerebral and often inaccessible Mr. Godard, a master of the French New Wave of the 1960's, has been under a critical and commercial cloud for two decades. Mr. Depardieu is so popular and lucrative a property that a recent story in Variety practically suggested that the French film business might collapse without him. But in "Helas Pour Moi," they inspire each other's best tendencies. Beautifully photographed beside a Swiss lake, the film has a poetry and emotion rarely associated with Mr. Godard. Mr. Depardieu's performance is surprisingly restrained and resonant. 
 The tirades about French film that erupted during the recent GATT talks have mercifully faded away. (To refresh your memory, both sides sounded like little boys squaring off in the playground: "No fair! You're trying to kill us!" the French screamed at Hollywood. "Are not! And your movies stink anyway!" Hollywood yelled back.) "Helas Pour Moi" hints that reports of French film's demise were wildly exaggerated. And there is plenty more evidence in a provocative, exciting series hiding behind a drab, uninviting title: "Cahiers du Cinema Selects Recent French Films."
The series of a dozen films, most made within the last year and being shown in this country for the first time, begins today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center and runs through March 1. It is the third annual installment of the program, chosen by the Film Society of Lincoln Center along with editors of the French journal Cahiers du Cinema.
Even in France, Cahiers has far less influence than it did 30 years ago, when its best critics turned to film making and created the personal, fluent style of the New Wave. But the journal still champions films that reveal a director's distinctive vision and signature.
Though this year's series includes several names from the Cahiers pantheon, the program is not bathed in nostalgia. Eric Rohmer's "Tale of Winter," Claude Chabrol's documentary "The Eye of Vichy" and the Godard film present those directors in top form. And a documentary by Serge Toubiana and Michel Pascal, "Francois Truffaut: Stolen Portraits," is a surprising view of the much-loved director as his family and colleagues saw him.
 
Teen-Age Werther
 One of the most charming films will be shown on Sunday and Monday. Jacques Doillon's "Young Werther" is more lighthearted and engaging than its title and plot make it sound. Ismael, the film's endearing 15-year-old hero, is not the suicidal Werther character based on Goethe's novel; his friend, Guillaume, is. Early on, Ismael and his friends learn of Guillaume's suicide and spend the rest of the film talking about life, love and death, and trying to track down the young woman who might have broken their friend's heart and left him in despair. "Young Werther" is most affecting in the way it gives adult weight to its unmistakably teen-age characters.
"Helas Pour Moi," showing today, Sunday and Monday, is not as easy to slip into, but its rewards are profound. Mr. Godard's sometimes fragmented narrative is broken by chapter titles and words on the screen. Townspeople tell what they know of Simon's possibly miraculous transformation, as if they were a Greek chorus. It helps to know that the story was inspired in part by the Greek legend of Amphitryon, whose body Zeus borrowed to seduce the man's wife. Mr. Godard's rigorous film mirrors the complexity of his themes: the process of storytelling; rediscovering traditions; the possibility of believing in God. All these ideas are eloquently embodied in Mr. Depardieu's sorrowful Simon. "Helas Pour Moi" will also be shown at the Joseph Papp Public Theater from March 18 to 31.
Mr. Chabrol's "Eye of Vichy" is an engrossing look at French propaganda films and newsreels made for the collaborationist government of Marshall Petain during World War II. As the narrator notes at the start, the film depicts France "not as it was, but as Petain and the collaborators wanted it to be seen." The film could have used more context. How many French people saw these films? What Allied or Resistance works might have counterbalanced them? But this firsthand evidence of what was put forth as happy news -- unemployed French find jobs in Germany and Petain is beloved by children all over France -- is still chilling.
"Francois Truffaut: Stolen Portraits" plays off the title of Truffaut's own "Stolen Kisses." As a film it is merely competent, but as a glimpse at the director it is fascinating. More a professional view than a personal one, it nonetheless has moments of wrenching personal tenderness. Here is Mr. Depardieu again (maybe he is a one-man industry) reading a despairing letter Truffaut wrote while he was in a juvenile detention home.
 
A Rohmer Substitution
 A new Rohmer film, "The Tree, the Mayor and the Mediatheque," was originally scheduled for the series, but at the last minute legal tangles kept it away. No one should complain about its substitute, though. Mr. Rohmer's charming and wise "Tale of Winter" is the story of a young woman who is misplaced by her lover. She gives him a wrong address, goes home to have his child and blithely assumes that one day he will turn up again. Meanwhile, she gets on with her life. Romantic and wry at once, "A Tale of Winter" suggests that while the French film industry is far from dead, it does not have an easy time in the United States. This film was shown at the 1992 New York Film Festival and is only now about to be released commercially, sometime in the spring.
Fifteen years ago, when it cost far less to distribute a film and there were more art houses around the country, many of the films in this series would automatically have had theatrical releases here. That they have struggled to be seen raises a crucial question: have action movies and juvenile comedies forced them out of the marketplace, or are they simply not very good? The answer, of course, is a little of both.
Not every French film is a gem. The series includes all three features by Leos Carax, a favorite of the New York Film Festival. "Les Amants du Pont Neuf," about two straggly lovers (Juliette Binoche and Denis Lavant) who live under a bridge and find themselves soul mates during the French bicentennial celebration, is nearly unwatchable. But the overwhelming majority of films on the program deserve an audience. This enticing series should help them find it. Whether anyone finds God in Gerard Depardieu is quite another story.
 
Cahiers Films And Times
 "Cahiers du Cinema Selects Recent French Films," a retrospective of films that have been cited for excellence by the French film journal, will be shown through March 1 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street.

HEADLINE: Bring Back the Wise Men

BYLINE: By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the former President, is chairman of the Carter Center.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Ever since Japan became one of our most important trade partners and competitors, differences in national policies and priorities have threatened to degenerate into a counterproductive trade war. The current standoff is the most threatening in recent years and could have extremely serious consequences.
Such disputes are hardly unexpected, given the integration of Japan's Government and private sectors and its extreme dependence on exports. There is little doubt that Japan, a relatively closed society, has alliances among corporations that would violate American antitrust laws as well as safeguarded paths of product delivery from raw-material suppliers through manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to consumers. 
 National laws and customs perpetuate these arrangements, making penetration of the market very difficult for foreigners unless they find a way to become part of the system.
In fairness to the Japanese, our laws almost completely exclude foreign imports that compete with vulnerable or politically powerful American industries or farm producers. Then, too, until recently most of our manufacturers depended on our enormous domestic market for sales, with relatively little emphasis an exports.
With a few notable exceptions, our consumer goods are not designed to accommodate the exceptional preferences of foreign consumers: How many Japanese cars would Americans buy if all their steering wheels were on the right side?
Still, there are situations and products that require attention at the highest level in Washington to enhance equitable access to markets, protect domestic employment and prevent the dumping of foreign goods here at or below production cost.
These factors are exacerbated by domestic political pressures, with leaders of both nations striving to avoid blame for economic problems and to gain credit for spirited actions and words against economic competitors. Fiery language, threats and step-by-step sanctions can escalate almost beyond control.
There is a proven alternative to counterproductive sanctions, public condemnations and arguments. In the late 1970's, a U.S.-Japan Economic Relations Group meet regularly and privately to address the multiple trade problems that inevitably arose.
The Prime Minister appointed four Japanese and I chose four Americans. Soon known as "wise men," all were respected senior statesmen knowledgeable about life and politics in both countries. The co-chairman were former ambassadors Robert Ingersoll and Nobuhiko Ushiba. With them were A.W. Clausen, Hugh Patrick, Edson Spencer, Akio Morita, Shuzo Muramato and Kiichi Seeki. They had no authority and only advised the President, Prime Minister and special trade representatives.
Controversial issues -- like those involving the quantity of imported shoes, TV sets and cars -- were referred to them. For example, Japan quietly accepted a proposal that it limit the number of cars exported to America and begin a program of producing Japanese cars here. Another resolved crisis related to allegations that the Japanese were dumping certain kinds of steel products on the American market at prices below those demanded in Japan.
The wise men's suggestions (almost always unanimous) were shared with top national leaders, who were still free to become personally involved or to initiate a public debate. The system worked remarkably well. Developing problems could be addressed almost immediately before they became controversies, and the result of actions taken could be assessed quickly. There was almost total freedom of communication, confidentiality was preserved and the need for face-saving and political rhetoric were minimized.
The President and Special Trade Representative were provided with sound and well-balanced advice on which to make decisions. Among private business and financial leaders in both countries, knowledge that the wise men had considered an issue and made a joint recommendation carried great weight and helped remove the stigma of politicization.
The wise men were disbanded soon after Ronald Reagan was inaugurated. The same system can work again and be initiated almost immediately. It would pay rich dividends.

HEADLINE: Mr. Cuomo's Medicaid Cure

 BODY:
For years, Gov. Mario Cuomo has proposed having New York State take over the share paid by local governments for Medicaid -- the program of medical insurance for the poor. But never did he take the next step of budgeting money to pay for the worthy plan. That changed this week when the Governor proposed spending $110 million next year as a first installment of a phased Medicaid takeover.
Release of the money is contingent on Albany passing a multi-year takeover plan. In the past the Republican-led Senate has balked. But the election of a Republican Mayor in New York City, and dozens of Republican county executives around the state clamoring for Medicaid relief, might wilt that opposition. That makes Mr. Cuomo's decision to push his plan forward not only good public policy but also astute election-year campaigning. 
 Once a plan is passed, New York City will learn how much of the $110 million it will collect. But a rough guess is that the city would gain about $75 million over the next 13 months, and -- if the state puts up comparable money in its next budget -- perhaps $130 million before July 1995. That matches the figure its Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, penciled in the city budget to balance next year's books.
New York is one of the few states that makes local governments pick up part of the tab for Medicaid, and it sticks those governments with the highest costs of any state. Next year New York City will spend about $2.5 billion on the program. It ought to pay nothing. The nation's poor should be a national responsibility, with Washington paying the entire tab. Short of that unlikely outcome, the state should pay Medicaid bills for all its poor citizens.
What Governor Cuomo proposes falls short of a full state assumption of the costs. He would slowly have the state take over Medicaid. But in return, counties would turn over to Albany a small fraction of their sales tax revenue, and New York City would turn over some of its personal income tax revenue. In the first couple of years the swap would be nearly even. But if Medicaid costs continue to explode, the city and counties would eventually come out ahead.
When the Governor presented his 1995 budget in January, he put up no money for a takeover. But Mayor Giuliani lobbied hard. And recent projections show that the state will, because of economic recovery, take in more tax revenue next year than originally estimated. Mr. Cuomo proposes using most of this to finance the initial cost.
Local governments face the danger that, with national health reform on the horizon, Medicaid costs will slow down while the taxes they gave away keep rising, so the swap might cost them money. But Mr. Cuomo proposes a "hold harmless" clause to guarantee that the city and counties would never turn over more tax revenue to the state than they would have spent on Medicaid.
However, there is a possible catch. Suburban executives are backing the Governor's initiative because they too are promised Medicaid budget relief. But everyone can't win. If New York City and other high-poverty regions come out ahead, then suburban taxpayers would presumably foot the bill through higher statewide taxes. Suburban leaders may be betting that the takeover will be financed not by taxes but by spending cuts -- in social programs that the better-off suburbs do not much use. If that happens, the "hold harmless" clause won't entirely work: The city would pay for part of its Medicaid relief by losing other state money.
Thus the Governor's plan poses some risk. But spending cuts for New York City are unlikely to exceed Medicaid relief, so the risk is worth taking. The city is spending nearly one-third of its revenues on the poor. That is unsustainable. The Governor proposes significant relief.

Political Crime

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
At the urging of President Clinton and many other politicians of both parties, the United States is about to embark on a remarkable new social program. It is to house, feed and provide geriatric support services for elderly Americans who have led worthless, harmful lives.
That will be one result of "three strikes, you're out," the much-touted proposal to put criminals away for life after a third violent felony. It would make state and Federal prisons hold increasing numbers of men past the age of violence, living on into their 80's and 90's. 
 If the Federal Government and the states considering the idea go ahead with it, the cost will be enormous. Philip Heymann, who has just left the job of Deputy Attorney General, estimates that it will cost between $600,000 and $700,000 to keep one person in prison for life after age 50, when the statistics show that criminal careers run down.
Mr. Heymann, speaking out after he returned to private life, said what most students of the crime problem privately believe: The three-strikes proposal and much else in the crime bill passed by the Senate will do little if anything to reduce violent crime.
"It's feeling good by appearing to be tough," Mr. Heymann said on ABC's "Nightline." Ted Koppel, who is usually so wise an interviewer, sneered at Mr. Heymann as "a lousy politician." Telling the truth about the phoniness of much crime legislation risks sneers, and that is why few have the courage to do it.
Politicians produce tough-looking remedies for crime because that is what voters want. The public is right to be angry and fearful about crime. Though statistics do not show a recent rise in violence, people are aware of drive-by shootings, the murder of children and other random horrors. They want to be tough: longer sentences, more prisons, boot camps. But the question is whether that kind of toughness will reduce violence.
The United States has more prisoners per capita than any other country: 455 per 100,000. That is 10 times the rate in Japan. There are almost one million Americans in prison today, three times the number in 1990.
The number of prisoners is so large, and growing so rapidly, for two main reasons. This country imposes penal sentences for minor drug offenses. And in recent years Congress and some states have imposed mandatory minimum sentences, without parole, for a number of crimes.
We tend to think of people who are sent to prison as depraved and brutal. Many, probably most, are in fact nonviolent offenders. About 20 percent of Federal prisoners are drug offenders with no prior record, no violence and no connection with any big drug operation.
Consider the case of Joel Proyect, a lawyer in upstate New York, former president of the Sullivan County Bar Association. He grew marijuana plants at his place in the country. He was not a dealer, not a seller, just a user of pot. He is now serving a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in Federal prison.
Joel Proyect was wrong to violate the law. But can it conceivably benefit our society to keep him in prison for five years for growing marijuana plants? And there are many thousands like him.
This country needs to reduce its prison population. It needs to get away from mandatory minimum sentences. Janet Reno knew that and said so before she became Attorney General. But the Clinton White House, determined to make the President look tough on crime, has evidently muzzled her.
The Senate crime bill would cost upwards of $22 billion. That kind of money would make a difference in a serious effort to deter violent crime, but the Senate bill is not that. It is a rag-bag of politicians' gestures, such as turning local offenses into Federal crimes, that will do nothing except waste money and frustrate citizens concerned about crime.
The saddest thing about the political posturing over crime is that it turns us back toward remedies proved useless: more prisons, longer fixed sentences and the like. The politicians, from President Clinton down, are determined not to let a new thought on drug policy or the causes of crime enter our failed system.
A headline in The Economist of London put it exactly: "Three strikes, you're hoodwinked."

HEADLINE: Medical Prices Outrun The Rate of Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Today we hear that sweeping national health care reform may not be necessary because competition has broken the back of health care inflation. While medical care prices were increasing at 9.1 percent in 1990, they had fallen to 7.2 percent by the end of 1992 and to about 5.9 percent by the end of 1993.
Exactly 10 years ago, the Reagan Administration proudly announced that it had "broken the back of the health care inflation monster that has plagued us for more than two decades." That inflation rate had fallen from 10.8 percent in 1981 to 6.3 percent in 1984. But then, as now, most of the decline reflected the decline in overall inflation. Today, medical prices are rising 2.4 times faster than general inflation, considerably higher than in 1990. 
 The high rate at which the prices and use of medical services erode corporate profits and cut into state and Federal budgets for crime control, education and investments in economic growth certainly looks like a crisis. Spiraling prices also contribute to the personal crisis of people no longer sure their health insurance company will cover their medical bills. Thus, when leading Republicans dismiss the grave concerns of the Clintons as "a brazen campaign of fear-mongering" about a nonexistent crisis, they mislead the public.
After more than a decade of the most intense competition in medical care, both prices and overall expenditures rose proportionately faster during the 1980's than in the 70's.
Costs are not slowing now either, but competition is making a lot of money for a lot of people. Containing costs in the long run, now as in 1983, will greatly depend on the limits that are put on the total budget for spending. Sad to say, I suspect the United States will have no serious controls on total health care budgets 10 years from now.

HEADLINE: In Haiti, Oil Embargo Increases Suffering

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We recently returned from a medical mission in rural Haiti, where we observed rapidly deteriorating living conditions as a result of the United States-led United Nations oil embargo. Most of us are veterans of previous medical missions in rural Haiti; some of us have returned annually for more than a decade. 
 We observed a drastic reduction in medical and preventative health services provided to rural Haitians. Compared with January 1993, attendance at rural illness clinics is down 70 percent, surgical cases at regional hospitals are down 75 percent, and the number of immunizations and family planning services dispensed has similarly declined.
Public transportation (in rural Haiti on the back of dangerously overcrowded pickup trucks called "taptaps") has declined nearly 85 percent, and the cost has increased 500 percent, beyond the reach of most Haitians. Thus, poor rural Haitians cannot receive badly needed health care. Their health, already the worst in the Western Hemisphere, will certainly decline further as the embargo continues. The oil embargo is a de facto embargo on medical and preventative health care for rural Haiti.
Similarly, we observed decreased availability of food and an apparent increase in malnutrition. Although food is not specifically embargoed, the main sources of nutrition for rural Haitians (beans and rice) are imported and must be transported to the highlands. With transportation less available and more expensive, the price of rice and beans in the marketplace has more than doubled.
We noticed an increase in the number of children with the orange hair, thin limbs and swollen abdomens characteristic of malnutrition. This burden is added to a high rate of serious childhood malnutrition (some 25 percent) in rural Haitian children. The oil embargo is a de facto food embargo for rural Haiti.
The deliberate promotion of malnutrition and disease in Haiti is morally unacceptable to us. We believe most Americans would agree if they saw the new suffering the embargo has caused. Although the best way for our Government to proceed is not yet apparent, we are certain the oil embargo further victimizes the Haitian people. The oil embargo should be lifted. Now.

HEADLINE: Deciding to Escape Los Angeles: The Earthquake Tipped the Scale

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Two days after the earthquake, and two decades after he had arrived here from Chicago, Leo Fasciocco, a financial writer, packed up his family and his car and headed for solid ground -- Phoenix.
A week later, Karin Kugel quit her secretarial job and drove cross country, to Tampa, Fla., returning for good 13 years after she had left. 
 Last week, Larry Levine, a resident of Los Angeles since 1939, gave notice at the drugstore where he is a pharmacist that he would be moving to Las Vegas, Nev., next Friday -- four years ahead of schedule.
Stefan Becker, 25, boarded a train Sunday morning, heading home, back to winter, and Boston. Until Friday he had been an international development coordinator for a cable television entertainment network. He left with his earthquake survival kit -- just in case -- and no job.
"I was brought up in New England," he said at his farewell party last Saturday night, at Cafe Figaro in West Hollywood. "You stick things out. You never leave a job without another job. The earthquake just shattered all that. Suddenly, I felt freed of Los Angeles. For me, personally, it's not worth it -- pending earthquakes, isolated people, hidden agendas."
New York and Los Angeles are still both destinations, cities that people dream of going to. "You get out of school, and what do you do?" Mr. Becker said. "You go West."
Or East. Both cities are also places that people talk incessantly of leaving -- and, eventually, many do get out. In the last few years, with the riots, rising crime, a series of natural disasters and, most significantly, the persistent recession, the exit from Los Angeles has been building.
Last year an estimated 426,000 Americans moved out of Los Angeles County, and 256,000 moved in -- for a net population loss of 170,000, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The state population growth rate was at 1.4 percent -- the lowest in 21 years -- with Southern California showing the slowest growth rate in the state, at 1.2 percent, according to the State Finance Department.
 
Anecdotal Evidence
 No one, though, is suggesting that Los Angeles is going to lose its vibrancy -- in fact, foreign immigration continues its rapid pace -- and to date there is no statistical record of a post-earthquake exodus. But it is not hard to find anecdotal evidence that some people are leaving. Ten people who were interviewed for this article have either already gone or have firm departure plans. All of them said they had been thinking about moving for some time. The earthquake gave them a sense of urgency.
For Marlene Besso, paradise changed irrevocably with the 1992 riots. But she would not consider giving up her rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica until the earthquake that occurred a month ago today.
"The earthquake was the most horrifying experience of my life," said Ms. Besso, a bookkeeper from Buffalo. "I was all alone. Immediately I said, 'I'm out of here.' "
One indicator of the level of unease here is a recent Field Poll, taken in late January, in which 7 percent of those surveyed in Los Angeles County said they were very likely to move because of the quake. Thirty percent said they have considered moving because of fears of another earthquake.
 
Thinking About Moving On
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion and killed 61 people, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce has been receiving 40 to 50 calls per day from Southern Californians wanting relocation information. The Las Vegas Chamber reports double the number of such requests from Californians since January.
Just about everyone seems to know of someone who began packing after the earthquake. Bill Dertouzos, a chef at a Beverly Hills restaurant, said his next-door neighbor, whose name he never did learn, held a lawn sale shortly after the earthquake, and then left. "He said to me, 'Are you still here?' " said Mr. Dertouzos, a native New Yorker, adding that he plans to be gone within a year.
Josefina Vidal, the features editor for La Opinion, the primary Spanish-language newspaper here, said that at a shelter two weeks ago she met a group of 23 Mexican immigrants -- three large families and their friends, all legal, longtime residents of Southern California -- who were on their way to Dallas. They had already been mulling a move because of the poor economy, Ms. Vidal said.
Southern California was supposed to be the easy life. It still is, on good days. But lately the good days have been fewer in number. The stories of those who are leaving now are the stories of Americans searching, in the aftermath of a disaster, for what has eluded them here -- an affordable house, love, roots, security.
 
The Columnist
Family's Safety Above All Else
 Leo Fasciocco came for the warm weather and his career, and left because of his children, Michael, 6, and Glorianne, 3. In January 1973, he recalled in a telephone interview from Arizona, he was a reporter in the Chicago bureau of the Reuters news agency. "I was walking across a parking lot one afternoon," he said. "Snow was coming down. It was zero degrees. I said to myself, 'Gee, I wonder what it's like in California.' "
A year later he had transferred to the news agency's Los Angeles bureau. Ten years ago he became the stock market columnist for Investor's Business Daily.
Mr. Fasciocco and his wife, Beverly, and their children lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica, five blocks from the beach. They were members of the pastoral council at St. Monica's Roman Catholic Church, and Mrs. Fasciocco's mother lived only six blocks away.
None of it, they decided, was worth the risk of the Big One. More frightening to Mr. Fasciocco even than the severe damage to his apartment was that the nave of St. Monica's had partially caved in. "If anyone had been in that church a lot of people would have been killed," Mr. Fasciocco said. "There just isn't any doubt."
"If I was single, I could have stayed," he continued. "But when you have two kids, you have to care for their welfare. All the material things in the world shouldn't hold you back. I had to get them to a safe place."
The day after the earthquake, Mr. Fasciocco asked the editor of Investors' Business Daily, Wes Mann, for a transfer to New York, with the idea that he would live in Connecticut. "He said, 'Don't you think you're making a rash decision?' " Mr. Fasciocco recalled. "I said, 'Wes, if you'd been in Santa Monica during that earthquake. . . .' " The transfer was arranged.
But with their daughter sick, the Fascioccos ended up making an indefinite layover just outside Phoenix, in Gilbert. They have rented a house, and Mr. Fasciocco has been filing his column by computer. Michael has already started first grade -- in a public school, an option the Fascioccos never would have considered back in California.
 
The Bookkeeper
An Urgent Desire To Put Down Roots
 Marlene Besso, fleeing the 1977 blizzard in Buffalo, has built a solid bookkeeping career. She has time to paint and take photographs. She has been to the hot restaurants. She has a personal trainer. She has good friends, though they are mostly people from home. At 40 years of age, what she wants is something more.
"Everyone here is in transit," she said. "You never see the same faces in the laundromat. People might be driving through an area, and stop and do something. Then they go back 50 miles to where they live. I want to go someplace where I can put down roots."
She would like to marry, she said, but adds, "I don't feel like I'll ever find anyone here."
In the last few years, fearful of crime and with a growing number of homeless people in Santa Monica, Ms. Besso said she has stopped taking evening walks along the ocean. She won't use automated teller machines. She never honks at rude drivers; they could be packing guns, she said.
Still, her one-bedroom apartment is a coveted piece of Southern California real estate. "It's the rent-control disease," said Ms. Besso, who now spends her evenings poring over brochures from Boston, Boulder, Colo., and Nashville. "I couldn't leave -- 17 years have gone by like that. Ten more years could by in a flash. I don't want to be 50 and starting over. I have to do it now."
 
The TV Coordinator
'It's All About Staying Alive'
 Stefan Becker's farewell party felt more like Boston than Los Angeles. Mr. Becker is a graduate of Emerson College, and so are most of his friends in Los Angeles. They were all drawn here by the entertainment industry.
One of Mr. Becker's friends from high school, Jeff Yerkes, is a writer's assistant on the "Seinfeld" show. "You're going back to five feet of snow," he said, grinning at Mr. Becker across the table at Cafe Figaro.
Mr. Becker was the first among his friends to leave, though they all swear that they are only here for a while. The earthquake destroyed his apartment.
"My career had nothing to do with getting me through the earthquake," he said. "I woke up in the air, screaming. The doors were all jammed. We jumped out the window. We helped the neighbors get out. I'm on such a high. I survived the earthquake! I feel I can survive anything."
He left with the same dream he had arrived with: to change the world through television. "No one wants to change anything in L.A.," he said. "It's all about staying alive."
Mr. Becker made a stop in Harrisburg, Pa., on Wednesday. "I'm walking around in the snow," he said in a telephone call. "There are no celebrities here. It's so great. Everyone looks normal."
The Radio Host
Some Would Rather Stay and Cope
 On the same night his friends bid Stefan Becker goodbye in West Hollywood, Tom Schnabel had a housewarming party in Venice, Calif. Mr. Schnabel, who is the host of the "World Music" program on KCRW, the National Public Radio affiliate in Santa Monica, had just moved into a pseudo-Mediterrranean palace with soaring ceilings, skylights and a rooftop terrace.
Artists, writers, designers and journalists mingled amid Mr. Schnabel's collection of African sculpture, which had been bolted down in case of earthquake. Caribbean music flowed from speakers in the ceiling.
Up on the terrace, Mr. Schnabel and Garrett White, the former managing editor of the old L.A. Style, declared their intention to stay in Los Angeles forever.
"The people who leave are sissies," Mr. White said. "Joan Didion wrote that the weather of L.A. is the weather of apocalypse. We're used to living with a certain amount of tension. Earthquakes are a part of it. You cope, or you get out."

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: The New York Region -- A special report;
An Economic Evolution From Making to Thinking

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
The long-evolving shape of the regional economy is now clearly etched.
Mass production, whether in automobiles, chemicals or beer, has mostly disappeared from New York City and its environs. Only 1 in 16 of the 7.3 million people employed in the region still labors on a factory floor. At the same time, residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut earn nearly 25 percent above the national average. 
 The weight of the region has diminished to where it accounts for less than 8 percent of United States output. But as its position in the American economy declines, metropolitan New York is becoming the global economy's leading marketplace.
Overseas business, while hard to track, contributes much more to the region's economic life than it did a decade ago. That is because America's exports of services -- New York's stock in trade -- have soared more than 150 percent since 1985 to almost $200 billion.
New York's regional economy was once the most broad-based and diverse in the United States, generating almost one of every five dollars produced in the early post-World War II boom. As recently as the late 1980's, the region could boast of a reasonably wide manufacturing base.
 
Something Altogether New
 Now the New York region is becoming something new under the sun. Most economic centers ship goods elsewhere and consume their services locally. By contrast, the manufacturing that remains in the New York region is heavily devoted to the local market while its cutting-edge services -- finance, law, communications, popular culture and medicine -- are increasingly in demand throughout the global economy.
"We're a major player in the global economy because of our services, not because of our manufacturing," said Richard W. Roper, director of economic and policy analysis at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "This region is a magnet for foreign firms that want to get a foothold in the North American market. And almost any U.S. company that wants to compete actively in the international arena needs to have some kind of a presence here."
For the New York economy, the rapid change in telecommunications and management is both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, such innovations undercut New York as a capital of big business by making it easier for companies to run their affairs from Atlanta or Houston or Columbus. But they also benefit the region: As the global economy becomes smaller, clusters of brain workers like Wall Street's investment bankers or Madison Avenue's world-class marketeers gain a far larger market in which to sell their wares.
"What is holding New York together, paradoxically, is what is allowing the world economy to spread further afield," said Saskia Sassen, a Columbia University professor who wrote "The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo," (Princeton University Press, 1991).
Five or six years ago, Tokyo seemed on a trajectory to surpass New York as the world's premier financial center. The air has since gone out of that balloon, however. And the share of global capital that flows through New York is once again on the rise.
To be sure, neither New York nor the United States will ever be the powers they were when big companies like R.C.A., Exxon and I.B.M. ruled the American economy from Manhattan headquarters.
The good news for the region's economy, though, is that thousands of newer, more dynamic companies are producing custom-tailored goods and services, from an Aragon stereo amplifier for audiophiles to boutique breweries such as New Amsterdam Beer to the deal that allowed General Motors to take over Saab Automobiles of Sweden.
 
The New Passes the Old
 Consider Magda Sole, a young woman whose four-year-old company provides cross-cultural marketing for major United States corporations doing business abroad. The birth of the new economy from the ashes of the old came home to her in one crystalline moment last fall.
Ms. Sole was moving her firm, Trans Image International Communications, into a turn-of-the-century industrial building in lower Manhattan's TriBeCa district. As she arrived to inspect the newly remodeled ninth-floor offices -- now bristling with computers, fax machines and video editing equipment -- movers were wrestling the last of several heavy, ink-stained printing presses on cables down the elevator shaft of the 14-story building and off to oblivion.
"The end of an era passed right before my eyes," she recalled. "Yet it was also the start of a new one."
The stability that temples of business like I.B.M. or Union Carbide once assured has disappeared, to be replaced with frightening uncertainties.
"Even more than the nation as a whole, this region is in the midst of its own very painful transition," said Steven B. Schlossstein, a business consultant and economist in Princeton, N.J. "We are moving from the top-down, hierarchical, centralized, bureaucratic, command-and-control structure of the old industrial age to a flatter, leaner, decentralized, faster-moving, more flexible, unpredictable, chaotic information age."
Painful is right. While much of the nation emerged from recession two to three years ago, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut remained, until very recently, in a stubborn slump. Even as the U.S. economy had regained all the 1.9 million jobs lost in the downturn and added nearly two million more by the end of 1993, employment in metropolitan New York is still down 800,000 from its 1989 peak of 8.1 million.
Today, the regional economy is finally on the mend. Indeed, revised figures due this month from the United States Department of Labor should show that job losses here were not quite as bad as believed. New Jersey, whose monthly surveys still show a stagnant job market, will report that modest job increases began as early as the summer of 1992, mostly in smaller, newer firms not measured in the regular surveys.
Yet at best, economists say, the New York urban conglomeration will not regain all its lost jobs until the end of the decade. High taxes and heavy operating costs, together with congestion, crime and other urban ills, will continue to hobble the region.
Regional assets, in many cases, have become liabilities. Job gains will be retarded by New York's heavy dependence on the mammoth corporations now slashing their work forces for greater productivity and competitiveness. A.T .& T., Xerox, Nynex and Pfizer are only the latest. And prosperity on Wall Street no longer automatically translates into a stronger job market.
"New York City has held up well as a world financial market," Charles R. Morris, a business consultant and analyst, wrote in City Journal, the quarterly publication of the Manhattan Institute. "But because of the increased automation of the industry, this does not portend continued high levels of employment and office-space consumption by the city's financial services sector."
"The economy in the New York region should add jobs in 1994," said Rae D. Rosen, chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "But the recovery here is likely to continue to lag the recovery in the nation as a whole."
 
Entrepreneurs
Finding 'Gazelles' Of Business
 There is much more to the story, however.
While the Fortune 500 leviathans are shrinking, thriving young firms like Just Toys of Manhattan and Nationwide Cellular Service on Long Island are emerging as the hidden strength of the regional economy.
New York, more than any other urban area, is the nation's leading creative hothouse of talented and driven people. To be sure, other places, such as North Carolina's Research Triangle, Boston's university complex and Silicon Valley in California, attract high concentrations of brain power. But their intellectual firepower tends to be specialized. New York has by far the greatest diversity of information workers.
"Whatever you need, you can find it here," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "Specific, innovative, customized service -- that's what makes New York New York."
That talent is invaluable to such diverse fields here as communications, the arts, advanced health care, advertising, financial services and the law.
"Where are the brightest, most creative, most productive, and, yes, the most aggressive people?" asked Vincent Tese, New York State's Commissioner of Economic Development. "Right here."
Some formidable obstacles stand in the way, however. David Birch, president of Cognetics, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass., has found that only 4 to 5 percent of the companies in an area produce 60 to 70 percent of its new jobs.
"Where these gazelles start and where they grow, economies prosper," Mr. Birch said. "The places they avoid will have a tough time economically in the years ahead."
Unfortunately, while the fast-paced, more flexible enterprises Mr. Birch calls "gazelles" are gaining ground in the region, not enough have taken root to outpace the lumbering "elephants" still shedding weight.
Experts say that a crucial reason is that government remains focused on the past, unwilling or unable to help the new businesses shaping the future.
"We're still trapped by a nostalgia for an economy that won't come again," said William W. Ginsberg, the director of Science Park in New Haven, one of the most successful government-sponsored business incubators in the tri-state area. Mr. Ginsberg was recently named to head the economic development division of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
"Our classic corporate base is maturing and shrinking," Mr. Ginsberg added. "But we're not building a more entrepreneurial base fast enough."
 
Paradoxes
What Is Made Is More Money
 In the economy now taking shape all across the New York region, paradoxes abound.
The number of help-wanted ads in local newspapers is rising, for example, but many laid-off employees with valuable skills cannot find work.
Ravi Mehta, a 50-year-old electronics engineer, worked at Perkin Elmer Corporation in Norwalk, Conn., for 13 years, until he was laid off last February when half his division was sold. Mr. Mehta, who was a telecommunications manager earning $74,500, said he has sent out more than 2,000 resumes over the last year. He still lacks a permanent job.
"Everybody is talking about the information superhighway," he said, "but I feel like I'm on a dead end."
Meanwhile, Nationwide Cellular, a company that provides a full range of wireless communication services in seven major U.S. cities, is racing ahead on that information superhighway. It is one of the fastest growing companies in the region, employing more than 500 people, 175 at its headquarters in Valley Stream, just across the Nassau County border from Queens.
"The recession has been good for us," said Stephen Katz, president of Nationwide Cellular. "What Long Island does have is a skilled, highly educated labor force, and we've had our pick of the best."
Nationwide Cellular neither manufactures portable telephones nor provides over-the-air connections. It offers help for those too busy or too confused to sort out the best deals. "Nobody is forced to deal with us," Mr. Katz said. "But we're doing well because we offer added value and one-stop shopping with a smile."
That raises another anomaly of the New York economy. Very few workers actually make things here any more. Yet the region's residents earn among the highest incomes in the country designing, developing, packaging, financing, lawyering, advertising and selling some of the most sophisticated goods and services available.
How is this possible? By serving business as the brain serves the body. Cures for diseases are conceived and created in the array of pharmaceutical laboratories and medical centers in New Jersey and Manhattan. The pills are manufactured in Puerto Rico.
Furniture designs conceived in Manhattan offices and lofts are turned into chairs, tables and lamps in North Carolina and Michigan. Designs for apparel are laid out on Seventh Avenue. Some are put together in the back alleys of Chinatown and the burgeoning immigrant-run job shops in Queens, but millions more are cut into skirts and blouses in east Asia and the Caribbean.
Manhattan-based Just Toys, founded in 1989 by Allan Rigberg, a toy-industry veteran, and Rose Evangelista, a former graphic designer, is a prime example. Cited by Business Week as one of the 100 fastest-growing small companies in the nation, it has prospered mainly by producing tiny, bend able plastic figures featuring popular comic book and cartoon characters.
Based at the Toy Center on Fifth Avenue, where the designs are done and marketing shaped, its top officers shuttle in and out of Hong Kong. There they arrange contracts to churn out the toys from factories in China and elsewhere in Asia.
"Increasingly, the real value of goods we produce comes not from where they are physically manufactured, whether in New Jersey, Malaysia or Mexico, but from the substance of their content," Mr. Schlossstein said. "Without programming, TV sets are lifeless boxes. Without software, computers have no value."
Retaining the people whose ideas translate into jobs for others is a challenge for private business and public institutions alike.
Dr. Herbert Pardes is vice president for health sciences and dean of the faculty of medicine at Columbia University. Since arriving in 1989, he has helped Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center build a stronger position as a top academic medical center.
Last year, the University of California at Los Angeles sought Dr. Pardes out to run its medical school and hospital. He was wooed by California Gov. Pete Wilson. Michael Ovitz, the powerful head of Creative Artists Agency in Hollywood, and even Dustin Hoffman, the actor, courted Dr. Pardes.
"But I decided to stay here in Washington Heights," Dr. Pardes said. "Why? Because I love New York. Because of the challenge."
Meeting those challenges has included a $300 million building program at Columbia-Presbyterian, spearheaded by Dr. Pardes, that is taking up some of the slack of New York's construction slump. And the medical center has moved up from ninth in the nation in 1989 to fifth as a recipient of federal research money today.
 
Jobs
The Brain Train Passes Some By
 But what about the people left behind in the next New York economy?
As routine jobs in production, distribution and retail dry up, so do opportunities to climb the economic ladder. Income polarization has increased, and differences between the haves and have-nots are starker in and around New York than elsewhere in the nation. Among big cities, only Detroit has a lower percentage of working-age people in jobs than New York City.
Less than 55 percent of the city's working-age population is employed, compared with a national rate of more than 66 percent.
Various explanations are offered, including generous welfare benefits, poor education in troubled urban neighborhoods and infestations of illegal drugs and crime. But a lack of promising jobs that require more strength and stamina than study is also important.
"Not everybody can be a rocket scientist or a reporter for a national newspaper," said Donald Scarry, a New Jersey economic consultant. "When manufacturing jobs go, they are gone for good. Can we ever get back the kind of job opportunities that factories once provided to the less educated?"
The trends are not particularly encouraging.
"You heard a lot of talk about how New York's post-industrial economic structure would protect us from the worst," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional director for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. "That was just plain wrong."
The reorganization of basic industry that helped, after painful years, to revive the Rust Belt has now shifted to pillars of the New York region, such as insurance, banking, pharmaceuticals and communications.
"Today, our industries are going through what the steel, auto and other smokestack industries went through in the 70's and 80's," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "I'm afraid we have some of the smokestack industries of the 90's."
 
Growth
The World Is The 6th Borough
 New York's greatest promise rests on the region's increasingly close economic ties to the rest of the world.
Its leading urban competitors are no longer so much Chicago, Miami and Houston as London and Tokyo. Financial-service firms here, for instance, have long been active globally. Today, such services, along with a wide range of business and professional activities, are among the nation's fastest growing exports. New York's share of such lucrative pursuits as foreign exchange, bond trading and pension investment, for example, rose through the economic ups and downs of the past decade.
So, too, are entertainment products, from MTV to the National Basketball Association, which are headquartered here. And so are some of the high-quality, customized goods still produced locally: jet engines, high fashion, specialty chemicals, industrial electronics.
A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting group, found that New York's regional economy would flourish again with a more vibrant global economy. More foreign and domestic investment would flow into the region, with many companies finding it advantageous to locate internationally oriented corporate staff in the New York region.
So maybe that's why back on Hudson Street in TriBeCa, TransImage's Ms. Sole is starting to feel at home.
Ms. Sole, who is 35 and speaks seven languages, co-founded the international communications and translation firm in 1990 just as the recession was in full fury. It has prospered nonetheless.
TransImage mirrors New York's diversity; its central staff of 16 come from all over the world. Most of its corporate clients, such as Time Warner and American Express, are headquartered here and looking overseas to expand.
"New York," Ms. Sole said, "is the only truly cosmopolitan city in the U.S. We couldn't have built this business anywhere else in the world."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS: New Fears Emerge Amid Low Inflation;
Consumer Index Stable but Survey Foresees Price Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Consumer prices were unchanged in January as energy prices fell sharply for the third consecutive month and Florida escaped freeze damage to its fruits and vegetables, Government figures showed today.
The report was better than expected and was seen, at least initially, as more evidence that inflation remains tame. But a separate report, the February regional outlook survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, raised the specter of rising prices. 
After the Philadelphia Fed survey was published yesterday, bond prices fell sharply. Stock prices also slumped.
"What took the starch out of the markets was the Philadelphia survey," Robert T. McGee, economist at the Tokai Bank in New York, said. Manufacturing is displaying some inflation pressure, he observed, in response to a long period of low interest rates that has "given the economy quite a head of steam."
 
'Very Favorable' Report
 Despite the Philadelphia survey and the markets' reaction to it, various economists said they remained sanguine about keeping inflation in check.
Gary Thayer, senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons, a brokerage house based in St. Louis, called the Consumer Price Index report "very favorable" and said he was not aware of companies "straining" to meet demand.
Another favorable aspect of the consumer price report was that the core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, was also restrained last month, rising one-tenth of 1 percent for the best performance since September. The core has climbed 2.9 percent over the last 12 months, compared with 2.5 percent inflation for the index as a whole.
The Philadelphia survey, however, showed that prices paid by area producers rose for the second straight month to their highest point since late 1990, with 30.4 percent of manufacturers reporting higher costs in early February and none reporting declines. The rest said there was no change.
This survey also found that 34.7 percent of respondents expect to receive higher prices six months from now compared with only 3.6 percent expecting lower prices.
Economists, many of whom are in immediate contact with their firms' bond traders, generally consider such signs of impending inflation at the factory level more important than the Consumer Price Index, which tends to register a pickup in inflation only after it become entrenched.
Indeed, the services portion of the Consumer Price Index is officially designated by the Government as a lagging indicator, one that tends to move only after moves by the economy in general.
Complacency about inflation may have been further eroded by still another set of statistics today, this one a Commerce Department report showing American exports surged $2 billion in December, the biggest gain of the year.
Although today's Consumer Price Index report was technically the best since August 1989, when it was also unchanged, this occurred only because revisions transformed such readings for last June and last September into rises of one-tenth of 1 percent.
In conducting its usual updating of seasonal adjustment factors, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also expanded the list of individual components that it adjusts individually. Of the 60 component series, 50 now meet the criteria for individual adjustment compared with 34 last year, the agency said.
The aim was to try to lessen an upward bias in the index for the early months of the year. When first reported, the Consumer Price Index rose five-tenths of 1 percent in January 1993, an advance now recorded as two-tenths of 1 percent. No other month last year was revised by more than a tenth of a point, the report showed.
Analysts did not think there was enough evidence of inflation for the Federal Reserve Board to move again on interest rates. On Feb. 4, the Fed decided to push up short-term interest rates to keep prices in check as the economy bounds ahead.
"The Fed is looking forward" in raising rates before inflation revives, Mr. Thayer of A. G. Edwards said, "but it doesn't appear they have a big job ahead of them."
Among the components of the Consumer Price Index, food prices edged down one-tenth of 1 percent following a jump of five-tenths of 1 percent in December as fresh fruits and fresh vegetables fell 4.2 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, after seasonal adjustment. Prices for beef and poultry each declined but these were more than offset by increases for pork, other meats, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy products and cereal.
Housing rose minimally last month, with a 1 percent rise in maintenance and repair costs offset by declines in heating oil, natural gas and electricity.
In transportation, used cars fell by the largest amount in two years after jumping 8 percent in 1993. Airline fares fell 2 percent.
 
 
Medical Costs
 Medical costs continued to moderate, rising three-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month to bring the 12-month advance down to 5.1 percent. For clothing, post-holiday sales of fall and winter wear more than offset price increases for new spring and summer merchandise.
Of the five metropolitan areas for which monthly inflation figures were published today, Philadelphia posted a January increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent, a result consistent with -- but not necessarily reflecting -- the Federal Reserve survey.
The other four areas -- New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco -- all showed increases of less than half Philadelphia's.
The 43.5 percent share of the Consumer Price Index designated as commodities eased one-tenth of 1 percent last month, while the 56.5 percent service share rose by that amount, the report found. Service inflation has slackened lately, late, to 2.8 percent for the three months through January from 3.3 percent for the three months through October.
The Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers now stands at 146.2, meaning that an assortment of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period now costs $14.62.
Jobless claims totaled 371,000 last week, 5,000 more than in the preceding week, with the four-week moving average rising to 375,750 from 373,250.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 21, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article and a chart in Business Day on Friday, about consumer prices in January and the prospects for inflation, described a statistical index incorrectly. The index, based on a regional survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, measures the difference between the percentage of manufacturers in the Philadelphia area who said the prices they paid for raw materials and parts had risen from the previous month and the percentage who said prices had fallen. The index does not measure the prices themselves.

HEADLINE: Review/Architecture;
An Architect From the Ground Up

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
ABOUT 15 years ago, I was living in the Berkshires, working on a book about Frank Lloyd Wright. One day, the author of a self-help book was being interviewed on the radio, and she said something that turned out to be just the idea I'd been struggling to express: "Everybody has the right to radiate."
And this still seems to me the most useful idea to take into the Museum of Modern Art's magnificent show on Frank Lloyd Wright, which opens on Sunday. You will see wonders there: gorgeous drawings, new and painstakingly reconstructed models, full-scale mock-ups of walls from six landmark buildings. In the show's catalogue, you can read learned tributes to Wright's genius. But to approach this show on bended knee would be to miss the nature of that genius. Frank Lloyd Wright was a Mr. Everybody who gave himself the right to radiate. He was a genius of the conventional, a supreme artist of everyday living, a person with desires no different from anyone else's, but one who found a way to turn off all the No voices in his head and give bold, persistent voice to a resoundingly radiant American Yes. 
 Organized by Terence Riley, the director of the Modern's department of architecture and design, "Frank Lloyd Wright: Architect" is a curatorial triumph, an achievement all the more remarkable when you consider that a blockbuster architecture show has one insurmountable problem. It is the problem of all architecture shows writ large: they don't show any architecture. They offer drawings, models, photographs, perhaps some ornamental fragments, but the spatial essence of the art is missing. That absence is all the more glaring if the subject is Frank Lloyd Wright, for Wright's command of space, and his transformation of architectural space from something static and contained to something fluid and dynamic, remains the most thrilling aspect of his work.
It would be stretching the truth to say that Mr. Riley has overcome this inherent obstacle. Those hoping to experience the flowing, pinwheeling space of Wright's interiors -- the sensation that space itself is moving like a supple dance partner -- will not be satisfied by this show. And those who insist that the times demand a revisionist approach to Wright may also be disappointed. While the show offers a fresh look at Wright, Mr. Riley has not invented a new Wright for 1994. Wisely, he has placed his trust in Wright to make his own appeal to contemporary viewers. With the help of the assistant curator, Peter Reed, and the consultants Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer and Anthony Alofsin, Mr. Riley has expressed that trust with a presentation of exceptional clarity and depth.
The show, which occupies both the main and the basement floors of the museum's temporary exhibition space, presents 190 buildings and projects from Wright's 70-year career. Arranged in roughly chronological order, these works are presented in thematic sections that explore Wright's development in detail. The first of these sections, the seed of all that follows, traces the evolution of the prairie house, the suburban middle-class dwelling that remained Wright's touchstone.
Designed between 1889 and 1910, when Wright lived in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, the Winslow, Dana, Willits, Coonley and Robie houses display the gradual flowering of features that would recur in Wright's domestic architecture for decades to come. The long, low horizontal lines that evoked an affinity with the earth. The open floor plan of loosely defined living areas disposed around a central hearth. The corner windows that opened interiors to vistas beyond. The use of furnishings and simplified ornament to unite the entire dwelling into a single organic composition.
What we're seeing here is not just some well-designed houses. We're seeing houses designed by an architect who raised the middle-class home to a place in architectural history that, before him, had been largely reserved for palaces, cathedrals and other public monuments. Wright perceived that in modern democracy, the private home can claim the highest cultural stature. It is the seat of the self, the "sovereign individual" where democratic authority ultimately resides. If Wright departed from prevailing conventions of domestic architecture, that is because he grasped that this new authority called for a new architectural order.
But Wright could also design magnificent civic and urban buildings, and the show next presents some of the earliest of these, including the Larkin Building (1902 to 1906) in Buffalo, Unity Temple (1905 to 1908) in Oak Park and the festive Midway Gardens, a Chicago pleasure park designed in 1913 and 1914. Mr. Riley presents these opening sections as two facets of Wright's Romanticism. The residential buildings evoke the architect's longing for his roots in rural Wisconsin and the stability of family life. The public buildings voice the country boy's yearning for the big city's bright lights. Wright wanted it all: that was the most Romantic thing about him.
In the show, as in Wright's life, a pivotal moment arrives with Taliesin, the Wisconsin estate that Wright built in 1911 and twice rebuilt after catastrophic fires. Wright retreated here after the first of several marital scandals damaged his professional life. While Taliesin's fusion of landscape and architecture registered Wright's desire for stability, in the years that followed many of his projects were the work of a restless wanderer. The ornate Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1912 to 1923) and the textile-block houses he designed in Los Angeles in the 1920's (both represented here by full-scale wall sections), were far removed, geographically and esthetically, from the work of the Oak Park years. The show's first part ends with Wright's setting up camp in the desert. But what a camp: the lovely canvas-roofed Ocatillo near Winslow, Ariz., where he settled in 1929.
The second part, in the lower galleries, ushers Wright back from the wilderness to the world stage of international celebrity. In the 30's, he perfected the American Prophet persona that he retained until his death in 1959. White-maned, outfitted with flowing cape and Malacca cane, this is the figure who stared out at the American public from television sets and magazine covers, proving to his amazed detractors that there are second acts in some American lives.
By then, Wright had lived to see his earlier work absorbed by a younger generation of European modernists who believed they had surpassed him. In response, Wright absorbed them: the result was Fallingwater, the sublime weekend house near Mill Run, Pa., that he designed from 1934 to 1937 for Edgar Kaufman. Along with the S. C. Johnson & Son Inc. Administrative Building of 1936 to 1939 in Racine, Wis. (shown in a dramatic cutaway model), Fallingwater put Wright back in business. But the period also saw the escalation of Wright's utopian streak to new heights of messianic fervor.
The heart of the show's second half is the 12-by-12-foot scale model of Broadacre City, Wright's Utopian vision of an America whose congested older cities have dissolved into a pastoral landscape crisscrossed with highways and studded with the occasional high-rise apartment building. (Wright thoughtfully included these last, modeled after an apartment complex he designed for New York City in the late 1920's, for those who might feel lost without urban congestion.) First exhibited at Rockefeller Center in 1935, the plan has been justifiably criticized as a formula for postwar suburban sprawl. But the project also helps to clarify that this show is much more than a hit parade of legendary buildings. It is an architectural portrait of America: a vision of democracy as a dynamic process of working out the tensions between freedom and equality.
Wright never retreated from his Romantic faith in unbounded individual freedom. With the modestly scaled Usonian houses of the 30's and 40's, he enabled less affluent Americans to strike out on their own in the suburban "crab grass frontier." At the same time, Wright never abandoned architecture's traditional function of providing social cohesion. Broadacre City was one expression of this function. It recognized that without some kind of master plan, all those sovereign selves could end up attacking one another with lawn mowers. And in Wright's later years, such spectacular public buildings as the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, the Beth Shalom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pa., and the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, Calif., helped mitigate the centrifugal force of suburban growth. As the social dispersal Wright had envisioned came to pass, it is as if he rediscovered the need for buildings to lure people off the highway toward a renewed civic ideal. Where's the fun in having the right to radiate if no one's around to see you shine?
It is often said that Wright is such a domineering presence in these buildings that no one else stands a chance. As Lewis Mumford once wrote of the Guggenheim, "You may go to this building to see Kandinsky or Jackson Pollock; you remain to see Frank Lloyd Wright." But this show should prompt a re-evaluation of Wright's public works. Staggeringly diverse in form, they are hardly signature pieces. Rather, they represent the idea that a public building is, above all, an opportunity for a society to demonstrate that its creativity is inexhaustible.
At the Modern, you go to see Wright, and you remain to see Wright, and this is in large part a tribute to Mr. Riley's brilliant installation. While Mr. Riley, a practicing architect, hasn't tried to ape Wright's architecture, his exhibition is a masterly demonstration of organic design. He has fed a remarkable array of facts, objects and ideas into his brain and come up with a stunningly unified presentation. Mr. Riley shows an uncanny ability to gauge how much information a viewer can comfortably absorb, and he knows just how to pace it. His mixture of well-known and obscure drawings reveals new facets of familiar buildings, while the push-pull effect of drawings juxtaposed with photographs keeps the eye alert. And Mr. Riley's deftly deployed partitions beckon the viewer through what many will judge the most beautiful architecture show they have ever seen.
What is Wright's relevance today? It is the relevance of any major chapter in modern history. In showing us where we've come from, Wright helps us to recognize where we are. The history traced by this show is not just one man's pathway. It is the road a nation has traveled from its agrarian roots, through its industrial cities, to the suburban megalopolis made possible by modern communications. The show presents architecture not only as place but also as process: an art of building in time.
But perhaps the show's most important lesson concerns Wright's relationship to the middle class. Although Wright flouted middle-class morality and initially departed from middle-class good taste, he never lost sight of the fact that the middle class occupies the pivotal terrain in American democracy. Unlike some gifted members of today's avant-garde, Wright did not shrink in horror from the mass audience. When people stopped commissioning his buildings, Wright turned up the volume with writings and exhibitions.
It can be argued that society has become too fragmented to allow architects to occupy the middle ground Wright fought for. Actually, things were even more rigidly segregated in Wright's day. Regional, economic and ethnic divisions were less permeated by popular culture. While architects today confront different problems, Wright also faced the challenge of bridging social differences. He did not meet that challenge by waiting for a consensus of taste to announce itself. Instead, he came up with ideas sufficiently strong to build a consensus upon. These ideas were a product not only of talent, but also of faith. Wright would not take No for an answer.
This is, of course, precisely the spirit in which the Museum of Modern Art's architecture and design department was originally founded, a missionary zeal that, until Mr. Riley's appointment two years ago, had fallen into considerable disrepair. In his lifetime, Frank Lloyd Wright was frequently at odds with the Modern's agenda. Although his work was the subject of an important show in 1940, Wright was often obscured by the museum's predominantly European slant. Wright did not, happily, need the museum then, nor does he need it now. This show does not precisely pluck him from obscurity. It is the Modern that stands to gain by recruiting Wright to revitalize its mission.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Lotus Stock Rises on Word Of a Venture With A.T.& T.

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
Shares of the Lotus Development Corporation surged yesterday on reports that the company is close to a deal in which A.T.& T. would set up a public computer network based on Lotus's popular Notes software.
The network, if it is built, would make it easier for people in different locations to share data and work simultaneously on the same computer file. Such capabilities are now possible with Notes on private corporate networks, but are not yet easily achieved on networks available to the general public. 
 The agreement could greatly expand the market for Lotus Notes software, according to a report released on Thursday by Terence M. Quinn, an analyst at Furman Selz Inc.
Neither Lotus nor the American Telephone and Telegraph Company would comment on Mr. Quinn's report, which followed a similar, though less detailed, article this week in Info World, a trade publication.
But investors took the reports seriously enough to drive up Lotus shares more than 10 percent yesterday in Nasdaq trading, where the stock was the most active, with volume of nearly 8.2 million shares. The stock rose $6.50 a share, to $66.50 -- its 52-week closing high. A.T.& T. shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $54.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Exactly a year earlier, on Feb. 17, 1993, shares of Lotus, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., were at their 52-week low of $22.25. Since then, the company's fortunes have risen, largely on the strength of Notes, which is being installed in corporate computer networks to make it easier for people to share documents, work simultaneously on the same files and send messages throughout a company.
Last month, for example, the Coopers & Lybrand accounting firm said it planned to use Notes on the desktop computers of its 70,000 employees worldwide.
By making Notes available over a public electronic network, A.T.& T. would enable companies, their customers and suppliers to work together without necessarily needing to install Notes on their own computers. A.T.& T. would manage and administer the network.
"To do this privately is costly and difficult," Mary Modahl, a consultant with Forrester Research in Cambridge, said. "Companies need to identify each other and then coordinate their information systems teams to build private networking links to each other. Using a public network would dramatically reduce the cost."
 
Up to $100 Million in Financing
 Mr. Quinn reported that A.T.& T. would provide between $50 million and $100 million in research and development financing for Notes development and that Lotus would reap a royalty payment of 15 percent for each client session on the network.
Notes is the leading product in a software category known as groupware, in which the Microsoft Corporation and other large software publishers are still trying to develop competitive products.
"You can't overestimate how dramatic this is in terms of new business for Lotus," Mr. Quinn said. Because A.T.& T. would incur the bulk of the costs and responsibilities for the network, Lotus stands to gain a lot from very little new investment, he said.
Lotus introduced Notes in 1989, but its early versions sold slowly. The program became a profitable product in the fourth quarter of 1993 and, along with the company's other communications products, accounted for 26 percent of its $278 million in sales in the quarter, when the company posted a profit of $29.6 million.
In his report, Mr. Quinn raised his 1995 earnings estimate for Lotus by at least 30 cents a share and said the company's shares could reach a range of $90 to $100 in the next 12 months.
Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said the deal would be good for Lotus, but warned that until the specifics were announced, it was too early to change earnings estimates or declare such a network a winner.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Belgrade's Serbs Hail Russia For Being Involved in Bosnia

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Crowds of cheering Serbs hailed Russia's diplomatic intervention in Bosnia today, praising Boris N. Yeltsin, Russian nationalists -- anything and everything Russian.
"Hooray Mother Russia!" shouted a crowd of about 150 demonstrators in a city park, elated by Moscow's effort to avert NATO air strikes against Serbian guns ringing Sarajevo and to send Russian troops there. 
 "Hooray Yeltsin! Hooray Zhirinovsky!" they cheered, enthusiastically pairing the Russian President with Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, his most vehement ultra-nationalist critic.
Moscow pledged Thursday to deploy Russian troops as peacekeepers around the besieged Bosnian capital in exchange for a promise by the Serbs to withdraw the artillery they have used for almost two years to pound away at civilian neighborhoods.
 
No Setback Seen
 None of the demonstrators seemed to view the Serbian pull-back as a setback. "I'm sure the Serbs and the Russians will together outwit the West," said 62-year-old Rajko Radovic, who was demonstrating against NATO in front of a monument to France, Serbia's closest World War I ally.
Though the immediate effect of Russia's effort was to reduce the possibility of NATO air strikes against the Serbian gun positions, many Serbs here saw it as a step toward eventual unification of Serbian-held territory in Croatia and Bosnia with Serbia itself.
Some of them reason that the long-term presence of Russian forces on Bosnian soil, even as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force, could help cement the Serbs' control of territory they have seized in Bosnia during the last two years.
"The Russians will be able to protect our people and our region," Mr. Radovic said.
The Serbs and Russians have had a special relationship since the early 18th century, when Peter the Great asserted Russia's right to protect the Serbs and other Eastern Orthodox peoples living in the Balkans, then dominated by the Muslim Ottoman Turks.
Many of the Serbs interviewed in Belgrade today had harsh words for France and for the United States, which led the drive for NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs in Sarajevo last week.
"This is the gravestone of our love for France," cried Radomir Smiljanic, a Belgrade poet and a leader of the nationalist "White Rose" movement, striking the monument to France with his hand. "And we don't believe in their American allies."
Belgrade's economy is on the verge of collapse after a year and a half of economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in retaliation for Yugoslavia's military support for the Serbs. The embargo has stirred considerable anti-Western feeling here.
"The Russians are our natural allies," said one retired man who refused to give his name as he marched off quickly through the fresh-fallen snow. "We are the same Slavic nation, Orthodox people who can get along."

U.S. WANTS YUGOSLAV SHUNNED

Ignoring a request from the Clinton Administration, the United Nations representatives of Britain, France, Russia and China met with the visiting Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Radoje Kontic, this week.
Mr. Kontic also met yesterday with the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and appealed to the United Nations at a news conference to ease or lift sanctions against Yugoslavia. .
The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, made the request to shun Mr. Kontic in a paper circulated to the other permanent members of the Security Councilon Jan. 10. . A copy of the paper obtained from a diplomat said that "continued isolation" was "an important element in maintaining pressure on Belgrade."

HEADLINE: Pushing Against Tide at Mexico Border

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN YSIDRO, Calif., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Even the illegal immigrants who run through the gullies here to cross the border from Mexico have noticed the flurry of activity. "They've been asking us, 'Hey, what's going on?' " said Joe Ralph, one of the overworked Border Patrol agents who spend the dark nights catching them, sending them back, then catching them when they cross again.
Cameras, television crews, politicians. New lighting, new tactics, and a 10-foot-high steel wall begun in the Bush Administration and just completed runs 14 miles and extends across the beach and into the surf of the Pacific Ocean. The strip of land along the border near San Diego has become the symbol of a losing national battle against illegal immigration and the focus of new measures to try to control it. 
 Illegal immigration has become a volatile issue in California, which continues to struggle with a sagging economy. As he seeks re-election this fall, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, has taken the lead in citing illegal immigration as a source of the state's problems, and he has proposed a crackdown that would deny government benefits to undocumented immigrants. The state's two Democratic Senators have put forward their own proposals: Dianne Feinstein would charge a $1 border toll to pay for more border control agents, and even the liberal Barbara Boxer has proposed deploying the National Guard along the border.
This month, the Clinton Administration outlined new steps to bolster the Border Patrol and tighten the porous frontier in the most energetic attempt to address the problem since a 1986 law that prohibited the hiring of illegal aliens but failed to turn the tide.
 
Sending Reinforcements
 Reacting to the growing anti-immigrant passions in this politically crucial state, the Administration plans to add 400 agents to the 1,000 now assigned to the San Diego sector. This 14-mile stretch accounted for about half the one million arrests last year along the 2,000-mile Mexican border.
Grateful as they are for the manpower and for badly needed new equipment that is also promised, agents here take the sober view of front-line combat veterans. "We'll do our best with whatever you give us," said Ann Summers, a Border Patrol spokeswoman. "But as long as there are two countries sharing a border where one is a major world power and the other is a third world nation, you are going to continue to have this influx of people."
As Agent Ralph puts it, pausing out of breath in the moonlight as another group of immigrants outruns him and crashes through the underbrush: "There's no end to it. We call it the balloon effect. You squeeze it here, it just goes over there."
 
'I'll Be Back'
 Juan Miranda-Olvera, an 18-year-old resident of Tijuana was seized as he crossed to visit his uncle. As he sat by a dusty trail wearing white plastic handcuffs, he told Agent Ralph: "It doesn't matter how many times you catch me. I'll be back."
In two long nights along the border, Agent Ralph and his colleagues described their work as an exhilarating, exhausting and ultimately demoralizing exercise shaped by the futility of trying to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. As if playing a giant and remarkably organized game of capture the flag, the agents on one side and the immigrant-smugglers on the other matched wits and tactics without any major victories or losses.
"At first I used to get really frustrated," said another agent, John Anderson, who like many recruits joined the Border Patrol fired with idealism as protectors of the frontiers. "Now I just try to have as much fun as I can."
The "fun" begins at dusk, with hundreds of immigrants clustered on the Mexican side of the border near gaps in the fencing at gullies like Smugglers Gulch, at a giant sewage pipe and along the fetid banks of the Tijuana River, where women sell plastic bags to protect the feet and legs of immigrants who choose to try wading across.
 
Games in the Dark
 A Border Patrol agent has driven his pale green van up a dirt trail to the top of Goat Canyon to see how "the traffic" of immigrants is shaping up tonight. And the smugglers, who charge about $200 to guide immigrants across the border, are deploying their own spies.
"They'll send spotters up on top and they'll try to see where we're inserting," Agent Ralph said. "Then they'll go the other way. We'll send an agent up there and run their spotters back."
As the cat-and-mouse game continues through the night, the agents tracking the immigrants with an infrared scope, and the immigrants conceal themselves in underbrush and along riverbanks. The agents set traps; the smugglers send out decoys. The immigrants rush the fences when the agents are scheduled to change shifts; the agents delay their shift change.
Over the years, said Supervisory Patrol Agent Steven P. Kean, attempts to control the border have involved an unending series of new ploys, each of which has been answered with new tactics by the smugglers: a six-mile ditch, a chicken-wire fence, the new steel wall, the addition of an angled overhang to the wall, the further addition of steel plating on the ground where tunnels were being dug.
 
Sisyphean Task
 New tactics can change the patterns of the crossings, he said, but have not affected the overall numbers. Because of the natural terrain left gaps in the new fencing, it has funneled the immigrants toward more open areas where they are easier to catch, and more of the captures are being made closer to the border. Increased aggressiveness in the San Diego area has put greater pressure on El Paso.
But overall, he said, "The numbers of agents have not significantly affected apprehension rates." Similarly, the 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act, which sanctioned employers for hiring undocumented workers and granted amnesty to millions of immigrants, did depress the numbers of crossings at first, but they have climbed again to their earlier levels.
The unending nature of the battle takes a toll on the agents, Agent Kean said, with an annual attrition rate of 12 percent. "You're dealing with that idealism and learning how to cope with it," he said. "You have to come to a realization that there's a balance to be made. There's got to be limits. The economy would break down if we just opened up our borders. If we weren't here, how many people would cross? At least five times as many."
Agent Ralph, a six-year Border Patrol veteran at the age of 34, said he had his moments of self-doubt. "A lot of times I've sat down and wondered, am I doing the right thing?" he said. "I think, jeez, these are just poor people trying to feed their families." There are times, he said, when immigrants, reading his identification tag, address him by name and implore his mercy, and his heart is tugged.
But at other times, he said: "There are days when you're just fed up and you want to catch everyone you can. You're exhausted. You've fallen down. People are swearing at you, spitting at you, and they're just out of reach. And you just want to bag them all and send them back."

HEADLINE: Brain-Dead Florida Girl Will Be Sent Home on Life Support

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 18

 BODY:
A 13-year-old girl who doctors say is brain dead will be sent home on life support in the custody of her parents, who insist that she is alive, hospital officials in Sarasota said today.
The teen-ager, Teresa Hamilton, has been the focus of a conflict between doctors who want to remove life support equipment, as accepted medical practice dictates, and her parents, who contend that she can recover. 
 Doctors at Sarasota Memorial Hospital may discharge her as early as this weekend. The doctors announced their decision after meeting on Thursday with the girl's parents, Frederick and Sharon Hamilton, and their lawyer. Under the agreement, Teresa would remain on life support equipment at home at the hospital's expense.
 
A Severe Diabetic
 Teresa was admitted on Jan. 7 with what her parents said were flu symptoms. But the girl, a severe diabetic, soon lapsed into unconsciousness. Brain scans showed no activity and other tests showed no blood flow to her brain. Less than a week after her admission, doctors began recommending that life support be curtailed, and the hospital began gathering medical findings required for a legal determination of brain death in Florida.
But Teresa's family demanded that life support continue. Mr. Hamilton said in an interview that Teresa was responding to her parents' voices and that he believed that her brain was merely resting while her body healed.
Mr. Hamilton, an unemployed oil engineer who migrated to Florida from Scotland, said the family had been contacted by many people who recovered after being declared brain-dead and who urged them not to lose hope.
 
No State Interest
 Lawyers for the hospital said that the state law governing a finding of brain death clearly supported the hospital's position on Teresa. However, they said, a recent decision by Florida's Supreme Court has clouded the issue by requiring hospitals to ask the local State Attorney to arbitrate conflicts between "acceptable medical treatment and the patient's wishes."
The Sarasota County State Attorney, Earl Moreland, said on Wednesday that the state's interests were not involved and that doctors would not be held criminally liable if Teresa's care was terminated. Florida law says a patient on life support can be declared brain dead "where there is irreversible cessation of the functioning of the entire brain, including the brain stem."
Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota and a member of the White House health care task force, found the Hamilton case disturbing. "If the legal system has brought us to the point where Florida doctors can't discontinue life support from a person who is dead, then it's no longer doctors whom we could accuse of playing God but judges and lawyers," Dr. Caplan said in a telephone interview.
"The decisions about when someone is dead are not for the State of Florida to make; it's for a doctor to make," Dr. Caplan said.
Doctors and medical ethicists familiar with Florida law say the hospital is not required to continue care after a finding of brain death has been made. While notifying a patient's relatives is required, their consent is not.
"There are only two states you can be: alive or dead," said George Annas director of the law, medicine and ethics program at Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. "The law says you're dead when the doctor says you're dead."
Dr. Caplan said the Hamilton case set a bad example. "I find it incredible and mind-boggling that we are talking about rationing health care as part of health reform and at the same time we have a person that is dead that we can't stop treating," he said.
The Hamiltons' insurance ran out "long ago," said a hospital spokesman, Mike Vizvary. But he said the hospital would continue to pay for Teresa's care even after she is taken home because her parents want her home "and the nursing staff is wrung out."
The Hamiltons are also pleased with the hospital's decision. Mr. Hamilton said last week that he had felt all along that Teresa "will tell us when she's given up the fight for it."
"When we get the wee one home where she is comfortable, then there will be a story," he said.

Markets
Long-term interest rates shot sharply higher for the second day in a row, leaving the nation's central bank in an uncomfortable situation. The Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is likely to face hard questions -- and criticism -- from Congress on what his next move will be when he presents his annual review of the bank's interest-rate policy on Tuesday. [Page 1.] 
 The stock market followed the unnerved bond market, as prices on all major exchanges dropped in moderately heavy trading. The Dow industrials fell 35.18 points to 3,887.46. [38.]
The dollar fell against European currencies after failing to sustain a rally after Germany's central bank cut a rate. [48.]
Copper prices slipped but still posted nearly a 2-cent-a-pound rise for the week as analysts predicted an increase in demand. [48.]
 
The Economy
One sure bet about the new-media industry is that it will be littered with corporate casualties. A study of American consumer attitudes toward new media shows that marketing savvy, as much as technology, may separate the winners from the losers. [37.]
The Treasury Department barred three savings and loans in New Jersey and one in Ohio from changing their charters, saying the institutions had not lent enough money to poor people and members of minority groups. [37.]
In a test that glimpses the potential of the emerging national information network, the I.R.S. said taxpayers in nine states would be able to file their 1993 Federal tax returns by personal computer over telephone lines. [37.]
If anyone knows how to benefit from wrinkles in the tax law, it is the I.R.S. So it should come as no surprise that the top officials at the I.R.S. have found a way to avoid paying hundreds of dollars in extra taxes. [1.]
 
Companies
After erroneously deducting about $16 million from more than 100,000 accounts on Thursday, Chemical Bank said it had corrected the problem for all but a few hundred customers. [37.]
A group led by Continental Airlines' chairman, David Bonderman, has submitted a bid to gain control of America West Airlines and help the carrier emerge from bankruptcy protection. [37.]
Ventritex shares lost a fourth of their value after an analyst lowered her rating. Reports that F.D.A. inspectors spent three days at the medical-device company also concerned investors. [39.]
Martin Marietta could scrap its proposed acquisition of the space systems division of General Dynamics unless the Pentagon agrees to an unusual rebate of expected savings from the deal. [39.]
Spy, the self-styled humor magazine that targeted the Establishment and skewered many of its members, closed down after months of futile efforts to find a buyer. [39.]
Now that Viacom has acquired Paramount Communications, speculation in the publishing industry has focused on the possibility that it might sell off all or parts of Paramount Publishing. [39.]
General Motors' Saginaw steering gear division has been recognized for its high quality from an unlikely source -- Ford. [39.]
 
Your Money
When divorcing, full disclosure and cooperation can maximize each person's share of a settlement while minimizing taxes and legal fees. Even if the parting is less than friendly, divorce can yield a long-term financial plan for each spouse. [35.]
Betting on currency moves is risky, but that hasn't stopped millions of Americans from investing in currencies -- usually without knowing what they're gambling on. [35.]
Closed-end mutual funds, which have a limited number of shares and trade like stocks, are taking off. Their managers do not have to worry about shareholder redemptions or surges of cash, making the funds well suited for volatile overseas markets. [36.]

HEADLINE: Clinton's Wisdom Questioned In Fighting a Budget Balancer

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The easiest way to bring President Clinton's top economic policy makers to the phone these days is to ask whether the Administration is undermining its deficit-cutting credentials by criticizing the balanced-budget amendment so vehemently.
This week the White House released a state-by-state analysis of the effect of the higher taxes and cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that it says would be needed to balance the budget by the fiscal year 2000. The goal was local news coverage. For example, in New Jersey, the Administration said a balanced budget in six years could mean raising taxes by $952 for each taxpayer and cutting annual social security payments by $665. 
 Newspaper articles appeared, but that project and other Administration efforts to criticize the balanced-budget proposal have prompted concern among some Democrats at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
"There are a lot of people in the Administration who are uncomfortable about this," said an Administration official who insisted on anonymity. "You're putting the President on the side of demagoguing against a balanced budget. It could expose us to a big political backlash."
 
View of Deficit Hawk
 Representative Timothy J. Penny, a Minnesota Democrat and deficit hawk, said the Administration should stick to arguments about the constitutionality of the proposed amendment rather than highlighting how difficult balancing the budget would be. "I just think it's the wrong kind of leadership," he said. "We need a debate on the budget that enlightens, not frightens."
Such comments, particularly criticisms of the decision to put out the state-by-state analysis, anger President Clinton's top economic policy advisers. "You would expect me to be partisan, but I can't see on any level that that is demagogy," said Roger C. Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary, who returned a phone call within minutes.
Gene B. Sperling, a top official at the National Economic Council, defended the Administration's tactics. "After a brutal battle for deficit reduction in '93, we know it's a complicated message," he said in a White House interview. "It's complicated, message-wise, to oppose this amendment, but it's the right thing economically, and it's essential for the rest of the President's health, crime and economic agenda."
A requirement that the Federal budget be balanced would be likely to force steep cuts in spending, limiting the Administration's efforts to hire more police officers and extend health insurance to all Americans. Debate on the amendment is scheduled to begin on the Senate floor on Tuesday, with a close vote expected later in the week. A two-thirds majority is required for approval.
 
Ballots Needed in States
 Even broader support already exists in the House, which will vote if the Senate passes the measure. If both houses approve the proposed amendment, it would still require the endorsement of 38 states before being added to the Constitution.
Responding to criticisms like Mr. Penny's, Mr. Altman said Administration officials had raised constitutional objections to the balanced budget amendment.
But he also said that the Administration had to demonstrate what effects a balanced budget would have on the economy to convey how difficult it would be to cut programs deeply enough. "I think this message is starting to sink in because it's the message of reality," he said.
Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, said the Clinton Administration faced a difficult task in maintaining its deficit-cutting credentials while arguing against deeper cuts this year. "It seems to me it is walking a tightrope, but I fear it is in danger of falling off," he said.
Some members of Congress said they did not think the current debate over the balanced budget amendment would have any effect beyond Capitol Hill. Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat and member of the tax-law-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said no one had objected when he told a conservative group of real estate brokers in his Sacramento district that he opposed the amendment.

HEADLINE: Burmese Lighten Policy on Dissident

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 18

 BODY:
In what diplomats described as a significant step toward possible freedom for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Government-controlled newspapers in Myanmar published a long transcript of remarks today in which an American Congressman described the Burmese opposition leader as "a woman of passion and commitment" who "stands for the best ideals of democracy."
Diplomats said it was the first time since she was placed under house arrest in 1989 that words of praise for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had been allowed to appear in any official Myanmar Government publication. 
 The remarks were made at a news conference in Bangkok on Wednesday by Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who this week led the first delegation of foreign visitors outside her family to see Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi since her detention. Mr. Richardson's comments were printed in full today in both the Burmese and English-language editions of The New Light of Myanmar, the principal Government newspaper.
 
'Dumbfounded and Delighted'
 A Western diplomat in Myanmar said he was "dumbfounded and delighted" to see that in the paper.
"I think they're laying the ground work for some sort of negotiations between Khin Nyunt and Aung San Suu Kyi," the diplomat said, referring to Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of Burmese military intelligence and the man considered by many to be Myanmar's new strongman. "It would be astounding if they would use their official mouthpiece to put out this much praise for the negotiating process and for Suu Kyi if they didn't intend to negotiate."
In the comments printed today in Myanmar, Representative Richardson described Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as "a woman of towering intellectual ability and strength of conscience."
"She is a woman of passion and commitment," Mr. Richardson said. "She is a woman who stands for the best ideals of democracy. U.S. policy with Burma will improve only if Aung San Suu Kyi is released without condition as well as other political prisoners, and a genuine democratization effort takes place. Aung San Suu Kyi should be let free."
 
Announcement on Radio
 The Burmese junta clearly wanted to draw the public's attention to Representative Richardson's remarks since the Burmese state radio ran an announcement Thursday night alerting Burmese that the transcript would appear in the newspapers this morning.
During his visit to Myanmar, Representative Richardson met twice with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi (pronounced awng san sue chee) at her family compound, which has served as her prison for nearly five years, and twice with General Khin Nyunt.
"The most productive effort that I can undertake is to get Aung San Suu Kyi and General Khin Nyunt together for talks," he said in other remarks also republished today. "Let me stress that I also believe that Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt is a pragmatic individual who is sincere about wanting to resolve the divisions in his country."
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has already agreed to the talks. General Khin Nyunt has not made a reply, although diplomats in Yangon, the capital formerly known as Rangoon, said today that the decision to publish such highly complimentary remarks about the democracy leader in the tightly controlled Burmese press meant that negotiations could now be only a matter of time.
 
A Sign of Policy Change
 "It sounds like they are serious," said another Western resident of Yangon. "It's the kind of thing we want to see. This is the first time we've ever had anything like this in the papers. I think this is as significant a litmus test for a change in the Government's policy than the actual meeting" between Mr. Richardson and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of a national hero, Aung San. In 1990, despite her detention, her opposition party won a landslide victory in national elections called by the military. The junta then refused to honor the results and arrested many of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's followers.
She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her nonviolent campaign to bring democracy to her homeland.
Diplomats offer a variety of opinions why the junta has apparently decided to ease the restrictions on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. Many say that the junta's leaders have come to the belief that Myanmar will never break out of decades of economic stagnation unless the issue of her detention is resolved.

HEADLINE: At I.R.S.'s Parking Garage, Cars Zip Around a New Tax

SERIES: The Fine Print: A periodic look behind the law.

BYLINE: By By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
If anyone knows how to take advantage of wrinkles in the tax rules, it is the bean counters at the Internal Revenue Service. So it should come as no surprise that they have figured out how the top officials at the agency can avoid paying hundreds of dollars in extra taxes this year to cover the value of parking free in the I.R.S. garage.
To do so, the agency had to violate principles it laid down eight years ago on how the value of taxable fringe benefits should be calculated. It wrote a one-year grace period into the enforcement rules of a new law and then figured the worth of I.R.S. parking in such a favorable way that the executives who use it owe no additional taxes. 
 Taking their cue from the tax authorities, the payroll managers at most other departments and agencies here are telling their officials that they too do not have to pay additional taxes this April on their free parking spaces.
Congress is in something of a dither, uncertain what to do. So the Architect of the Capitol, George M. White, has retained Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm, to conduct a study and report next month on the worth of the free parking spaces available to all members of Congress and thousands of their staff members.
At issue is an obscure provision of a 1992 energy policy law that requires workers who receive free or subsidized parking from their employers to pay income taxes on the value above $155 a month, beginning with their 1993 tax returns.
The purpose of the provision, according to its sponsor, Representative Robert T. Matsui, a Democrat from California, is to raise a small amount of revenue and at the same time conserve energy and reduce pollution by discouraging commuters from driving to work.
 
Surprise for Officials
 The tax change was never debated or voted on separately in Congress, and few people in or out of the Government knew of its existence. It apparently never occurred to those who did know about it that Government officials might be affected, even though commercial parking rates in Washington are among the highest in the country and subsidized parking is much more prevalent here than it is in other big cities.
Then, between last Christmas and New Year's Day, more than a year after the law was enacted, the tax agency issued a ruling on how the value of parking should be calculated.
This regulation is important because without official guidance, many people have no idea how to figure what their subsidized parking is worth. When an employer pays a commercial lot for the space workers use, then the value is reasonably clear. But when the employer owns the building and allows employees to park there at no cost, as is often the case in the Government, then the value is in doubt.
The new rules specified that beginning with 1994 taxes, the value should be determined by what the I.R.S. called the fair market value, or the price a taxpayer would have paid for the parking space in a commercial transaction at the same location or one nearby. It is up to employers to tell their workers what they owe and to include the sum on W-2 forms, the forms that show how much income was earned each year and how much tax was withheld.
The tax agency left little wiggle room: the monthly rate must be applied if the space is available all month, even if the employee uses it only part of the time. If several employees commute together, one of them must be designated the "prime member" of the car pool and bear the tax consequences. If someone is driven to work in a limousine, as are some Cabinet officers and Congressional leaders, taxes are still due on the value of space where the limousine parks.
 
Yardstick for Fringe Benefits
 This follows the general I.R.S. regulation, in effect since 1986, on the proper way to assess the value of employer-paid fringe benefits. That regulation states: "The fair market value of a fringe benefit is the amount that an individual would have to pay for the particular fringe benefit in an arm's-length transaction. . . . An employee's subjective perception of the value of a fringe benefit is not relevant."
But the regulation on parking issued last December contained what in tax jargon is known as a transition rule and what others might call a one-year escape hatch. For 1993 taxes, the ones due this April 15, employers can apply any "reasonable good faith" method of calculating what the parking they provide their employees is worth. In the case of the Government, the rules left it up to each department and agency to determine the value of the parking it provides for its workers.
Lawyers and consultants who advise clients on the taxation of fringe benefits say that private employers in the few large cities in the country where parking runs higher than $155 a month are scrambling to take advantage of the escape clause.
At the tax agency's headquarters on Constitution Avenue, 79 officials enjoy free, indoor, reserved parking. They are given to the highest ranking officials, handicapped workers and some who work nights.
For taxes due this year, the agency has decided not to follow in the case of its own employees what it has proclaimed in the 1986 regulation to be the proper way to calculate the value of parking or any other fringe benefit. Instead, said Frank Keith, an agency spokesman, the agency figured the worth of parking spaces on the basis of the rent the agency pays the General Services Administration, the Government's landlord.
 
Justification of Move
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Keith described the process this way: "We are assessed a fee of $6.93 per square foot for our parking garage. We multiplied that by the square footage of the parking spaces and determined that it came to less than $155 a month. This particular method we used for evaluation, a good faith method, is a method any taxpayer could have used."
Maybe so. But it is not an arm's-length transaction.
The Justice Department, which enforces the laws, the General Accounting Office, which audits the Government's books, and many other departments and agencies followed the lead of the I.R.S. and used a similar method to figure the worth of parking last year to their employees.
A spot check of commercial parking lots near Capitol Hill and in downtown Washington, where most of the Cabinet Departments are situated, shows that indoor, reserved spaces cost about $300 a month. Outdoor spaces and unreserved spaces indoors generally run less than $155, below the threshold of the new law.
In any event, the rules mean that beginning with income earned in 1994, all Senators and Representatives, most Cabinet officers and thousands of other executive branch officials and Congressional aides who park indoors in spaces reserved for them will owe taxes on at least an additional $1,740 ($300 minus $155, or $145, times 12 months). Those in the 36 percent tax bracket will owe an additional $626 in taxes on April 15, 1995.
The White House and the Treasury Department do not have indoor garages, so parking there probably falls beneath the threshold. (In a true arm's-length transaction, based on, say, what a parking space might go for at auction, the outdoor spots on West Executive Avenue next to the White House, where the really important people park, are probably worth thousands of dollars a month. But that is beside the point. Surely no one will ever be required to make that calculation.)
Asked about this the day after an ice storm last week, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said, "You see me scraping the ice last night, and you tell me this is worth more than $155."

HEADLINE: Oregon Starts to Extend Health Care

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 17

 BODY:
A woman stood up and asked, If someone makes absolutely no money, how could she possibly prove that her income was below the Federal poverty line to qualify for free medical insurance.
A man wanted to know if the cost of an operation that is not covered by insurance could be covered if the condition is discovered during a surgical procedure that does qualify for reimbursement. 
 "What about periodontal costs?" an older man called out.
The questions continued for an hour one night last week as two state administrators explained Oregon's new health care plan at a center for the elderly in Tigard, a suburb south of here. Many people listened with worried expressions.
 
Questions on Ability to Pay
 After years of dispute, Oregon is finally beginning to carry out an ambitious plan to extend health coverage to all residents, and the people at the Tigard Senior Center were some of the intended beneficiaries. In the first step, which took effect on Feb. 1, Oregon became the first state to extend Medicaid coverage, care paid for by the state and Federal governments, to most residents below the poverty line.
But serious questions are already being raised about the state's ability to pay for the new services and its political will to extend insurance to all.
The next step toward universal coverage is to require all employers to contribute toward health insurance, but that has been resisted by small-business owners, and the mandate has been put off until 1998.
Oregon's original idea was to help pay for the expanded coverage of poor people by eliminating payments for treatments deemed low in benefit, a step toward rationing that drew widespread criticism. In the end, only the most marginal of medical services were eliminated, saving little money, and the State Legislature had to come up with $65 million at a time of acute financial strain.
 
Difficult Decisions Ahead
 In coming years, unless it is bailed out by a new national health program, the state will either have to approve large additional outlays for health coverage or take the politically explosive step of scaling back the treatments it covers under Medicaid, denying medically useful care.
The five-year experiment guarantees coverage to all Oregonians whose income is under the Federal poverty level but too high to qualify for the existing Medicaid program. The estimated Federal poverty level for a family of four in 1993 was an annual income of $14,764.
The focus of most questions in Tigard last week was the list of covered services. The administrators' answers allayed enough anxieties to cause a near stampede when the audience was invited to fill out application forms.
"This is wonderful," said Janet Wieneke, 36, an unemployed radiation therapist. "Now, I've got no insurance and it's real scary. With every ache or pain, you think this is it. I could lose everything I own."
State officials estimate that as many as 120,000 of the 479,000 Oregonians without health coverage could qualify for the expanded Medicaid program. Applicants need to meet the poverty-line requirement for only a month to qualify for six months of coverage.
In formulating the Oregon plan, which provides a choice among 22 health maintenance organizations, a state panel produced a list of 696 health conditions and treatments, ranking them on a cost-benefit basis. After public hearings and negotiations with Washington, the state agreed to cover the first 565.
 
Extent of Coverage
 The plan provides general medical and dental coverage, with no stipulations for pre-existing conditions, and covers the entire cost of prescriptions. The conditions excluded from coverage are those that are not deemed to be serious enough to require treatment, like common colds, flu, mild food poisoning, sprains, cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments for diseases in advanced stages.
The program was approved for the 17 months through June 30, 1995, with financing of $20 million from the state's general fund and a gradual increase on cigarette taxes that is expected to produce $45 million.
But with the new plan scheduled to absorb all those who remain under the standard Medicaid plan by Jan. 1, 1995, and with benefits expanding to include mental health and chemical dependency treatment, officials are predicting that costs could rise to as much as $200 million over the next two-year period. With the cigarette tax increase expiring, it remains unclear where the money would come from in a state that prides itself on having no sales tax.
The entire Oregon plan could be folded into whatever national program is adopted by the Federal Government. "Which would be fine with me," said John Kitzhaber, a former state legislator who helped draw up the state's plan.
Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democratic candidate for governor, said the plan that went into effect two weeks ago differed from his original concept in one major area: the timing of the requirement that all employers offer health insurance. The original plan would have required employers to cover all workers by July 1993. For companies with 25 employees and more, the deadline was pushed back to July 1995, then to March 31, 1997. Companies with fewer than 25 workers were given until Jan. 1, 1998, to comply.
 
Concern on Rationing
 Advocates for the poor are concerned that the delay, combined with the possibility that health care costs will continue to rise in the short term, will force the state to begin cutting back on medical services that are covered, causing the dreaded rationing.
"Because Oregon has done nothing to control costs, there is only one way they will respond: move the benefit line," said Ellen Pinney, the executive director of the Oregon Health Action Campaign. But when the Federal Government approved the Medicaid experiment last year, it banned a reduction in services for two years, and required Federal permission for three years after that. What will happen if the state cannot come up with the required money is unclear.
In the past two weeks, the response to the plan around the state has been overwhelming, health officials say. Calls to an information number have far exceeded early projections of 5,000 a month, said Hersh Crawford, the assistant director of the state's medical assistance program. "The reality has been, we're getting 3,500 to 4,000 a day," he said.
Many of the 200 community meetings, like the one in Tigard, have attracted as many as 150 people at a time.
For people like John Oliphant, 26, an unemployed former marine who is now studying criminal justice at a local community college, the plan offers new hope. After his wife, Rae, was involved in an automobile accident, he said he called the health plan's information line and was told that her medical bills would be covered. He came to the Tigard center to enroll.
"When I called, they told me I would qualify, but I'm still a little skeptical," Mr. Oliphant said. "I know this is helpful. But I'll feel a lot better when my wife goes to the doctor and it's all paid for."

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip Nervously Following Bonds' Lead

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In a second straight session of falling prices, the stock market followed the unnerved bond market yesterday, as prices dropped on the leading stock exchanges in moderate trading before the long holiday weekend.
Now, both stock and bond traders will turn their uneasy gaze to Congressional testimony on Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan is sure to startle both markets by what he says, or fails to say, about future increases in interest rates. 
 Three weeks ago, when Mr. Greenspan testified, he clearly signaled a rise in interest rates to fight a potential resurgence of inflation. His testimony preceded by mere days a quarter-point rise in a key short-term rate that touched off a 96-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
 
 
Most Dow Stocks Drop
 The stock market has not been the same since. Traders yesterday bid down 27 of the 30 component stocks of the Dow industrial average and 313 of the components of the Standard & Poor's 500.
The Dow dropped 35.18 points, to 3,887.46, the S.& P. 500 fell 2.65 points, to 467.69, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 1.39 points, to 788.85.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.51 points, to 259.87, on volume of 290 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered those that rose by 1,411 to 706. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 3.51 points, to 470.95.
David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers Inc., said the stock and bond markets were moving on more than a morbid fascination with inflation and interest rates. Recent economic data like housing starts and auto sales, despite having been distorted by severe winter weather and the Los Angeles earthquake, have been strongly positive, he noted.
The economy is bound to accelerate as the weather improves, Mr. Shulman said, and that could possibly hurt stocks. "If the economic recovery moves from Wall Street to Main Street," he said, "then people will move from buying stocks to buying cars and houses and refrigerators. The financial market will get less of that pool of funds."
 
 
Another Decline Predicted
 William E. Raftery, a market technician for Smith Barney Shearson, said he would not be surprised if the Dow dropped to 3,750 soon, perhaps as early as next week. "A hundred points or more is nothing on a Dow close to 4,000," Mr. Raftery said. "You have got to think big numbers these days."
Yesterday, stock traders took their cue from bond traders fearful of a surge in inflation that for the moment has not become evident. When corporate borrowing costs rise, as when interest rates go up, stock prices of corporations often fall.
The fever chart of the bond traders was clear yesterday. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond generally reflects the bond market's outlook on interest rates. The yield has soared nearly 17 basis points in the last three sessions alone to close yesterday at 6.62 percent, the highest level in six and a half months. The 30-year bond's price, which declines as the yield rises, fell 11/32 , to 957/32 .
 
 
Utilities Also Falter
 The Dow Jones utilities average also seemed to reflect traders' inflation concerns. It declined for a sixth consecutive session, falling 3.56 points, to 208.54. Because stocks of electric power companies pay such high dividends, some market analysts regard them as a hybrid of stocks and bonds and a potential indicator of the future direction of both markets. A decline in the utilities average is said to signal higher interest rates.
Novell was the most active stock of the day, with 7.3 million shares traded. The maker of computer networking software rose 1 1/8, to 23 7/8, on reports that it could reap more than $100 million from new license fees for Unix computer software.
Ventritex, a maker of heart-treatment devices, was the second-most-active stock, with trading volume of 6.8 million shares. Its shares fell 10 1/4, to 26 3/4. Analysts downgraded the stock, citing questions about the company's compliance with a Food and Drug Administration inquiry.
In Japan, stocks traded slightly higher yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 28.21 points, or about a tenth of a percent, to 18,959.60.

As the college class of 1994 approaches graduation, it is that nervous time when parents who have not nagged once in four long years find themselves blurting out, "Have you found a job?"
Jeremy Palmer, an engineering student at the University of Connecticut here, is one who, somewhat to his surprise, does have a job, at General Electric. Before his successful internship at G.E. during the semester break, he said, "I had almost been locked into graduate school." 
 But to Mr. Palmer and his classmates, who entered college at the start of a recession and are leaving in what economists are saying is the first foothold of a recovery, landing a first job out in the real world is not what it used to be.
As college career officers across the country sound their final alarm this month, they are telling seniors that the job market is improving, even in the Northeast, where the recession hit hard. But after four years of cutbacks and reorganization and, plainly put, mass dismissals at the great names of American industry and finance, students know the market has changed, perhaps for their lifetime.
It may always have been a jungle out there, but they sense they are stepping back into the kind of workplace jungle that Upton Sinclair would recognize, one where loyalty is a luxury and security a dangerous illusion.
"People have been warning us, especially our parents, that you need to have an escape plan," Mr. Palmer said. "What I mean is, that once you're over 40, companies are likely to weed you out. You have to be prepared to start your own business or change careers."
With nearly 3,000 seniors graduating with degrees in liberal arts, business, engineering and health, the University of Connecticut offers a wide window into the changing job market and the evolving expectations of employers and their potential employees.
Career officers at the university say they know the job market is finally improving because more employers are coming to them. At the peak, in the late 1980's, 400 employers a year came to campus to interview seniors. At the nadir, in 1992, 150 did. This year, the number should pass 200, said Gene Policelli, assistant director of the Department of Career Programs.
As important, he said, as many as 100 companies with job openings call his department each month, asking for the resumes of qualified students.
"What I suspect, with this class, is that there is less frenzy about landing a job," Mr. Policelli said. "Not less anxiety, less frenzy. No one's surprised by what's out there."
For most students, February is a month for basketball fever, with both the men's and women's teams ranked in the Top 10 nationally this year. But for seniors, it is the month when career officers offer workshops on preparing resumes, interviewing, searching and networking. Mock interviews are conducted. Students start submitting their resumes for the real interviews.
 
Sit Down Front
 "Could I ask of you a favor?" Mr. Policelli said to 25 students gathered in a lecture hall one afternoon, none seated within 10 rows of where he stood. "All of you who would like jobs, please sit down in the front."
Seconds later, everyone rearranged, he continued, "What I really want to do today is psych you up to give you some hope that there is hope, and to put the fear of God in you that it won't happen unless you get out there."
The message that Mr. Policelli and his colleagues deliver is double-edged. "The whole concept of employment has changed," he warned. "Downsizing is real. That tremendous work force we had is not coming back."
But even companies that are dismissing thousands of older, experienced, higher-paid employees, he said, still need entry-level workers, especially those with the skills to step right in and do the work piling up on vacated desks.
"Maybe instead of hiring 10, they'll hire 3," he said. "So it's more competitive, but they're hiring."
Even getting a campus interview is competitive, he said. Most recruiters talk to only a dozen students; many companies want to see only students with grade-point averages above 3.0.
"This bothers us," he said, confiding that the university does not screen out students with averages below an employer's cut-off point. ""We've done some research, and we've found there's absolutely no correlation between a high G.P.A. and success on the job."
"Yes!" someone in the rear said softly but firmly.
"There's your hope," Mr. Policelli said.
Afterward, students talked about their plans. Lisa Diamond of Newington had built up her resume with a double major in psychology and journalism, an internship with the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission and, last semester, had worked full time at a law firm. Back on campus, she finally had time to think about life after graduation.
"I just want a job with benefits," she said.
Padrick Power of West Hartford was hearing contrary advice: adults were steering him toward sales, classmates toward teaching. His father had advised him not to worry about his philosophy major: "He told me, 'You're going to have to change careers anyway. Not jobs. Careers.' "
The recession, he said, had always been a concern. "It's been like a burden, an atmosphere of fear about the economy. Now you see companies laying people off and then hiring others, and you have to ask, are they really interested in me? Do they have any loyalty?"
John Totten of Coventry and Chris Alexopoulos of Storrs, both aspiring sports broadcasters, had been occupied with stints on the campus radio station, internships at a Hartford television station, and part-time jobs. They were prepared for the worst: leaving Connecticut.
"I'd go to Walla Walla if I could do radio there," Mr. Totten said. "But I'm in a position where I definitely have to have something in May. And I have to help my family. I can't just go home and take a year off."
Career officers say the seniors have realistic expectations. They understand why they are employable, fresh out of college, when their parents and other adults are losing jobs they might once have aspired to. They understand why more employers want to put them right to work, rather than invest in training them.
So they are not so surprised when a company like International Business Machines, once a symbol of careerlong employment, now comes to campus offering what it calls "term employment": a three-year contract.
"Students are doing better than older people in dealing with revisions to the implied social contract between employers and employees," said Raymond Palmer, a consultant with the career center at the School of Business Administration.
Many students are doing well. Health-service graduates and computer-science engineers are in demand. So are accounting majors like Cathy Jarrett of Stamford, who accepted a position as an auditor with KPMG Peat Marwick last October.
"Most of us are going Big Six," she said of her accounting classmates.
Many are undertaking the search with the sense of adventure that graduating seniors have always had. "I played football for four years, so I'm just starting now," said Gary Bailey, a communications-science major from Norwalk, who stopped by the career library to look up tips on interviewing. "I'm on pins and needles, trying to get my life in order."
In the United Technologies Building, a group of mechanical-engineering students agreed that with the three largest recruiters of University of Connecticut engineers laying off employees -- Electric Boat, Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky Aircraft -- they were prepared to look out of state.
"I don't think Connecticut is really a great place for industry, so I'm looking elsewhere," said Richard Glatt of Glastonbury.
Tim Mercier of Glastonbury said, "I'd be more willing to take a job that paid $5,000 less in return for knowing I could be there 10 or 15 years without having to worry."
 
Help With the Master's
 Jeremy Palmer said he hoped General Electric would help pay for him to pursue his master's degree. Jeff Staniunas of Manchester hoped to find a job in Connecticut "and then network my way out to Arizona."
Pratt & Whitney, where he had had a semester-long job arranged through the university, wanted to interview him, Mr. Staniunas said, but he was unsure. "Who's to say we won't be laid off in three years?"
Mr. Policelli says he is not surprised to see students leave Connecticut. Other parts of the country have jobs. But while he watches students adapt to the changing marketplace, he also wonders how their new, lower expectations will ultimately benefit the economy.
This is a generation that grew up leery of marriage and intimacy because of the divorces they saw all around them. Now, he said, its members are being encouraged to look warily on relationships with employers.
"What can they offer a company?" he said. "Two or three years, I tell them. Because that's all the company is going to offer them.
"Yes, I do worry. Where is their anchor?"

Dollar Closes With Losses After an Early Rally Falters

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most European currencies yesterday amid disappointment that it failed to sustain a rally after the German central bank cut an important interest rate.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7133 marks, down from 1.7265 marks on Thursday. 
 The Bundesbank said on Thursday that it was cutting its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent. Other European central banks also trimmed rates.
But interest rates in the United States moved higher yesterday as bond prices fell amid new fears of inflation.
Lower interest rates in other countries tend to make investments there less attractive, and the dollar initially rallied after the European rate cuts. But the dollar then failed to make much headway.
That dampened many players' expectations for a much higher dollar in coming months, prompting many to scale back their holdings of dollars.
The dollar's huge selloff at the beginning of the week against the Japanese yen also helped cast a shadow over the dollar.
"With the dollar down on the yen, it drags everything down with it," said Frank Pusateri, vice president at Bank of Boston.
The dollar did manage to post a minor gain against the yen in trading yesterday after Japanese officials said they planned steps to make markets more open to American exports. In New York, the dollar rose to 104.61 yen, up from 104.25 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.4825 in late New York trading, from $1.4775 on Thursday.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the most active gold futures contract for April delivery dropped $2.70, to $381.60 an ounce.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4425 Swiss francs, down from 1.4575; 5.8238 French francs, down from 5.8665; 1.3427 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3377, and 1,666 Italian lire, down from 1,674.

Copper Eases but Still Ends The Week Nearly 2 Higher

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper prices retreated yesterday but still posted nearly a 2-cent-a-pound rise for the week as many analysts predicted an increase in copper demand from expanding global economies.
Crude oil prices edged lower, while heating oil, gasoline and natural gas prices firmed. 
 Profit taking was prevalent in many commodity markets, which will not reopen until Tuesday because of the long holiday weekend.
At the Commodity Exchange in New York, the March copper contract fell 2.05 cents, to 86 cents a pound. Bernard Savaiko, an analyst at Paine Webber, said the contract's failure to breach the 88-cent level had led to selling. "From there, prices eroded as stocks and bonds declined sharply amid fears of higher interest rates," he said.
The market posted a 10-month high of 90.3 cents a pound on Feb. 2, having only gradually recovered from a low of 72 cents set in October.
"The price I feel we need to achieve before we truly break the psychology of a six-year downtrend is 95 cents," Richard Hirsch of Sharps Pixley Brokers said at an American Metal Market copper forum this week. He based the outlook for higher prices on a continuation of the economic recovery in the United States and a quicker-than-expected economic bounce in Europe, perhaps led by Germany.
Charles Bradford of UBS Securities said that copper prices were likely to average around 85 cents a pound this year but rise to 95 cents next year. "In a recovery, you get substantial growth in consumption," he said.
But Leanne Baker of Salomon Brothers forecast a fall in copper prices because of expanded copper mining. "Supply on an annual basis should rise by about 5 percent in the second half of 1994," she said, predicting a copper surplus of 200,000 metric tons by the end of the year.
 In oil trading, Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at Cameron Hanover, said many investors had taken profits on previously established spread trades by buying back heating oil contracts and selling off gasoline contracts.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude lost 2 cents, to $14.21 a barrel; March heating oil added 0.51 cent, to 45.75 cents a gallon; March gasoline gained 0.17 cent, to 43.23 cents a gallon, and March natural gas jumped 3.3 cents, to $2.418 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Unwitting Hostages To Currency Risks

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
BETTING on currency moves is too risky, too hazardous, too akin to gambling for any investor short of George Soros, right?
Maybe, but that hasn't stopped millions of Americans from placing big wagers on currencies -- usually without knowing what they're betting on or, in some cases, without knowing that they are making a bet at all. These investments may come back to haunt them if, as many pundits predict, the dollar strengthens this year. 
 Given the kind of volatility investors saw last week, when the dollar plunged 4 percent against the Japanese yen on Monday before rebounding a bit, you might expect currency moves to have caught the attention even of people who think the Thai baht has something to do with baseball. Unfortunately, last week's action may have reassured, rather than alarmed, investors.
The reason: The dollar dropped. And while that made Tokyo a tougher place for American tourists to afford, it increased the dollar value of their investments in Japan.
With currencies as with stocks, nobody complains about volatility that's in her favor. And it's been years since the dollar slammed investors and helped travelers; the dollar peaked against most currencies back in 1985.
Though Europe's 1992 currency crisis certainly pounded investors in short-term global bond funds -- so much so that these funds barely exist anymore -- that was two years ago. "Memories have gotten so short," said Robert Markman, president of a Minneapolis investment advisory firm that bears his name. In 1990, 1991 and 1992 "people got killed in overseas markets," he said. "Now we've had one good year and they've had a financial lobotomy."
But many Americans have been investing overseas for less than a year, pouring billions of greenbacks into all kinds of international investments, sometimes without knowing it. Lots of mutual funds that on the surface look like red, white and blue funds turn out, on close inspection, to have big bucks at work overseas. For example, Fidelity Capital Appreciation Fund has about 40 percent of its $1.4 billion in assets invested abroad.
Then there are foreign investments that trade on stock exchanges in the United States: closed-end country funds and American depository receipts, which are basically foreign companies' stocks. Because these securities look like domestic issues, and trade in dollars, neophyte investors may not have thought much about the fact that the underlying investments may be denominated in ringgits or Deutsche marks or pesos.
The biggest foreign investments, however, have come through American mutual funds that specialize in overseas stocks. Last year, Americans put $26.3 billion into international funds, more than in the previous 10 years put together, and five times 1992's level
"Currency can be a powerful force, to be ignored at your peril," said Simon H. Davies, investment director of Gartmore Capital Management Ltd. in London. Mr. Davies, who last year began managing an international mutual fund for the Colonial Group of Boston, said he was surprised to discover how few of his competitors hedge currency risk -- a situation he expects will change if he's right about the dollar rising later this year.
In fact, investors counting on professional money managers to protect them from currency risk may be in for a nasty surprise. Most mutual funds reserve the right to hedge their currency exposure, but many have little or no intention of doing so.
Even reading a fund's annual report may not tell you much, because disclosure about derivatives and currencies is weak, as even Federal regulators concede. The Securities and Exchange Commission's staff has discussed forcing international funds to disclose how much of their returns come from currency, but that trial balloon has never floated far.
Morningstar, the Chicago fund-tracking firm, does try to figure out whether funds are using currency hedges or not, but it's not easy, Jim Coursey, an analyst, reported. A few funds, most notably those run by G. T. Capital Management, are almost always hedging their currency exposure and qualify as active hedgers. A larger number, like those in Franklin Resources' Templeton division, never hedge. But "the vast majority fall into the category of occasional hedgers, which is squishy and noninformative," Mr. Coursey said.
Of course, hedging currencies can be expensive and is by no means foolproof. "I don't have a lot of confidence in real active currency management," said Kenneth Gregory, an investment adviser and editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in Orinda, Calif. "Even the smart guys are wrong a lot."
Furthermore, he noted, just because 10 percent of a portfolio is invested overseas, that doesn't mean it has 10 percent exposure to currency fluctuations. Some currencies, including many in Southeast Asia, are linked to the dollar, and foreign companies that export goods might do better if the dollar rises.
Still, Mr. Gregory said, over the last year he has increased his use of mutual funds that try to reduce their exposure to currency fluctuations.
Over the long run, currency fluctuations may be a wash, he said. "But the short run," he added, "can be pretty long sometimes: three or four or five years."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Maas Gaining Cash, Losing a Career

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
On the surface, the raise Kevin Maas won by losing in salary arbitration seems absurd. Maas went to bat for the Yankees only 177 times last season and batted .205, but he emerged from his hearing with a $170,000 raise, even though the Yankees' last offer before they submitted that figure represented a $30,000 pay cut.
That's what salary arbitration has done to clubs. It has made them economic wimps. For all of their complaining about players' salaries, the clubs approach the arbitration process with cowardice. Of the 80 players who exchanged salary figures with their clubs for this year's potential hearings, only two faced pay cuts. 
 Clubs are afraid to argue for cuts because they don't think arbitrators will grant them, but by not attempting to gain cuts, clubs are telling arbitrators that lower salaries are not part of the arbitration game.
So Maas will earn more money, and for possibly less work for the Yankees. That's the other side of the Kevin Maas story.
"It's a classic case of wasting an asset," Craig Fenech, the player's agent, said yesterday. "While that's unfortunate for the Yankees, it's tragic for Kevin. He's 29 years old. He has to get out and play or he won't have a career."
Maas has tried to have a career. About the only thing he hasn't done is picket outside Yankee Stadium carrying a sign saying, "Free Kevin Maas."
For more than a year, he has begged the Yankees to trade him or release him or sell him to a Japanese team. A couple of months ago he placed a series of telephone calls to George Steinbrenner, a man who shows such compassion for the underdog that he gave Tonya Harding $20,000 for training expenses. Maas wanted to make his case directly to his employer and ask him not to tender him a contract for the 1994 season, thus making him a free agent.
"We wanted to appeal to him as a human being to let him go," Fenech said. "He's 29. They're frittering away his career. He's never said play me. He's said if you have no use for me, trade me."
Steinbrenner never called back. After ignoring numerous messages, he had Tim McCleary, the Yankees' assistant general manager, make the call. The answer, of course, was no, just as it had been earlier, when Fenech, at Maas's request, asked Gene Michael, the general manager, to sell him to a Japanese team.
"What, are you crazy?" Fenech quoted Michael as responding. "What's the matter with you?"
Michael defended his decision not to let Maas walk away.
"We're not going to let a player go just because he wants to go," Michael said. "If we can get something for him, we'll let him go. I told Hensley Meulens the same thing. He just wanted me to let him go. We have a lot of money invested in these guys. If I let guys go just because they want to be let go, I'd be fired."
So Maas remains trapped in an impossible situation. The Yankees have absolutely no use for him -- Don Mattingly is their first baseman, Danny Tartabull the designated hitter -- and his trade value has plummeted to the used resin bag level, but they stubbornly refuse to liberate him.
Rumors surfaced recently that the Mets, in the market for a first baseman, were interested in Maas, but there's no way the Yankees would send him to Shea Stadium. Fenech believes the Yankees would send Maas to Columbus before they would put him on the subway to Queens, although he speculated that a $425,000 salary would be an expensive minor league salary.
A decade ago, though, the Yankees kept Butch Hobson at Columbus under house arrest for three years at $400,000 a year rather than release him and let him try to earn a major league job elsewhere.
Maas is caught in a baseball version of Catch 22. He has played professionally for eight years, but even after his ninth season, he will not have accumulated enough time to be a free agent either as a minor leaguer or a major leaguer. He needs nearly all of the next three seasons to gain major league free agency, or at least one day in the minors in each of two more seasons to qualify for minor league free agency.
His playing time with the Yankees has decreased each of the last two seasons, and Fenech said, "He would need a train wreck to play this year." Furthermore, the Yankees have a new left-handed hitter, Sam Horn, who could serve the part-time role Maas has played the past couple of seasons.
"I'm not asking the Yankees to get nothing for Kevin," Fenech said. "All I'm saying is give the kid a chance, before he's too old, to find out what kind of player he can be. When given a chance to perform, he performs well. We have never said he should be playing for the New York Yankees. What we have said is if you can't use him, let him go. The saddest part is no one gives a damn."
Meanwhile, the Yankees have given Maas a pay raise, which in their supposedly downtrodden financial straits is inexplicable.
"He's arbitration eligible," Michael said, trying to explain the raise. "The salary scale changes then and we acknowledge that. We admit that."
Fenech offered a different view.
"After three years, a player earns the right to be compensated if he's going to be warehoused," he said. "There's a terrible cost involved for Kevin, but there's compensation for that."

HEADLINE: REDESIGN PLANNED FOR CITY HOSPITAL SERVING BROOKLYN

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
Two weeks after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared a moratorium on the billion-dollar reconstruction of Kings County Hospital, his administration and state officials say they plan a thorough redesign of the project in order to produce a smaller, more efficient institution.
The call for a redesign of the city's largest public hospital, coming after a decade generally acknowledged to have been wasted on delay, mismanagement and poor planning, is certain to postpone the long-awaited project in East Flatbush even further. 
 Political and neighborhood leaders in central Brooklyn, who have pleaded for a new hospital through more than three decades and five different mayors and who sharply criticized Mr. Giuliani when he imposed the moratorium, say the new delay is unconscionable.
"It's outrageous that they've spent all this money to have an expert design it, and now they say it won't meet the needs of the next century," said Waldaba Stewart, an economist living in Crown Heights who is a member of the Kings County Hospital Community Advisory Board. "How long is it going to take for them to come up with the right hospital?" So far, $43.6 million has been spent on planning and design.
 
A Design Too Old?
 But the swift changes transforming the country's health care system have already eclipsed the mid-1980's design for a sprawling, 1,200-bed campus that New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation has struggled for years to build, state and city health officials say.
Whatever hospital finally emerges will have fewer beds and be more tightly focused on primary care, with emphasis on prevention and outpatient treatment, rather than expensive specialties, they say.
"The project was not headed in the right direction," said Dr. Bruce Siegel, who began work this week as the new president of the hospitals agency, appointed by Mr. Giuliani. "All over America hospitals are redesigning to cut out expensive inpatient beds and expand their primary-care networks. It's not a good idea to just bulldoze ahead with a 15-year-old project that may not be what Brooklyn needs in the year 2000."
 
Mayor Concurs
 Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, said the Mayor concurred with Dr. Siegel's desire to steer the project toward more primary care for the community. She said the two men would meet soon to discuss the precise size of the new hospital.
Residents and political leaders in central Brooklyn said they were suspicious of the administration's intentions in redesigning the project, expressing concern that the current moratorium is a prelude to simply killing the project in a largely black neighborhood that supported Mr. Giuliani's opponent. But Giuliani administration officials insisted they plan to build a replacement hospital with a minimum of delay.
There have been numerous master plans and designs for a replacement of the 62-year-old hospital, but the current plan, completed in 1986, calls for a 1.4-million-square-foot medical center with 1,220 beds and a full complement of specialized medical units, like a burn center and a radiation therapy clinic. The size of the new hospital was determined at a time when the existing building was so desperately overcrowded with patients that its ancient wards were jammed with makeshift beds and emergency cases could barely fit into overstuffed elevators.
But hospital records show that the occupancy rate of Kings County Hospital has steadily declined in the last five years from more than 100 percent to 75.4 percent in 1993, a trend matched by surrounding medical centers. Hospital officials say the construction throughout central Brooklyn of several primary-care centers, which practice preventive medicine and treat illnesses before they require hospitalization, has reduced the demand at Kings County, as have limits on Federal payments that result in shorter patient stays.
"What's happening at Kings County is part of a nationwide trend," said Robert D. Gumbs, executive director of the Health Systems Agency of New York City, which coordinates planning of new hospital operations in the city for the state. "Occupancy has dropped because of things like outpatient surgery and a better ability to manage H.I.V. and substance abuse. You don't need these mammoth structures anymore; the hospital will wind up being less important as the focal point of health care delivery."
As the Kings County Hospital plans are re-evaluated, Mr. Gumbs said, his agency would require the new hospital to have "significantly fewer" inpatient beds. He did not specify how many, but other city and state officials predicted that the new plan would include somewhere between 600 and 800 beds.
"There are a lot of people who think the optimal-size hospital is under 600 beds," said Dr. Siegel. "I want to look at this in the perspective of what is the size that the people of Brooklyn need. What does the community need?"
 
Duplication Cited
 A top official with the State Health Department said the moratorium was also an appropriate time to trim a large number of planned specialized units that are duplicated at the State University of New York's Health Sciences Center at Brooklyn, a 300-bed teaching hospital directly across Clarkson Avenue from Kings County. Edward J. Dowling, associate director of the Health Department's Division of Health Facility Planning, said there was no need to have two complete medical laboratories, radiation therapy units and obstetrics and pediatric units on both sides of the same street.
"This may be an opportunity to look at the scope of the project," said Mr. Dowling, who has been a critic of the project's size for many years. "I think there are several things that could be changed without adding another 10 years to planning it. And you don't want to walk away from the $119 million they've already spent."
Despite the concerns of some Brooklyn residents, Dr. Siegel said a replacement hospital for Kings County would definitely be built, and he predicted that the additional delays would be minor in comparison with the delays in the current project, which is about four years behind its original schedule.
Sidique A. Wai, president of the New York City Health Crisis Coalition, an umbrella organization of 15 community groups that has pressed for the new hospital, said he believed the neighborhood would not object to shifting the hospital's focus toward more primary care, but he insisted that the city provide a firm date when new construction would begin.
 
Councilman Objects
 Enoch Williams, a Brooklyn Councilman who is chairman of the Council's Health Committee, objected to the decision to reduce the hospital's size, saying residents of the area have the right to the same kind of full-service medical center that wealthier neighborhoods now enjoy.
"Those primary-care clinics are no panacea," said Mr. Williams. "We have a lot of health needs in central Brooklyn, and for them all of a sudden to turn everything around on this hospital just doesn't make sense. We can't stand any more stops on this."
Health and Hospitals officials say they have begun preliminary discussions with the state Dormitory Authority over whether that state agency might construct the new hospital and then turn it over to the city. Such a move, combined with the reduced scale of the hospital, could mean fewer construction jobs and fewer of the minority contractors that political leaders have requested, but Dr. Siegel said the agency's new highest priority was making the project manageable.
"I understand the symbolism of the project, and I understand the employment concerns," said Dr. Siegel. "But you have to remember that this is a health care project, and it should be designed to provide health care first and foremost."

HEADLINE: Russia's Sarajevo Gambit

 BODY:
Russia, after days of pouting over feeling shoved aside by NATO in Sarajevo, has now dramatically and unilaterally rewritten the script by cutting a deal with Bosnian Serbs and moving Russian troops into place around the besieged Bosnian capital.
Taken by surprise, Washington has little immediate choice but to accept Moscow's fait accompli. But it must not back off from its own principles and policies merely to let Boris Yeltsin please Russian nationalists who want to shift Moscow's policy in the Balkans toward a more partisan and confrontational path. 
 Acting independently of America and other Western powers, Moscow worked out its own arrangement Thursday with Bosnian Serb leaders. It provides for withdrawal of Serbian artillery from the Sarajevo area in exchange for the deployment of Russian troops there under a U.N. flag.
Russia's abrupt move could work out well for everyone if it simply represents a face-saving way for the Serbs to pull back their big guns. Besides saving Sarajevan lives, that would spare NATO from having to follow through on a risky bombing campaign, and would ease the growing pressure on Moscow from Russian nationalists.
But, unsettlingly, Russia now insists that its deal "negates" last week's NATO ultimatum, which threatened air strikes unless Serbian artillery surrounding Sarajevo was either pulled back or placed under U.N. control by tomorrow night. Moscow also wants Sarajevo placed under direct U.N. administration. But that would wrongly erode the authority of the Bosnian Government, effectively putting it out of business.
President Clinton and other NATO leaders must make three things clear at once: Any Russian troops deployed around Sarajevo should be under unambiguous United Nations command. The 10-day deadline on withdrawing or surrendering control over Serbian artillery still stands. And the West will not coerce the Bosnian Government into peace arrangements it reasonably resists.
Still unknown is where Mr. Yeltsin has struck the balance between trying to head off Russian nationalists and actually accommodating their demands. In the eyes of the nationalists, and probably of most Russians, the Bosnian Serbs are ethnic and religious brethren. Yet the Bosnian Serbs' leaders and their patrons in Belgrade are the declared political enemies of Russian reform and reformers like Mr. Yeltsin.
Is Mr. Yeltsin's dramatic gesture meant to protect the brotherly Serbs in their continued war of aggression against Bosnia, or to maneuver them into accepting a face-saving way out? The answer will only be known as events play out on the ground over the next few days.
In the best case, a concerted push by the U.S., Europe and Russia could help achieve a fair peace, which cannot be confined to Sarajevo but must encompass all of Bosnia. Such a peace would bring an end to attacks on civilians. It would leave the Government side with a workable economic base and maritime access to the outside world. And it would provide territorial arrangements allowing the secure passage of people and goods between all Government-controlled cities.
Saving Bosnia requires more than surrounding an isolated Sarajevo with Russian soldiers whose impartiality cannot be taken for granted -- unless they are under direct U.N. command.

SEGA ENTERPRISES FORECASTS DROP IN PROFITS

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Sega Enterprises Ltd., the Japanese video game maker that eclipsed its archrival, the Nintendo Company, in the United States market last year, yesterday forecast its first drop in profits in 12 years. It cited the soaring yen and the recession in Europe, as well as intensified competition. The company has been spending heavily to develop theme parks, advanced computer game machines and electronic toys. Such investments come with a cost, however, and Sega said its profits were likely to fall to 42.5 billion yen, or $408 million, in the year ending March 31, down nearly 23 percent from 55 billion yen, or $529 million, the previous year. It had previously forecast profits of 57.5 billion yen, or $552 million.

HEADLINE: Landfill Methane Doesn't Always Make Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "How Cities Make Money" (Op-Ed, Feb. 10) Gar Alperovitz, president of the National Center for Economic Alternatives, suggests that a methane recovery system at a landfill may be a "moneymaking venture" for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City to undertake. 
 Such a system has been in place at the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island since 1982, where it has produced gas high in British Thermal Units, which is sold to Brooklyn Union Gas. New York City is issuing a request to develop additional sections of the landfill for methane gas recovery and processing.
Landfill gas recovery with energy processing can be a very successful undertaking for local governments that own the landfills and companies that own power production and gas collection facilities.
The Methane Recovery From Landfill Yearbook, my organization's soon-to-be released biennial study, documents that about 225 landfills throughout the country are either operating or developing methane recovery and processing facilities.
However, this moneymaking idea is not as simple as merely putting it on a list would suggest. The profits from processing landfill gas derive, in part, from a favorable regulatory environment, which insures that the energy produced can be sold at a high enough rate to recover investment costs. With many utilities now buying electricity at low rates, landfill gas-to-energy may not necessarily be a "moneymaking venture."
Nevertheless, if the economic conditions are favorable, then the installation of a landfill gas recovery and processing plant will become a revenue producer for the landfill's owner.

HEADLINE: Equivalency Test Offers a Second Chance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with great interest "High School Equivalency Guarantees Second-Class Status" (letter, Jan. 31) by Steven Cameron and James Heckman, who are with the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy. They were responding to "High School Equivalency Test Poses a New Question: Will Taking It Matter?" (Education page, Jan. 5), which debated the value of the General Education Development test, a test used by the 50 states as a way for dropouts to earn a high school diploma. 
 My concern is that Mr. Cameron and Mr. Heckman have presented a distorted view of what G.E.D. tests can and cannot do, and that their research will inevitably be used to reduce or eliminate the funds for many programs.
The G.E.D. tests are tools for measuring what a graduating high school senior is supposed to know about mathematics, science, social studies, writing, literature and the arts. The tests are not supposed to guarantee economic or professional success.
No credential, no matter how prestigious, can do that, not even a college degree. The G.E.D. merely gives high school dropouts, regardless of race and class, a second chance to document what they have learned from school and from life.
Afterward, it is up to the individuals to decide which goals they should realistically pursue, given their own intellectual abilities and interests.
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Heckman suggest that earning a G.E.D. guarantees a person second-class status. To the contrary, the high-school equivalency certificate gives many Americans a second chance at gaining the skills that will put them on the path toward a more satisfying life. Why risk taking that away?
I speak as a G.E.D. graduate myself who happens to be a tenured member of the faculty at Princeton University. I do not consider myself, or the nearly half-million other Americans who earn their high school equivalency each year by passing the G.E.D. tests as second-class citizens.
For purely economic reasons, I left school after completing the eighth grade. My G.E.D. helped prepare me for the junior college where I earned a business degree, and later for the private four-year college where I was graduated magna cum laude.
Each year, approximately 25 percent of high school students leave school before graduating. Now that the Clinton Administration is proposing more than $600 million in budget cuts to Federal education programs, including $37.7 million used to pay for drop-out prevention programs, the G.E.D. alternative will undoubtedly become more important than ever.
Until someone can propose some real alternatives, why should we waste human capital by not providing second chances to this segment of our population?

HEADLINE: North Korea's Master Hand

BYLINE: By Michael Shapiro; Michael Shapiro, assistant professor of journalism at Columbia, is author of "The Shadow in the Sun: A Korean Year of Love and Sorrow."

 BODY:
In the end, North Korea did not blink. Despite reports this week of its capitulation in the face of economic sanctions, Pyongyang has emerged the victor in its confrontation with the United States over inspections of seven sites where it may or may not be producing nuclear weapons.
The crisis on the Korean peninsula has been defused, but only temporarily. North Korea has agreed to comply with terms to which, in fact, it had already agreed in 1985. Meanwhile, there is the strong suspicion that the evidence of weapons production can be found elsewhere, dumped in two nuclear waste sites the North Koreans insist remain off-limits, in the name of national sovereignty. And of course there is the legitimate fear that the inspections will come too late, that North Korea already has its bomb. 
 After months of negotiations, the West has succeeded only in buying time. And that is the truest measure of Pyongyang's victory. Because the agreement necessitates further talks, North Korea has insured that it will not be pushed off to the periphery of America's attention.
For the North Koreans, this crisis is not about war. It is about being treated as an equal by its most hated foe, the United States.
The moment the crisis ends, the moment Pyongyang assumes what in the West would be regarded as a reasonable position, is the moment North Korea recedes in significance and becomes just another small and impoverished country pleading with potential investors to visit.
Kim Il Sung, the dictator who has ruled North Korea for 48 years, has staked his claim to legitimacy on the idea that one day the world will finally come to its senses and recognize the long overlooked greatness of the Korean people. It is an appealing message to a people whose 5,000-year history is one of being marginalized by the powerful nations that surround it.
Mr. Kim also tells North Koreans that America lies in wait, ready to invade. So the country keeps its million-man army on alert. And it begins producing nuclear weapons -- or makes the world think it is producing nuclear weapons.
North Korea has committed savage terrorist acts like killing half the South Korean Cabinet in 1983 and blowing up a South Korean airliner in 1987, killing 115 people. But the world eventually turns away.
The threat of nuclear weapons, however, is another matter entirely. It is North Korea's most effective threat because it is sustainable.
All through the negotiations during the past year, through the apparent agreements and broken promises, there lingered the danger of what might be. And because Kim Il Sung has built up a reputation as a man crazy and determined enough to risk war, he cannot be taken lightly.
Pyongyang has made it clear that, in addition to seeing the end of the joint United States-South Korean "Team Spirit" war games, it wants to sit across the table from the Americans -- not in tandem with their despised brothers to the South and not with the United Nations. The North Koreans dream of joint ventures with American companies and of economic cooperation with our Government. One day the two countries might even talk of formalizing their relationship, of exchanging diplomats, just as equals do.
North Korea has the U.S. in a bind. If we call Kim Il Sung's bluff and heighten the pressure on Pyongyang, we risk the very real possibility of war on the Korean peninsula, where 35,000 American troops are stationed.
That path is unacceptable, which leaves us with no choice but to keep talking, giving North Korea the recognition it so badly wants. It is, to say the least, an unsatisfying resolution, as is always the case in bargaining with an enemy who has everything to gain and makes it clear that he believes he has nothing to lose.

HEADLINE: Keynes Would Be Horrified

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The headline for Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s review of the second volume of Robert Skidelsky's biography, "John Maynard Keynes" (Jan. 23), was "The Economist of the Century." A more appropriate title would have been "The Economist of the Depression." 
 In "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money," Keynes gave a prescription for dealing with an economic depression like the one that afflicted the United States during the 1930's: under those conditions, the Government should stimulate the economy through deficit spending. However, he also stated that as soon as the economy recovered, the Government should generate surpluses to repay the debt. This caveat has been ignored by virtually all politicians and by many economists.
The United States Government has incurred deficits in 54 of the past 60 years. The Federal debt totals $4.5 trillion and is growing at the rate of about $1 billion a day. Keynes would be horrified at the irresponsible policies that have been rationalized on the basis of his theories for dealing with the Depression of the 30's. Under current circumstances, Keynes would undoubtedly give top priority to policies that would balance the budget and start repaying the Federal debt.

HEADLINE: Mark Plaatjes

BYLINE: By Jere Longman; Jere Longman is a sports reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
December in Johannesburg, a place that gives a whole new meaning to white Christmas. The Plaatjes family gathers in a wide circle around the dining-room table, three dozen relatives holding hands, as grace is said before the homecoming meal. Mark Plaatjes, the youngest of five sons, has returned to the home he reluctantly left six years ago to escape apartheid and gain the chance to compete against the world's best runners.
In recent months, he has become both an American citizen and the world champion marathon runner. But apartheid never lets its victims off easily, and Plaatjes is reminded again of how much he has given up to pursue his dreams. 
 A vast welcoming meal of braised meat, curried chicken and a bean casserole has been prepared, along with cakes and ice cream for dessert. In the middle of dinner, a family news conference breaks out as Mark is peppered with questions about his victory in August at the world track-and-field championships in Stuttgart, Germany. At 5 foot 8, 117 pounds, he is built with a marathoner's muscular economy. He wears a trim beard and cinches his belt around a narrow waist; even at 32, he seems like a boy not yet grown into his clothes. His is a body built for distance, but his eyes are urgent, sprinter's eyes.
In an excited voice, Mark relives, mile by mile, that humid race in Stuttgart. For 12 years, since he won his first marathon, he worked toward that day, uncertain whether he could build a first-class career given the second-class existence prescribed by apartheid. As a South African, Mark was banned by international sanctions from competing against athletes from other countries. Even after he gained political asylum in the United States, he did not receive citizenship in time for the 1992 summer Olympics. It wasn't until the 1993 world championships that he ran head to head against the finest international marathoners instead of names and faces in a running magazine.
After 17 miles of that 26.2-mile race, Mark found himself in sixth place. At 21 1/2 miles, he had taken a secure grip on second place, but he was still 90 seconds behind a Namibian runner named Lucketz Swartbooi. Realizing he would win a medal, Mark was content to hold his position. Then Swartbooi began to fade. A half-mile from the finish, Mark caught him. "He had lost his last four marathons this way -- in the last mile; I felt sorry for him," Mark says. "I hesitated, but I knew I had to do it. He is only 27. He has a lot of time ahead of him. I didn't even look at him when I passed by."
At the finish line, there was confusion about whether Mark had to run another lap. Photographs circulated around the world showed him with his arms outstretched, his weary face not exalting in victory but anguished as he asked race officials: "Where is the finish line? Where is the finish line?"
Finally, someone told him to stop running. He crossed the line in 2:13:57, a relatively slow time, but fast enough on this day to be world champion. He won a Mercedes-Benz, and at his next marathon, in Korea in March, he will be able to command a handsome appearance fee (typically more than $100,000).
"You want to do something at the finish line, but I didn't know where it was," Mark says. "Still, it was a feeling I can't describe. I felt like I had legitimized myself as a runner. Very few people in life get a shot at their dream. I got a shot. I did it."
IN AN ADJACENT ROOM, RALPH Plaatjes lies on a sofa, wearing a T-shirt and athletic shorts, wrapped in a blanket, listening to his younger brother describe the race. His own voice trails off into a phlegmy cough, and he laughs and says: "I've never had a problem with smoking. Only the doctors have had a problem with me smoking."
Cancer has left him bedridden again. The disease that began in his spine has now invaded his lungs and liver. In 1990, doctors gave him six weeks to live, but six weeks have become three years, and Ralph has not yet succumbed. He still works as a builder when he feels fit, and, at 52, even with his body depleted, he remains thick and stout.
Victory at the world championships was as much a dream for Ralph as for Mark. Ralph had been more like a father than a brother, rearing Mark, pushing him to succeed in school and in running, proud of his brother but hard on him too. When Mark began running, Ralph would follow behind on a bicycle or in a car, hold up a brick and say, "Run faster, you bastard, or I'll hit you with this." To build up Mark's legs, Ralph made him train in heavy boots, carrying a backpack half filled with sand. He and his wife, Johanna, spent their money to enter Mark in races, to buy him shoes that cost up to $150 for an adequate pair. They paid the air fare to his distant races and, habitually late, scrambled to get him to local competitions on time.
"I learned how to run fast because we were always five minutes late getting to a race," Mark would joke. "I had to be fast just to catch up to everybody else."
By now, Ralph's stucco home in the Yeozille section of Johannesburg has become a museum of Mark's accomplishments, one entire wall of the living room given over to a display of trophies, photographs and a bronzed running shoe. Mark's medals fill up a travel bag like a treasure of doubloons. Ralph has his good days and bad days, five bad ones to every two good ones, he says, and there was one rough stretch in November where he didn't know if he would make it until the homecoming.
Earlier in the evening, tears welled in his eyes when Mark walked into the bedroom after a 14-hour flight from New York, trailing his wife, Shirley, and their three daughters, Gene, 9, Luz, 5, and Camille, 15 months. Mark leaned over to hug his brother, and Ralph pulled him close and said: "I'm so glad to see you. I didn't know if I would be around much longer." But this was the only sentimental moment Ralph allowed himself. He is not a man who expresses affection easily. The talk turned to the world championships, and Ralph's words came like fingers stabbing into Mark's chest. "I told you so," he said to his younger brother. "I just don't know what took you so long."
"You know how it is," Ralph is saying now, struggling to a sitting position on the sofa. "I'm never satisfied. If he wins, I always find fault. I don't want him to know how pleased I am. But he knows."
At age 3, Mark left his parents' home in the Johannesburg township of Coronationville. Twelve people, sometimes as many as 16, were crowded into three bedrooms, the only heat coming from a coal stove. So Mark went to live with his brother, Ralph, and Ralph's wife, Johanna.
In a country where everyone was tagged with a racial fingerprint -- a label that once determined where you could live and work and attend school, whom you could marry, whether you could swim at the beach and walk on the sidewalk -- the Plaatjes family was classified as "colored," or mixed race. Mark's maternal grandfather was Portuguese. Under the grand, failed scheme of racial separation, coloreds had marginally more privileges than blacks but never the equality of whites. Ralph and Johanna refused to accept such limited aspirations for Mark. Instead of a carpenter or a welder or an upholsterer -- his appointed stations as a colored -- he would become a doctor.
"You are as good as anybody," Ralph and Johanna told him repeatedly.
Mark ran his first race as a senior in high school in 1978. A friend dared him to run the 3,000-meter event at a meet, and he did, circling the cinder track in a pair of Converse high-top basketball sneakers and winning. Three months later, he became the national colored high-school champion. Ralph pushed him toward longer distances in this marathon-crazed country.
At age 17, Mark ran his first long-distance race, a 31-mile trek between Johannesburg and Pretoria. Early in training for the race, Ralph took Mark 18 miles from home, stopped the car and said, "Get out and run back." Mark had never run more than three or four miles in one workout, but Ralph would hear none of his protestations, yelling out of the window, "Run faster, or I'll bump you." Mark made it home, but says, "I couldn't walk for two days." Eventually, he worked up to 26 or 27 miles in training. On marathon day, his toenails came off with his shoes at the finish line, and he was not allowed to use the toilet facilities because he was not white. Still, Mark won the junior division and organizers presented him with a medal, a warm-up suit and a new pair of waffle-soled Nike running shoes.
When Mark's high school didn't offer biology, chemistry and physics, Ralph and Johanna found one that did. When the university admissions quota for coloreds was filled, they drove to Pretoria, the capital, and cajoled an education minister into providing Mark with the more difficult whites-only exams, which he easily passed -- gaining a place in an "open" university, one that admits a limited number of nonwhite students. He would become the only 1 of 10 Plaatjes children to attend college. Eventually, he was admitted to medical school at the University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg.
"We forced our way," Johanna Plaatjes says. "We wanted to show we could do the same as whites. His life was not going to stagnate. He wasn't going to live in a shell. He's a bird. Let him fly."
But a South African athlete could not easily spread his wings. From 1964 until 1992, South Africa was barred from the Olympics as part of international sanctions. For the final 17 years of isolation, the country's athletic borders were sealed. No South African runners could run on the outside; no foreigners could run inside. There were rare exceptions. Zola Budd, for example, received hurried citizenship and ran for England at the 1984 Olympics, where she collided with the American, Mary Decker, in that infamous barefoot tangle.
Inside South Africa, runners faced a more complicated -- and far more threatening -- political tangle. Anti-apartheid groups like the South African Council on Sport and the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee campaigned aggressively against "normal sport in an abnormal society." This meant asking athletes to boycott white-sanctioned events, including national championships, and to refuse to wear the green-and-gold colors of the national team. Mark could not abide by this. These groups were asking him to sacrifice his one great talent. A banned writer could smuggle his books to the outside. Nelson Mandela could spend 27 years in prison and, once released, still seek the presidency. But a runner's career ends once his legs are exhausted. So Plaatjes kept running, seeking to find liberation in his own personal achievement.
"What better way was there to show the authorities up, to show that you were just as good as anybody," Mark says. "That's all racism is, ignorance. If you show people what they don't know, they will change. I invited white people home, to show them that we slept in beds, not on rocks, that we ate the same food they did. You don't solve conflict by turning the other way. You look people in the face."
By 1987, Plaatjes had won two South African marthon championships and three national cross-country titles. He had run 2:08:58 -- then the 16th fastest marathon time in history. Of course, his every achievement was a shining light refracted through the prism of apartheid.
To many whites, Plaatjes was proof that apartheid was not so restrictive. To many nonwhites, he was a traitor. "Directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, he was an agent of apartheid," says Sam Ramsay, president of the South African Olympic Committee. "The message he sent was that he was an Uncle Tom."
Strangers approached Plaatjes in grocery stores or drove past and called him "a sellout," because he competed with whites. His mother, Louise, and his wife, Shirley, received anonymous phone calls at home and at work: "You'll find him dead on the doorstep." And: "You'll get another call to tell you where to pick up the body." Two of his friends died mysteriously while running. Mark himself was pushed out of the way of a swerving car while jogging with another marathoner. He was threatened with "necklacing," the grisly ritual during which a gasoline-soaked tire is placed on a victim's shoulders and set afire.
On the surface, Mark had a comfortable life. He was a medical-school student and an accomplished runner with an endorsement contract from a shoe company that provided him with free use of a car and a monthly stipend. He wrote a weekly newspaper column, made guest television appearances and built, along with Ralph, a house with a pool. But apartheid made him an incomplete citizen, left him a pariah in his own country.
Plaatjes also soured on medical school, leaving after three years to study physical therapy. "I didn't like the teaching methods," he says. "They prescribed drugs based on which companies put money into the program."
WHAT FINALLY DROVE him to leave South Africa was his daughter Gene. She was 3 and had begun to ask questions for which he had no comfortable answers. "How do you explain to a 3-year-old that she can't go to an amusement park because of the color of her skin?" he says. "Young children are so innocent. Gene would go up to white children, and the parents would reprimand her for talking to them or touching them. I didn't want her to grow up feeling inferior."
In January 1988, Mark, Shirley and Gene flew to Chicago, carrying two suitcases on what was planned as a monthlong vacation. They had no winter clothes and no idea that they wouldn't be returning home. Through a South African connection, the Plaatjes had come to visit Glenn Latimer, who runs a school for the disabled in suburban Chicago. Latimer needed a physical therapist. After much wrenching discussion, the Plaatjes decided he would take the job and apply for political asylum (which was quickly granted). Back in South Africa, his family was shocked.
"I was so close to the boy, it was like losing your right arm," Ralph says. "I was disappointed that he didn't inform me before he made up his mind. But I know now it was the right decision. He wouldn't be what he is if he stayed here."
Mark was an ocean away now, eventually setting up a physical therapy practice in Boulder, Colo., but Ralph continued to push him relentlessly. As a reminder of the old days, Ralph mailed a brick to Mark with this admonishment: "Run faster, or I'm coming."
"Ralph was the guy that always drove me, told me I could be the best in the world," Mark says. "If I finished second in a race, he said I should have finished first. If I won, he said I should have run faster. Even in school, he pushed and pushed. It wasn't an option; I was going to college. He made me do everything well. There was no excuse not to."
A different person -- perhaps most people -- would resent Ralph's relentless pressure. But Mark never did. "It was a natural acceptance that he knew what was right for me. I had to do it.
"I can see now there were some negatives. I wouldn't do it that way if my son were running. I would give a little more positive feedback. But his methods worked with me. You couldn't ask for a better motivator than him."
Still, it was three years before Mark won his first important marathon in the United States. The most discouraging time was the summer of 1992. South Africa was allowed back in the Olympics after an absence of three decades, but Mark was stateless, not having yet received his American citizenship. He watched on television. The South Africans had invited him to compete at their Olympic trials, but he declined. "I couldn't do it," Mark says. "We had made a commitment to the United States."
His citizenship finally came on July 24, 1993. Three weeks later, he ran in the world championships in Stuttgart. The marathon was not carried live on television in South Africa, so Ralph went to sleep on Aug. 14 not knowing the results. He awakened before dawn, switched on his radio and began channel-surfing. For two hours, he heard nothing about the order of finish. Finally, at 6 in the morning, word came from the BBC. Mark had won. A stream of congratulatory calls came, and Ralph feigned ignorance with each caller. Tell me again, he would say. Mark won? Where? You don't mean it. And he savored each retelling as if he were hearing the news for the first time.
"This was one of my dreams, that he would be the tops," Ralph says. "He had potential, so I was hard on him. I wouldn't take second best. When he won, I gave myself a hug."
A WEEK INTO MARK'S homecoming visit, Ralph suffers a setback, and Mark takes him for chemotherapy. "I feel so helpless," Ralph's wife, Johanna, says. After dinner, Mark sits at the dining-room table, head down, rubbing his eyes. The doctors have said there is nothing more that science can do. Mark is further distressed that two of his other brothers are drinking again, risking the loss of their jobs and families. That is one reason he left, he says, to get away from a country that tells black men they are less than zero and sends them to find their worth in a bottle. Mark is hearing whispers, too, about how he lives in splendor in the United States while his brothers live here in squalor. "If they only knew that I spend half my money on all my family," he says.
Could he ever move back, now that apartheid is imploding and elections are coming in April? Probably not, he says. He wants to re-enter medical school in Boulder, and he wants to win the 1996 Olympic marathon in Atlanta, an American finishing in a stadium full of Americans. "I feel a little guilty that I wasn't here for the changes," Mark says. "I really miss my friends and family. But the quality of life in America is so much better. The freedoms that Americans take for granted are the freedoms that people in other countries die for."
A few days later, Ralph begins coughing up blood. He misses a wedding for one of his nieces, and he spends Christmas in the hospital. By the middle of January, though, he is home and feeling fit enough to complete an addition to his house. Mark is leaving soon, returning to his physical-therapy practice. He is thinking about taking Ralph with him. Just in case something can be done.
"I may go," Ralph says, his voice strong over the phone. "My determination to make Mark a champion, that's the same determination I've got to overcome this. I'll fight it to the last. Maybe I need Mark standing there with that brick, telling me I must get fitter."

A Blunder, A Backlash, Now What?

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA League probably did not expect the outrage that greeted its report "Americanizing the American Orchestra" last summer. After all, the call for multicultural programming, including jazz and music from other cultures, is now commonplace in the visual arts and in educational curricula. The recommendations that orchestras reach out for new audiences by programming pop, using video and hiring interior decorators are no different from what has already been done in the entertainment business. Even the call for orchestras to hire consultants to begin "diversity sensitivity training" is just an attempt to catch up to other institutions. But the outrage was significant. And the league, shaken by widespread objections, is trying to figure out where it went wrong.
Recently some of the league's most important members have been registering their objections as well. Their resolution criticizing the report was presented to the league and obtained by the New York Times. These managers of some of the largest American orchestras objected to the way the report was prepared and released, and they argued that some of its conclusions were "seriously flawed." 
 The problem, they felt, was that the report did not recognize that orchestras have a very specialized function: to perform a particular repertory from a specific tradition. Instead of focusing on ways to educate a wider spectrum of listeners about that repertory, the report often seemed to be throwing in the towel. The league's report did not serve its constituents -- the orchestras, the audiences and musicians -- but a group of administrators and observers with a different agenda. The bigger challenge is that that agenda still carries great weight in a changing cultural and political climate.
This was apparent during a recent conversation in Los Angeles with Shelton Stanfill, who was named president of the Los Angeles Music Center last month. The music center is the West Coast counterpart of Lincoln Center. It has four resident companies: the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Center Theater Group, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. Its education division, one of the largest in the country, presents more than 12,000 in-school workshops and performances.
Like Lincoln Center, the music center will have a hand in programming, particularly when the Philharmonic moves to the new Walt Disney Concert Hall in the fall of 1997. Mr. Stanfill, formerly president of the Wolf Trap Foundation in Virginia, does not minimize the center's problems. The economy of southern California, he said, is being "restructured" (with hard times coming for the arts), and the demographics have changed; artworks of the Western tradition are being challenged by those of other communities.
In fact, Los Angeles, with its large Hispanic, black and Asian-American populations, provides a new version of the American melting pot in which whites will be an ethnic minority by the end of the century. The music center already has an "advancement committee" made up of about 30 representatives of the city's cultural and ethnic communities to guide outreach programs and provide what Mr. Stanfill calls a touchstone on "where we are, where we are going."
Last month, the opera company presented the first American performance of Manuel Penella's 1916 zarzuela, "El Gato Montes," in Spanish. The production was supported by a three-year grant from AT&T to help bring Hispanic audiences into the opera house. An irony of such an outreach project is that this zarzuela, with its verismo style, is nearly as alien to Mexican communities in Los Angeles as is an Italian view of bohemians on Paris's left bank. The 1990 Los Angeles Festival, directed by Peter Sellars, took a more radical approach to multicultural programming, presenting music, dance and drama from cultures on the Pacific Rim rather than centering on the European tradition.
Political shifts in the status of traditional arts institutions have been more evident in other cities. St. Louis gave financing priority to its zoo over its orchestra. In Houston, a coalition of ethnic arts leaders persuaded the arts council to decrease the money allotted to organizations like the Houston Grand Opera. Can Los Angeles be far behind?
"I don't have a sense of where this place will be 10 years from now," Mr. Stanfill said of the music center. "The changes are so dramatic in demographics and economics."
The changes, of course, can lead to such welcome discoveries as the Penella work and to expanded knowledge about the remarkable musical traditions of the world. Certainly, too, the confluence of cultures has been a distinguishing characteristic of the Western artistic tradition, which has also, in turn, found devoted audiences in other cultures.
But crudely applied pressures can lead to such meretricious pandering as the opera "Frida," which attracted so much self-congratulatory attention in Houston. They can lead to policies allocating concert pieces and orchestra chairs according to some artificially imposed demographic hierarchy. They can lead to arguments that esthetic distinctions are meaningless. They can also lead to the misguided recommendations of the league report.
There is a large audience that will object to such policies, as the league learned. Meanwhile, the issues behind the report -- issues now being raised in arts centers around the country -- have yet to be seriously addressed.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Is It Time To Buy A Co-op?

SERIES: The first of two articles.

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
AFTER suffering nearly four years of widespread financial instability, a credit famine and tumbling values, the co-op apartment market in New York City may now offer some of the most affordable housing in the entire metropolitan region.
Though not all buildings were affected, co-ops in general became difficult to sell in recent years. Studio and one-bedroom apartments, especially those with shaky financial underpinnings, were particularly hard-hit. In the last year, median prices for all co-ops in Manhattan fell by 9.8 percent, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, with the prices of units of one bedroom or less falling by 12.1 percent. 
 As a result co-ops may now offer unusual opportunities, and they are often in prime locations -- an outcome of the avalanche of conversions in the 80's that produced many more co-ops than condominiums.
Folded into this reversal of fortune is a window of opportunity for anyone with limited means who is new to the co-op market. Exceptional chances also exist for tenants already in these buildings who may have declined earlier chances to purchase their apartments, but now find their homes being offered to them at significantly lower prices.
"There are some incredible deals out there," said Diane Papsidero, a loan officer with Washington Mortgage Financing Group of Jersey City, mortgage bankers that specialize in financing underlying mortgages in co-op buildings.
"It really is a good time to buy because the situation is certainly not going to get any worse and it's already getting better," said Stuart Saft, a partner with Wolf, Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz, who is chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
The fear that the co-op itself might slide into bankruptcy, wiping out the buyer's equity, afflicted hundreds of prospective buyers and owners from 1989 through 1992. Many financially strapped sponsors stopped paying their share of a building's maintenance costs, causing a financial crisis during which some bills could not be met.
Brokers and others in the real estate industry around the city suggest that this has now ended.
"You're hard-pressed to find a building that's not worked out its problems with the sponsor," said James Goldstick, sales manager at Mark Greenberg Real Estate of Manhattan, a company that manages and markets some 60 co-op buildings throughout the city.
A result, he says, is that income from maintenance fees is more likely to be covering expenses. There is less danger of having to pay supplementary maintenance charges or special assessments to cover shortfalls.
The problem of getting financing, either to buy or sell a unit, is also receding as banks return to co-op lending. A key element in the banks' return was the announcement several months ago by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which buys residential mortgages and tends to set policy for the industry, of liberalized guidelines for co-op lending in New York City. Though this new program was slow to get off the ground it is now starting to make hundreds of buildings previously deemed unfit for financing eligible for loans.
The more liberal rules have also encouraged new lenders to come aboard, such as the National Co-op Bank, which started making co-op share loans in New York for the first time only in January.
The National Co-op Bank will now finance buyers in buildings where only 51 percent of the units have been sold, compared with the former industry minimum of around 70 percent.
"It's going be much easier to buy and sell in the future," said Dorothy Babson, National Co-op's manager for share loans.
The upshot is that dozens of unsold or occupied units that were frozen for years in legal limbo while their status was being clarified are increasingly being acquired by owner-occupiers, allowing even the worst of the buildings to reclaim financial respectability.
In December, for instance, Mark Zborovsky, president of Mark Zborovsky & Company, a real estate brokerage dealing mainly with investors, arranged for the sale of 476 of these "frozen" units in 14 buildings in four of the five boroughs. They had been repossessed by a banking institution following sponsor defaults. He sold them as a package to an investor who is now offering them individually to the general public -- to outsiders if the unit is vacant or to the tenant in possession if the unit is already occupied.
An improved proportion of owner-occupied units has also enabled more of the troubled buildings to refinance their underlying mortgages, noted Ms. Papsidero, the mortgage banker. At today's low rates, this should also control maintenance costs -- another concern keeping buyers away.
The icing on the cake is the fire-sale prices. According to Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a real estate concern that regularly charts values, a one-bedroom co-op apartment in a postwar building on the Upper East Side or West Side of Manhattan that might have cost $275,000 in 1988 now sells for around $160,000. And there are more than 2,000 such units to choose from, she said.
BY contrast, a condominium of equal size and amenities that would have sold for $375,000 in 1988 has dropped only to $275,000. Moreover, only around 600 are on the market. And there's not even that much difference in carrying costs -- around $750 a month for the co-op compared with $570 for the condominium.
Prices are even cheaper in co-op buildings that suffered serious financial distress because of a defaulting sponsor or a preponderance of unsold units.
In boroughs outside Manhattan, studios and one-bedroom units in such buildings still fetch only around $30,000, says James Samson, a partner with Bangser Klein Rocca & Blum, a Manhattan law firm that represents some 80 co-op boards. And that can make them cheaper than rentals.
Insiders -- nonpurchasing tenants already in possession -- can grab an even sweeter deal. At a 40-unit co-op on West 111th Street in Morningside Heights, one tenant, who declined to allow his name to be published, just bought his one-bedroom apartment for $14,552. In 1984, when the building was first converted to a co-op, he was offered the same unit for $96,300.
One reason for these exceptional insider prices, say lawyers, is the desire by a growing number of defaulting sponsors, as well as the lenders and co-op boards that have repossessed the units, to let some occupied units be acquired by insiders at nominal cost. This way, the percentage of owner-occupied apartments required by lenders before financing for all the others is permitted can be reached more rapidly, making the remaining units more marketable and thus more valuable.
Yet a further plus is a new move by the New York State Insurance Department to make title insurance available to the co-op buyer, much as it has always been for buyers of condominiums and detached houses.
"It makes you feel that much safer," said Mindy H. Stern, a lawyer with Shoeman, Marsh & Updike of Manhattan, who is involved in explaining the new insurance program to other co-op lawyers.
But issues in the transformation still require buyers -- whether they are insiders or outsiders -- to proceed with caution.
Next week: Questions that should be raised before buying, and the remaining drawbacks and pitfalls.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Briarcliff Manor;
Sweeping Vistas and Subdivided Estates

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN 

 BODY:
FROM the top of Scarborough Ridge, sweeping views of the Hudson River take in the broad expanse of Haverstraw Bay to the north and the skyscrapers of Manhattan 23 miles to the south.
That vista -- without the skyscrapers -- attracted Sint Sinck Indians, Dutch and English farmers and 19th-century estate owners with names like Vanderbilt and Webb. Modern-day landowners have included Brooke Astor and, until about 10 years ago, Queen Elizabeth of England. 
 Today, most of Briarcliff Manor's large properties have been converted into smaller lots in a village that won a county planning award in 1985 for its adaptive reuse of estates. Beechwood, the former riverfront estate of Frank A. Vanderlip, a banking executive, is now a homeowners' association whose members read in the mansion's library, swim in its pool and stroll beneath its copper beech trees.
Up on the ridge, the Renaissance Revival mansion designed by Stanford White for Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt's granddaughter Margaret and her husband, Elliott Shepard, is now the clubhouse for the Sleepy Hollow Country Club. The Ridgecrest section, bordering the club, is one of the most sought-after sections of the village.
"The view of the Hudson is drop-dead," said Elizabeth M. Biggar, manager of the Prudential-Carolyn A. Dwyer agency in Briarcliff Manor. Ridge lots are half an acre to an acre, but homes with good views sell for around $1 million, she said.
The ridge divides Briarcliff Manor from Scarborough, a hamlet with its own post office, railroad station and identity. When railroad officials tried to hang a sign reading "Briarcliff West" in the Scarborough station early in the century, it was promptly thrown in the river by the residents.
East of the ridge, Briarcliff Manor owes its special identity to its founder, Walter Law, a carpet manufacturer whose influence over the village proved so great that in an article in 1902, The New York Times called him "one of the few American millionaires to own villages of their own."
Arriving in 1890, Law bought up most of the small farms dotting the area. By 1900, his Briarcliff Farms employed virtually everyone in the area and supplied much of the metropolitan area with high-quality milk, American Beauty roses and bottled water. His employee population made the area eligible to become a village and in 1902 Law applied to the state for and got a village charter for Briarcliff Manor. He became one of the new village's first trustees; his son, Henry, was Mayor from 1918 to 1936.
One business venture made Briarcliff Manor internationally famous. Through the first third of the century, the Briarcliff Lodge, Law's resort hotel, which had 150 rooms when it opened in 1902, played host to a glittering clientele and served as a country getaway for such prominent New Yorkers as J. Pierpont Morgan, F. W. Woolworth and Jimmy Walker and the actresses Mary Pickford and Tallulah Bankhead. When it closed in 1936 it had about 200 rooms.
Guests took golf lessons from Gene Sarazen and tennis lessons from Bill Tilden and swam in a pool that Johnny Weismuller and Gertrude Ederle used for their olympic trials in 1924. Two years later, the Winter Olympic trials were held at the lodge using snow brought in by train from Canada.
Today, plans for the lodge, which became the main administrative building of King's College, have divided the village. An organization seeking to buy the lodge and the surrounding 52-acre campus in the center of the village to build an Irish-American cultural and sports center, Tara Circle, has generated intense opposition among residents concerned about environmental impacts. Should the plan be turned down, the property could revert to residential sites.
IN the village as a whole, approved plans for 299 attached one-family homes and 136 free-standing one-family homes have been gathering dust during the sluggish economy, but village officials say there is increased interest in development. "The phones are starting to ring," said Anthony Turiano, the assessor.
Residents worry about a sudden development boom, but Lynn M. McCrum, village manager for 22 years, said the village had established careful land-use policies.
"Briarcliff has changed very little since I arrived," Mr. McCrum said. "I take that as a compliment."
While the total of town, village, county and school taxes is relatively high, Mr. McCrum said, so is home-buyer interest in Briarcliff Manor. "We are just in such a good location," he said. Briarcliff Manor is 15 minutes northeast of White Plains, served by two railroad stations and intersected by the Taconic Parkway and Routes 9 and 9A. It lies in two towns, Ossining and Mount Pleasant.
Because land is expensive, with lots ranging from $250,000 to $350,000 an acre, there is little moderately priced housing, Mr. McCrum said. Voters have approved a bond issue to pay for a $2.67 million water filtration system and later this year a referendum will be held on building a new library.
Among the housing plans that have been approved are those for Briar Vista, which is to have 14 custom-built one-family homes on one-acre sites, and for the Unicorn at Sleepy Hollow, which is to have 30 homes in the same general area. All are expected to sell for about $600,000. Active work on infrastructure improvements, including the extension of existing streets, began in the fall.
The site is next to the Estates at Rosecliff, a nine-year-old planned community where 84 of what eventually will be 116 three- and four-bedroom one-family homes have been built on a 152-acre wooded estate once owned by Edward Walker Harden, who went from financial editor of The Chicago Tribune to a millionaire investment banker. With homeownership -- prices range from $449,000 for a three-bedroom house to $570,000 for a four-bedroom -- comes the use of Harden's Italianate mansion, pool and gardens.
MOST homes in Briarcliff Manor are one-family although three mostly two-bedroom condominium complexes have been built in the last decade. There is one three-story rental apartment complex, Briar House, with 66 two- and three-bedroom units, including some duplexes.
Agents say finding a home in Briarcliff Manor is extremely difficult. Inventories are at their lowest level in recent memory, said Eileen O'C. Weber, an agent with Houlihan Lawrence and the unofficial village historian.
"Clients are waiting in line for people to move," Mrs. Weber said. "There's such a demand to move to Briarcliff, but the houses people want we don't have."
Two- and three-bedroom starter homes in the Old Village and Crossroads area near the elementary school sell for $200,000 to $300,000 but are rarely available, say Mrs. Weber and Mrs. Biggar.
More expensive homes are found on Linden Circle overlooking the Hudson River in Scarborough, on plots laid out by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted. At Chilmark, the 250-acre former estate of V. Everit Macy, a Standard Oil heir, the Macy family planned the estate's transition to one-family homes whose owners, as an association, jointly own a swimming pool and tennis courts.
About a third of the village's children, including most Scarborough residents and all those in Chilmark, attend Ossining public schools. Real estate agents say the two systems are equal, but buyer preferences for the Briarcliff Manor schools have inflated prices for homes in the district, they say.
The Ossining School District is comparatively large, with 3,383 students in its three elementary schools and its middle and high school. Ossining High School, selected as one of the state's 10 best in 1985, sends 80 percent of its graduates to college. The high school, which graduated 211 students last year, has a fully licensed student-operated radio station and offers college-level courses sponsored by Syracuse University.
The Ann M. Dorner Middle School, named a Federal Blue Ribbon School of Excellence in 1989, has special honors programs in mathematics and science starting in Grade 6 and foreign language study in Grade 7.
AN unusual feature of Ossining's educational program is the Ossining Plan, which lets students progress through the grades as a cohesive group. Developed in response to the district's large multicultural population and with the community's endorsement, the plan keeps all students in a particular grade at the same school, encouraging a wide ethnic and racial mix.
The Briarcliff School district has 1,000 students in the k-6 Todd Elementary School and the combined Briarcliff Middle and High School.
The 88 members of Briarcliff High's Class of '93 had the highest SAT scores in 20 years and produced two National Merit finalists. Ninety percent went on to higher education. There are four National Merit finalists among this year's high school seniors. Briarcliff High School was the first in Westchester County to require and seniors to contribute 120 hours of community service before graduation.
Briarcliff Manor residents have a wealth of recreational opportunities in the village, including 167 acres of parkland plus biking and hiking on Old Croton Aqueduct Trail and the County Bike Trail. Two stables provide horses to ride on the grounds of the nearby 801-acre Rockefeller State Preserve.
The village's five parks have 10 tennis courts and three paddleball courts. The village pool at Law Memorial Park is open to all residents. Last year the fees were $200 for residents and $400 for school district residents who do not live in Briarcliff Manor.
Three small retail areas provide a typical assortment of laundries, grocery, hardware and liquor stores and pharmacies. On North State Road, Giardino's restaurant offers Italian specialities and fresh fish dishes.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Brokers Swing Onto Information Superhighways

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WITHIN the last six months Connecticut's residential real estate industry has developed five information superhighways capable of carrying highly detailed multiple listings throughout several counties and past state lines at the touch of a computer keyboard.
Computerized multiple listings have existed for a decade, and are available at most real estate offices by town. But they are relatively primitive compared to the new regional systems, which offer minutely detailed information and color pictures of homes in dozens of communities. 
 Originating in Norwalk, Hartford and New London, some of the new systems are fully operative and others soon will be.
In spite of the expensive equipment required and the cost of membership in two, three or more services, an increasing number of agencies and real estate boards around the state are buying into the regional services. Otherwise, they fear they will find themselves "on the exit ramp," as Lisa Governale, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Board of Realtors, put it.
But a pattern of geographical overlap and duplication of information is growing, along with problems arising from incompatibility among existing software and hardware leased over long terms.
And the proliferation of regional listing services is heading toward an informational traffic jam that the Connecticut Association of Realtors hopes to clear by 1996 with "a statewide system that provides our 13,000 members with greater access to listings and customers," said Gerald Kunde, the association's executive vice president. "And it could negotiate better terms with technology vendors on a volume basis."
Following a review of a study due in March, the association's board will vote in April on whether to create such a system.
Last November, in a move toward a nationwide multiple listing service, the National Association of Realtors in Chicago created a Federation of Real Estate Markets. Earlier this month, it allocated $1.9 million to incorporate it, hire personnel and buy equipment.
"Through the Federation," said Almon R. Smith, executive vice president of the board, "regional multiple-listing services will be able to interconnect with other regions next door or across the country."
This, he said, will "level the playing field for small and large realtors by negotiating for technology on a nationwide basis."
What is also occurring is the merging and downscaling of traditional real estate offices, just as other businesses have done in the recession. A laptop computer accompanying a broker from home to car to client is widely seen as the future, and it's here.
"There are areas of the country where realtors are using CD-Rom with portable hand-held equipment that can download all the information in a computer through any telephone connection," said Mr. Smith.
FAIRFIELD 1, a nonprofit corporation established with $500,000 from its four founder agencies -- William Pitt, William Raveis, Prudential Connecticut, and Coldwell Banker Schlott real estate companies -- is the first of Connecticut's regional multiple-listing services to offer such extensive information and training.
Its headquarters in Merritt 7, a Norwalk business park, opened last month, with a membership of 122 realty offices and 1,800 agents in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties.
Annual operating expenses, covered by membership fees, are estimated at around $1.3 million a year. Excess revenues would be distributed back to the members.
Its computer system, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, was supplied by PRC of McLean, Va., a division of Black & Decker. PRC also keeps a troubleshooter on site, ready to assist any office or agent with computer problems, and it provides instructors to train Fairfield members.
Nearly 4,000 properties can be called up on the screen in color, singly or up to 16 houses at once, interiors and exteriors, anywhere in the region. Textual information includes minutely detailed descriptions of rooms, basements, attics, landscaping, appliances, storage, roof, siding, utilities, taxes, estimated mortgage payments, fuel and air-conditioning.
Data on schools, demographics, architects, plumbers, mortgage lenders, contractors and town services will be added soon. Color printouts are immediately available to the customer and for advertising purposes.
"People trying to find a house sometimes worked with five or six agents in different towns over days or weeks," said Bett McCarthy, chief operating officer of Fairfield 1. "Now they can do it in an hour or two."
Competing with Fairfield 1 is the Realtors MLS of Greater Fairfield County, organized by 13 boards of realtors in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties and based at 116 East Avenue in Norwalk. "We have 600 offices and 4,850 agents" as members, said Donald Hull, the organization's chief executive, "but very few of the 16,000 listings are in the system as yet."
An effort to merge the two competitors, thus avoiding duplication, failed when it was discovered that Realtors MLS technology vendor, Moore Data Systems, provides a similar service but is not compatible with Fairfield 1's PRC system. "Nothing can happen until the contracts expire in five years," said Mr. Hull.
MEANWHILE, brokers such as Harriet Haffner, in business for 30 years in Norwalk and head of a firm bearing her name, joined both systems while retaining her membership in the multiple-listing service of the Norwalk Board of Realtors .
"I didn't feel that I could service my clients unless I had access to every piece of merchandise available," she said. "Listings are available to me in 23 towns, most of which I will never get to because I can't learn enough about 23 towns to avoid getting lost, nor can I speak intelligently about 23 school systems. Agents in other towns won't try to sell houses here for the same reason."
This, she said, "turned out to be a lot more expensive than I thought."
"My software was not applicable, so I had to buy software, and I had to update my computer equipment. My agents were distressed when they had to join both MLS's in order to stay competitive. It's been angst for everybody."
Regional multiple-listing service costs vary widely according to the level of service and numbers of subscribers. Charges for listings can range from $5 to $20, dues from $100 a year to $100 a quarter. Books showing all available listings are available at $50 a quarter, but "they are out of date by the time they are delivered twice a month," said Ms. McCarthy.
New London's Regional Multiple Listing Service uses Boris Systems of East Lansing, Mich., as its technology provider, while the United Regional Multiple Listing Service across the middle of the state, and the Hartford Regional Multiple Listing Service both use Realtron, of Pembroke, Mass. At least half a dozen other companies service individual boards and brokerages throughout Connecticut.
The Greenwich, Darien and New Milford Boards of Realtors have not joined any regional service although many real estate companies in those towns have.
"We think there will be a statewide realtors' MLS within two years, so we are going to wait," said Mary Beth Hackenberg, executive officer of the New Milford board.
David Ogilvie and Associates of Greenwich is another holdout, as is Susan Hughes, a broker with the firm and president of System One, a 600-member cooperative of smaller realtors in Connecticut and Westchester. "I see this really as a war among major computer companies trying to be the vendor for all of Connecticut," she said.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The American Radiator Building;
A 1924 Precursor of Art Deco

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE American Radiator Building, at 40 West 40th Street, is now just extra inventory in a recession-bloated sea of empty space. But it was once a dazzling new idea that promised to remake the city.
The owner of the striking black-and-gold, 23-story mid-block office tower, which has been vacant for four years, is getting restless and expects this spring either to convert the building to residential use or to sell it to a developer for the same purpose. 
 The man who designed the building, Raymond Hood, rocketed to prominence in 1922 when he won the international competition for The Chicago Tribune's new office tower. The young architect had been scraping by on small things, like radiator covers for the American Radiator Company, but after the competition he got many offers, including one from American Radiator for an office building facing Bryant Park on a block that until then was characterized by brownstones and turn-of-the-century clubs.
Hood embraced both the esthetic and business sides of architecture and was proud that the Radiator building steelwork was completed only seven months after the design. The building opened in 1924 and embodied several departures from existing practice.
In basic form it is a free-standing tower, a type diametrically opposed to the notion that buildings should have some shoulder-to-shoulder harmony.
Although free-standing towers have restricted floor areas because they are not built to the lot line, they can be treated architecturally all the way around and provide good natural light.
Hood also disliked the typical office building facade, where the regular dark glass reflections of the windows contrasted with the light masonry skin, making most buildings look like a "waffle stood on end," as he put it.
So he called for the American Radiator Building to be built of black brick (a product that proved very difficult to obtain) and topped it with gold-colored masonry units, which supposedly recalled the black iron and glowing embers of furnaces of the day.
The basic feeling of the tower is neo-Gothic and the exquisite bronze and marble entry is explicitly so. But the general ornament is abstract and clearly moving toward Art Deco, which would become important a year or two later.
Special floodlighting made the building "one of the sights of the city" at night, said the magazine American Architect, adding that "it has attracted and held the attention of thousands who ordinarily give little heed to street architecture."
In the basement, with its crypt-like low arched ceilings, were boiler and furnace showrooms. Upstairs were offices, including one for Hood, who went on to design the Daily News, McGraw-Hill and Rockefeller Center buildings, all landmarks of Art Deco modernism.
At the American Radiator Building, the fact that 90 percent of the space was within 25 feet of a window cut both ways. While it provided excellent light, it also meant that elevators ate up much of the interior space, something that Hood sought to mitigate with automatic leveling and push-button car gates to increase their operating efficiency.
In the tower, the far side of the building is never far away, and gives the sense of a flood of light. From it there are close views of other midblock towers of the same period and the idea of a city of medium-sized, independent office spires seems very reasonable, even if a bit quaint.
But the efficiency of building to fill the zoning envelope offered a greater logic, and the free-standing tower later appeared only on a huge scale, like the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings.
Hood combined a practical bent with a free spirit and was not loath to admit a style of life that included an appreciation of liquor at a time of Prohibition. He also testified as a witness for the defense in the 1927 obscenity case of the play "Sex," which was written by and starred Mae West (who was fined $500 and sentenced to 10 days in jail).
The Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Radiator building a landmark in 1974. American Radiator eventually became the American Standard Company, which in 1988 sold the building to a Japanese company, Clio Biz, just as a buying binge by Japanese peaked in New York.
Clio Biz announced at the time that it would convert the property to a 200-room hotel and build additional space on adjacent low-rise sites.
The typical floor area is so small, about 5,600 square feet, that it would be more profitable for residential than for office use in the midtown area.
A conversion is still the idea, says Daniel Stewart, a spokesman for Clio Biz, which he identifies as a real estate holding company controlled by a Japanese national who lives in both New York and Japan. Mr. Stewart says that there are now "promising" negotiations with a developer who would follow through with a residential condominium with hotel amenities.
If those talks fail, he says, "we'll do it ourselves."

 BODY:

CELEBRATING O'KEEFFE
One of America's legendary 20th-century artists will be celebrated in an exhibition titled "Of, For and By Georgia O'Keeffe," opening Friday at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Stamford, and running through April 20.
In addition to a display of her paintings and drawings, the show explores a broader view of her life with photographs of her and of subjects which were characteristic of her by famous photographers, including Alfred Stieglitz, Arnold Newman, Todd Webb and Eliot Porter. 
 As an indication of her influence on other artists, a selection of sculptures by Mary Callery and Juan Hamilton, two friends of O'Keeffe's, are also on view.
The museum, located on the ground floor of the Champion International Building on Atlantic Street at Tresser Boulevard, is open free of charge Tuesday through Saturday from 11 to 5. Free gallery talks are given on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 12:30 and free parking is available in the Champion garage on Tresser Boulevard. The number for more information is 358-7652.
 
TALES OF CITY LIFE
 "Griot New York," a full-length ballet that borrows its narrative format from the West African Griot, or tribal storyteller, relates in music and dance a variety of tales about city life. It will be performed next weekend at The Bushnell, 166 Capitol Avenue in Hartford, by the 15 members of the Garth Fagan Dance Company and a seven-piece ensemble of musicians.
The score is the first to be composed for a ballet by the noted trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The choreography is by Mr. Fagan and the scenery was designed by the sculptor Martin Puryear.
During its 23 years of existence, the Fagan company has acquired a distinctive style, melding modern dance, classical ballet, jazz and Afro-Caribbean movement. "Griot New York" gives the dancers an opportunity to display all of those stylistic components in such segments as "High Rise Riff," satirizing life among the yuppies; "Bayou Baroque," a love duet, and "The Disenfranchised," about big city homelessness.
Since it was first performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1991, the piece has been seen in a dozen American cities and in Vienna. Performances will be at 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday; 2:30 P.M. Sunday. Tickets, priced from $5.50 to $33.50, may be ordered by calling 246-6807.
 
CITIES OF THE FUTURE
 "The Future of the American City," a symposium questioning whether or not the cities can be saved, will take place in New Haven on Saturday from 9 to 5 in the auditorium of the Yale Law School, 127 Wall Street.
Following talks by Anthony Downs, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and others, four panel discussions will address the issues of economic and social factors, government and policy, urban design and urban life, and New Haven case studies.
A group of experts in the fields of architecture, urban planning, business and management, design, the environment, economic development and transportation has been assembled for the panels from Rutgers, Columbia and Yale Universities, the Ford Foundation, the Connecticut Department of Economic Development and the Connecticut Department of Transportation, as well as individual architects, developers and housing officials.
The fee is $30 in advance, $35 at the door and $10 for students with ID. Reservations may be made by calling 772-2788 and registration will begin at 8:15 A.M.
 
BRUCKNER REVISITED
 "Bruckner for People Who Think They Don't Like Bruckner," a symposium and two concerts, subtitled "Rarely Heard Works by Anton Bruckner" and sub-subtitled "Bruckner and the Nazis Re-examined" is to be held on Monday and Tuesday at Connecticut College in New London.
According to organizers of the event, a conference of this magnitude on Bruckner has not yet taken place in America because of the hostility toward his music generated by the Third Reich's lionizing of him, along with Richard Strauss, as a Teutonic musical icon. Strauss received his reprieve at a 1992 conference at Bard College in New York State.
Monday's concert at 8:30 P.M. includes Bruckner's Third Symphony arranged for two pianos and five of his songs performed by the baritone Richard Lalli. On Tuesday at 8 P.M. the program will consist of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony arranged for chamber orchestra, and a selection of choral works. Tickets are $7 per concert, or $5 for students.
Symposium sessions held both days cost $20 a day or $10 for students, including concert admission. Participants include Leon Botstein, president of Bard College; Christoff Wolff, dean of the Harvard Graduate School; Paul Hawkshaw, associate dean of the Yale School of Music; and faculty members from Oberlin College Conservatory, the University of Berlin, University of Hamburg, Duke University, the Bruckner Institute at Linz, the University of Liverpool, Alexander University of Nurnberg, and numerous other institutions here and abroad.
Registration for the entire conference costs $60, $30 for students. The number is 439-2787 for tickets or to obtain more information.
 
CAREERS IN BUILDING
 Each year the Southern Connecticut chapter of the National Association of Women in Construction sponsors a Block Kids competition, wherein children from first through sixth grade are given one hour to create a structure using 100 building blocks. This year's event will take place on Saturday from 3 to 5 P.M. at the Eli Whitney Museum, 915 Whitney Avenue in Hamden.
The purpose of the Block Kids contests is to heighten interest of boys and girls and their parents in the opportunities available for careers in construction. Winners will receive savings bonds, gift certificates, T-shirts and other prizes.
The National Association of Women in Construction has 9,000 members in the United States and Canada. For more information, or to enter the free competition, the number is 777-1833.
 
RESEARCHING ROOTS
 Finding one's roots through the computer and other resources is the subject of a seventh annual one-day genealogical seminar to be held by the Historical Society of Greenwich, the Stamford Historical Society and the Connecticut Ancestry Society. It is scheduled on Saturday from 9 to 4 at Christ Church Parish Hall, 254 East Putnam Avenue in Greenwich.
Thomas J. Kemp, the keynote speaker and director of special collections at the University of Southern Florida Library, is a former head librarian at Turn-of-River Library in Stamford. He will present two talks: "Technology Moves Forward Into the Past" and "Little Known Biographical Sources."
Craig R. Scott, editor and publisher of his own genealogical quarterly, will talk about researching records and conquering intimidation at the vast National Archives, and Kevin Mathewson, senior librarian of cataloguing at the New York Public Library, will discuss underused map resources.
New CD-ROM disks for genealogical research will be demonstrated by Robert W. Green of the Connecticut Ancestry Society, and a representative of Jonathan Sheppard Books, which specializes in out-of-print genealogies and local history will have some examples on hand.
Registration costs $45 and includes a morning snack and lunch. The number is 329-1183 for more information or to sign up.
 
BEETHOVEN BONANZA
 A double dose of Beethoven will be offered in Westport this week by the Friends of Music, in a lecture-demonstration by the Ad Hoc String Quartet on Wednesday at 8 P.M. at the Public Library, Bernhard Plaza, and a concert by the Talich Quartet from Prague on Saturday at 8:30 P.M. in the Unitarian Church, 10 Lyons Plain Road.
Joan Turner, violinist, will lead the discussion and demonstration of Beethoven chamber works on Wednesday, abetted by Herbert Steiner, violinist; Catherine Dobbs, violist, and Anne Rorich, cellist. Admission will be free.
Tickets for the Saturday concert are $15, or $10 for elderly people and students. The number is 227-3345 for reservations or more information. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Strategists Aren't Writing Japan Off Yet

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IF the recent collision between Japan and the United States over trade wiped out a bystander this week, it was the Japanese stock market. The trans-Pacific war of nerves put what had been one of the hottest markets in the world on the skids.
With the yen soaring in value, the prospects for corporate profits looking grimmer and the fear of American trade sanctions spreading, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks lost a little more than 5 percent of its value, closing Friday at 18,959.60. More than that, it made the market a hostage to the yen, which appears likely to remain strong for now. 
 Is the great bull run of 1994 already over?
The surprising answer from a number of market analysts is: don't bet on it. Some investors have been discouraged, of course, but many experts believe the news from Japan is likely to get better, not worse.
"I haven't changed my view," said Jeff Bahrenburg, the senior strategist here with Merrill Lynch Japan. "We still have a slight overweighting on Japan."
Added Geoffrey Barker, the head of research here with Baring Securities: "We haven't broken out of the uptrend in the market that we've seen since December. We had a correction, that's for sure, but we're still in the range."
The market has dropped 7.6 percent since hitting its recent peak about 10 days ago. But it has still gained more than 10 percent in the last two months.
In addition, foreign investors remain strong buyers, analysts said.
Foreigners made net purchases of a little more than a trillion yen worth of Japanese shares last year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the equivalent of almost $10 billion. Then in January, foreigners snapped up another $9 billion, the second-highest monthly total on record.
No one denies that there are serious problems in Japan. The economy is in a two-year-old recession, and the Government has offered fairly tepid measures to get it out of its rut. Corporations still have to do some deep cost-cutting to return to profitability.
And now there is the trade mess. The Administration has threatened to slap sanctions on Japan because of a dispute over the cellular phone market. Japan has suggested that it may retaliate if Washington acts. And the yen has shot up, squeezing exporters and their already strained bottom lines.
The real fear is that a prolonged rise in the yen could counter the $140 billion Government program to breathe new life into the economy.
"If the yen stays where it's at, it wipes out any positive impact of the stimulus package," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist here with Morgan Stanley Japan.
But barring the emergence of worse problems, most analysts seem to think Japan is near an economic turn and the stock market is anticipating the improvement.
For instance, Ms. Sasaki-Smith said she was expecting a quick reduction in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, perhaps in a week.
And Mr. Barker said, "This market wants to go up, and it will if there are more signs of a compromise on trade."
He and others argue that American pressure will speed up, if only slightly, Japan's push for greater economic deregulation. And that would help the market a great deal.
"The point is that the pressure will be good for Japan in the end," Mr. Bahrenburg said. "It will accelerate the changes already under way to opening things up."
Mr. Bahrenburg may be one of the more optimistic analysts. He said one cause for hope was the fact that corporate balance sheets had gotten so bad that only a small pickup in business could have a pronounced effect.
He said he had calculated that a 2 percent increase in sales and a reduction in fixed costs of just half a percent would lift pretax profits about 45 percent for most companies.
"That's a very big jump," he said. "The reason is that the bottom line is now so depressed. That's why I say that the long-term story is very positive."
He is so optimistic, in fact, that he has picked some long-ignored stocks for his model portfolio. He said he liked consumer goods companies like Sony, Toyota, Sharp and Jusco, a big retailer.
Mr. Bahrenburg said he was also recommending some capital goods stocks, like Canon, Tokyo Electron and Makino Milling. As it happens, corporations have been slashing their capital-spending budgets, so this is a bold move.
Mr. Barker said that the market as a whole was unlikely to show sharp improvement in the short term. But he said there were plenty of good opportunities for those willing to explore promising niches.
For instance, Mr. Barker said he was expecting some improvement in consumer spending. Thus, he likes Toyo Wharf and Warehouse and the Kamigumi Company, a port transportation and warehousing company. These are not exactly cutting-edge companies, but Mr. Barker said they appeared likely to enjoy some pickup in growth.
Even John Baldwin, the strategist here with Jardine Fleming Securities and a bear on the market, said he saw some good buys.
He said smaller companies in particular may prosper. "This is a good environment for an active fund manager," Mr. Baldwin said. "There are lots of little niches that will be profitable, even if there is not any growth in the index."
He said he liked Nichiei, which offers financing to mostly smaller companies, and Yamakawa, an auto parts producer.

HEADLINE: The Graying Factory

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
AT the age of 61, when many assembly line workers have retired to Florida or Arizona to pass their time playing cards or golf, James Langell rises almost every morning at 4:30 to prepare for his day at the Chrysler Corporation's Jefferson North plant here, where workers are scrambling to keep dealers stocked with the hot-selling Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Fifty-six times an hour, nine and a half hours a day, six days a week -- including Saturdays -- he installs the rear windshield washer hose and attaches front and rear bumpers, using a special screw gun that makes it easy on his arms and back to tighten screws. He has less than 90 seconds to do it and if he loses his rhythm he falls behind. 
 Hoses and bumpers. Hoses and bumpers. With seniority that comes with 30 years on assembly lines, Mr. Langell has a job that is not as taxing on his legs, arms and back as others. "At least I don't have to bend or get inside the cars. Those jobs are terrible," he said. Still it is tiring and monotonous, and the mandatory overtime as well as the pressure to churn out the cars -- without defects -- makes it even tougher.
"You work 10 hours a day, six days a week, and when you get up on Monday at 5 A.M., you're still tired," said Luther Cooksey, who during his nearly 28 years on the line has injured his back and suffered strains and cuts. Now, to avoid hamstring muscle pulls, he wears special pants favored by basketball players. "Time to move on and give a young man this job."
But where have all the young workers gone? In America's manufacturing heartland, ranging from aluminum factories to tire plants, there are precious few of the 90's version of the muscular long-hairs who populated plants 20 years ago. They declined in number along with newly-hired female workers after repeated layoffs in the 80's that pared thousands of people, mostly with little seniority. In industries like steel and rubber, and almost any place where layoffs, restructurings and union contracts have been the rule, only the oldest workers have survived.
 
Transforming a Work Force
 Now workers and management alike are trying to transform this old and tired work force into one of the most competitive and productive in the world. Onto their backs, biceps and brains have fallen the demands of increasing productivity, the work-smarter, work-faster ethos that has fueled a remarkable recovery not only on Detroit's assembly lines but in the manufacturing cities and towns across America.
"The traditional way of improving productivity has been to speed up the line, but you can't do that with older workers," said Harley Shaiken, who teaches industrial relations at the University of California at Berkeley. As workers in basic industries age, Mr. Shaiken said, "you have skill and experience, which can be positive factors if you know how to harness them." But "you can't rely on 22-year-olds working at the limit to dig you out of a hole."
One of the most stunning economic achievements the last decade has been the turnaround in manufacturing productivity growth -- the ultimate accelerator of profitability and pay. During the high-inflation, low-growth 1970's, America's factory productivity, though still the highest in the world, stalled. A decade later, after layoffs, plant closings and billions invested in technology, the nation's factories boasted the fastest rate of productivity growth among wealthy nations -- including Japan.
Here at the Jeep plant the average age is 52, the oldest in the auto industry and about six years higher than that of the average auto worker. Yet Chrysler is churning out the same 250,000 vehicles per year here as it did at the plant that Jefferson North replaced -- with only 2,500 workers to the old plant's 5,000. All told, Jefferson North, which opened in 1991, can assemble one and a half times as many vehicles per square foot as the leaky 84-year-old facility it replaced.
Engineers designed the Grand Cherokee for easier assembly than previous models. But much additional productivity was expected from harder, smarter efforts from individuals, as Detroit adopted Japan's lean production techniques. That expectation created new physical and mental burdens.
"There's not really enough time or space to do your job," said one worker. "You make one little mistake, you are in a hole," because the next vehicle arrives as the other one moves away.
TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY executives, before joining the General Motors Corporation in a joint venture in California some years ago, were worried that G.M. workers were too old and set in their work habits to adjust to the greater physical and mental demands of Toyota's manufacturing system. The venture largely has been a success, although some workers have complained about the fast pace and demands of work. In Japan, the average auto worker is 34.
To make sure workers don't collapse under the strain, Detroit auto makers have been compelled to rethink the deployment of an aging work force. At the old Jefferson plant Chrysler paid hundreds of extra workers whose only duties were to tidy up, fix mistakes and fill in for tired or absent workers.
No more. To keep cost down and quality up, workers today must be productive nearly every moment. That means they must do their own cleaning up. And increasingly, they must contribute ideas for efficiency, as well as physical effort.
Adjusting to a faster pace and additional responsibilities poses a particular challenge for older workers. So auto makers have instituted extensive training in problem-solving and teamwork; and they have installed ergonomic equipment to ease the physical strain.
The Jefferson North Assembly plant is the most modern in the American auto industry. Overhead conveyors tilt vehicle bodies at an angle so that workers standing underneath can easily make assemblies without straining. The entire plant "is designed to make jobs less physically demanding," said Jim Puckett, a 49-year-old millwright who has been in the plant for 30 years.
Mr. Cooksey, who is 46, uses a mechanically articulating arm to help him swing a 50-pound metal sheet that becomes the floor of a Grand Cherokee. The air guns that drive screws for Mr. Langell and a mitt worn by Keith Hence, a 44-year-old assembler who has worked at Chrysler 25 years, are specially designed to reduce the stress that causes painful wrist and arm injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome. Almost all line workers stand on special matting designed to reduce stress on backs and legs.
WHEN it built the plant, Chrysler constructed a small gym so that workers could stay fit. Now, employees can sometimes be seen power walking around the perimeter of the shop floor.
Manufacturers in other industries have used training and ergonomic design to improve productivity and reduce physical stress for a graying work force. For example, tire makers have designed a machine that raises tires onto a conveyor, eliminating the traditional task of lifting tires that weighed up to 110 pounds each.
At the Aluminum Company of America's plant in Davenport, Iowa, where the average age of workers is 47, "strains and sprains" were becoming a chronic problem until the company asked all 2,500 workers four years ago to attend a "back class." The classes continue and the result has been that injuries declined.
At USX Corporation's Braddock, Pa., steelworks, the company spent as much as $60,000 per worker to train men in their 50's in the operation of a high-tech continuous caster that makes steel more efficiently.
An even bigger payoff for training and ergonomics may arrive when a young generation of workers are hired on to replace those about to retire. Slowly, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation have begun to hire in small numbers, reflecting the rebound in car sales.
"This is an unprecedented chance to redefine what an auto worker will be," said Sean McAlinden, a labor economist at the University of Michigan. "There's a lot of thinking about what kind of skills an auto maker must have. The union wants this too, because it knows companies don't throw away skilled workers."
Russ Eckel, an industrial sociologist based in Boston, said older, more experienced workers "know a lot about design, and today companies are willing to listen to them and spend money on their ideas."
Historically, meeting production quotas took priority over quality, ease of effort or safety. So workers sometimes injured themselves struggling with defective parts or machines that didn't work properly. "First line supervisors are starting to listen when a team suggests changes," Mr. Eckel said.
In an unusual gesture, Chrysler invited workers to critique the Grand Cherokee before it went into production. Of 650 suggestions to improve manufacturability, 170 were accepted, including one, for example, to lengthen the connector on a bundle of wires, which simplified installation.
In practice, though, older workers can turn quickly cynical if they are encouraged to participate and their ideas aren't acted upon. They "get disgusted if they believe no one cares what they think," said Ron P. Mattice, 51, who leads a work team at the Chrysler plant.
Sometimes worker suggestions are flops. Said one worker, "They spent $15,000 to move a conveyor after the workers said it would improve things. Now the team wants it back the way it was." At the old Jefferson Avenue plant, a building that Jefferson North workers recall bittersweetly, workers didn't have to think, only sweat. A person with 20 or 25 years seniority exercised rights under the labor agreement to a respite from hard physical exertion. Older workers were entitled to a clipboard or the keys to a forklift -- a softer jobs away from the assembly line.
Safee Akbar, 67, with 51 years of seniority does indeed have such a job: He operates the computer that tracks parts deliveries and drives a forklift. Seniority rights remain in force, but the soft jobs today are few.
Instead, workers must master subjects like statistical process control, a technique of gathering and analyzing data that helps predict quality glitches and machine breakdowns. Trouble is, the education skills of many older workers have grown rusty. So they first must relearn basic math and reading, in addition to computer skills.
"The majority of workers have high school diplomas but that doesn't always mean you had a high school education," added Larry Morgan, a training manager for the United Automobile Workers union.
Big demand for the Grand Cherokee has increased the hours of overtime assigned to workers, consequently squeezing time available for training and discussion of quality-improvement ideas.
Constant overtime, rather than the intensity of the tasks or the pace, may have a negative impact on quality, as well as worker's attitudes toward their jobs. "Overtime followed by slack times are part of being an auto worker, but those jumps are what could be taking a toll on the 52-year-olds," said Robert Cole, a professor of business administration at the University of California at Berkeley.
Chrysler prefers to schedule overtime rather than to hire more workers, the alternative favored by the union and the workers. From the employers' perspective, new workers mean additional benefit costs. From the union's perspective, new members pay dues and reverse the membership losses. "The idea is not to hire too many workers, so we don't have to lay off people in the future," explained Jim Strasbaugh, a former Chrysler plant manager.
But Mr. Mattice argues that "people need more time off. The money is good but we need time to enjoy it." He owns a vacation home in northern Michigan and a speedboat. Most weeks Jefferson North is operating two shifts, 18 hours a day, every day except Sunday.
IN response to complaints about overtime, Chrysler recently instituted a special shutdown early on Friday so day shift workers could go to the bank. And in a few weeks, Chrysler will begin hiring temporary workers at the plant to fill in for hourly workers who say they are tired and want to take three-day weekends.
At the old plant any worker who needed a break could call in sick and bring a doctor's note. Some doctors on the east side of Detroit were known as quite willing to write excuses for auto workers. Absenteeism is no longer tolerated; besides, those still working are among the most dedicated. The only way out is retirement, which is possible on a full pension after 30 years of service.
Mr. Langell, whose first job on the line was stapling fender liners for 1954 Chrysler New York Yorkers and Imperials, made $55,000 last year and could retire now on a monthly check of $1,900 but has decided against it for awhile. "My wife died, this is all I have," he said.
Mr. Cooksey has 18 months to go and plans to retire immediately. "A lot of people just want to get out of here," Mr. Mattice said. "I go within the year. I've been very fortunate never to have any bad injuries, only a broken toe and a chipped tooth." By the year 2000, Mr. McAlinden predicts, most of the older workers will be retired and the face of Chrysler's work force will be suddenly and dramatically younger.
"The new guys will be facing a completely different environment than the one we've known," said Mr. McAlinden. "The people on the line know things must change, they're just asking for a chance to work their way out of it."
 
 
 
PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A RECALL
 THE Jeep Grand Cherokee, a hot-selling sport utility vehicle and the pride of the Jefferson North Assembly plant, has been recalled four times in the last year for safety defects.
Quality problems also have dogged Chrysler's L/H sedans and the recently introduced Neon subcompact. Nevertheless, the models have helped revive the No. 3 auto maker's fortunes and propelled the value of its common stock to a new peak.
Referring specifically to the Grand Cherokee, John Franciosi, the plant manager of the Chrysler Corporation's Jefferson North assembly plant, said the workers at the plant aren't to blame for the defects. Instead, engineering design glitches and defects in parts from suppliers caused the problem.
Mr. Franciosi said the Grand Cherokee's design was inherited from the American Motors Corporation when it was acquired in 1987 by Chrysler. Since then the auto maker has shifted to a different system of engineering development that is expected to produce higher-quality vehicles.
"There's no such thing as a defect free vehicle," said Mr. Franciosi. "One could say the gap between American and Japanese quality has narrowed to the point that it's statistically insignificant. That doesn't mean we've stopped trying."
Mr. Franciosi said Chrysler's internal surveys show the 1994 Grand Cherokee's quality has improved 27 percent over 1993 levels. J.D. Power & Associates, an automotive research firm that measures quality, declined to publicize the model's initial rating, which Chrysler said is "above the industry average."
In January, 1993 Chrysler recalled 700 Grand Cherokees for faulty break pedal clips. Last April it recalled 30,000 vehicles for possibly defective suspension bolts and, in the same month, 87,000 vehicles were recalled for potentially defective liftgate latches. Last month 115,000 vehicles were recalled for possible faulty steering columns.
The Grand Cherokee has proven to be quite popular as a station-wagon replacement for more affluent suburban families. Most workers at Jefferson North, who have been taking home $50,000 a year and more, say they like the vehicle, but say they can't afford to buy one, even with a company discount. The manufacturer's suggested retail price starts at $21,156 and can reach more than $30,000 with all options.

Redstone Stands Victorious on a Littered Battleground
Well, it's over -- the Super Bowl of corporate soap operas. After five months, the winning bidder for Paramount is . . . Viacom. The price: $9.7 billion in cash and stock. The loser: Barry Diller and his QVC Network Inc. (which, in grief or relief, quickly downsized itself to QVC Inc.). Standing alone amid the rubble is Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman. And rubble it is: Viacom stock fell so far during the fray that Mr. Redstone's stake fell by $3.1 billion, and the merged company will have $10 billion in debt -- a time bomb if interest rates rise. Shareholders of Blockbuster, which Viacom agreed to buy to help cover that debt, aren't too happy with Viacom's stock slide. And Martin Davis, Paramount chairman, got left by the wayside as the battle raged. So it's up to Mr. Redstone to make it work. And though there's been talk of spinning off properties like Simon & Schuster, he hopes to avoid selling anything. 

A Drizzle on Chrysler's Parade
American auto makers have been staging a rust-to-riches drama, mainly because they're just making better cars. In fact, Consumer Reports rated Chrysler's new sedans, the Intrepid et al., slightly above the Camry and Accord, the longtime stars -- the first time in 12 years Detroit has seized that medal. On its dash to glory, though, Chrysler has been plagued with recalls -- the Neon (twice), Dodge Ram and Grand Cherokee, all since December. And last week the gremlins struck again, as it recalled 110,000 sedans for an electrical problem. The glitches are all minor -- no injuries involved -- but their persistence is a sobering note at Chrysler's party.
 
Wang Dream House, for a Song
Rarely has there been a more vivid image of corporate humbling. In the 1980's, an age that recoiled at the mere mention of moderation, Wang Laboratories spent $50 million or so building a headquarters complex in Lowell, Mass. But times have changed: in 1988 Wang had sales of $3 billion and more than 30,000 workers; now it's fresh from bankruptcy, has downshifted from hardware to soft, and employs 6,000. The final blow: at a bankruptcy auction last week, the sprawling Lowell complex was sold for $525,000, about the price of a house in a fancy suburb.
 
Plug 'er In, Fill 'er Up
Electric cars are coming -- practical ones, that is. Why? For an age-old reason: Where there's a will there's a way. With a growing political will to clean the air, the way must be found. A big snag so far: Either charging takes too long, or, once charged, the cars don't go far enough. If one could be solved, the other would be downgraded to mere annoyance. A company called Solectria, using a method developed by Electronic Power Technology, has smashed the record for miles traveled by an electric vehicle in 24 hours. The charging time was cut to 20 minutes, enough to go 65 miles. One twist: If cars could build up a charge overnight, they'd draw power when demand is low; if they need daytime charges, utilities will find it tougher to meet demand.
 
What Next, Boardwalk at $800?
Life's just not fair. In Monopoly, if there's a bank error, you collect $200; if a real bank messes up, you pay. Chemical Bank made a whopper last week. Because of a tiny computer error, for nearly a day every A.T.M. withdrawal was counted twice, quickly draining $15 million out of accounts and drawing 4,000 complaints. (One wonders how many calls there would have been if the error had left customers ahead.) Chemical vows to take care of any fees or bounced checks, but customers surely had their faith in technology shaken. Now those trusting souls who toss bank statements might take a closer look.
 
Elvis Tilley? Get My Monocle!
For some, the fall of communism was small stuff -- the bark of a faraway seal. The true upheaval came when Tina Brown took over at The New Yorker 18 months ago, bringing -- depending on one's perspective -- either heretical tampering or a breath of fresh air. Emboldened by her success so far, Ms. Brown toppled a sacred image last week by bumping the monocled Eustace Tilley from the anniversary cover for the first time since 1925. In his place: Elvis Tilley, a squinting, pointy-nosed street punk with a marked resemblance to his grandfather. Yes, the seals are barking; yes, the republic still stands.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Saudis Give U.S. a Scratch
This was clearly President Clinton's message to Saudi Arabia: You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Or, put another way: You buy our planes, and if any neighbors bother you, we'll be there -- as we were in the Gulf war. His lobbying made impeccable sense to the Saudis, and last week they said they'd buy $6 billion worth of American commercial jets -- and buy none from Airbus, the European consortium. Figuring that each billion supports 20,000 jobs, that will mean 120,000 jobs at Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and other companies. And it means that Mr. Clinton -- who, with appropriate Olympic spirit, called the deal "a gold medal win" -- is not going to be shy about seeking business the world over for American companies.
 
Trade Tension With Japan
Things are getting nasty on the trade front. The Administration said last week that it would impose sanctions on Japan for not allowing Motorola into the Tokyo cellular phone market. Then it quickly started dropping threats about just how extensive its actions would be. And it didn't help much when, later in the week, the United States reported a record trade deficit with Japan for 1993. All this has left Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa scrambling to head off a trade war by coming up with some plan by this Saturday, when finance ministers of Group of Seven nations meet in Frankfurt.
 
Diamond Price-Fixing?
Even as the Administration puts a lot of energy into trade matters, the Justice Department is being aggressive in applying America's antitrust laws throughout the world. Last week a Federal grand jury indicted De Beers Centenary, General Electric and two European businessmen, saying they conspired to inflate prices for industrial diamonds -- one of the biggest cases ever to charge such an international antitrust violation. Industrial diamonds, mainly produced synthetically and used for saws and drills, constitute a half-billion-dollar-a-year industry.
 
January: Not the Time to Build
In an age obsessed with the lean and the mean, with solemn, high-energy executives talking on the phone even as they walk down the street, it's nice to be reminded periodically that, in the end, nature is in charge. Even a high-flying economy had to slow down a bit on January's ice and quivering freeways. The latest evidence: Last week's report that housing starts plunged 17.6 percent in January. No one was really worried, though: the figures are seasonally adjusted, but not enough for this nasty season. In any case, as one economist said, the economy may just be "taking a breather" after a strong fourth quarter.
 
More Trouble for Hoffenberg
Remember Steven Hoffenberg? He had a cameo role in The New York Post Follies a year ago, charging in with his checkbook, vowing to save the paper. It turned out the checkbook was not what it seemed, though, as the S.E.C. filed fraud charges against him and his company, Towers Financial. He passed it off as an accounting dispute, but last week the Government said there was an awful lot more to that iceberg, charging that Mr. Hoffenberg had defrauded investors of $450 million over the years in a gigantic Ponzi scheme. Since the Post debacle, though -- even with Towers in bankruptcy since March -- Mr. Hoffenberg keeps starting businesses, in one case advertising for investors in something called Haley Capital. Any takers?
 
Homelessness Redefined
This is the way the Republicans viewed homelessness in the years they ran things: 600,000 Americans homeless on a given night, mainly plagued by drugs, drink or mental illness. A draft report from this Administration puts it a bit differently: a problem "far larger than commonly thought," with poverty, racism and budget cuts shoving many out the door. The report calls for more spending on housing and mental health. And the plan raises a touchy point on housing -- that even as there's talk of cutting housing aid for the poor, housing aid for the middle class (i.e., deductible mortgage interest) stood at a huge $41 billion last year.
 
Inflation Behind Every Tree
The markets keep being spooked by inflation -- even though, officially, there really isn't any. Consumer prices didn't budge in January, the Government said on Thursday, putting the index just 2.5 percent ahead in 12 months. But the markets were so nervous they quickly latched onto a Philadelphia Fed survey showing that inflation may indeed be around the corner. Stock and bond prices fell, and kept falling on Friday, with the Dow industrials ending the week at 3,887.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Individuals Are Buying, but Not Like Old Times

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
BUY on weakness.
Since the rebound from the 1987 crash made bears look foolish, that has been the slogan of your average individual investor. When the Dow cracked under the weight of bad news or institutional selling, it was Ma and Pa who rushed in to buy.
But this time, it's different. In the wake of the Dow's 96-point plunge on Feb. 4, individual investors seem to have been much less eager to buy. To be sure, there has been no big selling blitz. But they are buying a lot less. 
 Dick McCabe, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, reports that Merrill's retail customers sold more on Feb. 4 than they had in previous plunges, and bought less in the period that followed. And figures compiled by AMG Data Services show that while investors are still putting cash into stock funds, the flow is less than it had been. Those facts help to explain why the widely anticipated bounce back has not occurred.
In fact, the last couple of weeks have been remarkable for the negative attitudes being shown by many professional investors. Take the options markets. There are individual speculators, but more and more of the business is done by institutions, some of which are speculating and some hedging. The volume of put trading in the last couple of weeks has been extraordinary. There are a number of ways to measure that, but both Richard Eakle of Eakle Associates, a money management firm in Fair Haven, N.J., and Don Fishback, who publishes newsletters on options in Cincinnati, point to indicators showing put activity has never been higher.
That may be important because, at extremes, option activity is a good contrary indicator. "It is a measure of sentiment among the crowd that is usually wrong," Mr. Fishback says.
Take the five previous bad days since 1990. In four of them, the Dow recovered completely within the next 10 trading days. The only exception was the plunge in November of 1991, when the Dow lost nearly 4 percent in one day. Then it took six weeks to recover, and the first couple of weeks saw substantial institutional selling, notes Jeff Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn. Institutions have also been significant sellers this time.
It is not hard to understand why investors are nervous now. A hostile Federal Reserve is, in the end, almost always bad news for the stock market. Those who remember 1987's rebound also recall that the crash was proceeded by months of Fed tightening.
But history shows that stocks often rise in the early months after the Fed first tightens, even as bonds prices fall. Money that might have gone into bonds instead chases stock prices higher. In time, after stock prices have risen significantly, confidence develops that this time, higher interest rates are not a big problem. Then they become one. The chances now are for at least one more good rally, before the real bear market arrives.

HEADLINE: At Work;
The Morning After for Health Care

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
A FRISSON has been traveling up and down the collective spine of the public policy community for the past year, innervated by the prospect of genuine, planned and, yes, rational reform of the nation's health care delivery system. One person's frisson is, of course, another's paralysis. The wizards of compensation and benefits at companies around the country have not been happy for several months, their designs and complications on hold while the Clinton health care task force toiled and spun out a plan -- a plan that might well make moot years of their own work.
Fortunes have flipped since the first of the year, and the wizards are waking as it becomes increasingly clear that whatever reform turns out to be, it will be built on what's already in place and be achieved in the style to which the Beltway is accustomed. Key provisions, like providing health care payments for early retirees and creating risk-pool alliances, seem to be headed already for extinction or reconstructive surgery. 
 And anyone who was worried that the debate over health care in Washington would actually be about health care or about national priorities or even about trying to match market forces to the market-taunting art of healing can return to a state of calm. For many beyond the Beltway, a heavy straw settled on the camel's back two weeks ago when the mainly Republican opposition tried to reframe a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Clinton plan into another mind-numbing debate about the deficit. By all accounts, Robert Reischauer, the C.B.O. chief, outsuaved those who would obsess about incomprehensible sums of money.
"No one in this country has been able to predict medical cost changes within any reasonable range of error," said Bruce Kelley, a principal at William M. Mercer Inc., the benefits consultants. Mr. Kelley is following the debate from his far-beyond-the-Beltway base of Minneapolis. "I'd call that a heads-up estimate."
Exasperation and relief were evident in conversations with several benefits consultants in the last week. Mr. Kelley indicated the companies he works with are definitely emerging from a funk. "We are coming out of a period where employers have been asking about how they are going to be impacted. Is it good or bad for them?" He added: "They are moving back into a mode of having to make some decision to move forward."
Henry Saveth, a principal at Foster Higgins in New York, another large benefits consultant, said his clients are beginning to realize just how long it will take to put any changes into place. "The 300-pound gorilla which was health care reform is now viewed as substantially slimmed down," he said, adding, "The first thing we saw was that the effective date would slip. Second, there's the emergence of a perception that the inner glue of the Clinton plan is coming undone, so there will not only be a delay, but whatever comes down the pike that is new will be much less than had been feared."
Employers were very nervous about taking what Mr. Saveth described as a "vertical plunge" into Government regulation. "Most employers think there are a number of useful changes that could be made, but done on a building-block basis, not as a big bang."
That reaction points up the limitations of the "convergence of interest" strategy among groups willing to employ similar means to achieve dissimilar ends -- and a plan that, like its instigator, tries to be all things to all people. The Clinton Administration health care reform constituency is a diverse group with several goals, but many in the group rank universal health coverage and reforming the insurance system considerably higher than buffing the bottom line. Mr. Kelley's clients' interests are elsewhere. "Their focus is on continuous quality improvement," he said. "That is in the Clinton proposal, but Clinton wants to use reform for cost control and for equity." His companies don't oppose that, Mr. Kelley said, "but it's not their motivation and it's not a high priority." What employees really want, Mr. Saveth said, is control over their programs and their destinies, and it looks like they will get -- or, rather, keep -- it.
EMPLOYERS are getting what they want but will employees? Mr. Reischauer indicated in his comments to Congress that reform could balance the interests of the two groups. "Changes in businesses' costs, both positive and negative, would be largely shifted back onto workers in the form of lower or higher wages," he told the Senate Finance Committee on Feb. 9.
That savings will be passed on tends to be a faith held more by economists than by employees, but the consultants said competition for good workers, even in a layoff environment, does indeed keep galloping capitalism in check. When medical pricing is down, compensation is more liberal. When it is up, wages flatten. A drop in medical costs has a faster impact on paychecks than it will on the national budget. "Employers tend to react in two- to three-year cycles with their benefit-pricing strategies," Mr. Kelley said. "If we really saw a reduction in costs, we would see employers being more liberal on the compensation side."
 
 
 
ONE COMPANY TAKES THE PLUNGE
AT the corporate headquarters of Snelling & Snelling Inc., the employment services franchiser, senior management did not wait to see which way the wind was blowing on health care reform before instituting changes meant to drive down the cost of health benefits for some 300 employees. As of the first of the year, Snelling switched its corporate employees in Dallas, California and Hawaii from a trust-financed traditional major medical plan to a program that allows them to choose either a health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization.
According to Claudia Hunt, the company's human resources vice president, the new plan will save Snelling $200,000 this year and reduce the amount employees have to contribute. And why did Snelling proceed, given the uncertainty last fall when the company was first planning the change? As far as Snelling was concerned, the handwriting was on the wall, no matter how loud the static from Washington. The push toward managed care and HMO-type organizations is irresistible, whether it comes from benefits consultants or Mr. Clinton. "We figured with what we knew about Clinton's program, this would help our employees get into that mode," Ms. Hunt said.

Readers' Mail: A Question of Risk

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Question: In one of your columns, you wrote that "risk is a matter of personal choice." That suggests a subjective personality quirk called "risk aversion," while I think risk tolerance is more a matter of when the investment is to be liquidated.
Answer: You're partly correct. Your investment horizon is one important element of risk. Stocks are normally preferred investments over time because they are the only effective inflation hedge. In the short run, though, equities are much riskier. 
 How short? For investments of less than five years, don't buy stocks, says Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. By contrast, Sheldon Jacobs, who edits The No-Load Fund Investor, in Irvington, N.Y., would put up to a third of a short-term portfolio into conservative stock funds like balanced or equity-income funds.
What you've overlooked is interim volatility. For example, Phoenix Growth and Founders Growth Funds have nearly identical 10-year returns, 14.6 percent and 14.5 percent a year, on average. But they traveled very different roads to get there. Phoenix had no losses, while Founders had double-digit losses in two years. Perhaps because it's harder for investors to hold on, Founders has only one-sixteenth the assets of Phoenix, although the two funds were close in size in 1980. The moral: People who lack the discipline to sit tight in tough times are better off with steadier funds.
Q: The mutual fund tables use the footnote "d" to denote both contingent deferred sales charges and redemption fees. In view of the quantum difference between the two types of fees, is that appropriate?
A: While they are constructed differently, both are used to encourage shareowners to hold shares, not cash them in quickly. Contingent deferred sales charges typically start as 4 percent to 6 percent of the amount invested, declining one percentage point a year until they disappear. Any deferred sales charges are paid to the fund sponsor.
By contrast, redemption fees usually run from 0.5 percent to 2 percent of the amount invested and apply to shares held from 60 days up to two years or so. Because they are intended to compensate long-term shareholders for the transaction costs incurred by short-term traders, redemption fees become part of the funds' assets. Many funds limit investors' trades in other ways; only 134 funds charge redemption fees.
The New York Times uses the same footnote for both types of fees to simplify the tables. The "d" alerts you that you may owe a fee when you sell; it's up to you to find out from the fund's prospectus which fees apply.
Q: I am interested in learning more about funds that invest in shares of other funds.
A: The nearly two dozen "funds of funds" are packaged in two ways. First is a package of funds run by one company. For example, the Vanguard Star Fund owns shares in nine Vanguard stock, bond and money market funds, with equities making up 63 percent of the portfolio. Star charges annual expenses of 0.37 percent of assets, the total of fees levied by the underlying funds. T. Rowe Price's version, now three years old, is broken down by investment objective. Price Spectrum Growth invests in six of its stock funds; Spectrum Income owns shares in five of its bond funds, plus an equity-income fund.
These funds are good choices for investors who want to diversify yet own only one fund, especially in a 401(k) or another retirement plan, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. They are less useful for people who prefer to mix and match.
Mr. Rekenthaler is less enthusiastic about the second type of funds of funds. These levy a fee on top of fees charged by the underlying funds. Two examples are API and Fundtrust, each of which offers five funds in its series. The Fundtrust Growth Fund, for example, owns shares in AIM Charter, Putnam Vista and Phoenix Capital Appreciation, among others, and charges a 1.6 percent annual fee, plus a 1.5 percent upfront sales load. The fund lagged behind all growth funds by 2.63 percentage points a year, on average, for the five years ended January, according to Morningstar.
Indeed, all but one of the 16 funds of funds with five-year records tracked by Morningstar showed a lag. The exception, Flex-Funds Muirfield, gained 12 percent a year, on average, compared with 11.3 percent for all asset-allocation funds; Vanguard Star lagged behind all balanced funds by only 0.61 percent.
Q: Some funds reserve the right to redeem shares with stocks, but in a free-falling market, stocks are the last thing I would want. How exactly does this work, and how common is it?
A: The Securities and Exchange Commission does not keep track of how many funds can redeem shares with securities. A spokesman says many funds limit payment-in-kind redemptions to accounts worth more than $250,000. For example, all of T. Rowe Price's 50-plus funds can redeem shares with securities in accounts worth more than $250,000, or 1 percent of the fund's assets, whichever is less; Dreyfus's strategy is similar. But Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, imposes no such limits in its 200-plus funds. While it's certainly possible, the practice has been exceedingly uncommon. For information, call your fund company.

HEADLINE: Institutional Investments That Grow With Trees

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: WAKEFIELD, Va.

 BODY:
IN a scene reminiscent of the movie "Jurassic Park," a customized bulldozer called a "sawhead feller" moves into the forest here like a mechanized dinosaur. It grabs a 70-foot pine tree with its steel teeth and, shaking the tree like a little flower, causes it to come thundering to the ground. The machine then rolls on to take down another tree, and then another.
This is modern forestry courtesy of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, which is busily matching institutional investors and trees to create one of the hottest corners of investing today: timberland. As traditional owners of forests sell off their lands and as the Government gets out of the tree-cutting business, big pension funds are rushing in and earning returns that have far outpaced stocks, bonds and real estate for several years now. 
 Trees have always been fundamental to the nation's economy. In fact, forest products are the country's fifth-largest business segment and represent a full 6 percent of the gross domestic product. By meshing modern financial theory with advanced forestry techniques, pension funds have been able to reap annual returns in the 20 percent to 30 percent range by putting money into trees and watching it grow.
"Trees have been wonderful for us," said John Carroll, president of the GTE Investment Management Corporation, which owns $260 million in timberland managed by Hancock. "It's been our most successful real estate investment. Besides, it's always nicer to own something real than a piece of paper. With timber, you can see it, kick it, feel it or even hug your investment."
The pension funds aren't actually out there buying up trees and chopping them down. Their investments are funneled through a middle man -- Hancock's Timber Resource Group is by far the largest of a small group of intermediaries that have set up forestry investment funds and separate accounts for pension funds. Hancock takes actual title to the forest land, manages it for a fee and passes the economic benefits to the investor -- a structure not unlike other real estate funds. Others in this business include the Wachovia Bank of Winston-Salem, N.C.; Resource Investments of West Lebanon, N.H.; Prudential Timber Investments of Boston, and Forest Investment Associates of Atlanta.
Investors in timberland make their money in three ways: Through timber sales, by selling off small parcels of land to others and through the increase in the value of the land holdings. As real estate investments in general have provided flat to negative returns of late, timber investments have been shown to be effective inflation hedges -- as the economy improves, so does the demand for wood and paper. Most of the timber sold ultimately makes its way into housing and industrial uses or is turned into paper and pulp.
"For most people, it's hard to relate to trees as money makers," said Richard N. Smith, head of Hancock's Boston-based timber management team, as he walked through the forest here, about 50 miles southwest of Norfolk. "It's almost as though it's too obvious or too simple." A forester by training, Mr. Smith started the Hancock effort in 1984 after coming up with the notion that the long-term investment objectives of pension funds could match the long-term demands of sound forestry, which is to manage timberlands so they remain productive for decades, rather than clear-cutting for immediate profit.
Since then, Hancock has grown to manage about $2 billion of the $3 billion of timberland owned by institutional investors -- all of whom have been praised by environmental groups as sensitive stewards of the land. Hancock's holdings represent 1.8 million acres of forests, primarily in the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest. While a growing force, institutional owners still pale in size compared with small private owners, who lay claim to about 60 percent of the 500 million commercial timber acres in the United States, and the Government, which owns about 26 percent of the commercial forests.
"Pension funds, with their long-term liabilities and their objective of capital appreciation, can be a source of capital consistent with this resource and better owners of the land than many others," Mr. Smith said. After pitching the idea to many skeptical institutions, Mr. Smith and Hancock now have a list of investors that includes the California State Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, and public pensions in Ohio, Colorado, Detroit and Dallas as well as corporate funds like GTE and A.T.& T. So far, timberland is strictly an institutional investment, but Mr. Smith expects that timber mutual funds for the individual retail customer might pop up in several years.
Recent developments have taken Mr. Smith's idea and pushed it to double-digit return levels. Public pressure in the late 1980's, culminating with the 1991 decision to preserve the northern spotted owl's Pacific Northwest habitat, has caused the Government to protect old-growth forests and halt most Federal timber sales. This has cut the supply of all Western timber by 20 to 30 percent -- which, in turn, has pushed up timber market prices over all. And it is the intention of the Clinton Administration to reduce Federal harvesting even further.
Moreover, the restructuring of forest products companies, which had undergone leveraged buyouts in the 1980's, has put many more acres of timberland onto the market for sale to institutions. Prominent companies like St. Regis Paper, Diamond International, Crown Zellerbach and Pacific Lumber went private through takeovers and buyouts in the last decade. Since then, many have decided to focus more on making paper and wood products and use their forest lands instead as a source of capital that can be sold to pay down debt, especially now that rising wood prices have increased the value of their properties.
"There's been a supply shock that has brought a substantial increase in timber prices," said Courtland L. Washburn, a Hancock forest economist. "And in the last 10 years, a lot of forest products companies have decided to concentrate more on the processing of wood and let folks like us concentrate on growing trees for them."
Most institutions classify timber as part of their real estate or natural resource portfolio. But timber has some strikingly different characteristics from other assets. For starters, a timber portfolio literally grows every day, unlike such resources as coal or gas, which remain the same size, or even, for that matter, commercial buildings. In addition, when timber prices are soft, the trees -- unlike other agricultural products like tomatoes or corn -- can simply remain in the ground, and wait for a market upturn.
"If you have an office building that sits vacant, you've lost that rent forever," said John Imboden, director of real estate assets for the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, which has a $100 million investment. "If you don't harvest the trees, you don't lose that value. The tree still grows."
BUT the key to timber returns comes in the management of the trees. And how institutional investors handle that is entirely different from the Government or other private investors -- which makes it more lucrative for them and is why environmentalists favor them. Owning timberland isn't just a matter of planting trees and cutting them down. Hancock employs econometric models to determine future timber demands and wood and paper prices and then decides from that what types of trees to plant, when to harvest them and how to manage that growth.
"Our biggest risk isn't what happens to the trees," said Mr. Smith of Hancock. "It's what happens to the economy."
Right now, Hancock economists are predicting rising prices in the next three to four years as the economy grows and the supply of commercial timber shrinks. But should the economy falter and supplies stabilize, returns could soften. Even Hancock acknowledges that today's returns are high and predicts that returns will settle over time at a 9 to 15 percent annual rate.
By meshing biology and finance, institutional owners try to determine the economically peak time to cut their trees. If a tree is cut before its time, money is forgone; if it grows too much, it runs the risk of becoming infested or damaged and less valuable. Here, where soaring pines form a canopy under the sky, Hancock foresters practice selective cutting: thinning away small, scrawny trees, which allows for more nutrients to reach the healthier trees so they grow bigger and stronger -- and fetch more money. There is virtually none of the clear-cutting that has scarred so much of the West and degraded the landscape. Genetic altering -- or the practice of mixing the seeds of the best-looking trees -- is used to produce better and more marketable trees. What is more, Hancock employs modern equipment, like the sawhead feller, which shields workers in a metal cab from the danger of falling trees and limbs.
"Institutional owners manage the forests better than anyone else," said John Turner, president of the Conservation Fund, a nonprofit group in Arlington, Va., and the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Bush Administration. "They are much more careful in their cutting practices. They invest in good biology. Their people are better trained. They are better at dealing with endangered species. They know the dynamics of the forest, when to plant and when to cut."
This differs from many wood and paper products companies, which viewed their forests simply as a source of raw material to keep their mills running, and from private owners, who cut trees when they needed money and had fewer resources to invest in forest maintenance. In Virginia, Hancock avoids harvesting near streams, knowing that maintaining water quality is important to the future of their forests. It protects the habitat of the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species, by maintaining vegetation needed for it to thrive. And it provides the necessary controlled fires to maintain a rare type of flora that has forest fires as part of its ecosystem.
Fire is the biggest physical threat to these investments and to protect against destruction, Hancock and other forest managers spread out the investors' parcels so they are not all in one spot. As a result, if a forest fire breaks out, it destroys a small number of trees owned by many, not all the trees of one investor. Such geographic diversification also protects investors' trees from localized insect infestations.
Besides maintaining forests so they will produce for decades, such sound forest practices also help attract pension funds, which are sensitive about their public images.
"We are careful in that we want our forest management to be good for the environment," said Roger C. Franz, an investment officer at Calpers, which has seen its $488 million timberland investment in 1988 grow to $832 million today. The same holds true in the corporate pension world. "We think we are adding value to the world," Thomas Judge, a vice president at the A.T.& T. Investment Management Corporation, said of his company's $100 million timber investment.
BESIDES, say investment managers, after hours of looking at complicated prospectuses and holding mind-numbing conversations with investment bankers, spending time learning about the economics of trees and talking to people in flannel shirts instead of suits is a refreshing change.
"The people who call on us are not the financial types," said Terry Denzer, director of investments at the Hoechst Celanese Corporation, which has $5 million in timber investments. "They are usually tree experts with master's or Ph.D.'s in forestry. We learn all about trees, and it's fascinating. It's almost as though the returns are the icing on the cake."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
A 'Freshened' Jaguar Adds V12 Power

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon 

 BODY:
ALL right, enough about snow and ice and antilock brakes and skids and winter. Let's talk about something less mundane. Let's think sun and clear roads and let's talk Jaguars.
True, there is a certain silliness in it all. The basic car costs $51,750, and if you think that is expensive then you may think the rest of the line exorbitant. Also true, the car is English and has spent years honing a reputation for frequent vacations at the repair shop. But there is a mystique that is equally well earned. 
 Jags have loyal (nay, fanatical) fans, and the cars' sleek and luxurious personas, along with behavior that is quick and taut, have made them icons in the luxury field.
That is the reason Ford paid $2.5 billion for the Coventry company in 1989. At the time, many in the industry thought the price was too high, even for a name that conjures so much reverence. Since then, too, Ford has poured more money into Jaguar in an effort to expunge the persnickety, while keeping the nice.
But sales have grown, albeit slowly in an industry that is still struggling to put recession behind it. Overall, sales were up 22 percent last year, and they rose 47 percent in the United States. New York, California and Florida accounted for much of the increase, continuing a trend that has made this country Jaguar's biggest market.
For 1994, the key word is "freshening," although some of the changes -- like a standard passenger air bag -- are welcome and overdue. Basically, there are three sedans and four versions of the XJS coupe and convertible, with the big differences being in trim and engines. Two powerplants are now available, a 4-liter six and a 6-liter V12. A five-speed manual transmission also can be had in the 4-liter XJS, but the sedans and the V12 sports cars send their power to the road through a four-speed automatic.
Prices for the XJS sports models range from $51,950 for the 4-liter coupe to $79,950 for the 6-liter convertible, and all convertibles now offer rear seating. But the big news is the return of the old V12, which made its first appearance in 1972 and which has been missing for a couple of years after its discontinuance in 1992.
Displacement has been increased from 5.3 liters by lengthing the pistons' stroke, but there are other refinements, too, and the current engine -- originally developed for 1993's limited edition XJR-S high-performance models -- now produces 278 horsepower in the XJS. Only 100 XJR-S's came to these shores, 50 of them coupes and the rest convertibles.
The V12, sorely lacking in the sedans for 15 years, also is back in the XJ12, which is the flagship four-door, and power for the heavier sedan has been increased to 301 horses. The in-line six is rated at 219 horsepower in the XJS and 223 in the XJ6 and in its fancier brother, the mid-level Vanden Plas sedan.
The test car was a bronze Vanden Plas, whose name honors a noted Belgian coach-building firm that was acquired by Jaguar in 1968. And while the talk of specifications may mean a lot to Jaguar buffs, the numbers count for little when you are in a car as smooth as this.
Actually, the sedan's body goes back to 1987, when it was thoroughly revamped. And it will be redone again for '95, with the new car -- code named X300 -- appearing next October.
For now, though, the sedan has been gussied up with new body moldings and new wheels, and its lines retain the pleasant swoop that car-watchers have long admired. The XJS has new cast-alloy wheels as well, but it also has new bumpers, an air dam on the front and a rear-deck spoiler.
While the sedan's exterior has had minimal changes, the interior benefits from the addition of the passenger air bag and a new front-passenger seat bolster for more protection in a crash. Unfortunately, though, the new air bag means no more glovebox, and the remote trunk release has had to be moved to the center console.
The car also now has an electrochomic mirror, which darkens automatically when high beams hit it from the rear, and there is standard wiring for a cellular phone. Foldaway cupholders have been added to the forward section of the console, and the seats have been redesigned.
In the tester, they were covered in cream-colored leather and were thoroughly comfortable -- although the power adjustments leave something to be desired. The buttons are mounted on the vertical sides of the inner footwells, and they are difficult to see and to manipulate. Headroom, too, might be improved, and a medium-tall occupant (my 6-foot-3-inch son) complained that his sandy hair was brushing the roof.
For '94, the company has tried to help driver ergonomics by moving the column stalks upward, but some of the controls -- notably those for cruise control and lights -- look like afterthoughts. A small keypad for the driver information center is located to the right of the steering column, and it too could be handier and better integrated.
Future Jags may not suffer these complaints, minor though they are. According to the company, a new computer technology called "Knowledge Based Engineering" has resulted in a major reduction in the time needed to change things -- as well as warning the designers about possible problems.
Resembling the animated characters in a video game, occupants are simulated and they provide instant feedback on interior design. For example, the "driver" comments on whether instruments are obscured from view or how well switches can be reached. If it's raining, the "computer people" describe visibility of the road ahead, and they tell the engineers about the ease or difficulty of opening the hood or loading the trunk.
The system uses a database that comprises real-world studies, technical manuals, legislation, the input of experienced designers, geometric relationships and structural, material and manufacturing requirements.
As for the speed of the application, Jaguar engineers recently cut the time it takes to design the basic structure of the inner panels of a hood from eight weeks to just one day. And quicker also meant better. Stiffness of the hood was doubled, without an increase in weight.
That bodes well for years hence, and there is an inkling of a small and front-wheel-drive Jag that would appeal to the masses. But for now, we have rear-drive tradition and lovely luxury. And if there is silliness in it, it is the silliness of love.

HEADLINE: On Reducing Employee Commuting

 BODY:
Re: "New Rules Nudging Companies to Reduce Employee Commuting," Jan. 16:
The Department of Transportation tells us that the High Occupancy Vehicle (H.O.V.) lanes that are opening in March will reduce traffic congestion. They hope to entice people into car pools by giving them a special lane in rush hours, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. I have my doubts. 
One problem is that the H.O.V. lanes are on the far inside, away from the exits. We will have cars missing their exits or making wild dives through heavy traffic to get off. The alternative is to get over well in advance, lessening the advantage of having the H.O.V. lane.
A worse problem will occur in the unlikely event of a car pool's obeying the 55 m.p.h. speed limit. Should this occur, there will quickly be 20 or more vehicles backed up behind the slowpoke. What are they going to do? If they just putt along in line, they lose the advantage of driving in the H.O.V. lane.
Instead, they will pass on the right, going into the next lane, which is going faster. This is extremely dangerous and will slow down the other lane too. One driver going 55 in the right lane snarls traffic badly enough. If you have one in the H.O.V. lane as well, it will choke the traffic flow from two sides. Traffic congestion might even get worse.
A better solution would be to raise the capacity of the highway by raising the speed limit. If cars go faster, there are fewer cars on the road. Slow drivers going 65 will impede traffic less than those going 55. Traffic flow, fuel economy and safety will improve. We've had 20 years to see that the 55 m.p.h. speed limit doesn't work. Let's get rid of it now.

HEADLINE: The World;
Myths Aside, Japanese Do Look for Bargains

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AS the first-ever shipment of California rice was going on sale in Tokyo this month, 50 people lined up outside a Seiyu supermarket here before the doors opened. The entire load of 5,500 pounds, which would normally take three days to sell, was gone in two and a half hours.
Maybe it was just curiosity. Maybe it was the price -- half that of high-grade Japanese rice. Maybe it was the shortage of domestic rice, which is why the foreign stuff is being allowed in. In any event, it was the shattering of another myth about Japanese consumers. Who said they would never eat foreign rice? 
 With the United States and Japan on the brink of a trade war, on whose side are the Japanese consumers? Are they clamoring for imported products, which would make them a natural ally of the United States? Or do they have a predisposition to buy Japanese, representing just another hard-to-penetrate layer of Japan Inc.?
The United States, in this and previous trade battles, has portrayed itself as the champion of Japan's downtrodden consumers, who would see greater variety and lower prices if only imports could surmount various trade barriers. Japan tends to argue that the market is open and that if foreign products don't sell well, it is because vendors are not doing enough to meet the exacting standards of Japanese consumers.
 
Fear of Rice
 Perhaps the Japanese have a point. In some ways Japanese consumers do differ from Americans. But there is also evidence to support President Clinton's assumption that the Japanese consumer can be courted; for one thing, recession has made for more price-conscious comparative shoppers.
True, Japanese consumers have not poured out in support of recent American demands for greater access to Japan's automobile, telecommunications or insurance markets. But that is because an organized consumer movement barely exists here, and the consumer groups that do exist often seem closely aligned with certain businesses.
Many consumer groups opposed the opening of Japan's rice market with the argument that foreign rice would be tainted by chemicals. A few years ago, such groups also joined with small shopkeepers to oppose easing restrictions on large stores like Toys R Us, even though they usually offer lower prices.
But if consumers don't speak with their voices, they do with their wallets. And many foreign products, from Levi's jeans to Australian beef and French skis, are being snapped up. Take the Big Mac. McDonald's is the largest restaurant chain in Japan. Or the Macintosh. Last year Apple Computer's sales in Japan grew 75 percent, making it the second largest vendor of personal computers behind NEC, the Japanese giant.
"There's never been any evidence that consumers rejected a product because it is foreign," said George Fields, who has been a market researcher here for 27 years. If there is any reason for the failure of more products to sell here, he said, it is that the distribution system can block foreign products or raise their prices excessively. Indeed, others say, being foreign, especially for luxury products, is a plus. Foreign products are becoming even more acceptable because of the rise of the yen, which makes imports cheaper. The latest issue of Nikkei Trendy, a magazine about consumer life styles, features a cover story on the rush of imports under the theme "Beat the Japanese market."
The recession is also helping shatter other myths about Japanese consumers. A few years ago it was the gospel that Japanese consumers cared only about quality and service, not price. Lowering a price often made the product less attractive. But consumers now are shunning high-priced department stores, with their legions of obsequious sales clerks, in favor of discount stores. Mail order is also on the rise.
Still, Japanese consumers are far from identical to American or European consumers, particularly in their emphasis on quality. It's not enough here for a product to work. It must be perfect down to the paint job and elaborate packaging. This is a country, after all, in which farmers hang weights on budding cucumbers so that they will grow straight instead of curved.
Apple quickly learned that what was acceptable in the United States wouldn't pass muster here. "We had complaints from resellers because the manuals were upside down in the box," recalled Ian Diery, executive vice president. Jiro Yanase, whose company is the Japanese distributor of General Motors cars, likes to recall the time, about a decade ago, when he invited the head of quality control at General Motors to the pier in Yokohama, where Mr. Yanase had lined up 20 G.M. cars fresh off the boat and 20 of his customers. All the customers said they wouldn't buy any of the cars, generally because the paint was slightly scratched.
Another big difference between Japan and the United States is in how to advertise. The American approach -- talking directly about a product and showing how much better it is than Brand X -- would not be considered sporting here. "The basic characteristic of the Japanese is to try to be harmonious and avoid confrontation," said Hidekazu Aizawa, a manager at Dentsu Inc., Japan's largest advertising agency. "You do not like to show off clearly that you have an advantage."
Television commercials in particular are indirect. They aim to convey an image or a feeling, or to capture attention with humor or a poignant story. Then, at the end, the product is mentioned, followed by the company logo and perhaps a slogan. English slogans, even if a bit odd, are often used. A while back, when Coca-Cola was describing itself as "the real thing" in most of the world, its slogan in Japan was "I feel Coke."
But some American companies are having success breaking the taboo. A couple of years ago, General Motors ran advertisements that compared its cars with Japanese ones in an effort to dispel the notion that American cars are too large, too expensive and too wasteful of fuel. Pepsi has taken on Coke and Compaq Computer Corporation has compared its computers with those of NEC.
Now, even some Japanese businesses like long distance phone companies are comparing themselves to Japanese competitors, while some retailers blare low prices on TV. "The Japanese are gradually changing," said Mr. Aizawa. "Consumers' eyes are becoming more strict."

Mutual Need Ties Dictator And Dissident In Myanmar

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar

 BODY:
DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI, the world's most famous political prisoner, has met her jailer only once. It was in January 1989, and the setting was the airy colonial-era villa at 56 University Avenue in northern Yangon, the family home of the Burmese opposition leader.
Her mother had died, and Lieut. General Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of military intelligence, had come to pay his respects on the eve of the Buddhist funeral procession, a event scented with jasmine and joss sticks that would see thousands of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's followers line the streets to mourn her famous mother, the widow of Myanmar's independence hero, Aung San. By all accounts, the meeting was cordial. 
 It was only six months later that this same house became Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's prison, the detention order approved by the same general. And the question on which the political future of their 43 million countrymen may now hang is whether Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the defiant Nobel Peace laureate, and General Khin Nyunt, the cunning strongman, will meet again.
"I think the future of Burma will be determined by two people -- Khin Nyunt and Aung San Suu Kyi," said Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who last week became the dissident's first non-family visitor since 1989. "What is critically important is for these two individuals to get to know each other."
To a degree that neither is now likely to admit, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and General Khin Nyunt have come to need the other's help. Diplomats say she needs the general if she is ever to resurrect the shattered Burmese democracy movement and to win her own freedom, and the general needs her help if Myanmar is to end decades of economic stagnation and political isolation.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi (pronounced awng sahn sue chee, with each syllable equally stressed) called for talks with the military even before she was placed under house arrest. She repeated that call last week. "I don't see any problem with sitting down with anybody," she said.
So the next move belongs to General Khin Nyunt. In recent years he has been described by foreign diplomats and scholars as the new strongman of Myanmar, the nation still better known by its colonial name, Burma.
By turns ruthless and pragmatic, General Khin Nyunt almost certainly made the final decision to allow Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to break her silence last week, a calculated risk intended to blunt international criticism of the junta that has run Myanmar since 1988, when the army killed thousands of her supporters as it crushed democracy demonstrations in Yangon and elsewhere.
General Khin Nyunt is in his mid-50's and is a protege of Myanmar's former strongman, General Ne Win. But he does not appear to share his mentor's penchant for the erratic and the irrational.
During a quarter-century of absolute power, General Ne Win took his policy advice from astrologers and numerologists -- Myanmar currency comes in denominations of 45 and 90 because Ne Win, like many Burmese, thinks 9 and its multiples are lucky -- while General Khin Nyunt is said to prefer the less-mystical counsel of economists.
General Ne Win was willing to turn Myanmar into a pauper nation under inept and xenophobic policies known as the "Burmese Way to Socialism." Diplomats say his protege seems to understand that unless something is done about Myanmar's economic misery, the result could be new public protests, perhaps even a revolution. Despite recent market reforms, Myanmar remains one of the world's poorest nations, with severe malnutrition and some of the highest infant mortality rates in Asia.
The general has still not said whether he will enter into talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. "It's a tricky decision for him," said a Western diplomat in Yangon. "If he accepts the offer, the international community and foreign investors will obviously applaud the move. But it would also mean admitting that Aung San Suu Kyi is the legitimate leader of a legitimate movement."
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is just that. Her political party won a landslide victory in 1990 elections, despite her detention. The military disregarded the results, imprisoned many of the party's leaders and launched a smear campaign against her. The junta said that in her years away from Myanmar -- she was educated at Oxford and married a British academic -- she had forfeited any claim to a political role in her homeland.
If the leaders of the junta had hoped to break Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's spirit by isolating her for years in the now-dilapidated family compound, they must have been sorely disappointed by what she had to say last week.
"I don't care if they deprive me of all of my privileges," she said. "They should not think that by making my personal conditions easier for me that this would in any way induce me to give up my convictions."
Still, to judge from her silences, there seems to be room for compromise. She was notably mute, for instance, about her neighbor across Inya Lake, General Ne Win, who is now in his early 80's and ailing but is said to retain veto power over the junta's decisions.
It has long been suspected by some of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's followers that it was her personal attacks on General Ne Win in interviews in June 1989 that led to her house arrest the following month. At least on the subject of the old general, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi may have decided to it is best for now to hold her tongue.

It's Back! The Idea That Senators Hate to Love

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Amending the Constitution used to rank with going to war as an occasion for congressional solemnity. But in the next few weeks Congress may vote to require itself to balance the Federal budget -- a sort of "stop me before I spend again" injunction -- with less gravity, and less public attention than when it debates a crime bill or considers tinkering with campaign finance laws.
Last week, Democratic Senators Paul Simon of Illinois and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the proposal's leading advocate and its signal enemy, conducted competing public hearings with little company other than their witnesses and C-SPAN camera crews. 
 In fact, the proposed 28th amendment raised two important issues that have received little attention.
One is that the Senate might actually pass it some time in the next couple of weeks. If it does, the House is likely to follow. Nobody is sure whether Senator Simon's side can muster the necessary two-thirds majority -- 67 if all 100 Senators vote. About 60 Senators have said they will support it. Mr. Simon spoke plausibly for himself and for Mr. Byrd when he said, "I don't have 67 solid votes and I don't think he has 34."
The second is that it could make a lot of difference if it becomes part of the Constitution. The debate that begins this week could lead directly, as sponsors hope, to newfound resolve to cut spending and perhaps raise taxes, with serious impact on the economy, although the two sides disagree over whether impact, in this case, would be recession or prosperity. Some recipients of Federal money would surely lose more than others, although everybody wouldn't lose everything, as the Clinton Administration seems to suggest in its arguments against the amendment. And it would be difficult to increase spending during a recession to help the needy.
Of course, come 2001, when the amendment would probably take effect, the Congress and the President might fail to find any new supply of courage. The Federal courts might have to figure out tax rates, troop levels and welfare standards. And, in Senator Byrd's view, the fundamental power of Congress would be crippled and the Constitution not merely amended but transformed.
But the country seems to be paying little notice. Mr. Simon claims broad public backing, shown by polls, but acknowledges "it may not reach the form of letters and telegrams and phone calls." Some of the ennui derives from the fact that the issue has been around a long time and has come close but never passed. However, it may have more to do with the impression that this is all a political stunt pitting proponents (cowardly phonies pandering to the booboisie of call-in radio) against opponents ( greedy phonies cloaking their commitment to pork behind cheap efforts to scare the elderly and unfilled pledges to do better).
Those caricatures are not wholly the product of cynical imaginations. But that picture fails to capture a sizable body of Senators. Take William S. Cohen, a thoughtful Maine Republican no one considers a political panderer. He used to oppose the amendment as disruptive constitutional clutter. He changed his mind last year and decided it was the only way to accomplish an essential end. On the other hand J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who backed the plan when he thought it had no chance, turned to opposition last fall fearing it would prove to be more than a slogan.
But they are not the whole Senate. Probably about half the Senate thinks the proposal is a good idea on its merits with some political benefit in it too. More than a quarter thinks it is dreadful. The issue will be decided by Senators who are weighing its political value to themselves against the damage they fear it would cause. And they must be wondering just how angry Mr. Byrd, who still controls spending as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, might get with them if they vote for it.

Tides That Brought Democrats to G.O.P. Have Turned

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Republican bumper stickers that proliferated after the 1992 election read: "Don't Blame Me. I Voted For Bush." The Democrats have finally come up with a rejoinder: "Thank Me. . . I Voted Clinton-Gore!"
The market for these newly minted red, white and blue stickers may be bigger than once thought. For all of President Clinton's troubles, for all the conflicting ideological messages and for all the flaws in the Democratic political operation, for all the noise from Senator Bob Dole, the language from the White House seems to be catching on. It is meant to hold on to the liberal camp while building a bridge to more centrist terrain. 
 There has been a small yet significant movement of people to the Democratic fold. It began even before the 1992 election and accelerated throughout Mr. Clinton's first year in office.
For the first time since 1976, the Republican Party is no longer gaining at the expense of the Democrats. While the nation's basic partisanship -- the degree to which people think of themselves as Democrats, Republicans or independents -- remains closely balanced, Democrats have widened their advantage in partisan loyalty to 8 percentage points over Republicans, twice what it was five years ago. The shift comes equally from people who identify themselves as Republicans and independents, according to a series of New York Times/CBS News polls over the last 18 years.
"They're getting credit for going back to the center," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst who predicted years in advance the realignment of the old Democratic South to the Republican Party. "It is significant because if you broke out issues which the Democrats made the most gains -- you'd get crime and welfare reform. That gives them a booster shot. That's also bad news for the Republicans." Yet Mr. Phillips asserted that the movement should not be overemphasized because there is no suggestion that "the Democrats are establishing anything that's got any depth."
Indeed, the trend hardly portends a major party realignment. The biggest question is still where the 19 million people who voted for Ross Perot in 1992 will end up in this year's mid-term elections and in the 1996 Presidential race.
But the Democrats' gains are not simply from fallen-away members who were drawn back to the fold in the afterglow of Mr. Clinton's winning the White House, and they suggest that the party has the potential to win over a significant proportion of independents. The possibilities among younger voters are particularly striking: For the first time since 1984, more Americans in the 18-to-29 age group identify themselves as Democrats than Republicans (31 percent to 29 percent). This is important because the loyalties of younger voters often stick with them for life, and the young tend to reflect the way political forces are moving.
 
The Importance of Loyalty
 Though the position of political parties has declined with the advent of television in recent decades, party loyalty is still important: It gives the dominant party a starting advantage in an election year. And polls on voter loyalty are even more reliable indicators of public sentiment than voter-registration figures, which are incomplete and often biased toward the dominant party in any local jurisdiction.
Martin P. Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine, said the pattern favoring Democrats is "really reactive to the President's overall approval and the economy." What is more significant, he said, is what the numbers say about Republicans. "The fact that some of the gains have receded is another indicator that the Democrats are going to be a majority party in the Congress and the state legislatures well into the 21st century," he said. "The Republicans are slipping."
The Republicans, of course, are also furious. Mr. Clinton is stealing their best lines on the biggest issues of the day, from crime to welfare reform. (He even cited an old health care proposal of Richard M. Nixon in his State of the Union Message last month.) The American public, polls show, barely distinguishes the parties in their ability to reduce the budget deficit or curb crime.
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who advised Mr. Perot in 1992, fears that Democrats could be gaining an edge in winning over the Perot voters. Watching Mr. Clinton deliver the State of the Union Message, he said, "sent a shiver down my spine -- no one's hearing what the Republicans are saying. The Democrats control the White House, the Congress, the bully pulpit."
Even if the Democrats can sustain and build on their gains, a return to the party's dominance of two decades ago would be difficult to imagine. In 1976, as the country was still reeling from Watergate and Jimmy Carter was elected President, 40 percent identified themselves as Democrats, and 20 percent as Republicans. But the edge diminished in the years of the Reagan Administration, as the Republicans absorbed supporters of George C. Wallace and the right-leaning "Reagan Democrats."
Had the Republicans been able to re-elect George Bush, the stage might have been set for them to finally overtake the Democrats in partisan allegiance. Instead, Mr. Clinton fractured the Republican coalition, with considerable help from Mr. Bush, who could not keep up the momentum of the Reagan years, and from Mr. Perot.
Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist organization from which Mr. Clinton developed many of his campaign positions, envisions a grand era of Democratic dominance that leaves little room for the liberals who are battling for a piece of the Clinton agenda.
"For the last quarter-century, the political debate has been on terms set by Republicans," said Mr. From, who sees the President's victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement as a turning point. More recently, he said, the debate has "been on terms set by Bill Clinton. He's on an agenda that goes right at the heart of what the Republicans have been using to build their party and to anchor their Presidential election dominance."
But Mr. From's analysis may be overly optimistic for the Democrats. After all, Jimmy Carter was unable to expand his party's coalition when he was President. And Gerald M. Pomper, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, contended that the party-loyalty figures are relatively soft -- and could again slip.
"Being in office means you can do good," Mr. Pomper said. "And, that you can screw up."

Mouthpiece of the 'Great Leader': Bombast, Bile and Bowling News

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
NORTH KOREA may be the Hermit Kingdom, but some of the hermits labor long and hard at the typewriter. Every day, all across Northeast Asia, antiquated teletypes clatter out the official line of the Korean Central News Agency, a mix of bombast, threats, denouncements and, on occasion, quirky glimpses of life in one of the world's most closed nations.
Last week, when the North reversed itself and said the International Atomic Energy Agency would finally be permitted to resume inspections of the country's suspected nuclear arms installations, the press agency barely mentioned it. But there was other big news: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea now has its own bowling alley, a 40-lane extravaganza in Pyongyang for the benefit of the followers of the "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, and his 52-year-old son, the "Dear Leader," Kim Jong Il. Now the faithful can share a passion for tenpins after a hard day's work up at the reactor. 
 No one examines the agency's dispatches more carefully than the United States, looking for subtle changes in tone that may signal big shifts in strategy. Last week's nuclear concession, for example, was foreshadowed by a report last weekend calling for dialogue to settle the nuclear issue -- an oddly conciliatory change of pitch. But the clues are slim and disconnected, so North Korea watchers, like Kremlinologists before them, have to be on their toes.
"The bowling balls!" one said in Seoul the other day in mock horror. "They're round and dark and heavy, right? We've been looking for the bomb cores everywhere, and we missed the bowling balls!"
Here, in the North Koreans' own idiosyncratic English, are some recent samples of the world according to Pyongyang. DAVID E. SANGER
 
What a guy
On Kim Jong Il's 52nd birthday last Wednesday:
An endless stream of people are visiting the old home at Mount Paektu secret camp, the time-honored holy place of revolution where Comrade Kim Jong Il was born . . . [Historians believe he was actually born in the Soviet Union, where his father had retreated in the battle against the Japanese occupiers of Korea.]
With his rare leadership ability the Dear Leader has brilliantly carried out many difficult and complex tasks in accomplishing the socialist cause of our times, performing immortal feats for the times and the revolution . . . The great trait of the singlehearted unity of our society now is a brilliant crystallization of the Dear Leader's benevolent politics, a politics of love and trust. Feb. 16
 
What a town
On the recent visit of the Rev. Billy Graham:
Pyongyang is beautiful, clean and wonderful and all people have a smile on their faces, he said, adding that their vigorous looks show the spirit of the Korean people . . . He pointed out that the United States and the former Soviet Union are to blame for the division of Korea. Jan. 31
 
Still more good news (sort of)
On the North Korean economy:
A new great progress has been made in all fields of Socialist construction, though the targets of the total scope of industrial output and some major indices including electric power, steel and chemical fiber envisaged in the third Seven-Year Plan failed to be attained due to international events and the acute situation created in Korea . . .
No politico-ideological offensive, economic blockade and military threat on the part of the imperialists and reactionaries can ever frighten the Korean people and no force on earth can block them from advancing under the leadership of the party. Dec. 9
 
The puppet . . .
On Kim Young Sam, the South Korean President:
Only yesterday he reduced the North-South agreement and joint declaration on denuclearization to a waste paper overnight and today he entreated 'tough sanctions against the North' . . . This was an act of a most despicable traitor dyed to the marrow in flunkyist spirit. Nov. 27
 
 We are prepared either for dialogue or for a war . . . The Kim Young Sam puppet clique must stop at once the criminal acts to make the fellow countrymen victims of nuclear holocaust, following outside forces, and unconditionally discontinue flunkyist treacheries and moves for North-South confrontation.
Jan. 30
 
. . . And the puppet-master On America's motives:
The U.S. hard-line conservative forces are promoting in full scale the supply of Patriot missiles to the U.S. troops present in South Korea under the pretext of coping with the D.P.R.K.'s "missile attack."
The U.S. Administration hurriedly dispatched the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to South Korea at the beginning of the new year to have a confab for "the intensification of intelligence against North Korea" and is operating in South Korea an "intelligence supporting team" composed of specialists of the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency. This clearly indicates that the new war provocation moves of the United States against the D.P.R.K. have reached a full-scale stage. Feb. 2
 
Some 'Team Spirit'
On the military exercises held annually by the United States and South Korea:
Now some quarters of the United States are raising a noisy row as if the discontinuation of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises were a big concession, but, in fact, the maneuvers are an act of nuclear threat . . . The United States would be well advised to give up the idea of using the discontinuation of the war game as a bargaining chip. Dec. 9
 
You should talk
On Japan's plans to recycle reactor fuel into plutonium for civilian power plants:
It is not a secret that Japan has already embarked upon the road of nuclear armament and South Korea, too, is developing nuclear weapons. This notwithstanding, the Japanese and South Korean authorities are perpetrating such rash acts as laying hurdles in the way of the D.P.R.K.-U.S. talks, flouting the world opinion over our non-existent "nuclear problem."

With the end of the cold war, jobs in mathematics and the physical sciences have sharply dwindled in the United States, spoiling the lifelong dreams of some students, throwing professionals out of work and possibly dulling the cutting edge of research itself.
Although Americans still win Nobel Prizes and publish thousands of papers, some scientists are deeply disturbed by this trend. They say the lack of jobs, and declining national support of science when the puzzles yet to be solved are more and more difficult, have begun to sap the vigor of American research. 
 The decline in support is reflected at universities, which are cutting the number of doctoral-level candidates they teach, and in board rooms, where companies are demanding more and more that science have some immediate, practical use.
 
Who Is Hurt Most?
 Those alarmed by the trend see grave consequences, both intellectual and personal. They sense a lessening of the free-wheeling intellectual approach that had given many researchers the freedom to pursue offbeat ideas. And they say that the job cutbacks will especially hurt women and members of minorities, who have long been underrepresented in the classroom and the laboratory.
Reflecting the new practical approach, an executive at a large electronics corporation said: "Our scientists have won enough Nobel Prizes to last the company for a long time to come. What we need now is focused research aimed at making a profit for this company. I'm talking about bottom-line commercial survival."
"Focused research" is also a major new theme at the National Science Foundation, one of the main Federal agencies financing research in the United States. The foundation has received steady increases in money each year, and the White House has called for an increase of 6 percent for the coming year, to $3.2 billion.
 
A Senator Speaks Out
 But a Senate appropriations subcommittee headed by Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland has demanded that 60 percent of the foundation's budget "maximize the return on the public's investment in science and technology and to insure that Federal resources are used efficiently and appropriately."
This has translated, many scientists argue, into increased spending on technology applications at the expense of basic scientific research, the traditional role of foundation spending.
The job market appears to be getting worse with each wave of corporate layoffs and university grant reductions. Many scientists and mathematicians have been compelled to seek jobs outside their fields, or to accept temporary academic or industrial positions with neither security nor benefits.
In the magazine Physics Today, Dr. Leo P. Kadanoff, MacArthur Professor of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Chicago, recently wrote that in America "all the props for science have begun to weaken." He added: "Government has become unpopular. The military has started to shrink. Corporations are concerned with tomorrow's stock value and have lost interest in promoting applied research."
Moreover, he said, "Nothing we scientists do is likely to arrest our decline in numbers, support or social value."
Much of the science that academic and manufacturing employers have been buying in recent years has been at cut-rate prices, and professional societies representing scientists object to what they see as exploitation.
Last month the American Mathematical Society passed a resolution condemning "the systematic hiring at United States colleges and universities of unemployed Ph.D.'s part-time at substandard salaries."
 
Too Many Applicants
 The few really desirable academic positions open to physicists are swamped with applicants; two years ago, 813 physicists applied for a single tenured opening at Amherst College.
Many colleges and universities have halted the hiring of permanent tenured scientists, and in some cases scientists who retire are not replaced. The national laboratories -- Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and others -- are struggling to shift away from military research to civilian applications, and they face further staff reductions.
Industries have been eliminating jobs in the sciences and engineering. The pharmaceutical industry alone laid off 27,000 people last year.
With the recent decision by Congress to halt construction of the superconducting supercollider particle accelerator in Texas, more than 1,000 scientists and engineers lost their jobs. Many are seeking positions at particle-accelerator laboratories in Europe, but there is a shortage of research money there.
 
Memories of Sputnik
 At a recent meeting of biochemists in New York City, participants said that the same political and economic forces that killed the supercollider are cutting into all branches of science.
"After the Soviet Union launched the first Sputnik satellite in 1957, the United States practically drowned scientists in money, for fear of losing the space race and the cold war," Dr. Richard L. Chappell, a biochemist, said at the meeting. "Big science budgets helped all branches of science. But now Washington and Moscow are at peace, and the supercollider is just one of the scientific enterprises likely to fall victim to the end of the cold war."
As the job market for scientists contracts, some universities -- Cornell and Pennsylvania State among them -- have already cut the number of graduate science students, especially would-be physicists.
Among the likely casualties of the bleak employment situation is a decade-long campaign by educators and government officials to recruit more women and members of minorities into the core sciences -- physics and chemistry, as well as engineering and mathematics. Only about 8 percent of the doctoral degrees in physics are earned by women, and about 1 percent by blacks.
 
Creating Disappointment?
 Some critics question the wisdom of efforts to recruit women and non-white scientists, efforts which include a campaign by the National Science Foundation. "Are they doing these minorities a favor?" asked Kip Kimbrough, an Atlanta consultant, in a letter to Chemical and Engineering News. "They seem to be training them for jobs that do not exist."
Many scientists are angry at the National Science Foundation, which in 1987 predicted that by the year 2010 there would be a shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States of 692,000. The foundation's prediction clashed with other findings that the job market was already shrinking.
The foundation's data seems to have been overtaken by workaday experiences. The most recent job data collected by the foundation are for the year 1991, and they do not suggest a shortage of scientific jobs. The foundation calculated that only 1.4 percent of doctoral-level scientists and engineers in the United States were unemployed in that year, and only another 1.7 percent were under-employed.
But Melissa Pollak, an official of the foundation's Science Resources Division, said figures for 1993, which will be available next fall, may show a large change. "A lot of professional associations have been documenting widespread hardship," she said.
 
Too Many Doctors?
 A recent survey by the American Institute of Physics found that in 1992, the most recent year for which it obtained data, the number of job openings for doctoral-level physicists at universities, national laboratories and industry was about 800. Competing for these jobs, along with older physicists, were 1,350 scientists who received their Ph.D. degrees that year.
Not only are universities over-supplying Ph.D. physicists, critics say, but the employment situation has been exacerbated by highly qualified scientists from abroad. Roughly 48 percent of the new physics Ph.D. degrees awarded in the United States in 1992 went to foreign students, of which the largest group came from China. Under the 1992 Chinese Student Protection Act, these students can apply for permanent American visas, and according to the American Physical Society, nearly all of them do so.
"A lot of able young people are stacked up in the holding pattern," said Dr. Dudley R. Herschbach, a Nobel laureate and chemistry professor at Harvard University. "If the economy picks up, it should help. But meanwhile, many new Ph.D. chemists are taking unconventional jobs."
Dr. Herschbach's daughter Brenda, who was awarded a Ph.D. in biochemistry last July, now works for a Boston patent law firm and plans to study for a law degree.
"Thirty-five years ago when I was starting my work on molecular-beam chemistry," Dr. Herschbach said, "the off-beat ideas of young scientists were met with enthusiasm. I no longer see that. The government providers of science funding no longer seem supportive of free, basic research and the wild ideas that can lead to great science and wonderful applications."
Dr. Herschbach was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986 for his pioneering investigation of chemical reactions taking place in intersecting beams of molecules.
 
Jobs Far Afield
 Dr. Phillip Schewe, a spokesman for the American Institute of Physics, suggested that "physics education must redirect itself," adding: "A physics student probably should no longer aspire to become a physics professor, but should be prepared to take jobs that may seem far afield from science -- jobs in which the training in rigorous thinking a physicist receives can be put to profitable use."
Just such a transition was made recently by Dr. Stella Sung, who was awarded a Ph.D. in chemistry by Harvard University last spring. Dr. Sung's work on the quantum-mechanical analysis of molecular reactions appeared to be the beginning of a very promising career. Instead, she took a job in Boston at Corporate Decisions Inc., a management strategy consultant.
"There aren't many tenure-track academic positions for chemists, and what jobs there are, are not very well paid," she said. "But that's only one reason for my decision. What I loved as a graduate student at Harvard was not specific scientific knowledge about things like harmonic oscillators, but the principles of thinking and solving problems. I have found the intellectual freedom I love in solving that kind of problem as a management consultant. More and more, young scientists are going to have to look outside science."

HEADLINE: Croats and Bosnians Hold Talks in Germany

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Facing the threat of economic sanctions for sending troops into neighboring Bosnia, Croatia joined talks in Frankfurt today aimed at stopping fighting between Croats and Muslims in western and central Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Top officials of the Bosnian and Croatian governments took part in talks organized by Charles E. Redman, President Clinton's special envoy for Yugoslavia. Earlier this week, Croatian officials described the negotiations as an effort toward normalizing relations between the two former Yugoslav republics. 
 After nearly eight hours of talks, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladjzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said that they had made progress in discussing a number of issues, including a possible cease-fire, and that their delegations would continue talks next week.
The Croats said they also put forward a plan of their own to resolve Bosnia's ethnic bloodshed by dividing the republic into seven ethnically-mixed cantons. The Bosnian side, which until now wanted to maintain a single unitary state, did not offer any public reaction to the plan.
The meeting was the latest in a series of high-level contacts between the two countries, including a meeting in Bonn last month between President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia.
Just as NATO and the United Nations now threaten air strikes on Bosnian Serb artillery positions over the siege of Sarajevo, the talks in Germany represent one of the more concentrated diplomatic efforts by the United States and Germany and other European sponsors to end the fighting between Croatian forces in Bosnia and their Muslim neighbors.
Nominal allies against the Serbs during the early fighting that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims have become bitter enemies over the last year as they have fought over the 30 percent of Bosnia that is not controlled by Serbs.
Among other things, the warfare has led to the eight-month siege of the ancient town of Mostar, where thousands of Muslims remain trapped and harassed by Croatian snipers and heavy guns hiding in the surrounding valley. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the siege claimed 37 lives just during the first nine days of February.
Arguing that it is defending its Bosnian brethren with armed "volunteers," Croatia has become deeply involved in the fighting, with the United Nations estimating that Zagreb has deployed 5,000 regular troops alongside Bosnian Croat irregulars.
Two weeks ago, the United Nations Security Council demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Croatian troops, telling Zagreb that it faced serious measures, including sanctions like those imposed on Serbia for its role in the Bosnian Serbs' war against the Bosnian Government.
But until now, United Nations observers here say, there is little sign the Croats are pulling out. Rather, there is some evidence the Croats are deliberately concealing their presence.
Even so, there are signs the Croats are not faring well against the Muslims. By one account, they have lost 40 percent of the territory they held only last April in central Bosnia.
The decision to seek a diplomatic solution may derive from a growing feeling on the part of both Bosnian Muslims and Croats that the time has come to seek mutual advantage once more against the more powerful Serbs.
At the same time, some people in the Croatian Government, prodded by the United States, have moved to distance themselves from Croatian militias.
Earlier this month Mate Boban, the hard-line Bosnian Croat leader, was forced to resign under pressure from Zagreb. Mr. Boban has advocated the division of Bosnia along ethnic lines.
Just as Croatia may now be turning to negotiations to help resolve a deteriorating military situation with the Muslims, Zagreb embarked last month on an effort to normalize relations with Serbia, with whom the Croatian Government fought a war in 1991.

HEADLINE: TYING EDUCATION TO THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
As the television camera lights glared, 17-year-old Kevin Weismann made his plea to the educators and politicians assembled in a conference hall here.
"All students should have the opportunity to explore the work world while they are still in high school," the high school senior said. "Sooner or later, everyone is going to be out in the workplace." 
 Mr. Weismann's brief comments went to the heart of the subject at hand: how to improve education in California.
The unusual two-day conference, called by the Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr., drew Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Education Secretary Richard W. Riley via satellite and more than 200 national and state education officials. The conference focused on the link between schooling and the economy, with a long discussion about job training for the many students who do not go on to college.
 
Staggering Deficiencies
 The national discourse on job skills and schooling has taken on new urgency here because of a widespread perception that California's flagging economy needs a strong public education system both to recover and to flourish. But the state's once-envied public school system now faces a staggering array of deficiencies: declining spending, growing class size and rising violence.
A voter-led ballot initiative to provide parents with vouchers to pay for private-school tuition also pressured lawmakers to organize the conference. Though voters rejected the initiative last year, the measure was an indication of Californians' rising dissatisfaction with public schools.
To counter the downward spiral, educators and state officials are urging stronger programs for students not bound for college, particularly school-to-work transition programs.
 
Looking to Job Training
 The Clinton Administration's education legislation, Goals 2000, already approved by Congress, emphasizes job training for high school students, as did the Bush Administration's plans. At the meeting, Mr. Reich announced a $750,000 grant to California to help overhaul its school-to-work transition programs, linking high schools to community colleges with apprenticeship-like components built in. To approach job training any other way, he said, "no longer meets the needs of the American economy or the American workplace."
States like Oregon are at the forefront of the movement. Three years ago the Oregon Legislature passed a broad education bill that included a redesign of its high school curriculum, in an effort to teach better job skills to students who are not bound for college.
The model, designed in part by Ira C. Magaziner, now a senior policy adviser to President Clinton, allows students in the 10th grade to choose courses that lead either to higher education or into the workplace. Those who select the workplace can pick forestry, telecommunications, commercial shipbuilding, a range of health professions and other careers. At the same time, they must take mathematics, science, technology and other academic subjects. Ten high schools have such programs; by the 1996-97 school year, all schools will have to offer this choice.
 
The Education-Business Gap
 While there is widespread support in California for such efforts, there are also hurdles. The recession has significantly cut education spending, leaving little money beyond existing programs. And some people at the meeting said there was a communication gap between educators and businessmen.
"Business has sent mixed signals," said Lawrence Kemper, president of the California Association of School Administrators, which represents school superintendents, principals and assistant principals. "At one time, businesses told us they wanted people who would show up on time, treat our customers well and take coaching. Now they are demanding more, but so are we."
Corporate executives acknowledge that problems remain in overhauling public education to accommodate students more interested in work than in college. "This is a real mindshift for our society," said Jere Jacobs, assistant vice president of Pacific Telesis Group in San Francisco and a member of the education committee of the California Business Roundtable. To help public schools, he said, industries like telecommunications and banking are finishing an outline of academic courses and skills that students need to find jobs. But, he said, "there is a lot of work ahead of us."
 
Money and Political Will
 Indeed, educators and lawmakers said, it will take much more money and an equal part of political will to overhaul this state's job-training for students, 60 percent of whom do not graduate from four-year colleges. Mr. Brown, the Speaker, said that in the next month he and other legislative leaders would try to frame a legislative package for education, though he added that it was too early to be sure what issues would be addressed.
But Kevin Weismann, the student from Placer High School, north of Sacramento, said that if educators and politicians were listening to him they would know what to do. He works after school at a local Hewlett-Packard plant, where an engineer steeps him in the principles of advanced electronics.
"All of this will help me know what I need to know when I get into the workplace," Mr. Weismann said.

HEADLINE: A Hard Lesson on Trade for Mondale

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
To understand how deeply President Clinton was seeking to change the tone of trade diplomacy with Japan last year, it took only a few minutes with his Ambassador to Tokyo, Walter F. Mondale.
Mr. Mondale spoke not in the negotiator's patois of tariffs, import barriers and market-share targets but of his confidence that if Washington eased some of the public pressure on Japan's new reform-minded Prime Minister, he would open the country without the need for threats. 
Just weeks after arriving, Mr. Mondale seemed to validate what he described as a more dignified approach by personally negotiating an opening of Japan's construction market.
Today, Mr. Mondale speaks little of dignity. The former Vice President, who has said he was not drawn back into public service to spend his time badgering Japan over semiconductors and wood products, has nevertheless been forced to don the traditional trade warrior's garb of threats of sanctions and timetables.
 
'It's Getting Worse'
 Japan's trade surplus with the United States set a record last year, $59 billion, and President Clinton's yearlong experiment lies in tatters after the collapse of talks a week ago.
Mr. Mondale, like the Government he represents, has endured a harsh education in the way Japan works, an education made all the more bitter because Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said from the time he took office last summer that he wanted the same sort of changes Washington was demanding.
"I don't think I came over here naive, but I thought I could do things a little differently, and I tried very hard," Mr. Mondale said in a conversation that he filled with details of the Japanese markets for cellular telephones, supercomputers and housing. "But what I found was that this pattern persisted.
"This isn't getting better, it's getting worse. We cannot sustain these current account and trade imbalances, and we are not going to just wait for the Government of Japan to take measures."
Mr. Mondale even dismissed his construction-market breakthrough last fall as a product of special circumstances, including a bribery scandal that turned the public against the protected construction companies.
 
One Import Item at a Time
 In a briefing for a group of reporters on Friday and in an interview later, Mr. Mondale made it clear that his thinking and that of the Clinton Administration had evolved in a number of critical respects.
One likely result appears to be a more adversarial posture in public as well as over the negotiating table, and a policy focused less on the abstract ideal of reducing Japan's surplus and more on specific instances where Washington believes Japan discriminates against imports.
That is one reason the Administration has put so much energy into the dispute over opening the Japanese market for cellular telephones. The Administration believes that this offers a blatant example of how an American company, Motorola Inc., was thwarted in its efforts to sell a product in Japan because of Government-sanctioned barriers.
There may well be more such narrowly focused offensives. The only remaining question is whether President Clinton will favor sanctions if disputes cannot be resolved.
 
Measuring the Markets
 One thing, however, will not change: the United States appears likely to become even more forceful in demanding that Japan agree to explicit goals in opening its markets. That was the key sticking point in Washington, and it is the point on which the Japanese have insisted they will not budge because, they say, such goals violate the principles of free trade.
"I think we have to have some way of measuring progress," Mr. Mondale said. "That's what history teaches us."
Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said: "One of the lessons from dealing with the Japanese for decades is that just because you don't get what you need the first time, doesn't mean you change your strategy. Our policy was right and we have no intention of changing it. Part of our problem was in how we presented our policy to the public."
One of Mr. Mondale's greatest disappointments has been the distance between the promises of change offered by Mr. Hosokawa and the reality.
Mr. Hosokawa has succeeded in enacting legislation to change the scandal-tainted electoral and campaign-financing system, the central promise he made last summer when his coalition replaced the Liberal Democratic Party after its 38 years in power.
In economic matters, however, it has been a very different story. Mr. Hosokawa has insisted that he will overcome resistance within the bureaucracy and deregulate consumer markets and the business world. But he has proven a good friend of the bureaucracy in a number of critical decisions.
"I don't mean to say that this is hopeless," Mr. Mondale said, "but I do mean to say that his record over the past four or five months has not been one of an economic reformer. We don't see any difference in the position of the bureaucracy and the Government."
 
An Omen Proves False
 The first signs that Mr. Hosokawa might not be as committed to economic change as expected came shortly after the construction-market agreement.
The Prime Minister had established a commission to propose measures to lift burdensome regulations and to jolt the economy out of a two-year recession, but when it issued its interim report in early November, the proposals were relatively toothless.
Then, at the summit meeting of Pacific nations in Seattle, Mr. Hosokawa met twice with President Clinton. At the second one, attended by Mr. Mondale, Mr. Hosokawa closed the conversation by quickly making several points about the trade talks.
He said that though he was in favor of opening Japanese markets, the talks were two-way; that the United States would have to respond to Japanese demands for change; that his Government did not intend to force changes in the private sector in important areas like the automotive or insurance markets, and that Japan would not agree to the "numerical indicators" of progress that Washington was demanding.
 
Tokyo on the Offensive
 The situation grew even more grim in early January. Not only did the Japanese negotiators stiffen their positions in meetings, but they also began a public offensive.
Just about every aspect of Washington's policy, even assertions that Japan's markets were closed, were refuted. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance issued papers arguing that in many instances, United States markets were actually the more restricted.
That was when Mr. Mondale began to signal to Washington that the process was going badly wrong.
"He has spent a tremendous amount of time alerting Washington to the shortfalls in how we were making our case to the public," said Mr. Garten, the Under Secretary. "We would have done much better if we had listened more to him, and at an earlier stage."
In the weeks preceding his Feb. 11 summit meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Hosokawa finally passed his political reform bills. He then offered a package of measures to stimulate the economy that shocked many here, including some political allies: Mr. Hosokawa accepted the Finance Ministry's advice over that of some of his closest advisers and announced an immediate income-tax cut and a huge increase in a national sales tax after a few years.
 
No One Likes Taxes
 It was a bombshell that Mr. Hosokawa was forced to recant a day later, and that caused his high approval ratings to plummet. The proposed tax increase was wildly unpopular.
"Intellectually, it was not much of a surprise, but for an old Western politician, it was a shock," said Mr. Mondale, who has had some bitter experiences of his own after proposing tax increases in public. "Why would a sitting politician drink that hemlock?"
The move was of direct interest to the United States, since the Administration had insisted that Japan take bold measures to revive its economy. Faster growth would draw in more imports and naturally reduce the trade surplus.
Thus the failure to enact a strong stimulus package and the lack of progress in the talks on specific markets appeared to doom the summit talks this month in Washington. It also changed Mr. Mondale's message back in Washington considerably.
 
Change in Tone Is Complete
 "It would have contributed immeasurably to a successful summit conference because it would have been something we could have hung our hat on," Mr. Mondale said of the stimulus package. "It was a sour way to get started. It told us that deep down, we couldn't communicate with the Finance Ministry or the Government."
A week before the scheduled meeting, Mr. Mondale sent a toughly worded cable to Washington, arguing that the United States should not accept a watered-down deal just to have a deal. The message represented almost a complete reversal from the patient tone of Mr. Mondale's advice five months earlier.
He was thus not surprised when the summit meeting failed to produce an agreement. He will not comment on whether Washington will resort to sanctions in trying to force change in Japan. But he is firm in demanding change in a system that he clearly feels has let the United States down.
"I believe there's a chance for change here," he said. "Whether that occurs or not, I don't know. But if it doesn't, we will not accept the status quo."

HEADLINE: Mexican Rebel Leader Sees No Quick Settlement

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 19

 BODY:
On the eve of talks to resolve the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the rebels' military commander discounted Government hopes of a prompt settlement, saying his troops would lay down their arms only after fundamental changes were made to democratize the Mexican political system.
In an interview on Thursday at a safe house in the mountains of Chiapas, the rebel leader, who calls himself Subcommander Marcos, said his Zapatista National Liberation Army would also demand broad autonomy for Indian regions of the country and a reorientation of the Government's economic policies. 
 The Zapatistas' insistence on sweeping national political and economic changes came weeks after Government officials announced that the insurgents had agreed to narrow their agenda to the problems of Chiapas, Mexico's second-poorest state.
 
Rift Within the Government
 Officials had described that condition as essential to persuading hard-line members in the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to support a negotiated settlement. But Marcos said the rebels had accepted the agenda only under Government pressure to get the dialogue started. He said they had never put aside their demands for national change and would not sign a peace agreement that did not fulfill them.
"We cannot believe that there can be a democratization of the state of Chiapas or the municipalities where the Zapatista National Liberation Army is located but not the rest of the country," he said. "We don't fool ourselves. Either the democratic process is national or there is not a democratic process."
The rebels' stand appears considerably tougher than what Government representatives were expecting to hear when they sit down with 15 rebel leaders and Catholic Church mediators on Monday in the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas.
Several officials have rejected the Zapatistas' position as impossible. And while Marcos said the rebels would not break a cease-fire that has held for five weeks unless attacked, others raised the prospect that the conflict, which began with barely a week of fighting, might drag on well beyond the presidential elections scheduled for Aug. 21.
 
'We Cannot Give Up'
 "We cannot give up things that will destabilize the political order, the social order or the basic economic strategy of the Government," Manuel Camacho Solis, the President's envoy to the talks, said in an interview on Friday in Mexico City. "The cost of doing that would be to increase conflict rather than reduce it."
The Zapatista demands clearly represent a bargaining position. But they also seem to reflect the rebels' belief that in the weeks since they declared war on the state just as the North American Free Trade Agreement was took effect on Jan. 1, they have galvanized an opposition to Mr. Salinas's policies that transcends their limited military strength.
"What is at stake in Chiapas is no longer just Chiapas or even Mexico, but perhaps even the free trade agreement or the whole neoliberal project in Latin America," Marcos said, referring to the wave of economic changes in Mexico and other Latin American countries. These have included openings to foreign trade, the privatization of state enterprises and the restoration of growth with little if any improvement in the lives of the poor.
 
Interview Site Concealed
 "Not because we have that moral force," Marcos added, "but because people are saying, 'All right, what happened here? What is going to happen elsewhere? What costs are there going to be?' " Motioning to the three reporters before him, he added, "If that were not true, you all would not be here."
The interview was the second that Marcos has given since he led the Zapatistas' seizure of San Cristobal and several large towns on Jan. 1, and the first to include a foreign news organization. It was also granted to reporters from the Mexican news magazine Proceso and an independent Mexican daily, El Financiero, on the condition that they not try to identify the remote location where it took place.
To make such identification impossible during a journey of more than six hours from San Cristobal, the reporters were transported in the back of a closed truck or required to cover their eyes. Their watches were taken away until the interview began at 3 A.M. on Thursday, and had to be surrendered again when it ended four and a half hours later.
As he has in the past, Marcos declined to divulge his real name or age. While he now stated directly that he had commanded the Zapatistas' military offensive, he continued to say his role was subordinate to the leadership of various "clandestine committees" made up almost entirely of Mayan Indian peasants.
He said the committees had not yet decided whether he would attend the peace talks.
As he sat on a rough-hewn bench, covered in a black wool poncho and bandoliers, wearing a black wool ski mask and guarded by young Indian guerrillas who dozed by their weapons, Marcos's manner suggested a man perhaps 35 or 40 years old, charismatic, highly intelligent and extraordinarily self-confident.
 
Speaks Some English
 His Spanish sounded only lightly Mexican, and he peppered his conversation with jokes and occasional phrases in a rough English. He said he had learned the language from Playboy magazine and Pentagon manuals.
Of his origins, he would say little more than that he had come from the Mexican provinces and completed college and graduate studies before setting out to form a guerrilla movement in Chiapas 10 years ago as part of a core of a dozen urban-born Mexicans.
He will not remove his mask in public, he said, because the Government refuses to recognize the Zapatista army's identity as anything but that of a "political party in formation." The rebels, he said, have no interest in becoming a political party.
Yet the recognition of autonomy that Marcos said the rebels would seek in the peace talks seems to be a far more difficult request.
Noting the tradition of self-government among the Indian communities that make up about one-third of the 3.2 million residents of Chiapas, he said the rebels would demand that elected leaders of predominantly Indian regions be given control over local political administration, regional economic development priorities and most police functions.
 
'Co-governors' Proposed
 He said the Zapatistas would also propose the election of "co-governors" from each of the six main Mayan-descended tribes of the state, and would push for the same sort of administration in other Indian communities around the country.
Government officials described this idea as virtually unthinkable, and they said the same for Marcos's call for the reorientation of Mexican economic policies so that states like Chiapas would not lag so far behind more prosperous manufacturing and agricultural states in the northern and central part of the country.
The officials said they would have little difficulty responding to other, more narrow demands that the insurgent leader detailed: for new hospitals and schools in Chiapas, new loans or subsidies for poor farmers, the redistribution of some agricultural lands, and small-scale manufacturing projects in areas where new land could not be had.
But to the broader demands for political and economic change that Marcos said the insurgents would present, the officials suggested that their response would be unyielding.
 
Government Seeks a Deal Now
 "If they do not take a deal now, they will turn into an extremist group isolated from the rest of the country," one official involved with the Chiapas conflict said. "If they don't see that, they will throw away the enormous prestige and support they have received, and bring all of the conservative forces in the country together against them."
If the Zapatistas were concerned by such a threat, Marcos gave no hint of it.
"We did not take up arms to appear in the newspaper," he said, his eyes flashing through the mask. "We took up arms so as not to die of hunger. If the Government does not heed our demands, the problem is going to continue and the war is going to continue, whether we appear in the newspapers or not.
"The Government does not have a lot of choices: either it solves the problems, or what happened on the first of January will take place again."

HEADLINE: Political Fanatics Find Pastime That Can Pay

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Feb. 18

 BODY:
The raucous United States Senate race in Virginia has a new side show: cash wagering. Befitting the age, the gaming takes place on computers in the form of a political stock market.
It is the latest offering of a 6-year-old experiment at the business school of the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, which has offered ventures resembling futures markets in 13 elections in seven countries. 
In the Virginia contest, participants set up an account of $5 to $500 and trade in shares of the three best-known candidates. The incumbent, Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, has been challenged by two Republicans who were officials in the Reagan Administration: Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide, and James C. Miller 3d, the former budget director.
Shares in a candidate will be worth a penny for each percentage of the vote he receives, so if a player buys Mr. North at 46 cents a share, and he wins 51 percent of the vote, it means a profit of a nickel a share.
"This is like the financial markets, only there is a definite day of reckoning -- Election Day," said one organizer, Dr. Douglas D. Davis, an economist at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. "You read a bad press report about one of the candidates, and you can see the effect on the stock price that day."
And the prices seem to be a relatively accurate barometer of an election's outcome. Professors at the University of Iowa said that in the last two Presidential elections their venture came within two-tenths of a percentage point, closer than public opinion polls.
Dr. Robert Forsythe, a professor at Iowa and a founder of the market, said that in the 1992 Presidential election a journalist invested $500 and wound up with 7 cents, while a graduate student at Princeton University turned $35 into $800. One $500 investment paid $1,884, which was covered by the losses of other participants.
Although the Iowa Electronic Markets, as the venture is called, conducts business over Internet, the global computer network, Dr. Forsythe said a businessman from Cleveland who was fervent supporter of Ross Perot and had just discovered the market was so excited that he flew to the campus in 1992 to bet in person on Mr. Perot. When Mr. Perot withdrew briefly, the market recorded 1,500 computer transactions in half a minute, dropping his standing to near zero from 30 percent, the professor said.
 
Amusement and Diversion
 Although 90 percent of the venture's 2,000 traders now in the market are from universities, Dr. Forsythe said he hoped to broaden use by people with intense interest in politics by adding a service with a toll-free number. He said that in addition to the Virginia Senate race, organizers expected to start markets this year in the Senate contest in New Jersey and the campaign for governor of Maryland.
In Virginia, campaign officials say the market provides some amusement and a welcome diversion from a contest that involves virtually daily rounds of name calling. "If I buy Chuck Robb, is that insider trading?" asked his spokeswoman, Peggy Wilhide.
Students here at the University of Virginia began setting up accounts when the market opened on Jan. 31. Noah Flaxenburg, 21, a junior from Pottstown, Pa., said he was learning as much about political reality as economic theory. "To make money, you buy the more popular person, not the better person," he said.
The Virginia market has two sectors: the Republican nomination, to be decided at a convention on June 4, and the general election on Nov. 8.
Late Friday, Mr. North's nomination futures were priced at 64 cents, to 35 cents for Dr. Miller. Dr. Charles A. Holt, a University of Virginia economist, said that although Mr. North maintained a wide lead, the market led much of the public in realizing that Dr. Miller was likely to be a strong contender.
On Friday, Mr. Robb's general election price was 49 cents to 32 cents for Mr. North and 16 cents for Dr. Miller.
Dr. Holt said he had no concerns about candidates' sneaking peeks at the latest quotes. "What they care about is the polls," he said.

HEADLINE: Rutgers Seems to Like Its Stately, Stateless Image

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Proud, put-upon New Jersey, the butt of endless jokes, is also the only state in the country without a university to bear its name, exclusively speaking.
Oh sure, the system's official name is Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. But during casual conversation, and more importantly it seems, during televised sports events, what is highlighted is Rutgers, while everything after the comma tends to be lost. 
 Which is why Donald T. DiFrancesco, President of the New Jersey Senate, has proposed dropping everything before the comma. If Rutgers truly is the state university of New Jersey, it should be the State University of New Jersey, he told The Associated Press. Or the University of New Jersey. "Or whatever's appropriate," he said.
"I went to Penn State University," he said. "You know when they play Southern Cal that these kids are from Pennsylvania. When Rutgers plays Southern Cal, the kids in California don't know Rutgers is the state university of New Jersey."
 
A Predictable Firestorm
 Predictably, Mr. DiFrancesco's comments have touched off a minor firestorm among Rutgers students and alumni, who say changing the name would diminish prestige, erase national name recognition and wipe out 227 years of the school's history.
The student newspaper, The Daily Targum, ran a front-page article in which a history professor called the proposed change "a crime of historic proportions." Rumors flew across the university's main campus in New Brunswick: the state would give Rutgers more money for changing its name; the state would reduce financing if Rutgers refused to acquiesce.
"I think its horrible," said Nicole Brown, president of the Douglass College Governing Association. Douglass is Rutgers' women's college. "The University of New Jersey could never carry as much prestige or tradition as the name Rutgers does."
Sean Reddington, a senior majoring in history, said: "If we changed the name, we'd lose the whole nostalgia bit," adding, "It'll become just another state institution."
 
Paul Robeson and 7 Governors
 Rutgers was founded in 1766 as Queens College and renamed in 1825 to honor Col. Henry Rutgers, a Revolutionary War hero and trustee. A year later, Mr. Rutgers gave the college $5,000.
The nostalgia includes beating Princeton in the first intercollegiate football game in 1869 and a slew of notable alumni, including Paul Robeson and seven New Jersey governors.
Today Rutgers graduates more than 9,000 students annually in nearly 100 different fields and is gaining ground in its drive to be recognized as a leading public research university.
"Rutgers is a very special institution," said Jotham Johnson, senior alumni director. "We enjoy a distinguished reputation as one of the leading public universities. People know Rutgers far and wide and any effort to wipe that clean would perhaps be a mistake."
This week, in an effort to stem what officials called a slow but steady decline in state aid, the university released a study detailing its impact on the New Jersey economy. In 1993, state funds made up 46 percent of Rutgers's $826.9 million budget.
 
No Reward or Penalty
 Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for Mr. DiFrancesco, said the Senate President had no plans to penalize Rutgers for not changing its name, or to reward it for doing so. She said Mr. DiFrancesco, who was out of state for much of the week and could not be reached, was taken aback at the reaction to his suggestion.
"I don't think he expected there to be such controversy immediately," she said.
Ms. Hutton said Mr. DiFrancesco had been considering the name change for about 15 years and decided the time was right. He still plans to introduce a bill on the name change, possibly as early as Feb. 24, she said. But he will not spend a lot of time pushing legislators to act on the matter, she said.
"He realizes there are many other important issues," she said.
Not everyone associated with Rutgers is appalled at the idea. Wil Tenburg, a graduate student, says he doubts that most Rutgers students even know who Henry Rutgers was.
"A change in the name wouldn't affect me the least bit," he said.
 
Sweatshirts Would Change
 Kristen Sullivan, a sophomore, said, "There's a lot of school spirit here and I don't think that would change if we became the University of New Jersey. The only thing that would change would be the sweatshirts."
Rutgers alumni say that contrary to Mr. DiFrancesco's suggestion, they are proud of Rutgers's status as a public university and do not wish to hide that fact.
"We're proud to be a state university, but that alone is not enough," said Dorothy Stanaitis, president of the Rutgers Alumni Federation. "So many of us Rutgers people are, well, Rutgers people."
Whatever happens, Mr. DiFrancesco can take solace in the correctness of his suggestion that some students in California might have trouble locating Rutgers on a map.
"Yeah, Rutgers," said Don Hansen, president of the student senate at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. "It's in New York."
No, actually it is in New Jersey.
"New Jersey." he said. "Same deal."

HEADLINE: Team's Motto: 'They Call; We Haul';
On the Road With the Crew of an E.M.S. Ambulance

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
Fifteen minutes after dropping off a man with chest pains at Brookdale Hospital in Brownsville, ambulance 30H is blazing through Brooklyn's rush-hour traffic, its siren an excruciating wail.
The ambulance cuts a tight passage through the streets of Bushwick until it is confronted with a stalled Cadillac on a snowy patch of road. As it impatiently inches forward, drivers leap from their cars to push the crippled Cadillac out of the way. 
 Ambulance 30H -- three-oh-Henry, the dispatchers call it -- races on. For all the commotion, the emergency toward which it is rushing is a child with diarrhea.
"They call; we haul," said John Hartmann, an emergency medical technician assigned to 30H. "That's the job."
Politicians are debating the latest plan to merge the Emergency Medical Service with the New York City Fire Department, and a furor continues over a baby's death last weekend after a dispute between the family and an emergency crew. But for the men and women at the center of the storm, the world continues to turn at its usual, weirdly chaotic pace.
It is a world ruled by the constant possibility of death, but dominated by the small, mundane problems of life: calls about chest pains or diarrhea, and broken-down Cadillacs in the street.
Since the Emergency Medical Service was created 14 years ago, the agency has been a lightning rod for criticism, weathering perennial complaints of abuse, mismanagement and incompetence.
Over the years, measurements of the agency's performance show a marked improvement. Average response times in the nation's busiest ambulance system have dropped to 8.5 minutes today from 18.8 minutes in 1980, even as the number of emergency incidents has gone up to nearly a million from 560,667. The ratio of highly trained paramedics to basic emergency medical technicians has also increased, with paramedics representing about a quarter of the corps today.
At the same time, the New York system is an exception to the national pattern: it is one of the few independent emergency services left in a big city. Three-quarters of the emergency systems in the nation's largest cities are operated by fire departments, private contractors or some combination of the two.
 
Everyday Heroics
 Supporters of a merger in New York say that it would be more efficient and point to the quicker response times of the city's Fire Department. Critics counter that despite the latest rush of headlines, the system does work and is getting better all the time.
For the crews, though, the controversies and the heroics that capture public attention are mere flashes on the horizon.
"It's not like the movies," Mr. Hartmann said. "I've had your ingrown toenail jobs, your hemorrhoid jobs. They all want to go to the hospital. We take them."
The current system grew out of a consolidation of a chaotic system of city-run and private ambulances, which sometimes ended up battling over patients at accident scenes. In 1969, all ambulances were placed under the control of the Department of Hospitals, which took charge of dispatching vehicles, establishing standards and operating policies.
In 1970, the state legislature created the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which then ran the ambulances through the Emergency Medical Service.
The system is now made up of about 490 city ambulance teams that are available on any given day and 110 more teams that are contracted from private hospitals. In addition, there are about 30 volunteer ambulance services, with workers donating their time and money.
All the ambulances are dispatched by the Emergency Medical Service communications center in Maspeth, Queens, based on availability and proximity to a patient. Ambulance 30H roves through Brooklyn and specializes in cases involving hazardous materials. Patients are charged fees ranging from $350 to $450 a run, but the agency still requires a public subsidy of about $100 million a year.
 
Distant Words
 Brenda Steffan, a spokeswoman for the California-based American Ambulance Association, said the trend in recent years has been to move to fire department or private systems, or both, for economy and efficiency. And Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has promised that a merger of the city's ambulance corps with the fire department will bring faster response times.
But how such a vast systemic change would affect service on the streets of New York is difficult to determine. As ambulance crews explain, it is a world ruled by so many obscure factors, from traffic flow to weather conditions, that shifting uniforms may have no effect on service.
"As long as I have a job, I don't care what uniform I wear," said James Foley, Mr. Hartmann's partner in 30H.
The debates that swirl around their work often seem distant and detached. Asked about the case of the baby who died in Queens last weekend after a dispute between family and crew over the choice of hospital, they said they had never encountered a situation that required extensive argument.
In fact, disputes like that are not as common as those with patients who do not want to go to the hospital at all, Mr. Hartmann said. "I mean, here you are and you think they're going down the tubes before your very eyes and they don't want to go," he said, adding that in those cases, they call a doctor.
"We just don't argue with people," Mr. Hartmann said.
 
Rewards, but a Price
 The reality is that although their work is perceived by the public as a matter of life and death, it often is not. Of nearly a million emergency incidents a year, nearly 60 percent are classified by the Emergency Medical Service as not life-threatening.
Emergency medical technicians, whose pay starts at about $24,000 a year, go through 10 weeks of training before going out in an ambulance. Paramedics, who can administer certain drugs, must go through about 10 more months of training; their pay starts at about $29,500.
In five years with the service, Mr. Hartmann has earned one "pre-hospital save," for bringing back a patient in full cardiac arrest. Whenever they save a patient, ambulance workers receive a red-and-orange medals which most wear on their shirt pockets.
Mr. Hartmann has also brought 18 babies into the world, delivering one in a tenement hallway. Most ambulance drivers have at least one of the distinctive blue-and-pink "baby bars" on their shirt pockets.
Some proudly wear the solid-black "black sheep" bar, an unofficial medal usually awarded by colleagues for saving a patient in unconventional and perhaps unauthorized ways -- like a technician who rappelled off the Williamsburg Bridge to rescue someone threatening to jump.
Mr. Hartmann said he intended eventually to take the course to become a paramedic, although most of his co-workers have their sights set on joining fire or police departments, which pay better.
Most ambulance workers last only a few years, often burning out from the constant fits and starts of the business and eventually finding other jobs, he said.
He said he also knew of co-workers who had committed suicide. "You always see blood and gore and abuses of the system," he said. "Some people don't handle it well."
But for real "trauma junkies," he said, nothing matches the satisfaction of doing the job right.
 
A Big Job? Maybe
 In the middle of burgers and fries after a call in Williamsburg, Mr. Hartmann and Mr. Foley run out of a restaurant and head to their ambulance when a call comes in about a major fire possibly involving hazardous material, several miles away in Midwood.
"This is our specialty," Mr. Foley says as he swerves the car into the street. "Probably a biggie. I love this job."
With the siren wailing, they get on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Even as they hit 75 miles an hour with their lights flashing, cars occasionally cut in front of them, while others fall in behind for a slick ride down the expressway.
They get off the expressway and fall in behind a line of firetrucks. "Five blocks away, bro," Mr. Foley yells to the back of the ambulance.
At Avenue O, the street is packed with fire engines and ambulances. They hear on emergency radios that 20 to 25 firefighters may have been exposed to asbestos in a house fire, requiring a full decontamination.
Mr. Hartmann and Mr. Foley unpack their sealed contamination suits and wait for the arrival of the Fire Department's shower trailer.
One ambulance worker comments ruefully that the trailer used to be controlled by the Emergency Medical Service. Now "they bring it, we staff it," he says.
 
Hurry Up and Wait
 After the initial burst of activity, the ambulance crews settle in, waiting to hear if the firefighters will need to be sprayed with water to remove all traces of asbestos.
The crews up sitting for an hour on Avenue O in a line of flashing emergency vehicles before word comes that the decontamination has been called off. The ambulance workers who gathered in 30H roll their eyes and head off to pack their equipment.
As they prepare to end their shift, Mr. Hartmann tallies the total for the night: two case of diarrhea, one case of chest pain, one stomach ache, one case of Mace in the face, a possible beating, a fire in a subway station and a canceled decontamination.
"All in all, a pretty good night," Mr. Hartmann said.

HEADLINE: NEW CALLS TO LIFT EMBARGO ON CUBA

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Now that the United States trade embargo on Vietnam has been lifted, a growing number of Cuban-Americans and members of Congress are pushing President Clinton to ease the embargo on Cuba. But because of domestic political pressures, the Administration seems unwilling to budge.
Though still a minority among Cuban-Americans and on Capitol Hill, these voices are telling the Administration that the best way to undermine Fidel Castro is to increase Western involvement in Cuba. In their view, that means easing or ending the embargo. 
 Supporters of such a move, like the Miami-based Cuban Committee for Democracy and Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, assert that the 32-year-old embargo has failed to achieve its goal of forcing out Mr. Castro or getting him to embrace democracy. Worse, they say, the embargo has hurt the well-being of average Cubans and given Mr. Castro a convenient explanation for why Cuba's economy is in such a sorry state.
Representative Rangel, whose bill to end the embargo has 25 co-sponsors, said: "I have talked with Cuban business people and they tell me, 'The embargo is helping Castro.' They say, 'The Cuban people believe it's the embargo, not Castro, that's causing all their pain.' "
 
Cuba Is Different
 Administration officials say that while the recent small and tentative economic reforms in Cuba offer some glimmers of hope, they have no intention of easing the embargo because they are convinced that Mr. Castro has no plans to hold free elections or improve human rights.
"Vietnam is at least doing something on economic reform, but Cuba isn't really doing anything on economic or political reform," one official said. "Our feeling is the embargo has an impact. Lifting it would produce a short-term inflow of capital that would enable Castro to retard reform."
Administration officials acknowledge that domestic politics comes into play. They see little political gain in softening their policy toward Cuba, when the main Cuban-American group, the Cuban American National Foundation, remains vehemently anti-Castro.
"This Adminstration doesn't want to be seen as soft on Castro," said Jorge Dominguez, a Cuban-American professor of political science at Harvard. "You hear talk from various parts of government that they're concerned about elections in Florida, and not just in 1996."
Administration officials say they have learned that even if they want to reach out toward Mr. Castro, they can end up getting burned. One official noted that shortly after the 1992 election, President Clinton's emerging foreign policy team was reassessing Cuba policy when they heard that several prominent Cuban human rights workers were beaten up on International Human Rights Day.
 
No Easing on Travel
 Showing the Administration's continuing determination to isolate Cuba, the State Department has recommended against easing travel restrictions to Cuba. Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, who asserts that liberalizing travel is vital for disseminating pro-democracy ideas, has suggested he would push a bill to ease travel restrictions to Cuba and other embargoed countries if the Administration did not do so on its own.
To woo the Cuban-American vote in the 1992 Presidential elections, Mr. Clinton moved faster than former President George Bush to endorse a tough bill on Cuba that tightened the embargo by prohibiting the overseas subsidiaries of American companies from trading with Cuba.
Administration officials say that law, the Cuban Democracy Act, ties their hands on Cuba policy. But many experts on Latin America say the act leaves the Administration plenty of latitude to tinker with Cuba policy.
The act's sponsor, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, takes a hard line, saying, "the question of American foreign policy toward Cuba is largely settled."
In the view of some foreign policy experts, the Administration is so attentive to domestic political concerns that it finds itself trapped with a policy that is counterproductive.
"It's a remnant of the cold war," said Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group. "Many senior officials say in private it's an absurd policy. It's not achieving its goals. And it's more likely than not to help create a violent situation in Cuba that will produce large flows of refugees."

HEADLINE: Unemployed Man Is Charged With Threat to Kill President

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
An unemployed limousine driver from Florida has been accused of threatening to kill President Clinton.
The man, Ronald Gene Barbour, 39, of Orlando is being held in the Seminole County jail in Sanford, Fla., after his indictment by a Federal grand jury in Orlando. 
 WUSA-TV in Washington reported on Friday that Mr. Barbour was in the Washington area from Jan. 11 to Jan. 17 and intended to shoot Mr. Clinton during one of the President's morning runs on the Mall. Mr. Clinton was in Europe at the time.

HEADLINE: One Health Care Vote: A periodic look at a lawmaker;
For Freshman in Congress, Finding Opinions on Clinton Plan Is the Easy Part

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Lynn Schenk is a freshman Democrat in Congress who would like to support President Clinton in his efforts to change the health care system. But in a district with 14 major hospitals and nearly 100 biotechnology companies, where one of her Republican opponents is a doctor, there are plenty of experts to tell her what to do.
So many, in fact, it's almost paralyzing. 
 On a visit back home during the Congressional recess this week, Ms. Schenk was besieged by lobbyists talking about health care.
Executives of two local companies that developed simple tests to help detect osteoporosis wanted Congress to require coverage of such tests, which cost $30 to $50, as part of any national health plan.
Retail druggists pleaded with Ms. Schenk to provide coverage of prescription drugs.
 
A Swing Vote
 Some retirees advocated a program of national health insurance like Canada's, a "single payer" plan financed by the Government, which would virtually eliminate the role of private insurance companies.
Restaurateurs told Ms. Schenk that employers should not be required to buy health insurance for their workers. Susan Ham Baumann, general manager of two San Diego restaurants, said her company spent $110,000 a year on insurance for 70 employees and would have to pay $190,000 under Mr. Clinton's proposal. "That's $80,000 more a year to me, which is money I don't have," she told the Congresswoman.
Ms. Schenk, a 49-year-old lawyer with liberal Democratic instincts in a fiscally conservative district, has a pivotal position as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will begin drafting health care legislation soon after Congress reconvenes on Tuesday. Hers is a swing vote; she is not committed to any specific health care bill.
 
'Couldn't Take It on Faith'
 "My background in health care is as a consumer," said Ms. Schenk, who knows her way around Washington from her days as a White House fellow in the Carter Administration. "Having to make a momentous decision on health care reform, one of the most significant social policy decisions of the last 30 or 50 years, I want to know a whole lot more than I do now. I've been trying to learn for the last year.
"With a Democrat in the White House, my inclination is to be very supportive of his proposal, but I couldn't just take it on faith. It's too important a decision."
Ms. Schenk is engaged in what she describes as a methodical "intellectual and technical study process." But the discussions with the experts in her district -- the coastal 49th District, which begins south of Del Mar and includes northern and downtown San Diego and Coronado -- tend to focus on small fragments of a very big picture.
From this continually shifting kaleidoscope of concerns, no coherent theme readily emerges. If there is any consensus on overhauling the health care system, it was not evident in the meetings that Ms. Schenk held this week. The conflicting pleas from constituents make her decision all the more difficult.
 
Big Test for Congress
 But she recognizes that Congress is on trial, and she says Congress as an institution will fail the test if it cannot synthesize consensus from the jumble of competing interests.
Those in the "bioscience industry," an engine of economic growth in Southern California, tend to support modest changes of the type proposed by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, she said. The Cooper bill would make health insurance more easily available, but would not require employers to buy it.
George W. Dunbar Jr., president of Metra Biosystems, which has developed the blood test for signs of osteoporosis, told Ms. Schenk, "Let's fix what needs to be fixed, rather than turn things upside down."
In general, the Cooper bill envisions a smaller role for the Federal Government than Mr. Clinton proposed. But when Ms. Schenk and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich held a forum for older residents of San Diego this week, there was substantial sentiment for a bigger Federal role.
 
Opposition in the Wings
 Joseph Stern, 83, a local coordinator for the American Association of Retired Persons, whom Ms. Schenk described as the "king of seniors," said: "Single-payer is the most sensible plan. It's the simplest, the most economical to operate. It gives consumers full choice, and it permits doctors to operate freely."
After the forum, Mr. Reich said, "I was surprised at the support for a single-payer plan."
Lawmakers who seek re-election this year naturally expect to be rewarded or punished at the polls for their votes on health care. But Ms. Schenk has special reason to be careful and cautious. A local urologist, Dr. John F. Steel, the former chief of staff at Scripps Memorial Hospital in the La Jolla district, is seeking the Republican nomination to oppose her. He says she will be more vulnerable if she supports the President's proposals.
Dr. Steel acknowledges some serious problems in the medical system, but, like many Republicans, he insists that "there is no crisis." He said his philosophy of health care was simple: "Keep the government out of it."
 
Concern About Drug Pricing
 As a junior member of a powerful committee, Ms. Schenk is focusing on several issues: women's health care, the fate of biotechnology companies, the concerns of small businesses and the need for Federal aid to help finance the care of illegal aliens.
She is a pro-business Democrat. In the early 1980's, when Edmund G. Brown Jr. was Governor, Ms. Schenk served in his Cabinet as Secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing.
She worries about the effects of Mr. Clinton's proposal for the Government to review the "reasonableness" of new drug prices. "The plan as it now stands would have a detrimental effect on research and development of breakthrough drugs," she said. "That's a constituent problem. These companies are a source of job growth. Cutting-edge research may help me, my family and friends and fellow citizens by finding treatments for AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
"If we, by our actions in Washington, dry up the venture capital that is the lifeblood of these companies, then we will have done something harmful to ourselves and to future generations," Ms. Schenk said. She quickly added that "some of these drugs are incredibly expensive to the consumer" and said, "We've got to fix that," but has not endorsed a specific remedy.
 
A Model Medical Market
 Ms. Schenk has formed a panel of advisers from local biomedical companies. The head of the panel, David F. Hale, president of Gensia Inc., said the growth of these companies was one of the few bright spots in California's economy, which has been battered by recession and by cutbacks in the defense industry.
San Diego is already a model for the kind of medical market that Mr. Clinton wants to create nationwide. Patients and doctors here are comfortable with health maintenance organizations like Kaiser Permanente, which provide a full range of medical services in return for a flat fee, set in advance. Competing networks of doctors and hospitals already provide much of the care here.
With 5 hospitals, 15 clinics, 4 nursing homes and 1,100 doctors in the San Diego area, the Sharp Health Care network is a model of the integrated care Mr. Clinton wants to encourage. But when Ms. Schenk visited Sharp's headquarters this week, she got a mixed message.
Peter K. Ellsworth, president of Sharp Health Care, told her that a network of doctors and hospitals could provide excellent care and control costs if it was paid a flat monthly amount for each person enrolled in the health plan.
 
Bureaucracy on Bureaucracy
 But he said the market was already "moving in the right direction," and he expressed concern about the authority Mr. Clinton would give to large health insurance purchasing pools, known as alliances.
"I worry about alliances that create yet another layer of bureaucracy between people paying the medical bills and the ultimate deliverer of care," Mr. Ellsworth said.
Ms. Schenk, who observed the burden of insurance paperwork in a doctor's office earlier this week, said, "It's hard to imagine it could get worse."
But Mr. Ellsworth said, yes, it could get worse with the alliances envisioned by Mr. Clinton.
"I'm a cynic when it comes to insurance companies," Mr. Ellsworth told the Congresswoman, a longtime friend. "They're big. They're rich. They're very powerful. I don't believe they will go away. I fear that we'll have new Federal, state and local bureaucracy plus the insurance company bureaucracy. That would be worse."
In Washington, Administration officials continually woo Ms. Schenk, seeking her support for Mr. Clinton's plan. Some of the officials, she said, are "breathtakingly knowledgeable." Others tell her simply, "You owe it to your President; you owe it to your party."
But the appeal to Ms. Schenk's sense of political loyalty has so far been unavailing. Those who would win her vote, she says, must address the substance of her concerns and those of her constituents.

HEADLINE: Single Women and Poverty Strongly Linked

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Single mothers and "displaced homemakers" are four times as likely to live in poverty as the population as a whole, according to a study.
"What we have discovered can only be characterized as grim," said Gilda Nardone, president of Women Work, an advocacy group that came to its conclusion by analyzing census data. "Even though these women's work-force participation rose significantly during the decade, their likelihood of living in poverty remained high." 
 The report, released on Thursday, focused on the plight of single mothers and what it calls "displaced homemakers" -- women whose primary occupation had been homemaking but who did not find full-time, year-round employment after they became divorced, separated or widowed.
There were 17.8 million such displaced homemakers in the United States in 1990, an increase of four million since 1980, Ms. Nardone said. The number of single mothers also rose, to 7.7 million in 1990 from 5.8 million a decade earlier.
While 11 percent of households in the United States lived in poverty in 1990, 42 percent of displaced homemakers who headed households and 44 percent of single mothers were impoverished, the study found.
"For millions of single mothers and displaced homemakers, the American dream is proving elusive because jobs are not providing economic security," Ms. Nardone said.
Displaced homemakers had a significantly higher rate of employment in 1990 than they did in 1980, the study found. About half were employed either part-time or part of the year in 1990, compared with a third who were employed a decade earlier. But the poverty rate improved only slightly, to 35 percent in 1990 from 39 percent in 1980.
"Part of the reason is that displaced homemakers and single mothers are over-represented in service jobs," Ms. Nardone said. "Service jobs offer low wages, few benefits, part-time work and little or no job security."
The study also found that single mothers and displaced homemakers tended to have "unstable housing situations." Three in four single mothers rented or shared their housing, and three in five single mothers with children under age 2 had moved within the previous year.
Jill Miller, executive director of the organization, said displaced homemakers were not a phenomenon that would soon disappear. "Future generations of stay-at-home mothers and women whose employment is interrupted by family caretaking responsibilities are likely to find themselves with little or no immediate income when they are displaced," Ms. Miller said.

HEADLINE: Late Donations Shore Up the Neediest

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As its 82d annual appeal draws to a close, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is in danger of ending the campaign with a decrease in contributions for a second straight year, jeopardizing services for thousands of the city's poor.
The amount collected so far this year, $4,135,714.05, represents a drop of $91,106 from collections at this time last year and a drop of more than $600,000 from the 1991-92 campaign, the most successful in the fund's history. Every dollar donated is used for direct services for the needy because The Times pays the campaign's overhead. 
 The shortfall comes at a time when the fund's ability to help is especially crucial because the seven charities the fund supports have been doubly besieged by decreased private giving and increased need as a result of the economic downturn.
For example, the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a branch of the UJA-Federation, one of the charities supported by the fund, is struggling to help dozens of recently unemployed men and women and a rapidly increasing pool of people in danger of being evicted. But last year, the board suffered a 10 percent decrease in support from the UJA-Federation. It has also lost two of five staff positions over the last two years.
The Children's Aid Society, which runs eight community centers throughout the city that provide food, medical care and supervision for hundreds of thousands of children, will have to curtail mental-health counseling and other services if private support continues to fall, said Philip Coltoff, the society's director.
"A decrease of even 10 percent compared to what we received last year would have an effect, particularly for those children who are prone to violent acting-out," Mr. Coltoff said. "It could mean as many as 150 fewer counseling sessions next year for these children."
 
Individuals Count
 Hundreds of donors, among them Rosalie S. Walton of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., have already responded to news of the lag in the campaign, which ends on Feb. 28. "I read your column about the fund being down this year, at a time after dispiriting, seemingly endless ice and cold," Mrs. Walton wrote in a letter accompanied by her $100 donation. "But my house is warm, my husband and children are well and my friend in Los Angeles reached me to say she is O.K. and is picking up everything from her floors."
Despite increased giving by such dedicated donors -- some who have given even though they are unemployed, and some who have given three or four times to try to bridge the gap -- the fund continues to trail previous years because of a decrease in giving by estates and trusts.
This means the continued largess of individual donors will determine whether the campaign is a success this year, said Arthur Gelb, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund.
"There is little more than a week to go before the drive's end, and those of us who keep track of the Neediest Fund are hoping there'll be a final splurge of giving by individual donors so we can meet last year's total or even beat it," Mr. Gelb said. "The seven charities that depend so much on our readers' generosity are particularly hard pressed for support this year, and they're hoping along with us."

For over a decade, the homeless have been parading, shivering, ranting, eating, drinking, sleeping and occasionally dying within view of the north-facing windows of the family quarters of the White House. At last, perhaps, we have a President who can see them. It is about time.
Homelessness in America is a spectacle to crack any caring heart. The scores of homeless who shuffle among the springtime tulips and winter snowbanks of Lafayette Park in Washington are the unelected representatives of a far-flung constituency. During the Reagan and Bush Administrations, neither these Washington representatives of the homeless nor the Congress itself could get the residents of the White House to open their eyes. 
Finally, the Clinton Administration seems ready to make the Federal Government look at and respond to homelessness. The new report prepared by the secretaries of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development argues that addiction and mental illness account for about half of the adult homeless population.
It also blames structural changes in society and the economy for causing growing numbers of poor Americans -- there are 37 million of them -- to lose their shelter. In the 80's, available jobs and wages for unskilled workers declined. Among women with dependent children, the buying power of welfare benefits has eroded in the last 20 years. Meanwhile, the study asserts that "huge numbers" of cheap units have disappeared from the rental market. In short, some poor citizens who were not addicted or mentally incompetent became homeless because the cost of bad apartments increased as the amount of money in their pockets declined.
The new report was written by Andrew Cuomo, the Assistant Secretary of Housing who produced a much praised and largely ignored report on homelessness in New York City in 1992. As in the earlier report, Mr. Cuomo called for a mix of remedial and preventive measures as well as new programs that enlist nonprofit organizations in delivering services to the homeless.
The report does not pretend to answer every question. For example, its finding that up to seven million people were homeless at some point in the late 80's does not answer how many are homeless at this moment. Guesses range from 500,000 to several million.
It does not take a head count to affirm the evidence before our eyes night and morning. Nor should the White House's formal commitment to the spirit of this draft report await clearance from the Office of Management and Budget. After 12 years of willful myopia, the numbers are less important than the commitment to behold the mundane suffering outside the windows of Pennsylvania Avenue and Main Streets across America.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Clinton described the residents of our door stoops and underpasses as "people who are battered and bruised and broken, but who still have a lot of God's grace left in them." To have left them so long to the grace of God alone is an insult to our national values.

HEADLINE: Tower Explosion's Legacy: Security Improves in Year And Is Also Lost Forever;
The Manager: A Changed World Is Oddly Normal

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Telephone calls pour into Charles Maikish's 35th-floor office at the World Trade Center constantly, sending him running to hear tenants' complaints, answer contractors' questions and attend the myriad meetings resulting from the explosion a year ago.
Since the moment of the blast, when he was rocked in his chair while signing a lease, Mr. Maikish, the director of the trade center, has seen his world change. He is now on a first-name basis with construction workers and engineers and secretaries and executives he scarcely knew before. As he walks the corridors of the concourse, he seems to marvel at the fact that on its face, the trade center 
 seems back to normal, if not a little better.
For the Port Authority, as well as the New York region, the explosion appears to have had little long-range economic impact. Losses that were not covered by insurance were offset by the temporary construction and security boom.
At the trade center, occupancy is higher than before the blast. Commuters and other pedestrians hustle by what was the Big Kitchen, an old food court, now replaced by a sleek new Gap clothing store. Just after the blast, one corner of the court was the control center for emergency workers. Now black leggings and athletic bras are displayed there.
 
New Restaurant for Tower
 Alexander's Department Store, which became an emergency tenant assistance center, will soon be converted into the Limited and several other stores. Though a few businesses, including Deloitte & Touche, the accountants, moved out after the blast, a slew of other stores and restaurants, plus the Bank of America, are moving in. They did not get financial incentives, Mr. Maikish said. Instead, he said, the trade center defied its reputation as a lethargic, bureaucratic landlord and hustled to accommodate them.
The Port Authority is spending more than $300 million to fill the bomb crater, repair other structural damage and renovate. It is now weighing bids from owners of the Rainbow Room, Smith & Wollensky Steak House, Bouley and Tavern on the Green to replace the Windows on the World restaurant, which was closed after the blast.
In recent weeks, Mr. Maikish says, the incessant telephone calls have included requests from tenants asking about parking in the underground garage, which is to reopen on March 30 -- but to tenants and government and security officers only. And about once a week, he said, there is a call about a suspicious package somewhere in the complex. So far, he said, they have been false alarms. MARY B. W. TABOR

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan Means New Era of Family Doctor;
Tax Burden for Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Jim Cooper's Pointless Plan," by Henry J. Aaron (Op-Ed, Feb. 13), is right. The Cooper plan will, at the margin, leave low-income workers facing confiscatory taxes because of phase-out of its low-income subsidy. 
 Unfortunately, the Clinton health plan is not much better. It leaves most low-income workers paying roughly 11 cents more of each dollar they earn through its 7.9 percent payroll tax, plus an additional 3 percent tax from the phase-out of its subsidy to low-income families.
Add this 11 percent marginal tax to the 18 percent marginal tax associated with the phase-out of the earned income tax credit, the 15 percent Federal income tax, the 15 percent Social Security payroll tax and an assumed 5 percent state income tax, and one gets a combined 64 percent marginal tax for low-income workers. This rate is smaller than that under the Cooper plan, but it's still outrageous.
The Clinton plan also produces extraordinarily large distortions for employers in deciding whether to hire high-wage or low-wage employees and workers younger or older than 55.
Both the Clinton and Cooper plans are seriously flawed in economic incentives. Neither should be adopted before their distortions are addressed.

On the Drawing Board: Rail Yard to Rail Hub

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Just blocks from the planned subway link in Long Island City lie the 200-acre Sunnyside rail yards, a sprawling site that has been the subject of scheme after scheme, including a domed sports stadium, an office skyscraper and a race track, none of which have materialized.
Now a new, grand plan for the yards is slowly taking shape. 
 Transportation planners and local officials are envisioning a regional rail transit hub with more links than Grand Central and Pennsylvania Stations combined. Housing and commercial buildings would be built on top of the hub, and the combined effect, the planners say, would turn Long Island City into New York's fourth central business district, after lower Manhattan, midtown and downtown Brooklyn.
There are many obstacles, the biggest being cost -- hundreds of millions of dollars or more for the new station, for which no money is now dedicated -- and the complexity of uniting diverse transportation and governmental agencies. The local economy is considered too anemic now to finance the housing and commercial development.
A task force named by the Queens Borough President's office is drafting a plan for the project and has applied for a Federal grant.
The City Planning Department has long advocated a hub plan. Floyd Lapp, the department's director of transportation, said the project might be realized because of a trend toward rail building. He cited the planned link of subway lines using Queens Boulevard with those using the new 63d Street tunnel as an example.
At the heart of the plan is a center connecting Amtrak's interstate trains, three suburban commuter lines (the Long Island Railroad, Metro North and New Jersey Transit) and up to nine subway lines (the B, E, F, G, N, Q, R, 7 and a line being developed on the new link) and trains to John F. Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports.
With most of the track in place, creating a hub would require building a station at Sunnyside. The subway stations are a bit far for a pedestrian connection and might require a shuttle or moving sidewalk.
There is no major opposition so far. The Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit organization, has advocated a hub since 1929. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is also doing its own study of a Sunnyside hub. Amtrak explored it in 1989, drawing up a plan for 950 housing units and five million square feet of commercial space but not acting on it. B.L.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SUNSET PARK;
Thumbing a Sail to Work

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
A high-speed ferry line to connect Sunset Park to lower Manhattan and midtown is being planned, officials at the City Planning Department say, in part to offset the traffic congestion that is expected to accompany a planned overhaul of the Gowanus Expressway.
The ferry would dock at 58th Street and Second Avenue in the Brooklyn Army Terminal, but the Manhattan stops have not yet been announced. The Scandinavian Marine Corporation, which runs ferries in Connecticut, Florida and Scandinavia, has been chosen to run the service, said Ann Buttenwieser, vice president of waterfront development for the Economic Development Corporation. 
 The demolition and replacement of a dilapidated pier and the construction of a parking lot for 500 cars, along with walkways and streets to the ferry, would cost an estimated $25 million, to be paid by the state Department of Transportation. The project would also an esplanade, benches and a railing.
The reconstruction of the Gowanus, which lies only two blocks from the pier site, is scheduled to begin in 1997 and is expected to cause traffic snarls from Bay Ridge to Brooklyn Heights. The city, which plans to open bidding for the project within two weeks, hopes to begin construction in about three months and believes the ferry could be running by 1996.
Plans are also being made to present the ferry project to residents and community leaders in the coming weeks, but there are rumblings of dissatisfaction already.
Anthony Giordano, executive director of Sunset Park Restoration, a community group, said the ferry would work best at 39th Street and Second Avenue, which was home to a ferry service that was discontinued in 1958. But he was doubtful about the success of any ferry in the area.
"It just doesn't seem plausible that commuters would trek from New Jersey, Staten Island and Long Island, be within sight of the Manhattan skyline, park their vehicles and take the ferry," Mr. Giordano said. "I just don't see it happening. If they really want to do something, they should do it in terms of improving the subway service."
The ferry would carry up to 350 passengers, but no cars. There is no estimate yet on how much the fare for the 10-minute ride would be. Bus lines may also be added to funnel passengers into Sunset Park.
The emphasis on ferry service is a result of the High-Speed Ferry Task Force appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1993 to study ways to relieve congestion on traffic routes leading into New York City.
He has called ferry transportation a key element of his "New New York" economic revitalization program for the metropolitan area and has described the boats as an "environmentally sound means of travel" and "a great way to get to and from work."
It would be Brooklyn's second ferry to Manhattan: one now runs from the 69th Street pier in Bay Ridge to Pier 11 at Wall and South Streets. LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Mentor, Hell-Raiser. . .

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
JOHN H. BESS, sitting in his cave of an office in the basement of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, had no time to mince words. The telephone was ringing, his schedule went on for pages and all this talking put him two beats behind his fast-forward rhythm as head of the youth agency called the Valley.
"We are a society that is manufacturing monsters," Mr. Bess said. "I call this the microwave generation. Everything is resolved to the extreme and quickly. These young people have plenty to be legitimately angry about, but often it's not a rational anger, it's an explosive anger. 
 "They're angry at their mother, they're angry at their sister, they're angry because the train is late," he said. "Then someone looks at them the wrong way or steps on their new shoes. . . ."
When Mr. Bess founded the agency 15 years ago in the Manhattan Valley neighborhood just east of Columbia University, things were bad for children living in the margins. Now, he says, they are dreadful. Crack, homelessness, guns, joblessness, combined with an existential ennui that early engulfs the poor, have devised a separate America steeped in pessimism.
"It is so different from 1979," Mr. Bess said with a shake of his head. "The young people mostly wanted a job or a place to develop leadership or communication skills. Young people today come in: No. 1 they're a teen mother; No. 2 they're being abused by a parent and/or boyfriend. They've dropped out of school and want to do something with their life. It's a multiplicity of problems."
And so it is that Mr. Bess, 41, acts as mentor, role model, hell-raiser, fund-raiser and go-between in this little world. He presides over a scope of services from leadership training programs to dropout-prevention counseling. The title on his business card, chief executive officer, does not begin to describe his peripatetic existence.
He goes to conferences, he buttonholes politicians, he badgers parents, he insists that successful black and brown visitors to Valley headquarters tell his young people how they made it. He works late into the night, his beeper on his hip and his mind focused on redemption.
Mr. Bess's vision 15 years ago was to develop an organization to nurture a new generation of leaders, he said. He miscalculated how hard it would be. The economy took a dive. Where there was no hope there were drugs, and where there were no jobs there was the opportunity to work for drug dealers. Plenty of children succumbed to despair.
If there is any secret for success, Mr. Bess said, it is disarmingly simple: caring people who give youngsters a chance to channel their energies. That can mean a lot of things. For the Valley, it means helping them organize to combat problems in their neighborhoods or teaching skills like how to silkscreen T-shirts. It can mean just listening.
There is no dearth of brilliance or creativity in the young people who flow through the warren of rooms beneath the great cathedral at Amsterdam Avenue and 111th Street, Mr. Bess said, but many have not been given the proper discipline, exposure, direction and opportunities.
The Valley, which is nonsectarian, serves 5,000 young people a year, with programs ranging from teen parenting to substance-abuse treatment, from fine arts to help preparing for college. The youngsters, from all over the city, are referred by peers, parents, schools, clinics or community-based programs. About half are black, half Hispanic.
One recent day, about 20 teen-agers in a biweekly leadership training group discussed a visit by Bill Cosby, a friend of the Valley who had just participated in an anti-violence program. Mr. Bess poured himself into the mix. He admonished people to stand up and speak clearly. "We can use this technique called standing," he said. He prodded others to stop and collect their thoughts.
"He is by far one of the most masterful teachers of young people I have ever seen," said Geoffrey Canada, head of the New York-based Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families. "He is a great mimic. He uses their own language in terms of the most hip words. He makes connections with young people.
"He is also caring," Mr. Canada added. "I sometimes stop to see him at 10:30 at night and he is there in the cathedral and I have to drag him out to get a bite to eat. I know of no time a young person cannot call John."
Waayl Shahid, 22, the director of leadership training, recalled that when he came to the Valley eight years ago, he was on the verge of dropping out of high school. "Just being involved and being around other people doing it in school, who found different ways, it just motivates you," Mr. Shahid said. "I wanted to emulate John. John is a very eloquent speaker. He can come across as very preachy if he wants to, but he can also come across as humorous."
Mr. Bess relishes the task. He grew up in a Harlem tenement and was active in community work as a student at Rice, a Catholic high school in Harlem. His mother was a homemaker and his father a photographer who worked with James Van DerZee, famous for his dreamy, stylized pictures of blacks.
It was a time when the country was taking a chance on poor kids, and so Mr. Bess was whisked off to Columbia University in Morningside Heights. Just a short distance away from home, it nevertheless belonged to that other world he had glimpsed as a boy when he rode the trains with his mother. His father died when he was 5 years old.
While a freshman, his girlfriend became pregnant with his son, Khalil, who still lives with him and is an engineering student. Khalil's mother wanted to be a physician and had years of rigorous preparation ahead, so Mr. Bess became Khalil's primary caretaker, though his mother remained part of his life. Mr. Bess eventually married another woman, but she died two years ago.
It was the experience of early fatherhood, combined with the zest to change the way things are, that led Mr. Bess to a number of jobs working with young people and finally to founding the Valley. In 1979, when the cathedral was completing two towers, Mr. Bess convinced the people there that they had a bigger mission than architecture -- helping the struggling community. The cathedral gave him space and money, though it is no longer a financial supporter. (Today, the Valley's 60 full-time and 30 part-time employees operate on a $5 million budget financed by individual donors, corporations, foundations and the Government.)
"It was a hunger to see young people fed in terms of what they needed" Mr. Bess said about founding the Valley. "It was something I had a calling to do."

HEADLINE: Hotels in West 30's Recover Their Aplomb

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
THE tourist was succinct: "It's good. It's simple." Hege Flatas of Trondheim, Norway, offered this judgment on a $65-a-night room she chose at the Wolcott Hotel on West 31st Street early this month for her four-day visit to New York City. She shared the room with her traveling companion and fellow-Trondheimite, Lill Schumann.
The two 23-year-olds had spent a year working at Disneyworld in Orlando, Fla. Then they went on a one-month travel spree, ending in New York for sightseeing and theater. They used a tourist pamphlet at Penn Station to pick a hotel. 
 They wanted a low rate and a central location. They wanted cleanliness, a private bath and personal security. Handsome appointments were unimportant and so was space. They didn't care about room service or bellmen. They didn't need a bar or restaurant within the hotel. They just wanted a place to sleep.
The fact that they and other budget-minded travelers have been finding satisfaction in the West 30's lately is in good measure a commentary on the resurgence of the area since the city relocated the homeless families that were given emergency housing there in the 80's. Overoccupancy in small rooms ill-fitted for family use, plus inadequate supervision, damaged the area as destination for leisure and business travelers.
The business travelers are typically foreign buyers, often from South America, who shop the district's import-export outlets for stock to ship back home.
The principal tourist hotels are the Roger Williams, the Herald Square, the Stanford, the Wolcott and the Grand Union, all of them offering modest rooms for under $100 a night.
There is also a new hotel, the Gershwin. It is at 7 East 27th Street, in a building that formerly formed the rear portion of the Hotel Latham at 4 East 28th Street. A group led by Urs B. Jakob, a Californian who got his start offering bunk beds in a former rooming house in Venice, Calif., to visitors to the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984, is gradually converting it to a dormitory-style hostelry. Sixty-five of the 164 rooms are run as dormitories, usually with four beds to a room. The charge is $17 a bed per night.
Elsewhere the plans are more ambitious. Anthony J. Rotonde, director of development for the Orient Hotel Group, a Hong Kong company whose American operations are based in Stamford, Conn., said the group had undertaken a $25 million redevelopment of the 500-room Prince George Hotel, at 10 East 28th Street, vacant after a period of heavy occupancy by homeless families.
The 5,000-square-foot ground floor of an office condominium at 72 Madison Avenue is being purchased for reconstruction as the main entrance. Average room rates are projected at $90 to $100 a night. The project is scheduled for completion in October, Mr. Rotonde said.
The Orient Hotel Group is also the owner of the 600-room Inn on West 57th Street, a former Days Inn at 454 West 57th Street.
But the long-anticipated redevelopment of the 600-room Martinique Hotel, which also had a heavy occupancy of homeless families in the 80's, is reported to have stalled. A lessee who started a reconstruction inside the closed building halted the work because of costs, hotel sources say, and now is in litigation with the owner. The Martinique is on the northeast blockfront of Broadway between 32d and 33d Streets.
Nevertheless, one way or another the hotels of the 30's are gradually moving to strengthen their ability to compete with the rising number of economy-class rooms elsewhere in Manhattan.
IN the general decline of room rates since the late 80's, a number of larger medium-priced hotels have cut quoted rates below $100 for some rooms. That also helps to lower taxes. Rooms that rent for more than $100 pay a 5 percent "luxury" tax imposed by New York State in 1990.
As for occupancy, the over-all picture improved in the city last year. Smith Travel Research, based in Gallatin, Tenn., reported that occupancy rose to 69.4 percent last year from 66.6 percent in 1992. It was a 4.2 percent increase, compared with a 2.9 percent increase nationally.
The firm's New York figures are based on a room count developed by InterBank Brener Hospitality Consultants, of Manhattan. These show a total of 58,300 hotel rooms in New York City in 1993, down from 61,900 in 1992. The temporary closing of the New York Vista Hotel after the World Trade Center explosion in February 1993 alone accounted for the loss of 820 rooms.
Average room rates in the city fell in 1993 to $114.86 from $115.23 in 1992, and $117.80 in 1991, according to Smith Travel Research. These are averages of the actual rates charged rather than the "rack" rate quoted to the individual traveler.
Average rates -- based on actual charges, which include lower rates given to tours and other group travelers -- do not include taxes. When taxes are added in, the prices paid by travelers make New York "the most expensive market in the country," said Randy Smith, president of Smith Travel Research.
The true budget hotels are those that have rack rates under $100 for all or nearly all their rooms. Occasionally, under new ownership, a rundown property is ambitiously overhauled as a budget facility. An example is the Ameritania Hotel, formerly the Bryant, at Broadway and 54th Street.
In some cases new owners are trying to bring back properties after a failed renovation in the 80's. In the budget category, the Woodward, at Broadway and 55th Street, now the Best Western Woodward, is an example.
Some of the lower-priced midlevel hotels that also offer budget rooms are the Wellington, the Edison, the Pennsylvania, the President and Milford Plaza. InterBank Brener defines midlevel as hotels with average rates between $100 and $200. The firm also has a definition for "luxury" hotels (average rates between $200 and $300) and "superluxury" hotels (average rates over $300).
But last year the decline in rates made these thresholds somewhat obsolete. The Waldorf-Astoria had average rates below $200 a room in 1993 and the Plaza Athenee, the Pierre and the Lowell all slipped below the $300-a-night threshold, said Stephen W. Brener, the chief executive of InterBank Brener. He says he now defines luxury hotels as those with average rates of $150 to $250, and superluxury hotels at $250 and above.
All the city's hotels are looking forward to a summer demand stimulated by the presence of the World Cup soccer matches in the United States from June 17 to July 17. The New Jersey Meadowlands is one of the nine locations in the country where matches will be played.
Already travel agencies from abroad are booking blocs of rooms for groups. One agent, Yvonne Cronin, 27, of Shandon Travel in Cork,Ireland, was encountered a few days ago at the Wolcott during her one-day inspection trip on behalf of a group of 50 soccer fans from Cork seeking budget rooms.
"Some rooms in more expensive hotels are not much better than these," Ms. Cronin said. "But you pay for decor and bar facilities that many people don't need." The visitors will pay $80 to $90 a night for the rooms, she said.
THE resurgence of the 30's as a destination for travelers seeking economy lodging is the latest chapter in the ever-changing commercial life of the area. In the early part of the century the East and West 20's and 30's were the center of the city's luxury hotels.
But luxury had long since marched uptown by the time the Department of Social Services, in the mid-80's, flashed the opportunity for extraordinary short-term financial rewards if the hotels agreed to fill vacancies with homeless families. No one believed the hotels were suited to the purpose, even for temporary family occupancy.
Eventually the city implemented a plan to vacate transient hotels and armories that were used for the homeless. The Martinique and the Prince George in particular were left with a need for major reinvestment before they could become successful commercial hotels again. But other properties accepted few if any homeless families and seem now to be benefiting from their low-cost operation and their central location.
At the 120-room Herald Square, Abraham Puchall, a partner in the ownership group, said the hotel has been the beneficiary of demand for hotel space in the neighborhood by Latin American buyers, who represent about 25 percent of the occupancy. Many of them come to purchase costume jewelry at nearby outlets like Metro Charles and Bay Sales, Mr. Puchall said.
The Herald Square, like many other budget hotels, upgrades itself gradually, as revenue permits. It has essentially three tiers of prices -- $40 a night for rooms that share bathrooms with another room; $90 for recently upgraded rooms; and $60 for midlevel rooms with private baths. The hotel was built in 1893 as the original home of Life magazine. The Puchall family bought it in the 60's.
The 280-room Wolcott Hotel, at 4 West 31st Street, was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by John H. Duncan, who was also the architect of Grant's Tomb, and leased by its developer, William C. Dewey, to James H. Breslin, a leading hotel operator of the day.
The lobby is decorated in the Louis XVI style, with marble pillars, mirrored panels and a lofty, ornate ceiling from which an elaborate chandelier hangs. But the lobby ends abruptly with a modest check-in desk, which shuts off what was formerly an equally elaborate ballroom.
The ballroom has been leased out to a restaurateur who runs it as The Five Spot. Other commercial space once part of the hotel also has been leased out.
SCOTT ERLICH, the manager for the last five years, said business had improved at a rate of 5 percent a year since he took over. Many of his guests find out about the hotel through travel publications in Europe. "Right now occupancy is 53 percent, but April to November is the high season," he said. "We have close to 90 or 100 percent on certain days."
The nonseasonal travelers include buyers like Alejandro Valderrama of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. He loads up on perfumes, watches, sports accessories and other consumer items at wholesale establishments in the West 30's, and has them repackaged for shipment back home. "On this trip I was here from Monday to Thursday and I bought 4,000 bottles of perfume and 300 watches from Korea," said Mr. Valderrama.
The repackaging and shipping has itself become an important business in the West 30's. A travel agency specializing in Latin America, Edward Travel, has established a freight-forwarding operation, E. D. Travel & Transportation Inc., in ground-floor space leased from the Wolcott Hotel. It does packaging and shipping for buyers so they don't have to clutter hotel lobbies and rooms with their purchases.
Alexander Duran, senior vice president, said the company moves over two million pounds of goods a year. "With the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Mexicans will be coming to buy without the 13- to 14 percent duty," he said.
Four blocks away, at 7 East 27th Street, is Mr. Jakob's hostel-style Gershwin Hotel. Pop-art sculpture has been installed in its lobby and small lounges have been created to help young international travelers get to know each other. There are private rooms, with single or double occupancy, renting for $70 a night.
"I came to New York with a mission to find a facility where I could service international travelers, beginning with young European, Canadians, New Zealanders and Japanese," said Mr. Jakob.
His first venture was at the 1,000-room Hotel Carter at 250 West 43d Street. He leased two high floors for his youthful worldwide clientele. Later he found the 27th Street property with the help of Jeffrey Wilder, a broker, who is now a partner.
"We are a social facility," he said. "People don't stay here just because it's cheap."
The typical room in an older Manhattan hotel operated at the budget level is about 15 by 15 feet, or 10 by 15 feet -- sometimes 15 by 20 feet. There are usually one or two 4- by 6-foot double beds, rather than the queen- or king-sized beds found in more recently built, larger hotel rooms.
There is a small and simple private bath with a shower, a small closet, a bureau, a color television set and a wall air-conditioner, and not much more. The halls may or may not be carpeted, and are not too bright. The probability is that if the hotel is genuinely seeking out business with tourist or leisure travelers it will either be in upgraded condition or in the process of upgrading.
AT the 96-room Newtown at 2528 Broadway, near 94th Street, a $2 million upgrading was done in the last year and a half after the hotel was purchased empty by an operating group led by Glenn Isaacs. Rack rates are $55 a night for a single and $65 for a double. Mr. Isaacs, who is responsible also for marketing rooms at two other economy-class hotels, the Travel Inn at 515 West 42d Street and the Hotel Belvedere at 319 West 48th Street, said that young German travelers were 40 percent of his business. "Give them a backpack and a clean room with a sink and friendly service and they are happy travelers," he said. "They don't need amenities or large rooms or concierges. They are self-confident travelers."
The 12-floor, 250-room Ameritania, at Broadway and 54th Street, was developed by Hank Freid, who also transformed the Broadway Arms Hotel, at Broadway and 103d Street, into the Malibu Studios in 1985.
MR. FREID said he had invested $5 million in the Ameritania project after purchasing a 49-year leasehold at a favorable price in 1990. There is a new lobby with granite walls and darkly lit modernistic decor, and new carpeting and new furnishings and decor throughout. Rooms rent for $89 to $99 a night.
"The Japanese business has fizzled quite a bit," Mr. Freid said. "The Italians are down 40 percent. We're making a push to get known domestically."
Twenty-one unfranchised budget hotels in the city utilize the reservation and representation system of Utell International, based in Omaha, a division of the Reed Travel Group. David Chestler, director of the mid-Atlantic region, estimated that there were 10,000 "quality" budget rooms in Manhattan.
"Twenty percent of them show up on no maps, and they don't advertise," he said.
Convention business in New York City is not directly the key to high occupancy in budget hotels, but a lack of it increases the supply of lower-cost rooms in standard hotels, undercutting the budget business. Hotel people say the city is hurt in the competition for convention business by the extraordinary state and city taxes on room rents.
First, there is an 8 1/4 percent sales tax. On top of that the city added a 5 percent tax in 1986 and an additional 1 percent tax in 1990. In 1990 the state imposed a 5 percent tax on rooms renting for more than $100 a night.
Thus a room renting for $100 or more has a basic 19 1/4 percent tax -- 8 1/4 percent plus 6 percent plus 5 percent. In addition, there is a flat New York City tax of $2 a room if the basic charge is more than $50 a night.
So the traveler renting one room for $150, for example, will pay a $30.87 tax for a total bill of $180.87. A room renting for $99, which is free of the 5 percent state tax, will cost $116.11 -- 14 1/4 percent plus the $2 room tax. Both Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have proposed reductions in the hotel taxes.
Taxes were not on the minds of the young budget travelers encountered at the Wolcott, however. Safety and prices were. "The hotel was recommended as cheap in the guide I used," said Michael Bray, 34, of Belfast, who was traveling with his younger sister and staying in a room that he said cost $59 a night. "Not knowing New York, I was nervous at first. But we've walked all over Manhattan."

HEADLINE: South Hackensack Journal;
County's Takeover of Police Department Angers Residents

BYLINE: By TOM TOOLEN 

DATELINE: SOUTH HACKENSACK

 BODY:
THIS tiny town so closely knit that parents know not only the whereabouts of their own children, but also those of their neighbors' children most of the time -- remains in a state of shock over the Bergen County takeover of its Police Department after charges of widespread ticket fixing, favoritism and illegal gambling by police officers.
John J. Fahy, the Bergen County Prosecutor, took over the 17-member Police Department Jan. 31. The Police Chief, Arthur Montenegro Jr., 44, resigned along with three of his officers. One officer, Anthony Giaquinto, 29, is charged with illegal gambling. In addition, a South Hackensack Councilman, Lucien Zeppone, is accused of running a gambling operation in his bar. 
 Instead of being outraged that their police officers might be acting illegally, however, many of the 2,100 residents of this one-square-mile borough are squarely backing the former Police Chief and the officials.
Many of those residents say that everyone makes bets sometimes -- so what's the big deal? Even the accusation that Chief Montenegro squelched a cocaine arrest in 1993 as a favor to a friend of a South Hackensack municipal employee didn't disturb many people interviewed here. "It was only a small amount of drugs, and he was doing a favor for someone," said one resident who insisted on anonymity.
Many here also back Officer Giaquinto, who was charged with official misconduct, conspiracy to promote gambling and promoting gambling. Office Giaquinto is accused of dropping bets off at two New York City betting parlors, both of which have Mafia connections Mr. Fahy said. The two other police officers who resigned were not charged criminally, but they had admitted placing bets with Mr. Giaquinto. Police officials raid a bar owned by Officer Giaquinto's parents because of suspected illegal gambling there.
Mr. Fahy contended Councilman Zeppone with maintaining a gambling operation at his saloon, the Stats Sports Bar, on Super Bowl Sunday. Mr. Zeppone has remained on the Council. All the defendants were released on their own recognizance and are awaiting hearings.
William Scheeler, 57, who lives on Phillips Avenue, said that he didn't know about the charges against the Chief and the others, but that he thought "the welfare hotel on Route 46 is the real problem in this town, not the gambling."
Mr. Scheeler, an unemployed sheetmetal worker who was shoveling snow in front of his well-kept house the other day, said that instead of worrying about gambling, the Bergen County Prosecutor ought to worry about cleaning out the crime and drugs going on at the hotel. "In the summer, we are outside and we have to watch all these criminal types walking up and down the front of our house," he said. It's a disgrace."
Mr. Fahy placed one of his lieutenants, Alan Grieco, as acting chief the Police Department, saying there was strong evidence that a rash of ticket-fixing and other favors were going on right in police headquarters.
Most of the incidents, Mr. Fahy said, involved fixing tickets or reducing charges for motor vehicle violations, minor drug offenses and driving while intoxicated cases.
"We believe it was happening for quite a few people for quite a long time and these people were either residents or had friends in the Police Department," Mr. Fahy said.
In taking a stand against the county takeover, many residents called Mr. Fahy's actions unfair and said he giving the town a bad name.
"South Hackensack is a good family town and they are making us out to be some sort of gangsters or something just because people bet on football games," said Arlene Spano, 37, who has lived in town for a year.
The only resident interviewed who said anything bad about the Police Chief or the others would not give his name. After some mildly disparaging comments about "big shots" and "things getting out of hand," a reporter asked for his name. "What do you think, I'm crazy?" the man replied.
This togetherness code in South Hackensack has a lot to do with the small size of the town. It may be the only municipality in the state to consist of three sections that are divided and separated by other towns -- Little Ferry, Hackensack and Teterboro.
Most of the residents, living in tidy, Colonial houses with postage-stamp lawns, live in the section north of Route 46, a busy east-west highway lined with car dealerships, welfare hotels and go-go bars. The second piece lies about a mile south on the other side of the borough and is set apart by Little Ferry. The third section is a tiny square housing factories and discount market. It is west of the police headquarters on Phillips Avenue, one of the two main streets of the town.
Ms. Spano said that most of the residents of South Hackensack feel the same way, and that a rally in support of the former Chief and the others was being organized. "We expect hundreds of people to attend," she said, adding that most people feel that betting on the Super Bowl is not such a serious crime.
As for the charges that the former Chief had charges dismissed on drugs, many residents also feel that this is no cause for alarm. At Tony D'Ambrosio's barber shop on Huyler Street, the main street in South Hackensack, Mr. D'Ambrosio, 72, a barber in town for 42 years, said Mr. Montenegro was "just a nice guy who was doing a favor for somebody."
Wouldn't you help a friend who was in need if he asked you to?" he said. The barber shop is directly across the street from Stats Sports Bar, in the hub of the town. Stats has more than 20 television sets, flashing lights, loud music and nonstop go-go girls. A patron in the bar the other day said the town was getting a bad name "for no good reason at all."
"It's a shame, all this over some two-bit charges," he said.
There isn't much of a town center, Huyler Street and Phillips Avenue being pretty much the main streets. But the merchants on those streets all feel that the town got a bad name from the county takeover.
"We will send a message that we are good people here and we are not some sort of Mafia-dominated town like they are saying," said one resident. As South Hackensack maintains its way of life the best way it can, the residents can see the spire on the courthouse and the county seat of Hackensack a short distance away. Many see Hackensack as the enemy. "That's where Fahy is, and he is the enemy," said one resident, staring at the courthouse dome.
 In addition, the map with the article was incomplete. It showed only the main section of South Hackensack.

HEADLINE: HERS;
Where Mothers Matter

BYLINE: By Gabrielle Glaser; Gabrielle Glaser reported from Eastern Europe for
The Times and The Economist.

 BODY:
It was a muggy Washington day, and my daughter and I were in the midst of our daily rounds: the bank, the dry cleaners, the Italian deli. She drifted off to sleep, and I wheeled the stroller into a crowded cafe for an iced tea. Finally, I could read my newspaper.
 The only empty chair was opposite another woman, young and red-haired, absently guarding a dozing infant. Would she mind if I sat with her, I asked. She gestured to the table, patting the seat beside her. We chatted; she seemed, as I often am during the day, eager for adult conversation. My daughter woke, and I leaned over to stroke her plump cheek. Finished with my tea, I kissed her neck to elicit a stream of giggles as we prepared to go. Curious, the woman mused: "She really likes you." 
I should hope so," I answered.
 "Have you been with her long?"
 Puzzled, I said: "Since birth."
 "Oh," she said, embarrassment flickering on her face. "You're her mother." Pause. "I only meet other nannies."
 Having lived in Washington before, I had steeled myself on my return for the verities of this city: that what you do is much more important than who you are; your job matters as much here as style in New York or looks in Los Angeles. Still, I was startled. I knew that Washington, with the highest percentage of dual-income couples in the country, was an exceptional place. But was I really the only woman inside the Beltway who wasn't back to work after a few weeks of maternity leave?
 My daughter was born in 1992, just before we returned to the United States after three years as journalists in Poland. Since my husband's new job here began almost immediately, the task of finding and eventually renovating the house we bought fell to me. I could write from home when I wanted, and besides, I was looking forward to sharing those precious firsts of her new life: first steps, first swims, first words.
 Abroad, I'd had the job of a lifetime, covering Eastern Europe's struggle to redefine itself after nearly a half-century of Communism -- its rocky transition to a market economy, the resurgence of nationalism, a growing theocracy, a war. My work was fascinating. But to the people I lived among, quite simply, it was unimportant.
 For them, the most important fact about me seemed to be my reproductive life. After the cursory glance for a wedding band came the question: "Do you have children?"
 What really alienated me from Poles was my childlessness. As the gap between me and 30 narrowed, I was admonished by everyone from the greengrocer on the corner to my neighbor's gardener: "You Americans, you're crazy, waiting so long for life's real joy!" Others were more solicitous, inquiring into the delicate issue of "female problems." What else could explain such a predicament?
 To me, the sorry state of Polish womanhood was summed up by the maternity wards: anyone delivering her firstborn after the age of 25 was designated a stara matka -- an old mother.
 All this only reinforced my view of the Polish male attitude toward women: that beneath the courtliness and incessant hand-kissing, females were merely the vessel to the next generation. I idealized the United States, telling Polish women friends how lucky American women were, how respected we were, how we were treated as equals.
 So the reaction of my American friends to the news that I was pregnant, at 27, was as baffling as the Poles' insistence that every woman start her family at 22. "What were you using?" asked one friend, eyes wide. "What are you going to do about it?" asked another, as if I were in high school.
 Among Poles, however, the response was ecstatic. I was given flowers, jars of pickles and plenty of unsolicited advice. One friend, a father of four, became positively weepy when my husband and I broke the news.
 For two years, I had laughingly recounted tales of Polish "backwardness" in missives back home: the indolent service in stores that closed without warning in the middle of the day; food greasy enough to clog the healthiest of arteries, and, above all, the antiquated approach to women. But suddenly, I found myself appreciating Poland's charms -- at least in matters maternal.
 The Poles, even the Communists among them, seemed to have at least one thing right. Fifty-year-old laws, still on the books, grant a year or more of maternity leave. The many Polish doctors, professors and lawyers who are also mothers think nothing of taking off several years to be with their kids; indeed, it is expected. There is a Polish saying: You have a lifetime to work, but children are only young once.
 On a visit back home a few months later, I escaped the post-Communist malaise, only to find myself adrift in post-feminist America. Of my friends and colleagues here, I know just a handful of women with young children -- and only one who is home with her year-old son. Most of the women I know are waiting until their late 30's to have children; others feel great ambivalence toward motherhood altogether.
 My final return trip from Poland to the United States signaled, once again, just how out of step I would be with local views on maternity. Three hours into the flight from Warsaw, the Polish pilot strolled out into the aisle and made a beeline for my seat. "What a beautiful child, and so round," he said. "I hope you're still breast-feeding." (Such familiarity seems strange only in retrospect.) Before I could respond, I was surrounded by a crowd of Poles: mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles -- each chiming in with their opinion of nursing. What I had dreaded -- an endless flight with a tiny baby -- turned out to be quite pleasant. The grandmother behind me offered to hold my daughter every hour so I could stretch. The flight crew couldn't have been more attentive.
 So it was a rude surprise to land in Chicago en route to visit my family in Oregon. The on-ground assistance I'd requested from my American carrier, which I desperately needed to traverse O'Hare, was nowhere to be seen. Never mind, I thought, this is America; I'll manage fine. But even getting through immigration was tough. Customs, it turned out, had confiscated my stroller. Baby strapped to my chest, $20 bill clutched in my fist, I flagged down a skycap and, braving a blizzard, we took an outdoor shortcut. Finally, huffing and puffing, diaper bag and car seat dangling from both arms, I reached the gate and the two ticket takers barked at me to speed it up.
 Today, as I continue to be mistaken for my daughter's au pair, I find myself in a quintessentially Polish state of mind, wanting something that is in all likelihood unattainable. I long for a land that does not yet exist, a place where women are valued both for their intellects and their motherhood, and where the choices between career and nurturing are somehow less stark. I find myself feeling what the Poles call tesknota -- a sweet-sad nostalgia -- for an unliberated land in which I was for a time very pleased to be an old mother.

HEADLINE: A Conference Center Expands, Lovingly

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
SPECTACULARLY situated on 26 acres overlooking the Hudson River in Tarrytown, two splendid 19th-century mansions link past and present.
The large stone Gothic (the Biddle House) and a white columned Greek Revival (the King House) make up the nucleus of Tarrytown House, the first corporate conference center in the country and possibly still the most beautiful. This year, Tarrytown House is celebrating its 30th anniversary with a $3.5 million expansion of the Biddle mansion, which, when completed, will be equally suited to corporate functions during the week and social events on weekends.
 
Proceeding on Schedule
 "The interiors have been designed to make the transformation from a serious meeting space, with state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment, to a romantic ballroom seamless," said Frank X. Fisher, general partner of the Manhattan-based Fisher Hotels Group, which owns the conference center. "Despite the bitter weather, thankfully the project is on schedule. We are aiming for a late summer opening, and since we have already accepted bookings for Labor Day weekend -- a meeting for 110 and a wedding for 250 -- in the new wing, we had better be ready." 
 Expansion of the conference center, Mr. Fisher continued, will add 17,000 square feet of space to the Biddle mansion: a 5,500-square-foot room for banquets and meetings, a reception area of 1,800 square feet and a bridal suite on an upper level. In addition, the larger space is expected to create 40 new jobs.
 
Extensive Research Required
 "And it will give us much greater flexibility in the groups we can accommodate for both corporate and social events, which will be a boost for business," Mr. Fisher said. "What happens is that we frequently get requests for both from the same client. For example, a businessman who has participated in a conference here will come back as father of the bride, and the reverse is true, wedding guests translate into business clients. Now we will be able to offer banquet seating for 400, meeting space for 500 and space for receptions for up to 600 people. And with the new kitchen, we will be capable of preparing 750 dinners at one time."
Laurence M. Harman, the architect for the project, said that designing an addition to a historic property required extensive research of the period. "Tarrytown House has the distinction of being one of the historic hotels of America listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation for preserving its historic character and architectural quality," Mr. Harman said. "In our practice, we frequently work on landmark buildings, and on this project we have tried to protect the integrity of the building by retaining its residential feeling. I like to think Mrs. Biddle would approve of the addition."
This is the second major renovation Mr. Fisher has overseen since the conference center was acquired by his group of investors from Robert Schwartz in December 1986.
 
Paying for a 'Labor of Love'
 "Bob Schwartz was the founder of the conference center concept, and we were bowled over by the beauty of the place when we bought it," Mr. Fisher said. "Nevertheless, shortly afterward we spent $7 million on restoring the mansions to their former glory and completely re-doing all the furnishings in our 150 guest rooms and 30 meeting rooms."
Restoring the King House alone, Mr. Fisher said, called for an outlay of more than $1 million.
"And what a job it was!" he said. "A labor of love. In the library, for instance, we uncovered beautiful wooden paneling that had been brought over from one of the great estates in England. It had been covered by layers and layers of paint for over 100 years. And the carved marble fireplaces in many of the rooms had suffered the same fate. The craftsmen working on the house never knew what they were going to find, but eventually they meticulously restored all the fireplaces and wooden carvings."
Mr. Fisher continued: "King House is really a gem. There are 10 guest rooms, each of them individually decorated in the original period, some with private balconies. The house has its own kitchen and five other rooms that lend themselves to meetings for groups of 10 to 18 or for banquets for up to 100. The house is completely private and self-contained, making it suitable for a wedding with accommodations for out-of-town guests or for a high-level, very private business conference."
 
More-Competitive 90's
 Despite the recession, conferences still play a vital role in the way business is conducted.
"It's more competitive in the 90's, but Fortune 500 companies and global companies still have to meet," Mr. Fisher said. "Most of our business comes from past clients and corporate word-of-mouth recommendations. In the 80's, planners booked conferences a year in advance, but now the lead time is shorter -- about three to six months down the road. And the principal players are different. In the 80's computer companies and pharmaceuticals dominated; now it's Wall Street firms and banks who are holding most of the meetings."
Changes in management and marketing, he added, have helped produce a rise of 15 percent in business each year for the last several years.
"The net result is that we have been able to fund the addition from cash flow," he said. "And we have just named James David Ball as general manager, so we are even more optimistic about increasing business. Mr. Ball is an experienced conference center manager who is coming to us from Woodlands, in Texas."
Most meetings are held during the week, Mondays through Thursdays, and last two or three days in one or more of 30 rooms suitable for groups of 10 to 150 participants. Conference planners are assigned to every group and a conference business service desk handles administrative details.
Francine Harris, acting director of sales, said that a complete meeting package, priced at $350 a person, includes breakfast and lunch and buffets, sit-down dinners, frequent coffee breaks and recreational activities. "We have a fully equipped sports center with tennis, indoor and outdoor pools, racquetball, bowling and billiards with a physical fitness instructor on staff," she added.
 
'Magic Mountain Feeling'
 The ratio of staff -- 180 -- to guests, she said, is very high. "One-on-one service is available 24 hours a day," she said. "Snacks are unlimited, and clients tell us frequently that they would come back for the food alone. We are known for the excellence of our kitchen, which is under the direction of our executive chef, Peter Calchera, who has been here for over 20 years."
Although companies from all over the globe come to Tarrytown House to hold meetings, Mr. Fisher said, a surprisingly large number also come from New York City.
"I think it is because there is a magic mountain feeling about the place, and it's free from distractions," he said. "That makes for a very productive meeting. Sometimes it's hard to believe that we are only 24 miles away from mid-Manhattan."

HEADLINE: New Job: Selling Pizza

BYLINE: By JUDY POKRAS

DATELINE: EAST HANOVER

 BODY:
UNABLE to find work when they were laid off two years ago, Ann Marie Carragher, an architect, became a nanny, and Oscar Aguilar, an electrical engineer, took a job delivering pizza.
One year later, last September, with a loan from her parents, Ms. Carragher and Mr. Aguilar bought the pizza shop where he had been employed. Now the couple, who became engaged on Christmas Eve, work 12 hours a day, seven days a week in their growing takeout business, the Gourmet Pizza Shoppe at 7 Ronald Drive. 
 "We didn't know the business," Ms. Carragher, 28, said. "My parents decided to lend us the money because it would take a few years till the construction industry turns around."
When she lost her architectural job at a Manhattan company, she tried freelancing, but couldn't find architectural work. When her unemployment ran out, she found a job in Denville caring for a little girl "and tidying up the house." She missed architecture, she said, but "you've got to do what you've got to do, you know?"
 
'Honest, Clean Living'
 She said the pizza shop "is an honest, clean living."
"I didn't want to be part of politics," Ms. Carragher said. "In this little pizzeria, I do my work. You've done your job and then go home."
Mr. Aguilar, 29, said he missed engineering, but wouldn't want to go back to an office.
"I feel a lot of freedom here," he said about the pizza shop. "I'm here all day, but being that it's our business, you feel better about it."
The couple learned the ropes from the shop's previous owner in three weeks. They barely had time to get up to speed when, three weeks after they took over the business, they were deluged with orders, like a $350 order to be delivered within an hour.
That was when a steady customer, Image Construction Studio, expanded by 11,000 square feet, making for a lot more catering business, Ms. Carragher said. "It was a godsend," she said.
Having expanded, Image Construction Studio, a rental stage for film and video production, sometimes needs food for as many as 50 people at a time, said Bill Kempner, an owner of the studio. He said the Gourmet Pizza Shoppe provides generous portions that "Ann Marie sets up herself."
"The clients just rave about their food,." Mr. Kempner said
 
Menu Offers Pizza Soup
 Besides such items as pizza -- available with pepperoni and extra cheese -- and an assortment of entrees,the menu features pizza soup. A local police officer who buys one soup or another from the shop every night has asked the couple if they would make their soups available commercially, Ms. Carragher said.
Mr. Aguilar said they have been trying new products and "taking the time to make things right."
The couple recently experimented with closing the store on Sundays, but not to have a day to relax. They needed a day in the store without orders to make preparations for the rest of the week.
"The pace that you're under is just . . . it keeps us busy," Ms. Carragher said. "It's great to be busy. We'd be in a lot of trouble if we weren't."
A visitor to the shop remarked that the two must get along well with each other, as they spend all their time together in an often high-stress atmosphere.
"Thank God for small favors," Ms. Carragher said.
Mr. Aguilar said, "We really do."
Ms. Carragher added: "When it gets busy, he's really calm. I get stressed out."
 
He Makes the Pizzas
 Ms. Carragher prepares the non-pizza items while Mr. Aguilar makes the pizzas. Cooking is a job that he enjoys. "I always cooked," he said. "Since I was a kid. My dream was to have a restaurant. My mother taught me how to cook."
But now, any chance they get, they go out to eat, mainly Mexican food. "I don't even look at Italian anymore," Ms. Carragher said.
Home is Madison. Ms. Carragher said she missed Manhattan, where she lived previously, and where she had been working on a master's degree in real estate, before her fiance "dragged me out here, kicking and screaming," she said with a smile.
What she misses most now is her inability to catch up on her reading. Before the couple left New York, they took advantage of the culture. "We went to seven operas, Carnegie Hall, Radio City, museums," Ms. Carragher said. "In this world, nothing's forever. You have to hit it when you can."
The couple's dream is to open a vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco.
"Before we bought this, we were going to become vegetarians," Ms. Carragher said. "We were trying to be vegetarian, but with this kind of business, it's difficult."

HEADLINE: Jewish Emigres With High Hopes

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
RITA and Yuri Shneider left behind their professions, their homeland and an extended family when they and their two sons boarded a flight to Kennedy International Airport in 1991. On the pretext of taking a vacation, the four Jews from the former Soviet Union disembarked in New York City with only their suitcases and a few photographs from their past to begin the new life they had secretly planned for years.
"For the children, we did this for them," said the 35-year-old mother, who was a doctor in a small town near Riga in Latvia. "We said we were coming only to visit, but really we never planned to go home." 
 Emblematic of their dreams, there are now seven trophies displayed on top of the television in the family's tiny living room here. The awards belong to 9-year-old Dimitri, their oldest son, who recently won a series of regional chess championships.
Dr. Shneider, the mother, smiled and said: "You see, it says: 'Dimitri Shneider: First Place.' Anything is possible here."
The Shneiders are one of about 75 Jewish families from the former Soviet Union who have arrived in Westchester recently, said Dr. Gene Sosin and Gloria Donen Sosin, who have written a guide for newcomers in Russian and English called "Welcome to Westchester."
These families are part of a new wave of immigrants resettling in the United States to escape growing anti-Semitism and a difficult economy in the former Soviet republics. The recent immigration figures, 32,204 Jews from the former Soviet Union last year, are higher even than during the late 1970's -- before the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, when large numbers of refugees fled for political reasons.
Robin A. Grenell, chairman of the Russian services committee of the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center in the Bronx, a resettlement center, said, "These new people are not like Anatoly Scharansky," referring to the former Soviet dissident and human rights champion who immigrated to Israel in 1986. "The current group of immigrants needs to eat. They are not refugees of conscience. They come here to get ahead."
The new nationalism in the former Soviet republics worked against many like the Shneiders, who grew up in Ukraine and later moved to Latvia to work and raise a family. Mr. Shneider, 37, a chief engineer of repairs for a Baltic rail system in Latvia, was dismissed from his position shortly after the country's independence, and his job was given to a native Latvian.
Dr. Shneider said she, too, had expected to lose her job at the clinic where she was a doctor of sports medicine. "We became like extra people for them," she said. "Although we did not like Communism, things were more stable for us then."
Also, the intensifying nationalism, combined with economic instability in the former republics, said Dr. Misha Galperin, associate executive vice president for the New York Association for New Americans, "has unleashed a new wave of anti-Semitism among individuals and fringe groups that is not untypical in times of economic difficulty."
He added, "Traditionally, Jews have been singled out for blame in such circumstances." The association is one of the largest refugee-resettlement organizations in the country.
Many Jewish refugees live in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, where resettlement groups help them learn English, adjust to a new culture and find jobs. But Norman Levine, director of field service for the international Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, said there was no way to determine the number of refugees living in the New York City area, and the Census Bureau said it does not keep figures based on religion.
 
No Close Relatives in the U.S.
 Ms. Grenell, however, estimated that there were 7,500 Jewish refugees living in the Bronx, and she said the figures for Brooklyn and Queens were substantially higher. Some unofficial estimates place the number of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union in New York City at 65,000 and the number for the entire New York City area at 150,000.
Jewish refugees living outside metropolitan areas have little access to services provided by resettlement organizations, and Ms. Grenell said: "In a real sense, they have to hit the ground running. They tend to go it alone in areas like Westchester, where there is little sense of a Russian Jewish community."
Although most Jews from the former Soviet Union begin the emigration procedure formally through the American Embassy in Moscow, the Shneiders used their visitors' visas to leave, because they had no close relatives in the United States as required for refugee status (cousins are not considered immediate family members). Since arriving, they have applied for green cards, which will allow them to continue living and working here. But they are also officially seeking political asylum so they can obtain permanent-residency status.
 
Temporary Working Papers
 A green card is an indication of legal permanent residency. An immigrant can apply for the card after one year of residency in this country. Immigrants like the Shneiders, who came on visitors' visas, must first obtain political asylum status before becoming eligible for a green card. The Shneiders have temporary working papers while they wait for a ruling on their application for political asylum.
The Shneiders settled in this riverfront village -- a suburban community of 10,000 people, which they said reminds them of home -- to be close to cousins who live here. Also, because they immigrated with visitors' visas, they did not work through established immigration channels, which might have encouraged them to find housing and jobs in New York City.
"Families that settle in the county tend to be risk takers," said Dr. Howard Rubin, director of the Westchester Jewish Conference, an umbrella organization representing 86 synagogues or other organizations. "But being in a place like this also tends to accelerate their assimilation, because they aren't speaking Russian 24 hours a day as they might in Brighton Beach."
Dr. Rubin said that "even though there is no center for emigres here, for the most part, Russian Jews in Westchester are faring well."
Initially, Dr. Shneider worked as a baby sitter and house cleaner, but she is now employed by the physical-therapy department of Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. She is also studying for a degree in physical therapy at Mercy College and is taking an English-as-a-second-language course there as well.
 
A Son in Ukraine
 Mr. Shneider works for All Makes Heating and Air Conditioning in Eastchester and is taking technical courses offered by the Board of Cooperative Education Services so that he can advance in his job.
Their sons, Igor, 6, and Dimitri, attend Hillside Elementary School. Polina Shneider, Mr. Shneider's mother who lived in Israel, has since joined the family here, and she is responsible for most of the cooking and child care while the parents work and study.
In Dobbs Ferry, Vera Fedorovskya, 47, also immigrated to the United States on a visitors' visa, although she had originally planned to return to Ukraine, where her 24-year-old son lives.
"It was a bad life for Jews there," said Ms. Fedorovskya, an accountant. "My eyes just opened when I came in 1990, and I did not want to go home."
She now works as a bookkeeper for Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry, where she has an apartment, and has applied through the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society for a green card. Although she said she is alone much of the time and worries about her son, she added that she is glad she lives in the United States.
 
Responsible for One Another
 In part, a local synagogue, the Greenburgh Hebrew Center in Dobbs Ferry, has provided a support network for the Shneiders and Ms. Fedorovskya.
"It gives the congregation a sense of fulfilling several commandments of the Jewish tradition," Rabbi Barry Kenter said. "There is an overarching concept that all Jews are responsible for one another."
Even though they have established themselves in homes and new jobs since arriving and have made new friends, the Shneiders and Ms. Fedorovskya -- like many Jewish refugees -- have experienced setbacks professionally since leaving their homeland. Dr. Shneider is not pursuing her career as a doctor because, she said, she cannot afford to take time out to study for American medical exams or for the required medical residency.
Mr. Shneider said he was grateful to find a job in a related technical field and was willing to retrain.
And Ms. Fedorovskya said that she, too, was happy to be supporting herself here, even though it meant starting over again in her field.
In terms of their backgrounds, adjustments to a new country and their aspirations for the future, Mr. and Mrs. Shneider and Ms. Fedorovskya are typical of many Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union, immigration specialists said.
As a group, these emigres tend to be technicians and professionals in white-collar jobs, with strong educational backgrounds -- computer programmers, engineers, nurses, doctors, bookkeepers and teachers, Dr. Galperin said. Some are entrepreneurs -- owners of food stores, nightclubs, taxi and limousine services -- and only a few rely on public assistance during the first year, he said.
He added that many emigres "experience a sense of loss at first."
But a follow-up study by the Council of Jewish Federations and the City University of New York showed that over a 10-year period most refugees from the former Soviet Union make up for their initial setbacks. Within a decade, the average family income for the emigres reached $34,000, compared with the $29,000 average for all American families, according to the 1990 study.

HEADLINE: There id No 'Middle East'

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan is a contributing editor of The Atlantic Monthly. His most recent books are "The Arabists: The Romance of an American Elite" and "Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History."

 BODY:
Last July, in the course of a briefing at a policy foundation in Washington, I asked a question about the effect of the Clinton Administration's Balkan policy on the Middle East. A high-ranking State Department area expert turned to me in derision, and said, in effect, that there was no connection. After an embarrassed silence the session resumed, concerned entirely with the inside baseball of the Arab-Israeli peace process. Indeed, the State Department has been trying -- without notable success -- to move the Balkans out of the President's "in" box to make room for the Middle East.
This is less a strategy than a dangerous bureaucratic convenience, for the false borders erected by area experts are fast being superseded by history. Middle East specialists today are like Sovietologists in the late 1980's -- on the brink of a rude upheaval they can't see coming. The reason, simply, is that Turkey, the Balkans and the so-called Middle East (and to lesser degrees the Caucasus nations and Central Asia) are re-emerging as one region -- what historically minded Europeans have always referred to as the greater "Near East." The former Ottoman Empire and even the former Byzantine world are fusing back together following the aberration of the cold war. The implications of this tectonic shift are, needless to say, enormous. 
 There are four reasons why we fail to conceive of Turkey and the Balkans (as well as the Caucasus and Central Asia) as part of the region that we have falsely labeled the "Middle East." First, Turkey's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has allowed it to be identified with Europe. Second, Communism imprisoned the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia in a historical black hole from 1945 to 1989. Third, the Arab-Israeli conflict -- institutionalized for decades partly on account of superpower competition -- permitted us to separate the Arab world from the rest of the region.
Fourth, and most interestingly, the global responsibilities thrust upon the United States after World War II led to the creation of area experts in government, academia and think tanks. Their effect on policy and public opinion has been to splinter and compartmentalize what used to be geographic wholes. The academic and policy-making nomenklatura invented a new world based not on real borders so much as on the borders of their knowledge, and lack thereof. As someone who has written extensively about Turkey and the Balkans, as well as the Middle East, I have seen how these areas constitute two entirely different subcultures of Washington society and wonkdom, with little or no cross-fertilization between the two.
These artificial divisions have warped the world view of Westerners and erased some historical truths from public consciousness. Turks led the House of Islam for almost 850 years, from the Seljuk conquest of Anatolia in 1071 to the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. Yet, as far as the West is concerned, Islam is predominantly Arab and synonomous with fundamentalism. Until the Iranian Revolution in 1978, even the 50 million Muslims of Persia were largely invisible to us -- just as 60 million Muslims in Turkey, and a greater number of Turkic-speaking Muslims in the Caucasus region and Central Asia, are still relatively invisible. While we in the West have gained acquaintance with Arab Islamic history and, since 1978, with some precepts of Shiite Islam in Iran, we know little of such things as the great Sufi tariqats (somewhat mystical sects, literally "fraternities"), which have defined Islamic identity in Turkey and the Balkans.
For example, if we knew a little more about Jalal ed-Din Rumi, the 13th-century Turkic founder of the tariqat that was associated with the whirling dervishes, Islam might not seem incompatible with democracy, and Islamic fundamentalism might not seem so monolithic and threatening.
Rumi dismissed "immature fanatics" who scorn music and poetry. He cautioned that a beard or a mustache on a cleric is no sign of wisdom. Rumi favored the individual over the crowd and consistently spoke against tyranny. Rumi's legacy is more applicable to democratizing tendencies in the Muslim world than are figures of the Arab and Iranian religious pantheons with whom the West is more familiar.
Indeed, the experience of Turkey, a huge Muslim nation bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, is rarely considered, even though Turkey's democratic system has incorporated orthodox Islamic elements for decades. Given Turkey's social and political dynamism (unlike those of many Arab states and Iran, its industry and middle class were not created out of thin air by oil revenues), its influence on contiguous countries will likely increase as nearby dictatorships slowly crumble.
While this might shock policy wonks, it won't surprise historians. In fact, through long stretches of history, movements in the northwestern part of the former Turkish Empire (the Balkans) have influenced and even determined events in the southwestern part of the former Turkish Empire (the Middle East). The national independence struggles of the 19th century in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece encouraged the rise of Arab nationalist societies in Damascus and Beirut. Similarly, modern terrorism was born in Macedonia and Bulgaria, before filtering into Greater Syria.
THE MURDER OF 12 BOSNIANS AND Croats, all of them Christians, by Muslim militants in Algeria last December went virtually unnoticed in America, but was a wake-up call to Europeans about the link between religious wars in the Balkans and those in the Middle East. That Muslims in Bosnia are secular and Westernized is irrelevant to what their suffering -- the razing of 800 mosques, not-to-mention their human losses -- may eventually symbolize for Muslims elsewhere.
It is no accident that the Balkans and the Arab world have accounted for a disproportionate share of the violent headlines of recent years. The Ottoman Empire took so long to die, its decrepitude burdens us still in the form of political underdevelopment among its formerly captive peoples; especially as Communism in the Balkans and the state of war with Israel -- providing, as it did, a basis for sterile military rule in places like Iraq and Syria -- arrested history for so long.
Turks have been something of an exception, since for so many centuries they were the rulers instead of the ruled. Thus, they lack the bitter complexes that afflict Balkan and Arab peoples. This and other factors -- like Rumi's tradition of tolerance and respect for the individual -- provide the backdrop for what, if only by regional standards, is a coherent national entity, already four decades into its experiment with democracy. Whatever further bloodshed Turkey faces over its continuing failure to compromise with the Kurdish minority there, its troubles pale beside the turbulence that has engulfed the former Yugoslavia and will surely engulf Arab states, especially Syria and Iraq.
For alas, there is a fifth reason why the "Middle East," particularly in Washington policy circles, is still seen in splendid isolation, separated from the rest of the region. It is this: While the cold war has ended in the Balkans, the Caucasus region and elsewhere, its effects still linger in Syria, Jordan and Iraq, where dictatorships of dubious legitimacy -- products of cold war military largesse, east-bloc security and torture technology and Arab-Israeli confrontation -- stagger on.
Have leaders like Hafez al-Assad, King Hussein and Saddam Hussein, merely by being in power so long, created national-communal organisms at least as well-rooted as, say, Turkey's?
In 1982, in Hama, where troops of the Alawite regime murdered more than 20,000 Sunni Arab civilians, we got a glimpse of just how little of a nation post-totalitarian Syria may turn out to be -- whether or not it gets back the Golan Heights. Given the preponderance of Palestinians in Jordan and the absurd degree to which that state's identity is tied to its ailing ruler, one can credibly wonder whether Jordan will even exist beyond the early 21st century. And Iraq? Well, the only questions there are how much blood will be spilled after Saddam departs and whether Iraq is going to break up into two pieces or three (Kurdistan and Arab Mesopotamia or Kurdistan, Sunni northern Mesopotamia and Shiite southern Mesopotamia).
Like Yugoslavia, all these Arab states were artificial creations of post-World War I peace treaties that represented the imperial powers' best attempt to impose order in the chaos that followed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The notion that these states -- little more than lines drawn on a map by Winston Churchill and others -- will have an uneventful transition to legitimizing-democratic rule is rather tenuous.
Even Turkey experienced three coups and (in the 1970's) veritable civil war in the course of a democratic experiment that the Arab world, for the most part, has yet to embark upon.
HISTORY, IN ITS ORIGINAL GREEK sense, implies a thematic narrative, as in a good novel (mythistorema in modern Greek). If history, then, is a narrative, the Arab-Israeli conflict, as an appendage of the cold war, has been a long and bloody footnote.
As that footnote concludes, we return to the main story, whose theme is not what new alliances will emerge, but which states from the post-World War I peace treaties will survive. With the Arab world about to rejoin the rest of the Near East, the Arabs will become less isolated from religious and political crosscurrents in neighboring, non-Arabic speaking nations. Thus, an expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans later in this decade might encourage an expulsion of indigenous Christian communities from Egypt and Syria.
Given what has happened in the Balkans and in the Caucasus states, it is naive not to expect redefining, even violent, turmoil in the Arab world.
In the future, historians may describe the struggle against Israel not as the bane of certain Arab states but as their very foundation. Patrick Seale, a specialist on Syria, ventured in 1986 that, " 'Greater Syria' is a sort of mirror image of 'Greater Israel' and its inevitable opponent. Both cannot win." Seale, who has always demonstrated more sympathy for Syria than for Israel, could turn out to be right in a way he would not want.
Whatever the territorial lines of any future peace treaty, Greater Israel will come into being as a regional economic magnet on the Mediterranean toward which the West Bank and Gaza will have to orient themselves. Syria and Jordan may, partly as a consequence, crumble under the weight of their sectarian contradictions and be reconfigured along different lines. We may someday look back upon the Arab-Israeli conflict as an almost romantic, sepia-toned chapter of the cold war in which calculations of morality and strategic advantage were relatively simple, just as they were in that other part of the Ottoman imperial domain, the Balkans, before history resumed.

INNOCENTS IN AFRICA
An American Family's Story.
By Drury Pifer.
Illustrated. 338 pp. New York:
Harcourt Brace & Company. $24.95. 
 IN 1932 Drury Pifer's parents, young, poor and ambitious, left the United States for the mines of South Africa because the country "promised an outside chance to marginal people." White, educated, English-speaking marginal people, that is.
They returned in 1945, when the author was 11 years old. During the intervening years this American family had been exposed to a strange colonial amalgam of privilege and austerity as Pifer Sr., a mining engineer, worked his way up within Sir Ernest Oppenheimer's awe-inspiring, ore-producing empire -- first in the gold mines of the Rand, then in the diamond mines in Oranjemund in the Namaqualand desert and finally in Kimberley.
From time to time Mr. Pifer, a playwright and former pilot, alludes to the adult brutalities of nationalism and economic disaster marching across the world in the course of his childhood. But "Innocents in Africa" is truly a child's-eye record of a small corner of that world -- unsophisticated and fascinating.
As Americans, the Pifers belonged to none of South Africa's tribes: African, British or Afrikaner. They were innocent, the title implies, in the sense of being naive, as well as guiltless of the tribal hatreds that have shaped and scarred South Africa. Yet soon enough the Pifers became part of South Africa's British white elite, their world circumscribed by tea parties, gossip, music, gardening and advancement in the hierarchy of mine management. In the case of Pifer Sr., this rise was less than meteoric.
Some of the author's memories are vivid and well wrought. His earliest years in Oranjemund consisted of a gritty existence on the edge of the continent, where the Atlantic gales whipped the desert sand as Afrikaner miners dug, fought and stole for Sir Ernest's diamonds. Other recollections are rather less intriguing, including the detailed accounts of the father's (ultimately unsuccessful) struggle for Sir Ernest's favor.
If this is a book about childhood and the wide-eyed wonder of an adult looking back at a child growing up in a strange land, it is as well -- almost in spite of itself and perhaps inevitably -- a book about race. Mr. Pifer's views on South Africa's grim racial divide are clear enough. He writes with hindsight, "I was conscious of the dislocation between their world and mine, but I accepted the disjunction without strain."
He claims also to "detect in that complacent small person the mental embryo of the skepticism that later formed me." This is thoroughly laudable, but the young Mr. Pifer, as recalled in maturity, appears not so much complacent as almost completely ignorant of the lives of black South Africans.
Certainly they are part of the picture, sitting under trees, dancing, singing or toiling in the mines. And they are in the procession of family servants, whom the author valiantly tries to depict as individuals, but who never quite attain personality. Here, Mr. Pifer's childhood memories accurately reflect the apartheid of South African society, the rigid barriers that operated at all levels long before they were enshrined in an ugly law described by an ugly Afrikaans word.
As the author emphasizes, his family was more enlightened than most. His father had advanced views on improving relations between white and black workers, and Mr. Pifer himself pours scorn on racists while mourning the passing of the Hottentots. But the family had settled in a land where race, color and nationality were the defining facts of existence, where the British South African did not care to mix with a German or an Afrikaner, any more than he would regard the Zulu as an equal. Simply reflected through the eyes of a child, those barriers appear still more chilling.
The Africans were not the only people set apart from the life of the young, white Pifer. He recounts how as a schoolboy he was regularly ambushed by resentful, brutish Afrikaner youths; he remembers how the Nazi-leaning Germans of Oranjemund were rounded up and herded away at the start of the war. But neither Afrikaners nor Germans were truly a part of his life: they too were apart, for apartheid grew out of divisions within races as well as between them.
Mr. Pifer's wistful book is subtitled "An American Family's Story," but it could as easily be the story of any privileged white family in South Africa, a chilling, rather brave portrait of an unknowing child watching the cancerous growth of apartheid from the inside. "Innocents in Africa," like the boy it recalls, is only half-knowing about the world it re-creates -- a vast, uncompromising land with vast, uncompromising spaces between its peoples.

A WORLD AT ARMS
A Global History of World War II.
By Gerhard L. Weinberg.
Maps. 1,178 pp. New York:
Cambridge University Press.
$34.95. 
 IT was Dr. Win-the-War at his most pedagogic: President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chat of Feb. 23, 1942, was an extended geography lesson. Millions of Americans sat by their radios with maps open as the President took them around the globe. "This war is a new kind of war," he insisted. "It is warfare in terms of every continent, every island, every sea, every air lane in the world."
Gerhard L. Weinberg does not mention that fireside chat in his book "A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II," but Roosevelt's approach mirrors his own; it certainly is global. For Mr. Weinberg, the grotesque ambition of Nazi foreign policy is the theme that ties together the years 1939-45. But what Hitler started, others developed and finished. His triumph in Europe in mid-1940 encouraged Italy and Japan down their own primrose paths to conquest and defeat. And it spurred Germany into a hubristic assault on Russia in June 1941, with victory expected by the fall.
Mr. Weinberg puts that "eastern front" back at the center of the land war against Germany. As we near the 50th anniversary of D-day, it is worth remembering that between June 1941 and June 1944 more than 90 percent of the German Army's battle casualties were inflicted by the Russians. By comparison, the British and American battles in North Africa, Sicily and Italy counted for relatively little.
As Mr. Weinberg also emphasizes, this was not a conventional struggle for territory and resources. At stake was the life or death of whole peoples. Hitler's goal of living space in the east encompassed the genocide of so-called inferior races. The Jews of Europe were his most notorious victims, but the Slavs were also deemed Untermenschen and this gave the eastern front an additional horror generally lacking in the west.
Mr. Weinberg's insistence that this war was novel in both extent and intent seems to me entirely correct. But to distill a few themes in this way cannot convey the scale of his enterprise. Unlike many recent histories of the war, this is not a mere synthesis of published material. It is also the fruit of a decade and a half of archival research. As one would expect of an eminent historian of Nazi foreign policy, Mr. Weinberg, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina, is strongest on Germany, but he has also worked extensively in the American and British documents.
The result is not easy reading. The book is constructed like a vast scheme of lectures, with points clearly enumerated. There are few pithy quotations or anecdotes, and virtually no humor -- though it was nice to be reminded of the wartime joke that the Royal Navy lived on rum, while the Italians stuck to port.
Yet the prose is clear, the detail arresting and the arguments carefully deployed. Repeatedly Mr. Weinberg's own research illuminates old controversies. He notes, for instance, that the failure of the Allies to take Tunisia quickly had grave consequences for plans they had been working on to invade France in 1943. And his insistence on Hitler's malevolence toward Britain, from the war plans of 1940 to the V-weapons of 1944, is a healthy antidote to some of the nonsense that appeared in the British press a year ago about the chances of a compromise peace. If you read the 920 pages of this text in conjunction with the 180 pages of notes, you will gain a real insight into how academic historians work and where current research is going. This is a tour de force, classical diplomatic history at its best.
Mr. Weinberg's global view of the war pays dividends again and again. Stalingrad, rightly, becomes the pivotal event of 1942-43, but the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal, on the one hand, and Alamein and the invasion of French North Africa, on the other, are given due weight. Together they helped prevent Germany and Japan from joining forces in the Middle East, which would have presented the Axis powers' only real chance of victory.
A global war is also a naval war, as Mr. Weinberg makes clear in a separate chapter. In the Pacific, American submarines throttled the Japanese war effort. In the Atlantic, German U-boats nearly did the same to the Allies in 1942, and the delay in mounting the second front can be understood only against this backdrop. When Mr. Weinberg talks of "the most disastrous defeat ever suffered by American naval power," he is referring not to Pearl Harbor but to the loss of 2.6 million tons of merchant shipping off the American coast during the first eight months of 1942.
Yet his globalism is not as comprehensive as one might think. His coverage of books and archives from Germany, America and Britain is remarkable (and there is an excellent bibliographic essay). But the Russian story, and the war in Asia, are written almost entirely from those same sources. The result, at its worst, is a shadowy factual summary. Thus, the Russian Army's victories of 1944, though given due significance, are endowed in Chapter 12 with little of the drama and detail that Mr. Weinberg lavishes on Normandy. In March and April, in June and again in August, the Russians inflicted a third of a million casualties on the Germans in a few weeks. Each time they get a page for their pains. Yet each "body count" was comparable to that of the Battle of Normandy.
Mr. Weinberg's Asian war is even more bloodless. Extended accounts of Leyte and Okinawa have no parallels on the Chinese mainland. Of course, Chiang Kai-shek's armies atrophied in 1942-43 and were then crushed by Japan in 1944. Mr. Weinberg is good on the effects of this for American strategy and China's international standing. But he gives us little sense of the magnitude of the war between Japan and China, which dated back to 1937 and even, arguably, to 1931. Then at the end, almost casually, he suggests a figure of 15 million Chinese war dead, a quarter of his estimate for the global death toll (the Soviet Union's losses were at least 25 million; America's, 300,000).
These are not really criticisms of Mr. Weinberg. As he notes, reliable material on Russia, China and even Japan is limited. And the language skills required to master them would be formidable -- "Lingua longa, vita brevis," one might say. What this suggests (and what historians increasingly recognize) is the need for international collaboration. A truly global history of a truly global war is beyond any one scholar, however gifted.
Less forgivable, in my view, is the book's anonymity. Mr. Weinberg is a historian of policy. He spends most of his time on diplomacy and strategy, skillfully interweaving both with the new revelations about wartime intelligence. On Nazi genocide he is moved and moving, but for the most part this is not a people's war, except for the people at the very top. The separate chapter on the home fronts is one of the weakest in the book, becoming ever more fragmented as it races round the world. The suffering entailed by victory and defeat requires a less cerebral historian.
"Geography costs," Carl Sandburg lamented. "Why does the map of Europe never stay put?" In 1939-45, the cost of geography was global in scale, and the account has still not been settled.
 
 
 
60 MILLION DEAD AND STILL COUNTING
 The Soviet Union had suffered the largest number of deaths. . . . New research . . . has been pointing to figures . . . possibly in excess of 25 million deaths. . . . Chinese casualties are much more difficult to estimate than those of the Soviet Union, but 15 million dead is a reasonable approximation. In Poland, close to 6 million lost their lives, while Yugoslavia suffered between 1.5 and 2 million deaths. About 400,000 United Kingdom soldiers and civilians lost their lives; about 300,000 from the United States. Germany lost over 4 million and Japan over 2 million lives in the war. The total for the globe as a whole probably reached 60 million, a figure which includes the 6 million murdered because they were Jewish. . . .
The costs in human life and suffering, in destruction and economic dislocation, had been of absolutely unprecedented magnitude. If the question is asked, was victory worth such tremendous exertions and the price paid for their success, one is obliged to consider the consequences of Axis victory.

 NOTHING beats a dose of the Wild, Wild West to ease the anxiety that accompanies change. For most Americans, cowboys, covered-wagon caravans and Wild Bill Hickok are icons of rugged individualism that simultaneously stimulate and soothe.
The last time the bloom was on the Wild West rose, for instance, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, and the boys of the Ponderosa galloped into the American living room. Their mission was simple: to triumph over a variety of bad guys on a weekly basis. At the same time, those who wore the white hats battled the ambient anxieties of their era. By carving out and then defending a homestead in an unfamiliar and unpredictable landscape, the good guys reassured a society made itinerant by company transfers, the demise of farm and small-town life, the growth of suburbs.
The current craze for the West isn't as much about adventure as it is about intimate daily life. The droves of the rich and chic that began buying second homes in Montana, Colorado and Utah several years ago don't ride the range, they create their own little (weekend) houses on the prairie. Movies like "A River Runs Through It" are real life, not larger than life. Likewise, there has recently been a passel of books about the Wild West dedicated to the details of daily living.
Two of those books, "Home on the Range," by Cathy Luchetti, and "Wagon Wheel Kitchens," by Jacqueline Williams, delve into the eating habits of the 19th-century American West. Both are histories culled from diaries and are more impressionistic than they are scholarly. Neither expands on the food history available in "Eating in America," by Waverley Root and Richard de Rochemont, and "A History of Food and Drink in America," by Richard J. Hooker. But both books give a deep sense of how the unpredictable adventure that was the West shaped lives and meals, how scarcity fostered invention, how opposites reconciled to survive.
Making dinner along the westward trails is a soothing parable for a generation that is making life up as it goes along, with recon figured families and real economic limits. After the indulgence of the 80's, who doesn't have a little sympathy for the overlanders Ms. Luchetti mentions who were forced to downsize their covered wagon halfway across the country, casting aside "champagne, East India sweetmeats and olives"?
"To travel, to shift occupation and to re settle was to alter life in unforeseen ways," Ms. Luchetti writes, and with more than 200 pages of text, historical photographs and recipes, she shows how manifest destiny eroded the European bias of the early American table.
Mealtimes shifted as the main meal was served between noon and 2, generally the hottest time of the day and also a perfect time for loading up on the fuel the travelers would need to travel until dark. Beef replaced pork as the favorite meat. Six courses gave way to one or two -- bacon and beans, or mush with rough bread, leavened with bicarbonate of soda or sourdough. Men, Ms. Luchetti notes, "could point proudly to their
own food discoveries." Sourdough, for instance, was the invention of a male cook. Role switching was as common as hoe cakes fried in suet in the Wild West. And it wasn't uncommon for Scandinavians to trade cooked dishes with Mexicans, who in turn traded with Irish immigrants, just for variety. For a brief period the unmeltable pot melted a little.
Ms. Luchetti, the author of "Women of the West" and "Under God's Spell: Frontier Evangelists, 1772-1915," offers a narrative that is as genial as it is general about the eating life along the trail, in the trapping camps, in the chuck wagons of cattle drives, in the hotels and boarding houses during the California gold rush and in a handful of other settings.
Like food historians before her, she describes how pioneers borrowed Indian techniques to preserve beef as jerky and to dry wild berries and fruits for pies. She includes recipes for pine-seed popcorn and instructions for "cooking puppy," as well as for preparing "coon cake." It is difficult to understand why the author, having unearthed such recipes, chose to include so many from "Housekeeping in Old Virginia," a place better noted for its Federalists than its frontier.
But for the most part, Ms. Luchetti's history, studded with diary entries, recipes and provision lists, sketches an era of improvisation and perseverance. Those who dared the unknown West lived a fluid life, in which nothing, particularly water, was taken for granted and nothing, not even a one-egg cake, was impossible.
"Wagon Wheel Kitchens" contains more discovery, yet somehow less charm, than "Home on the Range." Focusing on the estimated 300,000 people who traveled from Kansas to California on the Oregon Trail from 1840 to 1860 and the approximately 133 million meals they presumably consumed (calculated on a travel time of five months), Ms. Williams gives detailed lists of provisions, cooking techniques and utensils.
In 190 modestly illustrated pages, the reader learns how the European settlers, partial to meat rather than vegetables, learned the virtue of eating off the land. Citing travelers' diary entries, Ms. Williams -- the co-author of several books on nutrition, including "Hold the Fat, Sugar and Salt" -- details the discovery of a natural leavening in the foam of hot soda springs and explains the craft of cooking in cast iron over open fires, as well as the preparation of the Indian-inspired jerky. She describes how game, from antelope to sage hens, was cooked. Dedicated campers take note: trail mix and Power Bars alone won't satisfy after you have read "Wagon Wheel Kitchens."
For history buffs and armchair cooks, these two books about eating in the Wild West make absorbing reading. For everybody else, the books are another face of the old cowboy, more personal, more vulnerable, less heroic and excruciatingly human.

HEADLINE: Garbage In, Garbage Out

BYLINE: By Carl Levin; Carl Levin, a Democrat, is junior Senator from Michigan.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the floor debate scheduled to begin in the next few days on the proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget, Senate proponents will deliver impassioned speeches. As an antidote, a reading of the Senate Judiciary Committee's report favoring the amendment would be useful -- because it makes some of the best arguments against it.
Many foes of the amendment, including President Clinton, believe as strongly as its supporters that the deficit should be reduced and the budget balanced. But this proposed fiscal sleight-of-hand amendment doesn't do the job. 
 First, when speaking of the amendment's requirement that the President propose a budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts, the Judiciary Committee states: "The committee anticipates good faith on the part of the President with respect to projected economic factors."
Really? What in the 1980's would give us confidence in the "good faith" of the economic assumptions of any future administration? The first Reagan budget forecast economic growth of 4.2 percent; the economy declined by 1.9 percent.
David Stockman, President Reagan's first budget director, described in the "Triumph of Politics" how the forecasts in the first budget Ronald Reagan submitted were developed: "[Murray] Weidenbaum [chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers] unfurled his scenario . . . . Someone finally taunted the professor, 'What model did this come out of, Murray?' Weidenbaum glared at his inquisitor a moment and said, 'It came right out of here.' With that he slapped his belly with both hands. 'My visceral computer,' He smiled."
What in this amendment would prevent a future administration's visceral computer from re-emerging as the President's economic forecasting device? Nothing.
Second, when describing the need for constitutional instead of statutory language, the committee says: "Statutory efforts to balance the budget previously have failed because it is too easy for Congress to simply change its mind and rescind its previous declarations."
The trouble is that the amendment itself relies on statutory definitions that can easily be changed. It says the term "fiscal year" in the amendment is "intended as a term defined by statute and, as such, is to have no constitutional standing independent from its statutory definition."
Thus, under the committee's interpretation, Congress can change its mind and redefine "fiscal year" in order to encompass 11 months or three years. When faced with a budget that is hopelessly out of balance over the standard 12-month time frame, the President and Congress may decide to "save" billions of dollars by shortening the fiscal year by one day so that a payday for Federal employees falls into the next fiscal year. A form of this manipulation was used in 1986 to "save" almost $700 million dollars in revenue-sharing funds.
The nation should be under no illusion that this effort to mandate a balanced budget will succeed where past statutory efforts have failed. It will just require Congress to be more creative in searching for more loopholes as a substitute for real policies.
If the amendment works as advertised, it could prevent remedial action such as deficit spending in times of economic emergencies and exacerbate recessions by requiring tax increases or spending cuts, which would further slow economic growth. Because the amendment requires 60 Senate votes to waive a balanced budget, it would put dangerous power over the economy in the hands of a minority.
In short, the Judiciary Committee, in trying to put the best face on this amendment -- which does not specify how to balance the budget -- is leading with its chin.

HEADLINE: Yes, Ask Why We Need This Stuff in Our Milk

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"The Milk Brouhaha" (editorial, Feb. 10) seems typical of an insidious and myopic variety of thought in our economy: If a company (in this case, Monsanto) is capable of producing something (in this case, a genetically engineered drug that boosts milk production) and spending millions of dollars creating a need for it, let's use it. 
 What apparently bothers you is that this time, more than a few people are asking, "But why?" And well they should ask. With farmers from California to Vermont being paid Federal money to produce less milk, and in the wake of a program in the mid-to-late 1980's in which the Federal Government purchased and disposed of entire herds of dairy cows to decrease milk production, there is little reason to increase milk production.
Perhaps some small farmers think they would benefit because they could achieve the same or better milk production with smaller herds and thus fewer costs and less maintenance. However, clearly -- and as is usually the case with recently created agricultural technologies -- the real winners will be the biggest agribusinesses, the most powerful middlemen and, naturally, Monsanto.
It is ironic that the producers of milk, after having worked so long and so hard to create an image of wholesomeness for their product, appear quite eager to step even further into the arena of our perverse meta-economy, where people with dollar signs in their eyes sit around boardrooms and manufacture false needs. Maybe the "milk brouhaha" will encourage more people to ask "why?" on a greater variety of wondrous new products.

HEADLINE: Did Anybody Check Out Economic Wisdom of Hiring Sliwa?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As a daily listener of WNYC, New York City's public radio station, and a contributor to it for more than 10 years, I am one of many upset at the appearance of interference leading to the hiring of Curtis Sliwa, Guardian Angel turned radio personality, despite statements alleging Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's nonintervention. 
 I am more concerned about the economic wisdom of his hiring for the station. Did market research clearly indicate that Mr. Sliwa's audience will expand WNYC's support base enough to compensate for a dropoff in support from current listeners?
Will the hoped-for increase in listeners stay with the station long enough to satisfy the fund sources that look at audience-base figures? Will Mayor Giuliani promise to wait and see if the expected new revenue meets or exceeds the city's subsidy of a mere 10 percent of WNYC's budget and promise hands off if it does?
If we who have supported the station are to continue to do so, we must be assured more credibly that the offer to Mr. Sliwa was prompted by solid analysis, not political pressure. WNYC is New York's last bastion of consistently interesting radio, and I for one cannot willingly give it up without a fight.

HEADLINE: With No Clear Leader or Strategy, Unions Prepare to Face Giuliani

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
For decades, New York's mayors shared the public stage with a well-known cast of irascible, flamboyant leaders of municipal labor. There were the titans who could welcome a new mayor into office with a strike on Inauguration Day, and later the labor statesmen who worked with the city in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
Now the last of the union leaders who catapulted to prominence in the fiscal crisis has left the stage, clearing the way for less visible, less bombastic and, in some cases, less tested successors. And the change has come as the municipal unions face the twin challenges posed by the city's worst financial difficulties since the 1970's and by the new Republican Mayor's pledges to reduce the size of the city government.
 
Test for Unions
 The leaders and tactics that emerge over the next few months -- and in contract negotiations this year and next -- could not only decide the short-term success of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's fiscal strategy but also be crucial to the long-term power of the unions. 
 Many of Mr. Giuliani's proposals for erasing the $2.3 billion budget deficit -- changes in health benefits and vacation and sick days, new productivity measures and the elimination of 15,000 jobs -- can be carried out only with labor support because they affect contracts already in place or civil service rules. But Mr. Giuliani has said that without cooperation from the unions he will have to resort instead to as many as 35,000 layoffs over four years.
Some in the labor movement contend that unless the unions engage Mr. Giuliani in a public debate over the budget and offer alternatives, they could lose a larger political battle to a Mayor who has made the size of New York City's government an ideological issue.
"The issues are much bigger than is there a couple of thousand jobs lost here and there," said Gregory Tarpinian, the director of the Labor Research Association, a union-financed group. "Giuliani is waging a philosophical war."
The municipal unions boomed during the 1980's, adding members by the thousands as the city payroll expanded and winning strong wage settlements that were the envy of their hard-pressed brethren in the private sector. But the bubble burst as the recession hit, with layoffs and smaller wage settlements coming even under their ally, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Now, as the unions brace for a face-off with Mr. Giuliani, their task has been made more difficult by the departure of Barry Feinstein, the brash negotiator who resigned last April as president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to settle charges that he misused $500,000 of the local's funds to maintain a life of luxury.
Quotable and combative, Mr. Feinstein wielded power disproportionate to the small size of his union. He often seemed to be the dominant partner in a negotiating duo with Stanley Hill, the executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city's largest union, with 131,000 members in 56 locals.
This fight will be Mr. Hill's first without Mr. Feinstein at his side. Mr. Hill, 57, insists that he is up to the task, saying he should not be underestimated simply because his style is more low-key. "I'm a very competitive guy," he said. "I don't like losing."
 
Doubts About Leader
 But many of his allies describe him as a conciliator and not the strategist needed when Mr. Giuliani is signaling his intention to start shrinking the public sector. They say Mr. Hill is further hampered by his own need to satisfy the leaders of his separate locals.
"Stanley spends a great deal of his time creating consensus rather than marching at the front of a parade," said Norman Adler, a political consultant who made his name as a political director of District Council 37. "By predisposition, he's not a band leader. At best he's a concertmaster."
Whether anyone else will acquire Mr. Feinstein's stature is not clear. While Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, is considered a powerful and skilled labor strategist, she has worked to separate the teachers from the rest of the municipal work force, so that they are judged in comparison with other teachers during wage talks.
"It's not a secret that we've been fighting a battle for some years now to create some differences in the way the management in the city government has treated us," she said. "There's a problem with teachers being compared with other municipal employees other than teachers."
Another potential leader, Sonny Hall, resigned as president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union in October to become the international president of the union, and the transit workers, who negotiate with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and not the city, pulled out of the Municipal Labor Committee, the coalition of city municipal unions.
 
Others Hampered
 Carl Haynes, Mr. Feinstein's successor at the teamsters, is less visible and represents only 21,000 workers. Arthur Cheliotes, president of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, is also hampered by the small size of his local, which represents only 10,000 administrative employees.
Peter Scarlatos, who became president of the 7,000-member Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association just over a year ago, is highly regarded by his colleagues. But he is thought to have enough of a task negotiating for his own workers with a Mayor who has already identified nearly 1,500 jobs for elimination in the Sanitation Department and who singled out the sanitation contract for criticism during his campaign. And the unions representing uniformed workers have rarely made much of a common front with the nonuniformed ones.
So far, labor's response to Mr. Giuliani's proposals has been relatively muted. Union officials point out that they have not yet been given any specifics of Mr. Giuliani's plans, ranging from which jobs he wants to cut to the details of severance packages.
And with such details missing, one union official called it foolhardy to rush into confrontation with a Mayor who has cited the success of his Philadelphia counterpart in winning concessions from unions after a brief, abortive strike.
The unions have joined in their opposition to Mr. Giuliani's proposal that their members make co-payments for health care. But with no strong figure setting strategy, differences in approach quickly emerge. Some union leaders are ready to propose that Mr. Giuliani find many more savings in the ranks of the police and the firefighters, who rallied around him during his campaign, and who were left untouched in his budget.
"I think the Mayor will lose credibility about making tough decisions if there isn't a sense of fairness," Ms. Feldman said.
 
An Alternative Approach
 Some union leaders say the municipal unions cannot afford to ignore the fiscal problems or minimize them and should work with Mr. Giuliani. "I believe it's time for responsible union leadership in this city to pool their research personnel, apply that expertise in examining the city's budget and bureaucracy stem to stern, using the people who know this city best -- its own workers -- and identify waste and redundancy," said Jan D. Pierce, a regional vice president of the Communications Workers of America, which represents administrative employees. "I believe it can be done without the need to cut services, cut the employment levels or raising taxes."
Mr. Hill said he planned to release a "state of the city" proposal on behalf of labor sometime soon that would challenge some of Mr. Giuliani's statements about the size of the work force and its productivity. And he said it would contain alternative proposals for dealing with the deficit, suggesting that options would include some new ways of raising tax dollars as well as seeking more aid from Albany and Washington.
Mr. Hill has been meeting with the city's Democratic officeholders and City Council members, a number of whom receive strong campaign support from District Council 37. And with the black and Hispanic caucus of the City Council among the strongest backers of his union -- whose members are largely from minority groups -- Mr. Hill has also demonstrated a willingness to cast the fight in racial terms as he searches for allies.
Last week Mr. Hill shared the steps of City Hall with a group of Baptist ministers and elected officials who proclaimed Mr. Giuliani's budget "a plan of pain for people of color and city workers."
The unions are also supporting legislation in the City Council that would require the city to carry out cost-benefit studies before contracting out city services to private companies and allow the Council to hold a hearing on the contracts before they can be put in place. Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers spoke against the measure at a Council hearing last week, saying it was "designed to further hinder the process," and the Mayor and Council are hurtling toward a confrontation over the bill.
But in the long term, some labor strategists say, they need new tools to build public support for city workers and to make some of their points: that many of the people likely to be laid off could still be a burden to the city on unemployment or welfare rolls. The teachers are running a $1 million television campaign showing teachers and students succeeding despite deteriorating school buildings. And the Communications Workers of America has suggested that the other unions put a similar ad campaign on cable television to spread a more positive image of the civil servant.
"One of the things we have to do is stop assuming people know what we do," Mr. Cheliotes said. "We're invisible to much of the city."

The Economy
The I.R.S. faces a costly threat from thieves using electronic filing technology to receive fraudulent refunds. More than 25,000 fraudulent electronic returns were detected in the first 10 months of 1993, more than double the number a year earlier. [Page A1.] 
 The Justice Department is investigating whether networks that link automated teller machines have been putting pressure on banks to buy other services as a condition of participation. [D1.]
The labor union leaders and tactics that emerge in New York in the next few months -- and in contract negotiations this year and next -- could decide the short-term success of Mayor Giuliani's fiscal strategy and the long-term power of the unions. [A1.]
When Congress approved the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, contrary to the wishes of organized labor, union leaders vowed to retaliate against Democrats who supported President Clinton. So far, the unions' bite has not matched their bark, and most of the retribution has been far more symbolic than substantive. [A1.] The Administration and labor unions are natural allies on many issues and are now devising strategy on several matters of mutual interest. [A12.]
The drug AZT has so sharply reduced transmission of H.I.V. from infected mothers to their newborns in a federally financed study of American and French medical centers that the Government has stopped the study ahead of schedule. [A1.]
 
International
U.S. executives are praising President Clinton's decision to take a tougher stance with Japan over trade but are divided about how much the Administration can improve the situation. [D1.]
There is growing concern in Warsaw that too many Polish investors are inexperienced first-time buyers who have put their savings into a volatile and sometimes illiquid market. [D1.]
Mexico's largest construction company has joined with Canada's biggest development company to build a housing, office and entertainment complex on the outskirts of Mexico City. [D2.]
Zaire's state-owned mining company has collapsed, and the copper mines abandoned to scavengers, amid growing political and economic chaos. [A3.]
 
The Media Business
Stars and Stripes seems under siege itself. Many American soldiers no longer see the military newspaper as a primary source of news and its financial picture is cloudy as thousands of American troops and their families have been pulled from Europe. [D6.]
Magazine publishers are scrutinizing newly released 1993 circulation figures to check out the winners, the losers and the competition. [D6.]
Book publishers have come to regard Valentine's Day as a major marketing opportunity, a time to put out much of the year's selection of books that are even tenuously connected to romance. Sarah Lyall: Publishing. [D6.]
Michael Bloomberg's all-business-news radio station had barely turned a year old when he decided to celebrate by going national with the New York outlet -- just one more way in which Mr. Bloomberg is taking advantage of WBBR-AM. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Clinton and Unions, Burying Hatchets, Focus on Common Interests

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
Their name-calling, saber-rattling ruckus over the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada aside, the Clinton Administration and labor unions are natural allies on many issues and are now devising strategy on several matters of mutual interest.
In testimony to the effort to mend fences, the largest delegation of Administration officials and Congressional Democrats that labor leaders can remember is descending on the week-long annual winter meeting here of the 35-member executive council of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations. 
 Vice President Al Gore, who in his television debate with Ross Perot helped the President win enactment of the trade agreement, will be here on Monday bearing olive branches. George Stephanopoulos, a senior Presidential adviser, came in today. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, like his predecessors a regular at these affairs, comes on Tuesday and has dispatched nearly all his top appointees here.
 
Continued Influence
 And however acute the long erosion of union membership in the work force and labor's lost battles with Congress, other visitors testify to its continued influence. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, running for re-election, and Treasurer Kathleen Brown of California, seeking her party's nomination for governor, will be soliciting votes and campaign contributions.
The issues of mutual interest for the Democrats and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. include enacting the President's overhaul of the health care system, writing more union-friendly labor laws, tightening worker health and safety regulations and expanding aid to the chronically unemployed, among them those who lose jobs because of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Today, the union presidents, their staff and families, and Administration officials, many recruited from unions, were packed around poolside tables and lounge chairs at the Sheraton Bal Harbour, hearing one another out in the clammy heat of the South Florida sun. Meetings start on Monday.
Rare for these affairs, no one wore buttons or passed out leaflets criticizing someone or something. "Are we better off than we were three years ago?" asked Richard L. Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers. "Unquestionably. Is it utopia? Definitely not."
How durable these renewed links will be is anybody's guess. The union leaders, many past 70 years old, are creatures of the New Deal and the legacies of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. A senior federation official said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, as "new" Democrats in their 40's, were less persuaded by the appeal of big government solutions to problems.
On the other hand, said Lynn R. Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of America, the two have a compelling interest in breaching the divide. "There's no possibility of Clinton's being a second-term President without the support of the labor movement," Mr. Williams said. "And I think he understands that."
 
'Some Scars Left Over'
 Steven Rosenthal, a deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor, said, "Look, on 99 percent of the issues, we're in virtual agreement."
Donald R. Sweitzer, political director of the Democratic National Committee, said, "There are some scars left over from Nafta, some of which will never heal. But these are pragmatic people. We want to move on to things we can agree on."
Mr. Sweitzer has a special interest in courting labor here. In a rare show of pique over the trade pact vote, the federation leadership recently declared a moratorium on financial contributions to the national party and one other group, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- a signal to unions to withhold their contributions, too. "We want to patch that up," Mr. Sweitzer said.
Some vocal foes of the law eliminating barriers to trade with Mexico and Canada, which opens opportunities for American industry to build factories outside the country, have mellowed. Rather than try to defeat members of Congress who voted for the agreement, Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, said, "I'd rather go the extra mile for those who stood up for us."
And George J. Kourpias, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said: "We knew where Bill Clinton and Al Gore stood on Nafta before they were elected. Certainly, we're disappointed. But we must go on now, and we will."

HEADLINE: Students Plan Ways for Colleges to Act on Environmentalism

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Yale University's switch to fluorescent lighting in its library is expected to save $3.5 million over the next 10 years. Connecticut College's reduction of room temperatures by 1 degree Fahrenheit has saved $8,000 a year. Putting energy-efficient lights in 2,200 exit signs will save Brown University $65,000, it estimates.
Universities have found that environmentalism may be good for their budgets. At a planning conference this weekend, campus environmentalists from around the world focused on specific proposals for improving campus environmental programs. 
 Over 400 students, faculty members and administrators attended the Campus Earth Summit this weekend at Yale University, organized by Yale's Student Environmental Coalition and sponsored by the Heinz Family Foundation, which aids environmental and other charitable causes.
Teresa Heinz, chief executive of the foundation, said that universities' buying power and educating mission make them powerful agents for environmental change. Mrs. Heinz said the conference's practical proposals added a new dimension to campus advocacy. Student groups have traditionally staked out the high moral ground on environmentalism and left the messy work to others, she said.
 
'Starting With Ourselves'
 Abdi Soltani, a Stanford University junior, said: "We're not telling other people how to live their lives. We're starting with ourselves and the institutions where we have power."
Participants drafted a 19-page document, Campus Blueprint for a Sustainable Future, outlining strategies for improving campus environmental practices and education. The Heinz Family Foundation plans to publish by December a book rating universities on their environmental efforts.
Among the report's suggestions were: adding environmental problems to natural science courses; ending parking subsidies to encourage mass transit, and using alternatives to paper, like computer messages.
But at the conference's end, some students said that the discussion was still too vague. Amy Powers, a Bates College senior, urged local and regional conferences to provide more specifics.
Linnea Brudenell, a first-year student from Reed College in Portland, Ore., said that the conference was frustrating at times and that the strategy sessions were sometimes handicapped by participants' ideological differences.
 
Fivefold Increase Reported
 There are over 2,000 American campus environmental groups, up from 400 since 1989, according to Brian Trelstad of the Center for Environmental Citizenship.
In her address to the conference, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol M. Browner, compared current efforts by environmentalists to the early American labor movement.
"You too will meet with resistance; people will tell you that environmental protection and economic progress are incompatible; they'll even call you things like 'Granola Head' and 'Tree-Hugger' and probably some things that are worse," she said. "But you must stick to your convictions."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Satellite Service Will Extend the Reach of Bloomberg Radio

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
His all-business-news radio station in New York had barely turned one year old when Michael Bloomberg decided to celebrate by going national with it.
The decision was easy, because the radio station, WBBR-AM, can tag along at no additional expense on the satellite service that Mr. Bloomberg is leasing to start a 13-hour-a-day television service of business news. 
 Along with the video channel, called Bloomberg Direct, which will be part of GM Hughes Electronics' satellite-to-home broadcasting service, will come an audio channel carrying WBBR. A subscriber to the satellite service, which will start about May 1, will be able to hear the station through a television set, with the screen blank, or by connecting a radio to the system.
 
A Station of Many Uses
 The audio channel is just one more unusual way in which Mr. Bloomberg is taking advantage of the radio station he bought (the former WNEW-AM, at the frequency of 1130) in the fall of 1992 for $13.5 million. Mr. Bloomberg is the founder of Bloomberg Financial Markets, which provides computerized financial data to business customers, and Bloomberg Business News, a news service that reports and interprets the data.
Another innovation from Mr. Bloomberg is to put the radio programming inside the computer terminals he leases to business customers for $1,000 a month. The terminals are used to retrieve and display all the data gathered by Bloomberg Financial Markets -- and the Bloomberg software runs only on the Bloomberg hardware. But more than 20,000 of Bloomberg's 34,000 terminals now have built-in speakers for the radio programming.
Because WBBR broadcasts a digitally encoded signal, it can be captured and stored electronically on the Bloomberg computer system, then played on demand. If a broker, instead of typing a stock symbol on the keyboard, types in "WBBR," the terminal displays a menu of recent radio programming, like the most recent market report, news broadcast, weather or traffic report, or perhaps Alan Greenspan's speech of the day. Hit the number of a menu item, and the selection is replayed.
WNEW-AM, which played big band music and crooners, attracted about 1.6 percent of the listening audience in the New York area. Since WBBR began broadcasting on Jan. 3, 1993, the station's share, as measured by the Arbitron Company, has averaged about three-tenths of 1 percent.
While others in the radio business deride the station and its paltry ratings, Mr. Bloomberg, in the time-honored fashion of stations with low Arbitron numbers, prefers to bash the rating service.
"The people who listen to my station, investment bankers and the like, don't take the time to talk to market researchers on the phone, or to fill out Arbitron phone diaries," Mr. Bloomberg said in a recent interview at his Park Avenue office.
To prove his point, Mr. Bloomberg has commissioned "qualitative ratings" from Accuratings of Chicago, a relative newcomer that is offering its services to radio stations as a way of getting beyond the raw numbers of Arbitron to measure the wealth, education and buying habits of radio listeners. Many classical-music stations also use qualitative ratings, hoping to demonstrate that they, too, have an attractive audience in terms of buying power and taste.
"A bigger percentage of WBBR's listeners have bought a new car in the last six months than at any of the top 20 stations in New York," Kurt Hanson, the president of Accuratings, said. "A bigger percentage of WBBR's audience went to graduate school than of any station in New York except that of WQXR," the classical-music FM station owned by The New York Times Company, he said.
Whatever Accuratings may show, and however tony the advertisers WBBR attracts -- at rates of $500 a minute in morning drive time to $150 in off hours -- executives at New York's all-news stations, which Mr. Bloomberg likes to call "all-crime" stations, are happy to sneer in return.
"We don't look at them as competition," said Scott Herman, the vice president and general manager of WINS-AM, the all-news station owned by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. In the latest Arbitron ratings, WINS had 3.9 percent of the listening audience, or 13 times that of WBBR.
"They're not in the business of attracting listeners," he said of WBBR. "He's just trying to sell his data."
At WCBS-AM, Harvey Nagler, the director of news and programming, said the countermeasures that his station took when WBBR began broadcasting had proved unnecessary. "When we first heard about WBBR, we started a small-business report that airs twice a day," he said, "and we increased what we were doing off-air. Four times a year, we rent a hotel hall and do breakfasts for the community with well-known figures to talk about business and economic issues."
But aside from losing two part-time employees to Bloomberg, Mr. Nagler said, WBBR had had no effect on WCBS, which had 2.9 percent of the audience in Arbitron's latest ratings.

HEADLINE: Intel Market Share Rises

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation increased its share of the worldwide microprocessor market last year, the research firm Dataquest Inc. said last week.
Intel controlled 74 percent of the market in 1993, up from 69 percent the year before, Dataquest said. 
 "Such dominance of an entire semiconductor product segment is unprecedented," Jerry Banks, director and principal microprocessor analyst at Dataquest, said.
Microprocessors are the "brains" of personal computers. Most companies that make such chips enjoyed higher sales in 1993 because of the rising demand for PC's.
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., designed and is the leading maker of of X86-type microprocessors, used in most PC's. The company's sales of microprocessors amounted to $6.57 billion last year, up from $3.79 billion in 1992.

HEADLINE: Business Chiefs Praise Clinton for Stand on Japan

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Business executives are praising President Clinton's decision to take a tougher stance with Japan over trade but are divided about how much the Administration can improve the situation.
"It's time the Japanese understood that this chronic deficit is intolerable," said George Fisher, chairman and chief executive of the Eastman Kodak Company. 
 President Clinton is drawing the highest praise for refusing earlier this month to pretend that any progress had been made in trade talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
Japan is arguing that any agreement should focus on opening up Japanese markets by changing regulations and whittling away at traditional customs that inhibit access to its markets.
The United States has concluded that such tactics have failed to dent the deficit, which exceeded $59 billion last year. It wants agreement on specific benchmarks for progress, like growth in market share over certain periods of time for American products that are clearly competitive in price and performance.
 
Applauded on Motorola Stand
 The Clinton Administration is also being applauded for following up on its stand with a highly publicized move last Monday. The Administration announced that it was moving toward imposing trade sanctions in retaliation for what it sees as Japan's failure to meet commitments to grant Motorola Inc. unfettered access to Japan's biggest cellular telephone market.
The exact sanctions have not yet been determined, but most business executives said they were sure such moves would be limited. They said they doubted that there would be much impact on American manufacturers who used Japanese components or that Japan would see any need to respond with measures that would lead to an all-out trade war.
"The stakes are much too great for either side to let it go that route," said James Whittaker, international public policy manager for the Hewlett-Packard Company, when asked whether his company was prepared for a damaging series of escalating sanctions. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., makes computers and other electronic equipment.
Lynn Michaelis, chief economist for the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, a timber company based in Tacoma, Wash., that exports lumber and finished products to Japan, said: "We understand the concerns of those facing trade barriers, but countervailing duties is a risky approach. It could raise the cost of goods to American consumers and cause people that have an established trade position with Japan to lose some of it."
It is important to note, some executives say, that sanctions and other industry-specific trade measures would have a minor direct impact on the overall trade deficit but that talking about them draws attention to the imbalance, which can affect currencies. Indeed, the dollar dropped as trade talks foundered last week, imposing a far bigger penalty on Japanese competitiveness than any particular sanctions contemplated by the Clinton Administration.
The falling dollar at least delights American auto makers.
"The recent rise in the yen's value and its stability at the higher level over the past year has done more to level the playing field than all of the Government negotiations over the past 20 years," said John F. Smith Jr., chief executive and president of the General Motors Corporation in an address Monday in Washington to the U.S.-Japan Business Council.
The strong yen is "the most powerful means for correcting the trade imbalance over the long run," said Martin B. Zimmerman, executive director of government relations and corporate economics for the Ford Motor Company. And from a public policy standpoint in the short term, he said, "it does put pressure on the Japanese Government."
There are wide-ranging assessments of how much leverage the Government has to help various industries, reflecting the variety of trade barriers American companies face in Japan. Some consumer-product companies say the biggest barrier they face is the Japanese distribution and retailing system, which government-to-government talks cannot affect in the short run.
Kodak, for example, which has more than half the color-film market worldwide, has less than 10 percent in Japan, a discrepancy that Mr. Fisher says may cost the company as much as $1 billion a year in revenue. But the main problem is that film in Japan is mostly sold in kiosks and small stores that traditionally stock only one brand, usually Fuji
Until Japanese consumers become disgruntled enough with the higher prices under such a system to demand alternatives, it will be hard to make much headway against entrenched Japanese producers. The best Kodak can hope for is strong Government support at home for moves like its recent complaint that Fuji illegally cuts prices on exports to the United States.
In other sectors, like computers and telecommunications equipment, where American vendors are trying to win more contracts from Japanese Government agencies, the Clinton Administration's willingness to take a tough stand is possibly encouraging changes in Japanese policy.
"There's concern about the Japanese reaction, but the Government is smart to let the Japanese Government know in no uncertain terms that the lack of progress is unacceptable," said Kenneth R. Kay, executive director of the Computer Systems Policy Project, which represents the views of the chief executives of 13 large computer companies.
The group has asked the Administration to complain to Prime Minister Hosokawa about the lack of growth in the use of American computers by the Japanese Government, where they have a falling share of less than 4 percent compared with a growing share of 36 percent in the Japanese commercial sector.
Similar views are expressed in the medical equipment business, where American companies often find themselves at odds with the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. The ministry combines product review, physician reimbursement and research-financing responsibilities that in the United States are handled by separate Federal agencies. American companies have frequently complained of regulatory actions aimed at slowing penetration of the Japanese market by foreign products until homegrown products can be developed.
"A lot of our problem has to do with their regulatory system," said Terri Ethridge, director of global strategy and analysis for the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, a Washington-based trade group representing more than 300 medical equipment makers. The trade group says that the American companies have slightly more than 20 percent of Japan's $16.9 billion medical equipment market, compared with more than 50 percent in the rest of its export markets.
One uncertainty hovering over the medical sector as trade tensions grow is whether Japanese bureaucrats will be more likely to impose proposed cuts in reimbursement payments in four categories: heart valves, catheters used in heart surgery, oxygenators and orthopedic implants. The health ministry has said it wants to make the cuts to control rising health payments, but American companies say that the categories cover just 1 percent of Japanese spending on equipment and that it must be more than a coincidence that all four areas happen to be sectors where no significant Japanese companies are active.
William George, president and chief executive of Medtronic Inc., a Minneapolis-based equipment exporter that also has both research and manufacturing operations in Japan, said that he was concerned about how the pricing dispute might be affected by recent events in Washington but that he remained enthusiastic about President Clinton's policy.
"If you don't take a strong position, they'll keep doing what they've done as the path of least resistance," Mr. George said.

HEADLINE: Vittorio Rieti, Prolific Composer In Neo-Classical Style, Dies at 96

 BODY:
Vittorio Rieti, a prolific American composer who fashioned bright, elegant Neo-Classical scores for the ballets of Serge Diaghilev and George Balanchine, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 96 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was not immediately clear, said his son, Fabio, but Mr. Rieti had suffered a bad fall at his home, breaking several ribs. 
 In a career that spanned eight decades, Mr. Rieti wrote music for more than a dozen ballets, seven operas, five symphonies, several concertos, chamber music for a wide variety of instrumental combinations, songs and choral works. His music was widely performed; among the conductors who led performances of Mr. Rieti's works were Fritz Reiner, Frederick Stock, Willem Mengelberg and Arturo Toscanini.
Mr. Rieti was born in Egypt, to Italian-born parents, and educated in Italy. But his music -- in its wit, craft, lack of pretense and economy of means -- shares similarities with the work of the French group of composers who called themselves Les Six, particularly that of Poulenc. The music of Stravinsky, a close friend, was also an important influence.
Mr. Rieti continued to compose until shortly before his death. He used to say, "Composing every day is what keeps me alive." In his 75th, 80th and 85th birthday years, there were commemorative concerts in New York that included many new works. "Vittorio Rieti is becoming something of a wonder," Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times after a 1985 concert. "He will be 87 years old on the 28th of this month, but he is still composing music that is as sprightly and cheerful as anything he ever wrote."
Other commentators remarked upon the jaunty cheer in Mr. Rieti's music, yet some professed to find its obverse as well. "Rieti's oeuvre stands apart in its specific clarity, gaiety and sophistication of a kind only he possesses," the composer Alfredo Casella once said, "yet it hides a good deal of melancholia."
In 1973, Mr Rieti said: "I go on writing music. I started when I was 12, and it has become a habit. I maintain the same esthetic assumptions I have always had. I have kept evolving in the sense that one keeps on perfecting the same ground."
 
Three and Six
 Mr. Rieti was born in Alexandria, Egypt, on Jan. 28, 1898. As a musician, he was largely self-taught, although he acknowledged a debt to the composer Alfredo Casella, to the piano pedagogue Giuseppe Frugatta and to some "finishing touches" from Ottorino Respighi. In the early 1920's, he belonged to a group that called itself I Tre, an Italian imitation of Les Six. His first international success came in 1924, when Casella conducted his Concerto for Winds and Orchestra in Prague.
From 1925 to 1940, he lived in Paris, where he formed close ties with Les Six and with Stravinsky. He wrote ballet music for Diaghilev -- "Barabau" (1925) was particularly succesful -- and incidental music for Louis Jouvet.
In 1940, Mr. Rieti, his Italian wife, Elsie, and their son moved to the United States, where Mr. Rieti established a close working relationship with Balanchine, whose ballets "Waltz Academy" and "Native Dancers" are set to Mr. Rieti's music. However, Mr. Rieti's best-known collaboration with Balanchine remains "La Sonnambula," in which he orchestrated melodies by Bellini.
 
Late Works for Strings
 The compositions of the last 20 years of Mr. Rieti's life were mostly works for string ensembles, mostly string quartets.
"He was like Verdi and Tintoretto in the sense that some of his most beautiful works were composed near the end of his life," said Robert Fizdale, a duopianist who, with Arthur Gold, played and recorded much of Mr. Rieti's work. Mr. Rieti wrote numerous compositions for them over the years. Mr. Gold died two years ago.
While Mr. Rieti was in his 90's, a well-attended annual concert of his chamber music was given in New York, most recently at Merkin Concert Hall, by members of the Orchestra of St. Luke's. Much of the work that was performed was new, and all of it, Mr. Rieti's admirers said, sounded fresh.
His son said yesterday that Mr. Rieti's final compositions, done in the last two months, were for a string quartet, and another chamber work titled "The Glorious Ensemble."
Mr. Rieti taught at the Peabody Conservatory from 1948 to 1949, at the Chicago Musical College from 1950 to 1953, at Queens College from 1955 to 1960, and at the New York College of Music from 1960 to 1964.
He was often encouraged to write his memoirs but said he wasn't interested. "I haven't got records, and I have a bad memory," he told an interviewer in 1973. "Too bad. I've known so many people, but I've lost track."
Mr. Rieti was married in 1924 to Elsie Rappaport, who died in 1969. He is survived by his son, a painter in Paris; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

 BODY:
An article and a chart in Business Day on Friday, about consumer prices in January and the prospects for inflation, described a statistical index incorrectly. The index, based on a regional survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, measures the difference between the percentage of manufacturers in the Philadelphia area who said the prices they paid for raw materials and parts had risen from the previous month and the percentage who said prices had fallen. The index does not measure the prices themselves.

HEADLINE: New York's Information Underclass

 BODY:
Child number one owns a fancy computer setup that taps into electronic libraries all over the country. Child number two is computerless and poor in a rural area where the library is a single cramped room above the local gas station.
The first child is already primed for the Information Superhighway. The second child is stuck on what can only be called an Information Dirt Road. If Albany continues to starve the state library system, the gap between these information haves and have-nots will continue to grow, creating an information underclass that the state can ill afford. 
 The task of getting information to the small, isolated libraries falls to New York's library system, a loosely knit entity administered by the State Education Department. The system consists of 77 groups made up of nearly 9,000 libraries, including public libraries and those associated with schools, universities and hospitals. Local public libraries are financed mainly by municipalities.
The system, funded by the state, links local libraries through electronic catalogues, group buying agreements, inter-library loans and other supports. These services have grown dramatically more important since cash-starved cities and towns started cutting funds to local libraries. School libraries, meanwhile, are in scandalously bad shape; many cannot update even their encyclopedias.
Ideally, the state-financed library system would link the library in the mountains with the impressive holdings of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. That might never happen if the state continues to cheat the system out of money that it was promised and that it desperately needs.
In 1990, the Legislature passed a bill to give the system $15 million above the allocation at that time. But the state withheld the money because of the recession. Until last year, when a fraction of the promised funds were released, the system's budget had been frozen for seven years. Book acquisition fell to a dangerous low, journal subscriptions were dropped and computerization all but stopped.
Meanwhile, the demands have soared as immigrants continue to pour into the state, many turning to the libraries to learn about their new nation.
Gov. Mario Cuomo's current budget shortchanges the system yet again, by allocating only an extra $3 million instead of the balance of the $15 million previously promised. That is the difference between stabilizing a damaged system and letting it sink further into decline.
Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature need to stop starving the libraries. New York can pay in mere dollars now, or it can pay in illiteracy and work-force inferiority later.

HEADLINE: Frustration Over Haiti

 BODY:
It is not the business of the United States to forcibly reimpose democracy on Haiti. But neither is it the business of the United States to twist the arms of Haiti's democratically elected President. If he refuses to endorse proposals for political compromise or cabinet appointments urged on him by American and international mediators, it is wrong to ignore him.
In its double frustration with murderous and unyielding generals and a messianic and unbending President, that is just what the Clinton Administration has begun to do. It would do better to stick to democratic principles and learn to live with some of the resulting frustrations. It is for Haitians, and their elected leader, to decide if and when to yield. 
 Granted, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide can be a difficult man to deal with. Over the years, the strength of his political convictions has led Duvalierist gunmen to try to kill him and to burn his church to the ground, the Vatican to dismiss him from his religious order, and Haitian voters to make him the overwhelming winner of the freest election in Haiti's long history.
Less than a year after that election, those same unshakable convictions provoked soldiers, police and a tiny economic elite to depose him and drive him into exile. And almost ever since, those convictions have complicated the plans of two American Administrations to resolve Haiti's crisis with split-the-difference compromises between amoral usurpers with guns and a righteous exile with the country's only legitimate democratic mandate.
The unpleasant truth is that unless the United States is prepared to invade Haiti -- which it rightly is not -- no significant political changes are likely to take place without the ruling generals' consent. And if President Aristide has been a stubborn bargainer, the generals have been even more stubborn.
They have made it clear that they are dead set on staying put in Haiti and reaping the substantial profits of institutionalized corruption. And they remain utterly unmoved by the international sanctions that grind the faces of all those too poor and poorly connected to avail themselves of any of the numerous available loopholes.
So it is only honest for the United States to tell Father Aristide that he has little hope of returning to power without making large political compromises. But when the deposed President refuses to make the deals that Washington urges upon him, honoring democracy requires taking him at his word. Simply put, there can be no democracy in Haiti, at least during the current presidential term, without President Aristide.

HEADLINE: Executive on Hot Seat In Tokyo Trade Dispute

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Depending on one's point of view, Takeo Tsukada is either the culprit responsible for an escalating trade crisis between the United States and Japan or an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire.
Mr. Tsukada, who prefers the latter description, is president of the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, known as IDO, a provider of mobile telephone service that the United States Government accuses of failing to provide adequate access to Japan's cellular telephone market for equipment made by Motorola Inc. 
 Last week, the Clinton Administration said it would impose sanctions on Japan for violating a 1989 trade agreement intended to open Japan's market to the American cellular technology.
 
 
Motorola Called Selfish
 In an interview, Mr. Tsukada lashed out at Motorola for making what he called selfish demands that threaten to drive his company to bankruptcy.
At the last minute, he said, Motorola said sanctions could be avoided if IDO placed an immediate order for 225,000 Motorola portable telephones, which would have guaranteed Motorola a 50 percent share of IDO's anticipated cellular customers. IDO, he said, rejected the request as being impossible to fulfill and against free consumer choice.
Mr. Tsukada also expressed surprise that the American Government would bring all its weight to bear in the service of a single company.
"It's a dirty, collusive relationship between the Government and a private company," Mr. Tsukada said.
Motorola's main building in Tokyo has been splattered with graffiti in recent days. Slogans like "Crush the hard-selling diplomacy of U.S. imperialists" were painted on the walls.
As Mr. Tsukada tells it, there is no plot to keep Motorola out of the Japanese market. In 1987, Japan's Government decided to allow one company in each market to compete in cellular telephone service with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Japan's main phone company.
IDO won the franchise for the corridor from Tokyo to Nagoya. It built its system using technology developed by N.T.T., Mr. Tsukada said, not to block Motorola but because it already had a proven track record in Japan. The DDI Corporation, which won the franchise for the rest of Japan, chose Motorola's technology.
Still, the United States complained that it was unfair that the Motorola system was not being used in the highly populated corridor. In 1989, the cellular phone trade accord was signed to open the Tokyo-Nagoya market to Motorola. IDO was persuaded by Japan's Government to build a second system using the Motorola technology.
IDO could not afford to build two systems, Mr. Tsukada said. So it put more emphasis on the N.T.T. system, not to block Motorola but simply because it had started on the N.T.T. system first and needed to build it up quickly so it could compete. The result is that today, IDO has about 310,000 customers for its N.T.T.-compatible system and only a few more than 10,000 for the Motorola system.
Even Motorola executives say that IDO was saddled somewhat against its will with the franchise for the Motorola technology. But that has not stopped the company, based in Schaumburg, Ill., from complaining that IDO has dragged its feet in building the system.
Mr. Tsukada, a former Toyota executive who helped to establish that company's joint manufacturing venture with General Motors in California, said Motorola had overstepped its bounds. "Motorola has been behaving as if it has the authority to intervene in IDO's operation or as if it is representing the U.S. Government," he said.
Mr. Tsukada said IDO had proposed to build up the Motorola system over the next three years as fast as it could without endangering its already fragile economic health.
In the fiscal year that ended in March, IDO, which is privately held, had pretax profits of only 856 million yen, or about $8.3 million at current exchange rates, on sales of 81.1 billion yen, or $787 million, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit research firm. The company's debt of about 200 billion yen, or $1.94 billion, dwarfs its equity of 11.4 billion yen, or $110 million. The company has never paid a dividend and will not do so until the end of the century, Mr. Tsukada said.
 
Motorola's View
 Both Motorola and the Clinton Administration have rejected IDO's proposed construction schedule as inadequate. "We obviously do not want to see any of our customers in a loss," said Arnold S. Brenner, executive vice president and general manager of the Japan Group of Motorola. But he said that since Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications chose IDO, "it is the M.P.T.'s responsibility to make sure the company is financially and technically able to handle both systems."
In light of the looming American sanctions, Mr. Tsukada said, IDO is ready to review its investment program again, but has no practical ideas for what it could do to satisfy the Americans.
He rejected an idea proposed by Washington -- that the frequencies for the Motorola system be given to another company with more of a financial incentive to promote the American technology.
Mr. Tsukada also said that IDO is now shifting its strategy to favor the Motorola technology because it is better than N.T.T.'s.

HEADLINE: As Market Pressures Build, Fed Chief Goes to Congress

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, will deliver his semiannual report on interest rates to a Congressional panel on Tuesday against a backdrop of pressure from financial markets for a second increase, a move the Fed is believed to be trying to avoid for now.
The pressure from bond traders, who are steadily pushing up long-term interest rates and pushing down bond prices, is only one reason Mr. Greenspan's testimony before a House Banking subcommittee could scarcely come at a more awkward time for the nation's central bank. 
 The Fed's last increase, a quarter-of-a-percentage point rise in the Federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks, was made on Feb. 4, and was intended to hold down long-term rates. But it has had the reverse effect in the bond market. Long-term rates have also risen, to a yield of 6.62 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond, with most of that increase in the last several days.
"There are some Congressmen and Senators that are regular Fed-bashers, and this is an opportunity for them to do some bashing," said Laurence M. Ball, a macroeconomist at Johns Hopkins University.
White House economists count themselves among those who had not expected the recent increase in long-term rates from daily trading. "This has caught us by surprise just as it has caught most people by surprise," said Alan S. Blinder, one of three members of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. He added that long-term interest rates now slightly exceed Administration estimates for this year.
Mr. Blinder said investors were overreacting to recent signs of the nation's improving economic health and the resulting possibility of inflation. "That is no reason for the kind of interest-rate creep we have," he said.
Many economists, including some with close links to the Fed, predict that Mr. Greenspan will give few clear signs that another rate increase might be imminent. They predict that Mr. Greenspan will instead forecast that the economy will grow about 3 percent this year and conclude that such a growth rate can be sustained, at least this year, without fueling inflation.
But they nonetheless expect Mr. Greenspan to repeat his many warnings that the Fed would be ready to change direction quickly if prices do begin to rise.
"I do not expect to see any change in the Federal funds target in the next several months," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former Fed governor.
The Fed's defenders say an increase in long-term rates this spring may have been inevitable, given the widespread perception that a strengthening economy can eventually lead to higher inflation and lower bond prices.
"The Fed acted responsibly -- it was the correct thing for them to do," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President George Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. "If the Fed had not done this, there would have been a much larger adjustment down the road."
Other economists say that the recent sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen may have badly hurt speculative traders, who then pulled back from the American bond market. The decline of the dollar, and the possibility of further declines, given Japanese-American trade tensions, made dollar-denominated investments less desirable to international investors, and thus interest rates needed to rise to attract those investors.
 
Chain Reaction of Sorts
 The most common explanation among economists of why short-term rates sent long-term rates upward is that the Fed's action on Feb. 4 changed investors' expectations of future inflation. By raising interest rates, the Fed signaled that it was worried about inflation, and that convinced many investors that they should also be worried, Mr. Ball said.
"I suspect that the Fed's action had some effect on the psychology of the market," he said, "and that had the effect of pushing long-term interest rates higher."
Still, compared with many interest-rate moves in the last dozen years, these shifts are tiny. In the last two months of 1991, for example, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point.
Gene B. Sperling, a senior White House economic adviser, tried to present the bright side of recent interest-rate increases, pointing out that "30-year bonds are still a point below where they were when Bill Clinton was elected." These bonds yielded 7.65 percent on Nov. 3, 1992, the day after the election.
The timing of Mr. Greenspan's testimony on Tuesday is especially awkward for the Fed because it is also fighting an effort by the Treasury Department to take away most of its responsibilities for bank supervision.

HEADLINE: Disappointing Year for Mexican Economy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DEPALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Contrary to recent Government projections showing a moderate rebound, Mexico's economy grew only four-tenths of 1 percent last year, the weakest performance in the five years of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration.
In November, Mexico's Finance Minister had projected that the economy would increase 1.1 percent in 1993. 
 The fourth-quarter results were especially disappointing, coming after the passage in November of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada. The Mexican economy expanded only two-tenths of a percent in the quarter, allowing the economy to barely escape a classic recession, which economists consider to be two consecutive quarters of decline. In the third quarter, the Mexican economy fell 1.1 percent.
 
 
Worrisome Figures
 The year-end figures, released late Friday, present a worrisome picture for a country adjusting to a free trade agreement with a powerful neighbor while also trying to settle an armed uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. The rebellion was based in large part on the feeling among many Mexicans that they have not benefited from the economic changes of the last few years.
Mexico's manufacturing sector showed particularly poor results in 1993. Over all, manufacturing dropped 1.5 percent, but certain industries did much worse. Textiles, for example, dropped 7.4 percent, paper and printing fell 6.4 percent and lumber was down 10.1 percent.
"Only very late is the business community waking up and expressing concerns about how we translate macroeconomic policy to growth-related activities," Gabriel Szekely, a consultant in Mexico City, said. "The picture for 1994 is not very promising because of the reluctance of policy makers to come up with some type of industrial policy to identify sectors where Mexico can aspire to some competitive advantage."
There were a few bright spots in the year-end report. The financial services sector grew 4.9 percent, more than double the rate in 1992. And the agricultural sector rose 1.8 percent, compared with a drop of 1.5 percent a year earlier. However, that figure generally represents large growers, not the majority of the country's subsistence-level farmers.
And Mexico's trade deficit dropped 15.1 percent last year, to $13.54 billion.
Jonathan Heath, director of Macro Asesoria Economica, a consulting firm in Mexico City, said the lack of growth was caused by strict Government fiscal and monetary policy related to uncertainty over the fate of the free trade agreement. He said the Government maintained high interest rates for treasury notes to prevent an outflow of capital while the trade pact was being decided.
The Government was also intent on taming inflation. The money supply was kept limited and inflation increased at 8 percent, the lowest rate in 20 years.
The economic forecast for 1994 is substantially different from last year's. The trade pact is now in effect and 1994 is an election year. Even before the Chiapas uprising, the Government had decided to increase social spending substantially and stimulate the economy with public works projects.
Finance officials said last year that this could be done while still maintaining a balanced budget, but most analysts now expect a 1994 deficit that will be the equivalent of about 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Government officials have forecast a growth rate for 1994 of 3 percent, with 5 percent inflation. Mr. Heath finds those projections on target despite the economy's present weakness.

HEADLINE: Buffalo Rethinks Downtown Car Ban

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Feb. 21

 BODY:
It's been years since anyone arrived by cab beneath the marquee of the Shea's Buffalo theater or jockeyed for a parking space in front of A M & A's department store.
It's been a decade, in fact, since this city ripped up the busiest section of its Main Street, banishing the automobile in a quest for urban renewal and better mass transit. 
 Now some are having second thoughts.
Local officials have begun discussing the possibility of allowing cars back on the 1.2 miles of Main Street that were transformed into a pedestrian-transit mall, one of the largest malls of its type in the nation. The $42 million project, which includes a trolley-like light-rail line, formally opened as Buffalo Place in 1987.
Some now say it was a mistake to eliminate auto traffic completely. Chief among them is Richard T. Reinhard, executive director of Buffalo Place Inc., the nonprofit corporation responsible for maintaining and promoting the mall.
 
Seasonal Variance
 "Our transit mall works exceptionally well May through September, Monday through Friday, 11 A.M. through 2 P.M.," Mr. Reinhard said. "There are sidewalk cafes, sidewalk vendors, street performers. It's almost a storybook environment."
But, he added: "The rest of the time, it doesn't work. People can't find Main Street. Pedestrians feel all alone on Main Street. People don't enjoy Main Street."
Mr. Reinhard would like to keep the cafes and outdoor concerts that are so popular with summer lunchtime crowds, while allowing auto traffic alongside the Metro Rail line that now runs down the street's center. That would make businesses and theaters along the street more accessible, while the traffic would create a sense of activity during off-hours, he said.
Transforming the mall, again, would be expensive, involving the replacement of Metro Rail passenger stations, which also house the electronics controlling the transit system.
 
Another Round of Financing
 Richard T. Swist, executive director of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, said that getting money for car lanes would mean going back to the Federal and state transportation projects that provided the bulk of the original financing.
"I think their view would be, they've already invested in this once and if they're going to do it again, they'd want to know why," he said. "And the reasons better be compelling."
Buffalo is among scores of American cities that have turned downtown streets into pedestrian malls since the 1960's in an effort to compete with the suburbs. And it is far from the first to question whether the transformation was a mistake, said Fred Kent, president of the Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit group based in New York City that advises communities on the design of public spaces.
"A shopping mall is a shopping machine," Mr. Kent said. "A main street is different. It's a public space, and there are all kinds of things going on."
He said some of the more successful downtown pedestrian malls, such as one in Portland, Ore., allow limited auto traffic. "You need cars to be part of any environment, but in a more compatible way," he said.
Despite some vacant storefronts, the mall is far from a ghost town -- during the day, anyway. Since Buffalo Place opened, a new hotel, office buildings, a movie theater and an outdoor ice rink have been built in the district.
As many as 60,000 people visit the mall daily, at least on the sunny summer weekdays when pedestrian surveys have been made.
"But that's still not enough to support a significant amount of retail and restaurants," Mr. Reinhard said.
Patrick Fagan, executive vice president of Shea's Buffalo, a 3,183-seat theater on the mall, said most of his audience for touring Broadway shows and other performances now enters through a side door, which faces an open street.
It is his belief that reopening Main Street on at least a limited basis could change things only for the better. "To me, a traffic jam ain't bad," he said. "That means there's activity."
Still, the auto-less mall has its defenders.
Harold L. Cohen, a member of the citizen committee that worked with the transportation authority on the project's design, said the mall should have been more inviting to pedestrians, but construction costs took money meant for shelters, heated walkways and additional lighting.
"All the things that were supposed to be done to make it a pedestrian mall weren't done," said Mr. Cohen, dean emeritus of the State University at Buffalo's School of Architecture and Planning. "You can't blame the poor flower if it didn't grow because you didn't water it."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
U.S. Offers Pact To the Muslims And the Croats

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Feb. 21

 BODY:
While attention over the last two weeks has focused on the showdown around Sarajevo, United States diplomats have been pressing a peace plan for other regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina where there has been fighting between Croatian forces and the mostly Muslim Bosnian Army.
A broad outline under consideration would end their battle for territory and create a joint sovereign state from land they control in a economic and commercial federation with Croatia. The next step, Croats here said, would be to invite the Bosnian Serbs to join a new Bosnian state under a political arrangement that has not yet been defined. 
 At this point there seems to be little reason for the Serbs to accept such an agreement, but Charles E. Redman, the United States special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, told reporters here today: "The Croats do not want to close the door on the Serbs. The question is, how does one best arrange the table so we can get to the Serbs with something that can be acceptable?"
 
Cease-Fire Sought
 People close to the talks, including high-level Croatian officials, said they and the Bosnian leadership were in full agreement on an eventual confederation between Zagreb and any joint Croatian-Muslim Bosnian state.
As a key part of the political proposal, Croatian officials here said they also hoped that Croatian and Bosnian Government military leaders would sign a cease-fire as early as this week covering central and southern Bosnia. Until a year ago, when they began battling over territory they shared in central Bosnia, they had been nominal allies against the Serbs.
In their search for a negotiated settlement in Bosnia, representatives from the United States, Russia, Canada and European nations are to meet in Bonn this week to consider extending the Sarajevo demilitarization effort to eastern Bosnia, including Tuzla and Srebrenica, where the United Nations has been prevented from delivering aid and relieving peacekeeping troops.
Mr. Redman said he was working with the support and cooperation of the European Union to broker a deal between Croats and Muslims, and he took pains to describe his negotiations as being on a "parallel track" with talks under way in Geneva.
But in some ways, the new proposal seems to offer an entirely new basis for settlement: Rather than trying to get all three sides to accept a settlement in which Bosnia is divided into three ethnic republics, as the latest United Nations and European plan proposed, Washington appears to be encouraging the Croats and Muslims to reach a separate settlement.
 
Several Obstacles Remain
 The plan faces several obstacles, not the least of which have been months of war between Muslims and Croats. Croatian gunners around the southwestern city of Mostar have enforced an eight-month-old siege that has killed or wounded hundreds and have cut off electricity and food to Muslims trapped in the city's ruins.
Croats here acknowledged that the two sides had not yet worked out the political framework for sharing power within the joint Bosnian state. The Croats prefer the federal state to be divided among two republics, while the Bosnian Government leaders want power shared among an undisclosed number of ethnically mixed cantons. No maps or geographical details are available, but the two groups combined control only about 30 percent of Bosnia at the moment.
Croats and Muslims have discussed confederation before, and Lord Owen, the Europe Union mediator, discussed it at length with the two sides. But the idea has been given new momentum by Washington, which is making its first serious foray into the peace efforts.

HEADLINE: Democrats Face Hard Choices in Welfare Overhaul

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Something strange happened last week in the office of Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director, and it illustrates the topsy-turvy forces now shaping the Administration's welfare plan.
Desperately seeking ways to pay for it, Democrats began talking about cuts in the food stamp program. Big cuts. Cuts as large as the ones Ronald Reagan proposed. 
 Mr. Panetta seemed skeptical of the idea, which was offered by an aide, and when word spread later in the week, his spokesman ruled it out. But across the Government similar conversations are occurring daily.
Democrats, straining to finance President Clinton's welfare promises, are searching for the money in the same anti-poverty programs they spent the last decade defending.
 
Facing Tough Bind
 For some people involved, the revenue hunt has become the equivalent of eating their young, and the process is aggravating nerves, tempers and the occasional friendship.
The Administration is in this bind because it is striving to avoid tax increases, a decision that has left some officials disgruntled. They point to a memorandum that Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, sent President Clinton in December.
The memo suggested that tens of billions of dollars could be raised by changing provisions it called "tax breaks" for the prosperous. Mr. Reich, for instance, suggested reducing interest deductions for expensive homes or raising taxes on inherited stock.
But the subject of taxes is so sensitive that a call to the Labor Department on the matter brought an unsolicited response from the White House.
"This is not a memo that's under serious consideration, I just want to tell you," said Gene Sperling, a White House economics adviser. "We want a no-tax budget."
 
Choices Are Uninviting
 The failure to find a politically acceptable solution would doom one of Mr. Clinton's most popular campaign promises. He has pledged to expand training opportunities for welfare recipients and then force those still unemployed after two years to join a work program. His aides have said that the plan could cost as much as $7 billion a year when fully carried out.
Antipoverty programs can, of course, become as fat or flawed as any others. "Just because a program is targeted on the poor doesn't mean we shouldn't touch it," said one Administration official. "It might not be doing a good job."
But the biographies of those involved are not ones of typical budget cutters.
David T. Ellwood, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, came from Harvard University, where he was a prominent advocate for low-income people. Wendell E. Primus, his chief assistant, had been a Capitol Hill legend for finding money for antipoverty efforts.
Isabel V. Sawhill, a White House budget aide, was an academic specialist on rising income inequality. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, was chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund.
Now they are thinking about cutting disability payments, denying help to legal immigrants and reducing homeless prevention programs. But they are not discussing it. "Some of these ideas may be distasteful to the people who draft them," said Avis Lavelle, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.
 
Many Competing ClaimsA Binding Deficit
 The process also shows how a Government can spend $1.5 trillion a year and still consider itself broke. The 1990 budget law requires any new spending to be paid for with offsetting taxes or cuts.
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, would not flatly rule out a tax increase to pay for the welfare plan. But on Friday she repeated the guiding assumption: the proposal, which Mr. Clinton pledged to deliver to Congress this spring, "would be paid for by offsetting cuts in other programs."
And since welfare is an "entitlement program," the budget law requires the cuts to come from similar programs. Social Security, which costs $335 billion a year, is the largest. But the Administration has already shot down a suggested $1.2 billion trim, fearing the reaction from the lobby for the elderly.
Medicare and Medicaid, which together account for $273 billion, are the next two largest. But President Clinton is trying to restrain their growth to finance changes in health care.
Most of what is left affects poor people, and since those programs are much smaller, the cuts loom larger in proportion. The largest welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, costs about $23 billion a year. Food stamps cost about $24 billion. The Supplemental Security Income program, which provides payments to the indigent elderly and disabled, accounts for about $22 billion.
 
Making Some Suggestions
 In outlining possible tax increases, Mr. Reich was suggesting ways to get more money for the domestic agenda in general, not for the welfare plan. In his memo to the President he took pains to write that these were suggestions rather than firm recommendations.
Mr. Reich, for instance, took a dim view of the law that allows homeowners tax deductions for the interest on mortgages of up to $1 million. He wrote that "lowering the cap to $500,000 would raise about $4 billion over 5 years." He also talked about ending what he called tax breaks for companies with foreign subsidiaries and those involved in mergers and acquisitions.
A copy of the memo was provided by a White House official who argued that the hunt for revenue should be broadened. "Most of the things on that sheet are giveaways to rich people," the official said.
Mr. Reich, who was traveling, could not be reached. But Eugene Steuerle, a Washington tax expert, said many ideas on Mr. Reich's list had been proposed in the past, only to die from political opposition and technical complexity.
Mr. Ellwood and Mr. Primus, the human services officials, presented their proposed cuts at a meeting at the White House on Jan. 25. One still being considered is a plan to curb S.S.I. and Medicaid payments to legal immigrants until they become citizens. The move could raise $1.8 billion a year.
Several other items on the list have already been ruled out. After learning that the White House was thinking about taxing welfare benefits, Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is on the Ways and Means Committee, called the idea "just damn stupid."
Mr. Clinton, who is courting allies like Mr. Matsui for his health plan, publicly buried the idea last week with a single word. Asked if he would consider it, he said, "No."
The scene in Mr. Panetta's office last week captured the difficult dynamics that may continue to play out in the weeks ahead.
Ms. Sawhill, the budget aide, suggested giving fewer food stamps to people who get housing aid. There is a fairness argument involved. People who receive housing assistance have arguably more money left over for food than other low-income people, but they receive the same amount of food stamps.
The idea was opposed by Thomas J. Downey, a former Democratic Congressman from Suffolk County, and Robert Greenstein, an advocate who ran the food stamp program under Jimmy Carter.
Mr. Greenstein gave Mr. Panetta a memo that called the cuts devastating.
"About two million households would have their food stamps terminated or cut," said the memo, which has circulated at the human services department, the Agriculture Department, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And 60 percent of the families with children affected "have cash incomes below half the poverty line."
Mr. Greenstein would not comment on the issue, saying that his discussions with the Administration were confidential. But his strategy seemed to work. Barry Toiv, the budget office spokesman, said on Friday that the food stamp idea had been "ruled out."

HEADLINE: Japan, Bowing to Pressure, Defers Plutonium Projects

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Bowing to international pressure, Japan has decided to postpone, for as long as 20 years, a series of multibillion-dollar nuclear power projects that would add tremendously to the world oversupply of plutonium, Japanese and American officials say.
The decision, to be announced in the next few months, came after a yearlong reassessment of Japan's ambitious but politically troublesome nuclear energy program and stemmed largely from the international outcry last year over Japan's sea shipment from Europe of more than a ton of plutonium, a highly toxic and radioactive material that is a fuel for nuclear weapons. Several of Japan's Asian neighbors banned the shipment from passing through their waters, fearing an accident or terrorist incident. 
 The Government's decision affects the schedule for building several breeder reactors -- which are nuclear power plants that both consume and produce plutonium -- and a second reprocessing plant, which turns ordinary nuclear waste into plutonium. It also seems bound to cut sharply the shipments of plutonium from Europe because Japan will have far less capacity to use the plutonium fuel.
The Government's decision is also motivated partly by fears among Japan's huge utility companies that the country's policy to create a "nuclear fuel cycle" -- turning nuclear waste into plutonium fuel -- was quickly becoming a financial fiasco, one that could cost them billions of dollars.
 
Policy Is Retained
 Japanese officials say they have no intention of abandoning their fuel-recycling policy. But the delays are clearly an effort to back away, and many of them concede that they were shocked by the scope of international protests generated by the first plutonium shipment. Officially, about two sea shipments of one to two tons are planned annually for the next 18 years, although that plan also seems bound to be drastically changed.
What to do with that plutonium is becoming a major problem: Tokyo clearly fears that the political liabilities will mount in coming years if Japan is unable to burn all the plutonium it plans to produce or import. Plutonium stockpiles would only add to suspicions abroad, denied by Japan, that Tokyo has ulterior motives and is keeping its options open in case it ever needs to develop nuclear weapons.
Looming large against this background is North Korea, which is widely suspected of operating a nuclear weapons program. Even without a weapons project in Japan, many Asian nations say, the mere presence of large amounts of plutonium in the country constitutes a latent nuclear capability.
"Our basic policy is still in place, but now we are looking out at the year 2020, or maybe 2050," a senior Government official involved in the debate said last week. "Politically, it is clear that this is not the time to be producing plutonium, shipping it around the world or storing it."
The Clinton Administration, fearful of adding to its tensions with Washington's biggest ally in the Pacific, has never publicly opposed Japan's plans to build breeder reactors or the reprocessing centers needed to convert nuclear waste. In fact, the non-proliferation policies issued by the White House last year gave a specific exemption to Japan's project, and to reprocessing centers in England and France that depend heavily on Japan's business.
 
U.S. Halted Program
 But the United States halted its own breeder reactor program 15 years ago, largely to stop the spread of bomb-grade materials. American officials have made little secret of their concern that Japan's program would add tremendously to the glut of plutonium created by the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet republics.
While Japan's plutonium is "reactor grade," meaning it is made for energy production instead of weapons, the National Academy of Sciences recently concluded that such material could be used to make a bomb, heightening the concerns that the supplies could fall into the hands of terrorists or aspiring nuclear nations, including Iran, Iraq and North Korea.
"The overall program is now seen as more trouble than it is worth, in terms of the money and the politics," said Paul Leventhal, the president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a group in Washington that has led the lobbying effort against Japan's plutonium plans. It has suggested instead that Tokyo buy and stockpile large amounts of uranium, which is far more difficult to turn into nuclear weapons.
"The increasing international pressure because of the program has created a perception abroad that Japan is interested in preserving the nuclear weapons option," Mr. Leventhal said. Tokyo, he added, "is finding it more difficult to blunt that perception."
 
Trying to Avoid Debate
 While the wisdom of Japan's energy strategy has been widely debated abroad, the Government here has done everything it can to suppress open arguments that could stir a Japanese public when there is growing sentiment against nuclear power, especially as the authorities try to find sites for new plants. But some Japanese scientists are beginning to chafe.
"There are almost no open arguments on the issue," Prof. Kazuo Furukawa of Tokai University wrote recently in Asahi Shimbun. With the Government and some Government-controlled nuclear institutes commanding the research money, he added, "there is no democratic climate, and the debate has created factions and authoritarian tendencies."
Nonetheless, as a study commission has worked in secret on Japan's long-term energy plan, details have gradually been leaking out. Every week now Japanese news organizations are reporting that one element or another of the program will be delayed.
Next month, for instance, Japan will finally activate a $5 billion breeder reactor called Monju, named for the Buddhist divinity of wisdom, several years behind schedule. The huge complex, on a remote peninsula on the Sea of Japan, was originally supposed to be the first of a series of breeders that would fundamentally change the nuclear power industry here.
But Monju will be so expensive to run that the construction of a second reactor, originally planned to begin immediately, will now apparently not start until the year 2000, at the earliest. In fact, the Government has yet to find a site for the next reactor; so far, none of the country's local prefectural governments wants it to be built in its region.
 
Another Project Delayed
 Several days ago the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, reported that the completion of another major project, a second "reprocessing plant," which would convert the fuel to reactor-grade plutonium, would be also delayed -- from the year 2010 to the year 2030. Construction of the first reprocessing plant has already begun, but many experts say they have their doubts about when it will open.
By American standards, delaying huge technology projects by a generation, rather than canceling them outright, may seem ludicrous. But in Japan, few big projects are ever killed. Instead, they remain forever in the planning stage, keeping a vast bureaucracy at work. Already the Government-created corporations managing the nuclear fuel cycle have employed thousands. Terminating it would be politically unacceptable.
By slowing the program drastically, however, the Government appears to be betting that it can silence its international critics without visibly cutting back on employment. If the political atmosphere changes, or another energy crisis strikes, the program would be waiting in the wings.
The program that Japan is being forced to delay is already nearly 30 years old. In 1966, encouraged by the United States, Japan adopted a plan to build a series of breeder reactors around the country and become a leader in the technology. It seemed to make tremendous economic sense. By the 1990's, the Government said, uranium would be scarce and expensive, making the high cost of recovering plutonium from spent nuclear fuel a bargain.
 
Uranium Prices Plunge
 But the projections went wildly awry. Uranium prices have plunged, making the breeder reactors 5 to 15 times more expensive to run than conventional nuclear power plants. The United States dropped out of the breeder reactor business. Then the end of the cold war created the glut in plutonium. That heightened fears that the world oversupply was worsening, just as Japan set about producing more.
But once Japan was on the road to recycling, it seemed that there was no turning back. It has already shipped undetermined number of tons of nuclear waste to Europe, reportedly spending as much as $3 billion in secret agreements to help Britain and France build reprocessing installations that would convert the waste to plutonium.
The shipment that caused the protests in January 1993 was the first load of plutonium to arrive back in Japan from Europe. Along the way, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and the Philippines asked Japan to keep the ship well away from their waters.
Based largely on Japan's commitments, England recently commissioned its new nuclear reprocessor, after a long political battle. But Japan has scheduled no further shipments, in part because it does not have the installations to burn the plutonium.

Prison Lures Them In (as Tourists)

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Feb. 19

 BODY:
South Carolina's state penitentiary has been both an eyesore and a curiosity on the riverside in this stately capital city since shortly after the Civil War.
The subject of a Federal court order for overcrowding, and with a section condemned by the city government, the prison was closed by the South Carolina Department of Corrections last month. 
 But now the "prison from hell," as it came to be known, is the object of curiosity. Thousands of people asked to see the inside before the prison is torn down, so corrections officials decided to open it for tours, starting today and continuing on weekends until mid-March.
"People have driven by it all their lives and are curious about it," said Robyn Zimmerman, the director of public affairs for the Department of Corrections.
The first day of tours drew 3,300 visitors. Among other things, they saw the chair that electrocuted 243 inmates and a tunnel that was the site of untold inmate stabbings and other violence.
The City of Columbia has a contract to buy the prison property for $3.2 million but will not take possession until this summer. City officials hope to use the 25-acre site, which is beside the Columbia Canal and the Congaree River, for shops, restaurants, loft residences and offices. The South Carolina Film Commission is trying to interest Hollywood in using the oldest part of the prison as a movie set.
Until the last group of inmates was moved on Jan. 21, the prison, Central Correctional Institution, was one of the oldest state prisons still in use in the nation. When it was built in 1867, the five-story castle-like structure cost the state $65,000. The building, which eventually included several additions, was South Carolina's only maximum-security prison until 1975, when another opened.
South Carolina imprisons more people, per capita, than any other state, and has 32 state prisons.
Executions were performed at Central Correctional from 1912 until 1986, when the death house was relocated to the Broad River Correctional Institution, the state's main prison complex, also in Columbia. Among the executions was that of a 14-year-old black boy, George Stinney Jr., whose electrocution in 1944 made him the youngest person legally put to death in the United States in this century.
South Carolina's most notorious criminals spent time at Central Correctional, including Donald H. (Pee Wee) Gaskins, who in 1991 became the only white man to be executed in South Carolina for killing a black man. Mr. Gaskins, who was serving a life sentence for murder, was put to death for constructing a bomb that killed another inmate, Rudolph Tyner, in his cell. The cell where Mr. Tyner died is on the tour, said Charles Cepak, the outgoing warden.
The tunnel was designed to link all major parts of the prison and is a feature that made the prison one of the hardest in the state to manage.
"I don't know how many stabbings have occurred in this tunnel," said Corrections Commissioner Parker Evatt, "and it might be because someone got a bigger piece of chicken." In 1968, a riot began in the tunnel and spilled out onto the yard. Dozens of inmates were injured.
The prison's oldest section, Cellblock 1, was condemned some years ago. Its cells have floor space of only 5 by 6 feet and ceilings only 6 1/2 feet high. The walls are of 18-inch-thick granite and the door openings are only 25 inches across. Nevertheless, many inmates preferred Cellblock 1 because it often meant they could have private quarters.
But not always: as recently as the 1970's, there were cases of three inmates sharing one of those cells.
Preparing for the public tours has involved a great deal of cleaning -- and some interesting findings. "You wouldn't believe the filth," said Nelly Gasaway, a Central Corrections guard for two decades.
Officials found a plaque on a wall that had been set in place in 1904. When they pried it loose, they discovered behind it a battered copper box about the size of a shoebox, Ms. Zimmerman said. She said the box might be a time capsule because something can be heard rattling inside. It will not be opened until March 3, when a reunion of prison employees is held.
Prisoners left behind a wide variety of items, including toasters, radios, television sets, fans and about 50 cats that lived mainly in the prison yard. The cats are being taken to an animal welfare organization, and the appliances, probably part of the prison's underground economy, will be donated to charity.
"It's like an abandoned village," Mr. Cepak said.

HEADLINE: The Pain of British Privatizations Has Yielded a String of Successes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Not too long ago, the idea would have been laughable: BMW, a name synonymous with German quality and industrial prowess, paying $1.2 billion to acquire Rover, the struggling car maker and a name once synonymous here with British clunkers and industrial decline.
But in the five and a half years since the British Government privatized Rover and cut off the billions of dollars in subsidies that had sustained it for more than a decade, the company has completed a remarkable turnaround. Quality, design and efficiency have improved tremendously. Last year it was one of the few European auto makers to weather a sales slump profitably. 
 BMW, which announced last month that it was buying Rover from British Aerospace P.L.C., said it saw great potential to increase Rover's sales at home and around the world.
The transformation of Rover is just one example of how a number of companies, from British Airways to British Steel, were put through the crucible of Britain's aggressive privatization program during the 1980's and have emerged stronger and more nimble.
 
 
Mass Layoffs
 Freed from the embrace of Government bureaucracy and cut off from its financial support, many of the country's biggest corporations have remade themselves for a world in which their survival depends not on subsidies but on satisfying customers and shareholders.
They and their employees have suffered considerable upheaval, including mass layoffs. In the process, however, they have helped big British industries become more competitive internationally. Although it is impossible to quantify their effect on economic growth, they have clearly helped restore something of the nation's economic reputation.
The question of how much credit to give the privatization program remains hotly debated here, as is nearly every aspect of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's legacy. But with many of the companies involved having continued to expand and strengthen themselves despite a deep recession in Europe and Britain, there is little doubt that the whip hand of privatization is at least partly responsible for the change.
Here are some of the most prominent examples:
*At a time when nearly all the world's airlines have been suffering financial losses, British Airways has been among the world's most profitable for several years, and despite the recession has built itself into one of the world's few truly global carriers through investments in airlines like USAir and Qantas.
*British Telecommunications, long a stodgy, high-cost phone company with poor service, has slashed prices and improved service to stave off intense new competition at home and has taken a $4.3 billion 20 percent stake in MCI of the United States, a move that should allow it to expand worldwide.
*British Steel is the only big steelmaker in Europe that is profitable.
*BAA, the company that owns and operates Heathrow, Gatwick and other international airports in Britain, has more than doubled its profits since privatization in 1987 and is expanding its management services into the United States and Asia.
*NFC, formerly National Freight Consortium, bought Allied Van Lines in the United States as part of an ambitious expansion drive. Privatized through an employee-led buyout in 1982, the company went public in 1989 and has pushed sales and profits consistently higher since then. A share that was worth 1 at the time of the buyout would now be worth 160.
*Cable and Wireless slashed the work force at its headquarters, pushed authority and responsibility out to its operating units around the world and has seen its profits rise to an estimated $1.5 billion last year, from about $100 million a year, as it began privatizing in the early 1980's.
"All these companies that were moribund parts of the state sector are now out competing around the world," Lord Young, who was an early proponent of privatization, said. "It's been incredibly important for Britain."
Not every privatized company has flourished or even survived. Moreover, analysts, economists and business executives said it would be wrong to attribute all the improvement to privatization. The move away from state ownership, they said, was only important in the context of a wide range of Government policies that had the intention of deregulating industry, creating more competition and removing barriers to foreign trade and investment.
"I can be fairly unequivocal in saying that we're better off than if privatization had not happened," said John Kay, the chairman of London Economics, a consulting firm, and an economics professor at the London Business School. "But the other market-oriented reforms are in many ways as important a part of the story as privatization itself."
 Still, it was privatization that was the most visible and in many ways the most far-reaching change to sweep through British industry starting in the early 1980's. Both because it helped raise money for the Government -- more than $80 billion so far -- and because it fit neatly with the hard-line free market ideology espoused by Mrs. Thatcher upon taking office as prime minister in 1979, Britain has privatized or sold controlling stakes in 47 big companies and dozens of smaller ones. The bulk of the privatizations took place from 1981 to 1989 through public share offerings, management buyouts and direct sales to private-sector companies.
Privatization has not been uniformly successful. Leyland Bus, once the country's dominant bus manufacturer, was privatized through a management buyout in 1987 and sold to Volvo of Sweden a year later. Last year, after $150 million in losses, Volvo completed the closing of nearly all the company's operations.
Jaguar, the car maker that was privatized in 1984 and acquired by the Ford Motor Company five years later, continues to lose money, in part because of the worldwide downturn in auto sales, and Ford recently took a charge of $109 million to account for the latest costs of its turnaround effort.
Even for those companies that benefited, the process was far from pain free. In many cases there was considerable upheaval, including large-scale job losses.
 
 
'Major Shift'
 "Nationalized companies were insulated from the markets," said Keith Bradley, the director of the Business Performance Group at the London School of Economics. "You didn't have incentive for management change, and you didn't have incentive for organizational or technological change under that type of management culture. There was a major shift when these companies were suddenly exposed to markets and the realization dawned that they could go bankrupt or be taken over."
At Rover, for example, employment fell to 42,300 in 1988, from 157,000 in 1980, a drop of 73 percent, as the company was prepared for private ownership; it now stands at 33,000. At the same time, however, Rover's quality and efficiency were improving sharply, largely because of a partnership forged with Honda, the Japanese auto maker, which was encouraged by the Thatcher Government to invest in Britain.
[Honda, which owns 20 percent of Rover's car-making operations, was clearly rankled when BMW moved it aside to acquire control. As a result, Honda said Monday that it would cut its ties to Rover.]
In addition to cutting costs, most privatized companies have successfully remade their corporate cultures along less bureaucratic and more entrepreneurial lines, enabling them to respond more quickly to opportunities and changes in the market.
At British Steel, most of the plant closings and work force reductions took place in the years before privatization. The move into the private sector, by eliminating the need for consultation with the Government on every big decision, allowed the company's management to move more quickly to make acquisitions at home and abroad, and to close inefficient plants without political interference.
"The principal advantage for British Steel has been in shortening the decision-making chain," a spokesman for the company said.
 
 
Paying Attention to Customers
 The process has also forced companies to pay far more attention than before to their customers. British Telecom, which had become infamous for its uncaring attitude toward consumers, quickly changed its stripes at the time of privatization.
Responding to widespread complaints that there were not enough pay phones available and that many were not working, the company added 45 percent more of them and increased the number working to 95 percent last year, from 77 percent in the early 1980's. Faced with competition for the first time from upstart providers of residential and business phone service, the company reduced rates by 27 percent from 1984 to 1993, according to Government figures.
Prime Minister John Major, who succeeded Mrs. Thatcher (now Lady Thatcher) in 1990, has pressed ahead with the policy, although even some members of his Government have questioned whether the remaining industries are appropriate for privatization.
Mr. Major pushed through a plan in the fall to sell British Rail's passenger and freight service to regional franchisees only over opposition from commuters and travelers who said they feared it would lead to higher fares and deteriorating service.

HEADLINE: Disney Drums Its Fingers as Virginia Debates the Worth of a Theme Park

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAYMARKET, Va., Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company's plan to build a huge American history theme park next to this northern Virginia village 35 miles west of Washington is suddenly taking more political and economic twists and turns than a roller coaster ride.
The state's new Republican Governor, George F. Allen, is squabbling with the Democrat-controlled Legislature over whether to try to entice Disney by subsidizing some of the park's development costs, like highway construction and staff training. 
 Mr. Allen has proposed a $142 million subsidy, which is $17 million more generous than the legislators have so far been willing to offer. But given the potential economic impact of the $650 million park, which by some estimates could eventually rival the Disney parks in Florida and California, the debate is far from over.
Disney says it remains optimistic that a compromise will be found. But it has warned that its plans will collapse if they are delayed.
The company wants to open its fifth theme park in 1998 on 3,000 acres, which it has options to buy, just outside this town of 500 people. According to Disney calculations, the park should attract six million visitors a year, many of them tourists visiting Washington. State and private calculations indicate that directly or indirectly, the park and its surrounding new hotels, shops and houses could create 19,000 tourism jobs and a billion-dollar building boom.
 
Politics Comes Into Play
 In a state hard hit in recent years by recession and military cutbacks after a decade of above-average growth, some officials say new development is needed. Disney and Governor Allen are betting that the need will ultimately bring around balky legislators, as well as doubtful zoning officials and environmentalists.
Complicating the debate over how much inducement to give Disney is a host of other issues, including the political byplay between a new Republican Governor and a Democratic Legislature, state development policy, regional economic jealousies, pollution concerns and fair distribution of park jobs for members of minorities.
There is also debate over the American history attractions that Disney's "imagineers" propose to mix in with Mickey Mouse, Goofy and the usual assortment of Disney rides. The 100-acre park would be split into nine "playlands" with themes that include slavery in America and the wrenching era of the Vietnam War.
The politically savvy Disney, whose lobbyists are aswarm at the Capitol in Richmond, where they are referred to collectively as "the Mouse," says it must have a development subsidy -- and soon. Disney says it must have help building roads around the park, which by some estimates will cost more than $100 million, and argues that delaying or denying the subsidy would threaten the economic underpinning of the park and ruin its building schedule.
Last week, Disney officials said the company would not tolerate delay. Their warning came after the state Senate and House approved bills with differing subsidies, neither as generous as the Governor wants. Furthermore, the House version carried numerous qualifiers.
Still, the Disney officials, in the spirit of Mickey, found a silver lining.
"We're optimistic," said Mary Anne Reynolds, a Disney spokeswoman, noting that although the Legislature differed sharply with the Governor, it had at least moved toward approval of a subsidy.
 
Seeking a Second Vote
 In proposing a $142 million bond issue to help Disney, Governor Allen, the state's first Republican chief executive in 12 years, asked that the money be free of strings.
But when the state Senate voted on his request on Tuesday, the Democrats held the subsidy to $125 million, with Disney to pick up half of the annual $12 million in debt service. The House approved only $82 million, adding that if Disney would contribute another $44 million, the state would repay the company over several years.
Then the House threw in the biggest roadblock Disney has yet to encounter in its effort to create "Disney's America." The chamber attached a rider to its bill that requires a second legislative look at the park proposal, along with a second vote, just before the Legislature adjourns early this spring.
"This is hardly the way to welcome 19,000 jobs and a $650 million investment," the Governor said after the votes, accusing Democratic legislators of playing "partisan games."
But the debate over a Disney subsidy goes well beyond money and how much of it Democrats and Republicans can agree on. Also in dispute is whether Virginia should break with its long habit of drawing new industry by simply promoting its central location on the Atlantic Coast, low taxes, solid education system and the absence of strong unions.
Many other states, especially those in the South, use development subsidies to attract industry. But Virginia has mostly avoided this approach, arguing that the state has plenty of cost-free incentives to offer and that, besides, taxpayer money should not be risked on business ventures that could fail.
 
'Chilling' Mistake
 That was precisely the position taken last week by the House majority leader, C. Richard Cranwell.
"If we make a mistake on Disney," he warned, "it'll have a chilling effect on our ability to do anything constructive in the future because it is such a big-ticket item. I hope nobody thinks the message to Disney is, 'Don't come to Virginia.' The message is, 'Virginia is a well-run state.' "
Though Disney has had great success with most of its theme parks, the success has not been universal. Its Euro Disney park just outside Paris has lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Legislators are also squabbling over whether other regions of Virginia should be given some kind of economic aid if a big subsidy goes to Disney to help it settle in northern Virginia. In the southwest, many miners are out of work, and on the Tidewater coast, many military installations are closing.
Nor do the twists in the Disney dispute end there.
Environmentalists say a huge Disney development would further degrade the environment in the ever-growing Washington area. History buffs say that they fear Disney will distort history and that the influx of visitors could harm genuine historic areas like nearby Manassas Battlefield Park.
And civil rights advocates warn Disney that they will protest loudly if the company does not hire as many members of minorities as they want.
Senator Henry L. Marsh 3d of Richmond, who is black, argued during last week's debate that the legislature should require Disney to let black history experts review the historical accuracy of the park's theme attractions.
"There's a possibility of abuse when you show slavery in an entertainment fashion," he said. He was rebuffed.
In a few days, the conferees from the Virginia Senate and House will begin efforts to reconcile the two subsidy bills passed last week. No one is predicting just how much money will eventually be put out for Disney, but the betting is that the legislators will be generous enough to bring its new fantasyland to life.
"They're not going to be able to look their constituents in the eye and say, 'I just blew it, just messed up 19,000 jobs in Virginia,' " the Governor confidently predicted the other day.

HEADLINE: Panel Finds Threat to Great Lakes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The United States and Canada have not kept a promise in 1978 to halt the flow of dangerous chemicals into the Great Lakes, an international commission says.
"The integrity of the Great Lakes and life forms that depend on them remain at an unacceptable level of risk from persistent toxic substances," the International Joint Commission said last week in its seventh biennial report on water quality in the Great Lakes. It called for a more specific strategy for ending the flow of dangerous chemicals from industry and incineration. 
 Among its recommendations, the commission repeated a plea it made two years ago for the United States, Canada and the chemical industry to find a way to end the use of chlorine in manufacturing.
Coming just weeks after the Clinton Administration promised to study the possible phase-out of chlorine and chlorine compounds, the report was enthusiastically embraced by environmental groups and assailed by the chemical industry. "The debate is no longer whether to phase out these chemicals, but how," said George Coling, a Great Lakes specialist with the Sierra Club.
 
Chlorine Industry Objects
 The environmental group Greenpeace called the commission's report "one of the most important statements ever made for the future of environmental policy in North America."
But Brad Lienhart, managing director of the Chlorine Chemistry Council, said, "The I.J.C. report is not a sound-science approach to decision-making."
And the Dow Chemical Company, the world's largest producer of chlorine, said, "There is currently no evidence that would support a total ban on chlorine chemistry, and the social and economic consequences of such a ban would be disastrous for the public."
The joint commission's American co-chairman, Gordon Durnil, said that the panel had been trying for years to discuss chlorine and chlorine compounds with the chemical industry but that the industry refused to be involved.
"We're now having really a pretty good dialogue with lobbyists," Mr. Durnil said. "But the chemical industry has not brought forth any evidence that their views have any merit.
"It appears to us that the weight of evidence says there is a danger from organochlorides. You've got some really major problems going on: increases in breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometriosis. You can in many cases, trace it to an organochloride."
The chlorine industry said any analysis must take account of the risks of not having the chemical available to society.

HEADLINE: The Boat People: A Chapter Closes

 BODY:
They first floated into the world's consciousness in 1977, fishing boats crammed with desperate men, women and children fleeing the hardships and persecutions of a newly united Communist Vietnam. They encountered pirate attacks at sea and hostile receptions on nearby Asian shores. Still, nearly a million of these "boat people" eventually set sail, most in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
That chapter of history has now been officially closed by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. The U.N.'s refugee arm declared last week that fleeing Vietnamese would no longer be automatically eligible for consideration as political refugees; they will be judged on an individual basis like other applicants. Most of the 60,000 boat people remaining in Asian refugee camps can now be legally sent back home. 
 That is unwelcome news to the affected Vietnamese. But sending them home is no more cruel than leaving them to rot in refugee camps -- if they can be assured of freedom from reprisals on their return. Asian countries, fearing unemployment and ethnic conflict, will not admit them as residents. And Western countries other than the United States have been almost equally unwelcoming.
Though the world likes to pretend otherwise, the treatment refugees receive always has a lot to do with international politics and the current standing of their homeland. The Vietnamese exodus of the late 1970's shocked a world that had been lulled by Hanoi's rosy -- and false -- postwar picture of liberation, peace and national recuperation. Vietnam is still a poor country and remains arbitrary in its treatment of those suspected of political nonconformity. Yet it offers more hopeful economic prospects and less systematic repression.
It is also being officially welcomed back into the community of nations that isolated it during the long Indochina wars. Only this month, the U.S. finally dropped its 19-year economic embargo. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, once virtually an anti-Vietnamese alliance, now weighs accepting Hanoi as an associate member.
International law defines a refugee fairly strictly. Most people trying to escape poverty and dictatorship do not qualify, only those who can demonstrate a "well-founded fear of persecution." International agencies like the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees have a dual mandate: to protect legitimate refugees and to organize their return home after it becomes safe to go back. For Vietnam, that moment now seems to have arrived.

HEADLINE: Tax-Rate Scare Hides Real Health Plan Fear

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Jim Cooper's Pointless Plan (Op-Ed, Feb. 13), Henry J. Aaron writes: "Such taxes are almost confiscatory. It is hard to believe that any member of Congress would knowingly support the creation of a near-poverty trap like the one that would result from the Cooper health proposal." 
 Strong words from one of the most respected economists around. Yet before we rush to accept Dr. Aaron's views on financing health reform, we need to ask: How much more will the family he profiles pay in taxes because of the "confiscatory" phase-out of their health insurance subsidy? The answer is $0.
The issue Dr. Aaron raises is a favorite of conservative Republicans -- the effect of high marginal tax rates on work behavior. But Congress, having just raised the top tax rate close to 20 percent, cannot now start shouting that rates matter.
More disturbing, Dr. Aaron has indicted any proposal that suggests people should pay for their own health insurance (with a promise of help for those who need it).
But the design of a transfer program must concern itself not only with its effects on the beneficiaries, but also on the benefactors. It is because the costs to those asked to pay for the plan are so high that we see such opposition to the President's proposal.

HEADLINE: Don't Label All Young Germans as Neo-Nazis;
Home-Grown Variety

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re Stephen Silver's "Music of Hate" (Op-Ed, Feb. 8): Germany is not the only country in which neo-Nazi rock music has flourished. It can be found in many other countries, including the United States. Neo-Nazi or "white power" rock, as it is sometimes called, has inspired countless violent crimes in this country. 
 In Arlington, Tex., Donald Thomas, a 32-year-old black man, was killed by neo-Nazi skinheads in a drive-by shooting. In the car were three skinheads driving around while listening to white power rock.
"Sounds of Hate: Neo-Nazi Rock Music From Germany," a 1992 study by the Anti-Defamation League, reported that Rock-O-Rama, the record company mentioned in the Op-Ed article, was the leading producer of this type of music not just in Germany, but also in the world. The American groups they recorded were no less extreme than their German counterparts, as in the following song, "A Call to Arms," by Bound for Glory, a Minnesota band:
Zionist illusions, state of confusions
Are decaying away my mind,
Feelings of hate, can't get it straight,
Am I the only one of my kind?
Massive inflation by the racial infestation
Has turned our streets to decay
Racial domination, swift termination
Has become the only way.
Close the border, start the New Order
Gather your guns, it's time to fight,
A call to arms!
It is to the German Government's credit that it cracked down on Rock-O-Rama last year. However, other such companies remained free to operate, including Skull Records in Germany, Rebelles Europeens in France, RAC Records and White Power Records in Britain, Resistance Records in Detroit and White Terror Records in Garden Grove, Calif.
Our Constitution prohibits Government suppression of hate music, but it also protects the public's right to rise up and shout to those who promote it, "Enough!"

HEADLINE: U.S. TELLS ARISTIDE TO BEND ON PLAN

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 22

 BODY:
In a change of strategy, the Clinton Administration has decided against imposing tighter economic sanctions on Haiti unless the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, agrees to broaden his government and grant immediate amnesty to military officers who ousted him in 1991.
Administration officials said today that in effect Father Aristide must do more to embrace a recently formulated plan to restore him to office. The plan was drawn up in Washington by a visiting Haitian parliamentary delegation that has consulted closely with Administration and United Nations officials.
 
President Rejects Plan
 The plan, which Father Aristide has so far rejected, calls on the exiled President to name a new Prime Minister, who would form a new, broadly based Government and obtain immediate passage of legislation giving amnesty to Gen. Raoul Cedras and other Haitian officers involved in the coup. 
 Father Aristide has said that because the army has violated all of its agreements in the past, General Cedras and other military leaders should be required to relinquish power before any new political arrangements are made.
Nevertheless, the rejection of the plan by Father Aristide, who lives in exile in Washington, has irked officials of the Clinton Administration and United Nations diplomats. Many of the plan's elements were contained in a negotiated settlement of the country's crisis that Father Aristide signed in New York last July.
That settlement collapsed when Haiti's military leaders violated their agreement to step down in October and began a campaign of widespread violence, including assassinations of business and political leaders who supported Father Aristide.
Last week, the Haitian leader initially declined to meet with the parliamentary delegation, which included some political leaders nominally supporting him. Father Aristide later relented, agreeing to a meeting but rejecting requests that he name a new Government.
The Clinton Administration has openly expressed its frustration with Father Aristide's position. Asked last week if Father Aristide was considered to be intransigent, the State Department spokesman, Mike McCurry, replied, "That's close to our reading."
Many supporters of Father Aristide have maintained that as Haiti's first democratically-elected President, he should not be required to compromise with the military and its allies who supported his overthrow. Diplomats have said, however, that if the Haitian leader is ever to return to office, he will have to reach out to people who have opposed him in the past and reassure his enemies that his return will not result in reprisals.
Diplomats said a vote by the United Nations Security Council to broaden the embargo on Haiti, which currently covers oil and arms, would still be submitted for approval, possibly as early as this week. But a senior official involved in the diplomacy said the sanctions would be "conditioned somehow on political initiatives."
The Administration said as recently as last month that it would move ahead with broader sanctions against Haiti in spite of reports of widespread hardship among the poorest Haitians living in rural areas. A senior official said today, however, that the situation had changed as a result of the current initiative, and a decision was made to postpone further punitive measures to allow it to bear fruit.
The next round of sanctions before the United Nations Security Council would have barred all forms of trade except for food and medicine, a step that would close down factories and businesses in Haiti. The new sanctions would also have barred flights to and from Haiti by noncommercial aircraft.
Insisting that the country's military leadership must be removed before any new political arrangements can be made, Father Aristide has asked in recent weeks that the United Nations impose a blanket embargo on Haiti to force the army to relinquish power.
"It remains our view that since a commitment was made in December that the sanctions would be increased if the army did not give up power by Jan. 15, the U.N. should move quickly to fulfill that promise," said Michael Barnes, a senior adviser to Father Aristide.
Administration officials and diplomats said the decision to postpone the sanctions grew out of concerns that they would inflict great suffering on the Haitian people and further radicalize elements of the country's far right who oppose Father Aristide's return.
Equally prominent in their thinking, however, is persuading Father Aristide to accept a series of recent proposals aimed at jump-starting efforts to restore him to office.
"What we are talking about are things that would be done very quickly," a senior Administration official said. "The retirement of Cedras, the naming of a new commander, changes in the general staff and the separation of the police from the army. All of this would take place in maybe six days."
If Father Aristide agreed to the plan and the army then balked, officials said, broader sanctions would follow.

U.N. Aide Defends Plan
 UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 22 (Reuters) -- Dante Caputo, the United Nations mediator for Haiti, today defended an interim plan to restart the stalled peace process.
 "This is not a comprehensive plan," Mr. Caputo said at a news conference today. "This is a mini-plan to break the impasse."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines in New Survey

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell in February after three consecutive monthly increases, the Conference Board said yesterday in a survey suggesting that Americans' faith in the rebounding economy may be faltering a bit.
The business research group, based in New York, said it was premature to attach any significance to a one-month reading because February's results might have reflected nothing more than the impact of frigid weather. Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research center, characterized the dip as "very slight." 
 The results were an early economic indicator for the month, and included responses taken after the Federal Reserve's move on Feb. 4 to raise interest rates for the first time in five years.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, derived from answers to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide, fell to 80.8, from a 82.6 in January. The index, considered a gauge of future economic activity, totaled 79.8 in December, 71.9 in November and 60.5 in October. A reading between 50 and 70 forecasts moderate economic growth.
Mr. Linden attributed the decline to lower optimism about future business conditions and the outlook for jobs. He expressed doubt that the Fed's raising of interest rates played any significant role, "simply because the ordinary citizen isn't an economist, mercifully."
 
Frigid Weather a Factor
 Mr. Linden also said the severe winter cold that gripped much of the country during February might have influenced the results. Economists who follow the Conference Board's survey said they also thought the weather contributed to the results.
"I think people are allowed to feel a little unhappy and disgruntled because of the natural disasters we've had," said Sandra Shaber, a consumer economist at the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
Another measure of consumer confidence, a survey by the University of Michigan, also showed a drop in confidence in the economy in February. The Michigan survey was reported on Feb. 11.
The Conference Board survey seeks insight into consumer behavior by asking questions on topics ranging from home-appliance buying plans to the local job market. When people feel more secure about their personal financial outlook, the survey finds, they are more likely to borrow and spend.
The Conference Board said fewer respondents than in past months felt current economic conditions were bad. But fewer believed that the next six months would show improvement.
The number who feared business conditions would worsen increased in February, and more respondents forecast that the number of jobs would decline.

HEADLINE: President of Ukraine Says He Will Not Run

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Feb. 22

 BODY:
President Leonid M. Kravchuk was quoted today as saying he will not run for re-election in June, raising anew questions about the accord Mr. Kravchuk signed with the United States and Russia to hand over all of Ukraine's nuclear weapons.
In a front-page interview in the newspaper Demokratichna Ukraina, Mr. Kravchuk said he had made "a final decision" not to seek a second term because he could not "defend the current economic situation." The interview came a little more than a week before Mr. Kravchuk is to visit Washington for talks with President Clinton. 
 Mr. Kravchuk's press secretary, Victor I. Stelmakh, confirmed the decision not to seek a second term, but declined to offer an explanation.
In an opinion poll in December, only 11 percent of Ukrainians said they had confidence in Mr. Kravchuk and only 17 percent said they would vote for him again. Mr. Kravchuk's poor showing is generally blamed on the state of the Ukrainian economy, which was underscored today when the Government announced a sharp new increase in credits to support industry and agriculture.
The inflationary move came despite a high-level joint International Monetary Fund and World Bank mission.

HEADLINE: Clinton Tells Educators Youths Are Not Getting Practical Skills for Jobs

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Challenging American educators to move away from pure academics and toward applied skills, President Clinton said today that one of his Administration's top goals would be to help the nation's schools prepare students for work.
"In the 19th Century, at most, young Americans needed a high school education to make their way," Mr. Clinton told 1,500 educators at a luncheon during the American Council on Education's annual conference. "It was good enough if they could read well and understand basic numbers. In the 21st Century, our people will have to keep learning all their lives." 
 In a 40-minute speech in which he raced through issues about preschools, community colleges and the most prestigious universities, the President said the American imagination must be gripped by the need for new links between learning and jobs.
"We have to have rigorous academics and practical learning," he said. "We have to tie the workplace to the learning environment in high school for young people who know they are not going on to four-year colleges."
 
Series of Speeches
 The President's remarks, just two days before the House plans to take up the $10 billion Elementary and Secondary Education Act, dovetailed with those made in recent days by the Secretaries of Labor and Education. At various times, in various venues, each has underscored the need for radical educational reforms that would help reorient schools prepare the next generation to compete in the global economy. Today, the President urged the educators to meet the "realities of this economy, not the economy of a generation ago."
To accomplish that, he said, "we have an opportunity to do something that Americans have resisted for too long -- which is to merge instead of keep divided our notion of vocational education and academic education."
Meeting afterwards with reporters, the President said much of the responsibility for those changes would fall to the states and school districts.
No great amount of new money has been set aside in the Federal budget for such a transition. Though the Department of Education is slated to receive a 6 percent overall increase, half that amount would be lost to inflation.
 
Limited Federal Help
 The Administration's most talked about programs -- one encouraging national educational standards and another urging schools to prepare students for work -- are backed by relatively little money. And the Federal grants through the school-to-work program are scheduled to end in three years on the theory that individual states would adopt both the concept and the training to prepare students for the workplace.
"The Federal Government provides a relatively small share of the overall school funding," Mr. Clinton said. "We're trying to help some by just -- in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act -- by changing the way we distribute the funds and trying to give it to the more needy districts."
Speaking of the need to diminish Federal intervention in the day-to-day operations of local schools, President Clinton said he favored waivers to let states direct money to projects best tailored to their needs.
Sipping a caffeine-free diet soft drink, he referred at one point to an Arkansas program that combined Chapter 1 support with money for special education and said a result of that fusion was class work that held students to higher standards. Several students who had been held back to repeat a grade quadrupled their test scores after participating in that program, he said, and most students showed overall improvement.
Stressing the need for states to take more interest in the fate of their students -- as well as their specific studies -- he said states should track dropouts to see what kind of work they find. "We need to set up a system to keep up with those folks," he said.
Most schools, he said, have already begun moving forward with reforms and innovations. "Most people get this thing," he said. "Most people have figured this thing out, particularly in terms of life-long learning."
 
An Education Gap
 In his speech, he called America the only country without a system to help students make a smooth transition from school to work, "where they've got a chance to have a good job with a growing income."
One result of this failure, he said later, is that prisons have better libraries than schools.
"How did my country come to this?" he asked. "Why, when it's so much cheaper to educate somebody than it is to keep them in prison, can you get a better library in the prison than you can in the school?"
Later, speaking broadly of the need to revamp the school system, President Clinton said changes had to start with safety. In a leap to the situation in Bosnia, he compared the crisis in the country's educational system to that war.
"It's kind of analogous to what we try to do with Sarajevo and Bosnia," he said. "I think finally it became possible to do this thing in Bosnia because people realized that Sarajevo was like Humpty Dumpty. And if Sarajevo was destroyed, you'd never put the pieces back together.
"I think, psychologically, people view schools that way. I think it is very hard for families and communities to thrive if they're scared to send their kids to school, and the kids are scared in the schools."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
A Fractional Peace

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Behind the self-congratulation and assertions of victory in the Clinton Administration over the military respite in Sarajevo lie two stark realities: fighting still rages in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and any peace settlement that emerges may very well give the Muslims less territory than they could have gotten a year ago.
The NATO allies can plausibly take credit for finally giving the Bosnian Serbs an ultimatum that worked, proving that the credible threat of force can get at least short-term results. But their very success raises the question of why it took the United States and the rest of NATO so long: the Serbs have been seizing territory, after all, for nearly two years. 
 And now the Administration must figure out what to do next.
 
Tit-for-Tat
 The Russians have begun to "deliver" the Serbs, who more or less did what the United Nations demanded of them around Sarajevo, and now the United States is being called on to "deliver" the Bosnian Government without appearing to force it to make concessions.
Last year, the Administration initially refused to endorse the peace plan proposed by the United Nations envoy, Cyrus R. Vance, and the European emissary, Lord Owen, because they thought it demanded unfair concessions by the Muslim-dominated Government. That plan, however, offered more territory than the Muslims are now likely to get in any settlement.
President Clinton held out the tantalizing possibility on Monday that a broader use of power and diplomacy could extend the calm in the Bosnian capital to other parts of the country.
But his top military advisers warned lawmakers at a Congressional hearing today that the White House did not want to press ahead with new measures in other parts of the country until the capital is securely under control.
The unpredictability and volatility of Bosnia was highlighted again today when five Swedish peacekeepers were wounded while drivingin a particularly dangerous area near Tuzla, 50 miles north of Sarajevo.
That sent NATO commanders and United Nations officials scurrying to determine whether NATO should retaliate. After all, shouldn't the peacekeeepers continue to behave boldly, knowing that if they get into trouble, NATO aircraft will protect them?
Finally, however, United Nations commanders decided the attack was too small and the source too vague to justify defensive strikes.
Even if it wanted to, Washington cannot push too hard to spread the peace because it refuses to join the 15 countries that have peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia, though American pilots deliver most relief goods and would participate in any NATO air strikes.
 
Withholding Ground Troops
 Mr. Clinton came into office proclaiming a moral imperative to take action against Serbian aggression. But he quickly learned how complicated Bosnia was and had second thoughts, opposing the dispatch of United States ground troops as part of a misnamed "peacekeeping" force.
Only when there is a comprehensive peace will the United States help enforce a settlement with troops, a commitment Secretary of State Warren Christopher reiterated on Monday in a meeting with the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic. Even then, the Administration knows that it faces a brutal battle with Congress.
Senior officials in countries with peacekeepers in Bosnia reacted with varying degrees of frustration and bemusement on Monday when Mr. Clinton congratulated NATO, the United Nations, the Russians, "and above all, the American military personnel and those from our NATO allies, whose courage and skill provided the muscles that made this policy work."
Malcolm Rifkind, the British Defense Secretary, underscored the Europeans' frustration on Friday when he noted, "Britain at the moment has in Bosnia over 2,500 men, Russia is to have 400, the United States has 15."
On the diplomatic front, the Administration has stepped up its effort to help the Bosnian Government identify its basic demands without forcing a settlement that would be militarily unenforceable and morally unacceptable.
But in his talks with Mr. Christopher on Monday, Prime Minister Silajdzic sketched an ambitious framework that included a kind of Marshall Plan to reconstruct Bosnia, assurances that refugees could return to villages purged by the Serbs and long-term security guarantees so Bosnia could flourish as an ethnically mixed state.
But he refused to offer specific territorial demands, except to say that the "quality" of the territory offered under current plans must be improved.
 
Looking Toward Croatia
 The Administration has also tried to broker a deal between the Muslims and the Croats to consolidate territory under their control in a sovereign state that would form an economic federation with Croatia. But the Croats and the Muslims, who are currently fighting each other in central Bosnia, have discussed federation before, in vain.
At this moment, whatever territory the Muslims might accept would almost certainly be less than they would have received a year ago under the Vance-Owen plan, which the United States initially did not endorse.
The plan would have divided Bosnia into 10 ethnically dominated provinces. But it would have been a nightmare to enforce because it called for an illogical mosaic based on the premise that people who had been forced out of their homes would eventually return.
Mr. Christopher called the plan "repugnant" because it validated Serbian gains from "ethnic cleansing." The Bosnian Serbs were chiefly responsible for sabotaging that plan.
 
An Offer of Radar
 In recent weeks, the Administration has become convinced that since it was not prepared to go to war to help the Bosnian Government, it had to promote the fairest settlement possible. In exchange for an active diplomatic role, the Europeans agreed to allow NATO air strikes to enforce the ultimatum despite the risk to their troops.
Now Mr. Clinton is back to stating that American "interests" are at stake. In a small gesture of involvement, he has offered to provide NATO with radars to help trace artillery attacks. But there will be no United States ground troops to operate the radars. Washington has told the United Nations that other countries familiar with the technology -- including Egypt and Jordan, who have peacekeepers in Bosnia -- will be asked to operate it.

HEADLINE: Senate Debates Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Senate began a long and solemn debate tonight on a proposed constitutional amendment to require the Federal budget to be balanced. Its chief sponsor asked Congress and the states to take away the "blank check" that Government had used to build the national debt to $4 trillion.
"The deficit grows and grows, ad infinitum," said Senator Paul E. Simon, Democrat of Illinois, the main sponsor. Pointing to the young messengers who serve the Senate, he added, "It is hurting these pages and their future right down here." 
 Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is President pro tem of the Senate and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the proposal, with its requirement of a three-fifths majority in both houses to permit deficit spending, violated "the basic principle of the Constitution," the element of majority rule.
"Take the element of a majority rule away, and this is no longer a democracy," he said.
 
Clinton Opposes Plan
 President Clinton denounced the proposal as bringing the filibuster and other Congressional delaying tactics into the one area where they are now excluded, the budget.
"You will put 40 percent of the Senate and 40 percent of the House, plus one vote, in total control of the American Government and America's future," Mr. Clinton told the American Council on Education.
Both supporters and enemies of the proposal predicted that the margin would be narrow when the Senate votes, no sooner than next week. It takes a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators if all vote, to pass a constitutional amendment.
Another close vote would follow in the House, though Mr. Simon predicted it would pass "very, very quickly." It would then take approval by three-fourths, or 38, of the state legislatures to make the provision the 28th Amendment to the Constitution. If adopted, the amendment would take effect in the year 2001.
Mr. Simon maintained that the three-fifths majority could be mustered if Government spending was needed in a recession, or "when you have an earthquake in California."
 
Liberals and Conservatives
 Mr. Simon, a liberal Democrat who has advocated tax increases and Pentagon spending cuts as a route to balancing the budget, was supported by two Republicans, Senators Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Larry E. Craig of Idaho. They would prefer to cut domestic spending.
Mr. Hatch argued that past efforts to force a balanced budget by statutory measures, like the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act, had failed. He also said it was now clear that only a constitutional amendment would "end the long spending binge of Congress."
"Once the constitutional amendment is in place, we will all be forced to be serious," Mr. Hatch said. "We need the discipline that this balanced budget amendment would bring to the Congress."
Mr. Craig defended the requirement for a three-fifths majority to impose deficits and add to the national debt, saying issues of debt "should not be left to the judgment of a transient majority."
Agreeing with Mr. Simon's assertion that the amendment would improve the economy, Mr. Craig said, "I don't see ruinous taxes or a downward spiral in the economy." He added, "There is not a sky-is-falling scenario wrapped in the words of the 28th Amendment."
 
History and Balances
 But Mr. Byrd attacked the proposal as "illusory," saying it would not succeed in balancing the budget.
And he quarreled with Mr. Simon's contention that Thomas Jefferson would support his cause. While Mr. Jefferson had occasionally advocated a constitutional provision against debt, Mr. Byrd acknowledged, he had put the country into debt to pay for the Louisiana Purchase.
Finally, Mr. Byrd contended that the amendment was a sham, because the Judiciary Committee report advocating its adoption said Congress could decide that deviations were "negligible," "small" or "temporary," and therefore inconsequential.
He observed that the report also said that it was all right for Congress to decide that a small shortfall could be made up in the next fiscal year. And, Mr. Byrd said, Congress could then decide that this delayed repayment could be put off again and again. That meant that "Congress may declare that a violation is not a violation," he said.

HEADLINE: AUSTRIA PROTESTS CZECH ATOM PLANT

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Worried about the potential for a nuclear accident near its border, the Austrian Government has sent a high-level delegation to Washington to protest plans to use American technology to complete a Soviet-style nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic.
In January, the United States Export-Import Bank agreed to guarantee a $317 million loan to the Czech electric utility to buy equipment and nuclear fuel from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to start up two reactors at the Temelin nuclear plant, 40 miles from the Austrian border. 
 Construction of the reactors, of a type found across Eastern Europe, was started by the former Communist Government in Czechoslovakia. Work was halted in 1992 by the first post-Communist Government because of questions about costs, safety and electricity needs. The Czech Republic and Slovakia separated on Jan. 1, 1993.
Despite considerable domestic and international opposition, the Czech Government has decided to resume the project, modifying the design with Westinghouse's help.
 
The Austrian Arguments
 Austria, supported by environmental advocacy groups, argues that the design is flawed, that the plan to modify it is unproven and that the risks have never been publicly examined.
"An accident at Temelin could result in devastating health, environmental, economic and social consequences for all of Austria's almost eight million citizens," said an Austrian memorandum being circulated in Washington.
Nathaniel D. Woodson, the general manager for Westinghouse's commercial nuclear programs, responded that the company's plan meets all the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency for dealing with Soviet-style reactors.
Similar technology has been used in other reactors in Europe, he said, adding, "It is a proven approach that we are applying to a Russian reactor."
 
Haunted by Chernobyl
 The Austrian protest raised the specter of a Chernobyl-like accident just 60 miles from Prague and 120 miles from Vienna. Even the Chernobyl accident in 1986, 700 miles away, led to radioactive fallout in Austria.
The reactors at Temelin are not identical to the one destroyed at Chernobyl, but their design is widely viewed as flawed. Germany canceled construction of identical reactors in the former East Germany rather than try to correct the safety problems.
If the plan to modify the plants goes forward, it could represent a major opening for Westinghouse in Eastern Europe. There are 31 reactors of this type operating in Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria, and 16 partly completed across Eastern Europe.
The Administration has favored the plan, which was approved last year, but Congress has until early March to decide whether it should be approved.
 
Questions to Be Addressed
 Congressional hearings on the issue are scheduled on Wednesday.
Among the questions expected to be raised is whether the Export-Import Bank, an independent Federal agency that aids and finances United States exports, has adequately examined the environmental effects of the reactor.
Papers circulated by the Austrian Embassy in Washington said its experts are "very skeptical" of studies, not all of them made public, that are said to demonstrate that a power plant grafting Westinghouse technology onto the Soviet design would be safe.
The Austrian delegation to Washington is led by Peter Jankowitsch, a former Foreign Minister and Austria's envoy to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; there are several political, economic and technical advisers.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Seeks to Push Down Long-Term Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, used an appearance before Congress today to try to talk down the long-term interest rates that rose unexpectedly after the Fed pushed up short-term rates on Feb. 4.
Testifying before a House Banking Committee panel whose members mostly criticized the latest increase in interest rates, Mr. Greenspan sought to calm inflation fears but keep his options open. 
 He played down a recent Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank survey showing manufacturers expected higher prices and he predicted that inflation would be only slightly higher this year than last year. And he repeated his recent warnings that he would be willing to push up short-term rates if necessary to fight inflation.
 
A Dip in Bond Yield
 In response to Mr. Greenspan's testimony, long-term interest rates eased slightly today, with the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond dipping to 6.60 percent, from 6.62 percent on Friday. [Page D14.]
President Clinton professed to be encouraged by Mr. Greenspan's upbeat testimony on inflation. The Administration's economic plan rests on low long-term rates. With recent increases, long-term rates already exceed the Administration's forecasts for this year, while short-term interest rates remain a quarter of a percentage point below.
Long-term interest rates have climbed by nearly a third of a percentage point since the Fed nudged up short-term rates on Feb. 4 in an effort to restrain possible inflationary pressures. The Fed has no direct control over long-term rates, which depend mainly on investors' expectations of inflation.
Mr. Greenspan said he thought inflation was under control now. "In the current period, overall cost and price pressures still appear to remain damped," he said.
As in his last Congressional appearance a month ago, Mr. Greenspan was vague about when any further increases in short-term interest rates might come. "To promote sustainable growth, history suggests that real short-term rates are more likely to have to rise than fall from here," he said. "I cannot, however, tell you at this time when any such rise would occur."
But Mr. Greenspan left himself some room for an immediate increase in short-term rates. He took the highly unusual step this morning of saying that he was waiting for Thursday's Commerce Department report on manufacturers' new orders and production. Governors of the Federal Reserve seldom note a single economic indicator on a specific date as influencing their decision making.
"It could be a hint that a move may come much earlier than the market expected," said John P. Lipsky, the chief economist for Salomon Brothers. He predicted that the Fed could raise short-term rates again before its next monetary policy review meeting on March 22.
But Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the CS First Boston Corporation, said that he did not expect another rate increase until late March or early April. "I don't think there were any real surprises in the testimony," he said.
Federal law requires Mr. Greenspan to discuss interest rate policy semiannually before members of the House and Senate Banking Committees; he is scheduled to visit the Senate side soon, but no date has been set.
Fed officials like to compare their role in cooling an economy as it begins to gather steam to taking away a punch bowl when a party is becoming lively. But some representatives today accused the Fed of having acted too soon when it raised rates on Feb. 4.
"Many of us feel you are taking the punch bowl away while the guests are still taking their coats off," said Representative Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican.
 
A Range of Interpretations
 Economists and bond traders have offered a wide range of interpretations for the rise in long-term interest rates. One popular interpretation is that the Fed's action on short-term rates has prompted investors to take a new look at inflation and raise their expectations of future inflation, prompting them to ask for higher rates in exchange for long-term loans.
Another interpretation is that the fall in the dollar's value against the Japanese yen has made dollar-denominated securities less attractive to international investors. And a third interpretation is that recent indicators suggest that the strong economic growth from the fourth quarter may spill over into the first quarter and fuel inflation.
Mr. Greenspan chose the third interpretation today, and criticized financial markets for assuming that growth would remain strong. "It is too early to judge the degree of underlying economic strength in the early months of 1994," he said. "Wages do not seem to be accelerating despite scattered reports of some skilled-worker shortages, and advances in productivity early this year are holding down unit labor costs."
 
Best Outlook in Decades
 The Fed chairman predicted today that the nation's economy would grow by 3 percent or slightly more this year, and was generally upbeat. "The outlook, as a result of subdued inflation and still very low long-term interest rates, is the best we have seen in decades," he said.
During a news conference in the Rose Garden, President Clinton welcomed Mr. Greenspan's testimony. "Alan Greenspan said that he thought that we had the best conditions for fundamental economic growth in two decades or more -- I think that's quite encouraging -- and that there was no reason to believe that we had any problem with inflation," the President said. "If that's true, if we're going to have steady growth and no inflation, we ought to keep relatively low interest rates."
The Administration's economic forecasts assume that short-term rates will rise by at least another quarter of a percentage point this year.
 
Many Indicators Used
 In his testimony today, Mr. Greenspan gave another indication that monetarism is no longer a dominant influence on Fed policy. He said very little about the money supply today, noting instead that the Fed looked at many different economic indicators in deciding when to change interest rates.
Paul L. Kasriel, an economist for the Northern Trust Company, a Chicago bank, said, "The Federal Reserve is not really telling us in very specific terms what it is making its policy decisions on, and there don't seem to be any objective standards -- it's all very subjective and discretionary."
Mr. Greenspan showed unusual enthusiasm today for using gold prices as a guide to monetary policy. "It's not a perfect indicator, but it is a very good indicator" of price trends, Mr. Greenspan said.
He was also unusually frank in saying that the Fed did not have a detailed plan for future interest rate policy. "Clearly, the Federal Reserve will have to monitor carefully ongoing developments for indications of potential inflation or a strengthening in inflation expectations," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Government Securities Rise a Bit

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Following two sharp selloffs in as many days, the government securities market received a little lift yesterday from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose 5/16 , to 9517/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 6.60 percent, from 6.62 percent on Friday. 
 Traders said that Mr. Greenspan's testimony before Congress yesterday offered no details as to when the Fed would move short-term interest rates another notch higher. It is the uncertainty about the Fed's next move, some traders and investors have argued, that has caused the sharp selloff in the bond market since early February, when the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the first time in five years. Since then, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped a third of a percentage point.
 
Lower Economic Growth Seen
 But the chairman's comments about inflation and lower economic growth were a little soothing, they said.
Gerald A. Guild, senior manager fixed income at Advest Inc., said the Fed chairman's testimony "was typical Greenspan -- just trying to reassure people."
Some analysts believe the market may have just oversold itself a little too much last week, forcing the yield on the long bond to close at its highest level in more than six months. Investors betting that interest rates will continue to rise had to rush to cover short positions yesterday, buying securities to limit their losses or to lock in profits they might have made in several previous trading sessions.
In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said short-term rates were more likely to rise than fall, but he declined to say when it would happen.
 
Inflation Control Seen
 "The message was loud and clear," Mr. Guild said. "He will try to control inflation.
"There are people who think it can be done without raising interest rates, but that's impossible," he said. "But then, no one ever really wants to go through any pain. This market is more into psychology than reality.
"My impression was that he was speaking about controlling inflation in the years ahead, from 1995 to beyond, and that ought to be a very good boost, if you are investing in long-term bonds," Mr. Guild continued. "I believe that on a short-term basis, traders remain pessimistic and their mood bearish, but that should not have anything to do with long-term investing."
Some Fed watchers said the Feb. 4 tightening by the Fed could be the first in a series of similar actions, with many dealers expecting the central bank to raise the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points by the end of March. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Higher Fed Funds Forecast
 John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said, "We expect a 75-basis-point increase to 4 percent in the Fed funds rate by midyear."
Bond traders said the Conference Board's February consumer confidence survey, which fell after three consecutive months of increases, had little impact on trading yesterday.
The Treasury's weekly sale of three- and six-month bills, put off until yesterday because of the holiday on Monday, saw bill rates increase over those of the previous bill auction. The average rate for a three-month bill was up five basis points, to 3.33 percent, while the six-month maturity was 10 basis points higher over the rate a week ago.
Other government debt sales this week include today's two-year note auction and five-year note auction on Thursday. In when-issued trading the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 4.57 percent and the five-year at 5.50 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills:
