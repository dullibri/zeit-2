HEADLINE: A Retail Season of Hope and Caution

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
With their fingers tightly crossed and rabbits' feet stashed in their pockets, merchants are predicting healthy -- but not robust -- sales increases this holiday season.
Retailers are taking hope from their strong performances in the third quarter, when sales and profits increased for many. Also figuring into their estimates are the recent encouraging economic statistics, like stronger housing starts, rising consumer confidence and slightly lower unemployment and consumer debt loads. 
 And the calendar will work in their favor this year, giving retailers two days more than last year between Thanksgiving and Christmas to entice shoppers.
"I think Santa will arrive on time this year, if not a little early," said Robert E. M. Nourse, president and chief executive of the Bombay Company, a specialty retailer based in Fort Worth. "Last year he really didn't show up at all."
But the ghost of recent Christmases past, when sales failed to outpace inflation, still haunts many retailers.
"We're saying sales will be up 4 to 5 percent over last year," said John J. Schultz, president of the National Retail Federation, pausing a moment before adding: "But say four. Four's safer."
 
Playing It Safe
 While some investment analysts have projected 6 percent to 10 percent sales increases this season, a survey of 1,175 retailers by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche found that 41 percent expected sales and profits to be flat or only as much as 3 percent higher than last year.
Playing it safe is the name of the game this holiday season, which begins in earnest the day after Thanksgiving and comes to a halt on Dec. 24. Retailers have ordered sparingly, choosing to sacrifice sales rather than be left with unsold merchandise. Merchants are also banking on dependable sellers from the past, like board games, educational computer programs and rugby shirts, to lead sales.
The merchants' caution is well founded. California will be their Achilles' heel this holiday. The chains all have at least 15 percent of their stores there, and even the most optimistic retailers see no turnaround in that state's beleaguered economy.
Malina Gerber owns Malina's, a children's clothing retailer with stores in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, Calif. She said sales in her two shops, as well as a line of private-label children's clothing she sells to stores like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, are off by about 25 percent this year. "I don't expect any miracles at Christmas," Ms. Gerber said.
Despite the surge in the consumer confidence numbers reported by the University of Michigan, interviews with mall shoppers in various parts of the country reveal an underlying sense of uncertainty that could undermine holiday spending.
In a survey conducted by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates Inc., the market research firm, in the five days after the election, 46 percent of the 450 responding households said they would spend less during the holidays this year than last.
"Although I am doing fine financially this year, many people are not doing as well, and that is scary," said Erika Peace, a 25-year-old systems analyst from Midland, Ohio. "Because of the economy, our jobs aren't that stable any more."
 
Ways to Limit Spending
 As was the case last year, shoppers are finding ingenious ways to limit holiday spending. Ms. Peace plans to buy most of the presents for her five family members with cash to avoid building up credit card debt and buying extravagant gifts.
Maria Wilson, a 27-year-old homemaker in Granada Hills, Calif., will make chocolate truffles and hand-made ornaments to give as gifts this year.
Mrs. Wilson did go to F.A.O. Schwarz, the Bentley of toy stores, to buy an anatomically correct male doll for her 18-month-old son, but not before trekking to Toys "R" Us and some local toy stores to compare prices. "I want quality at the best price I can get it," she said.
Attitudes like that are keeping Wall Street busy laying odds on how much discounting retailers will have to do this holiday. For the last several years, anxious retailers have slashed prices to drive holiday sales -- and slashed profits in the process.
This year, most have vowed to keep inventories lean to avoid such a reaction as Christmas Eve draws closer.
"The big advantage we have now is our inventories are better edited," said Carl Tooker, chairman of Rich's, one of the Federated Department Stores chains. "As a result, we can continually replace things that take off hard with fresh merchandise but not get stuck with things that don't move as well."
He estimated that Rich's sales would be 5.5 to 7 percent higher this holiday season than last year.
But a few analysts are less confident, noting that while October sales were very good, November got off to a slow start, although momentum has picked up again.
"Consumers are very value-oriented and price-sensitive still," said Thomas A. Filandro, a retail analyst at Gruntal & Company. "That will result in a retailing game of chicken: The consumer will sit at home waiting for prices to come down, and the retailer will flinch first. The consumer wins again."
At least one retailer was not waiting to encourage shoppers to its stores. Signs trumpeting "20 percent off almost everything Nov. 14 and 15 only" hung on the doors of Carson Pirie Scott & Company's flagship store on State Street in downtown Chicago.
"This Christmas is going to be promotional, no doubt about it, but I think it will be mostly planned promotions," said Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities. "Of course, it all depends on what happens the week after Thanksgiving. If things are slow, everyone will starting slashing prices."
Other merchants are using increased advertising and direct marketing efforts to spur sales this year. Gordon Segal, the president of Crate and Barrel, the Chicago-based home furnishings chain, said he increased advertising expenditures by 30 percent this year. And unlike more cautious competitors, Crate and Barrel is banking on a 20 percent increase in sales during the holidays and has stocked 20 percent more inventory to meet the anticipated demand.
 
Computer Price Cuts
 Nathan Morton, the president of CompUSA, a computer super- store, said his company's sales had continued to ratchet up at the same rate as in the third quarter, when they increased 21.1 percent in stores open at least one year. Mr. Morton said families were taking advantage of recent price cuts on personal computers.
He believes the retail industry will see about a 5 percent sales increase this holiday, but he is also cautious.
"Everyone's bullish, yes, but with a tinge of conservatism," he said. "The last couple of years, Christmas just hasn't come, and it's difficult to say it's going to be a barn burner because all the cards aren't in yet."

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Links Tight Credit to Slowdown

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said yesterday that a strong economic recovery remained elusive as long as banks were reluctant to lend and businesses were reluctant to borrow.
He said that banks appeared to be making credit somewhat more available but that reducing bank regulations could encourage more lending. 
 Speaking to the Tax Foundation, the Fed chairman said the credit crunch had been caused both by banks' reluctance to lend and by weak demand from the business community to borrow.
 
 
'No Evidence of Worsening'
 "Fortunately, the credit crunch, which has been so debilitating to the economic performance in this country over the past two to three years, has shown no evidence of worsening in recent months and may finally be retreating." Mr. Greenspan said.
In his speech at the Walforf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, he predicted there would soon be more bank failures, "perhaps some sizable ones," but he concluded that the banking community remained healthy enough to help lift the nation's economy.
"Although many problems remain before one can conclude that our banking system has fully weathered the storm of recent years," he said, "it certainly appears in sufficiently reasonable shape to assist in the financing of a sustained expansion in economic activity."
Copies of Mr. Greenspan's speech were made available to the press.
Mr. Greenspan said one root cause of the weak lending by banks was that businesses and households were reluctant to borrow because they were struggling to reduce their debt burdens, which swelled during the 1980's.
Trying to explain why the Fed's repeated interest-rate cuts have not done much to lift the economy, he said monetary policy could only do so much to ease these debt burdens.
"Monetary policy can only peripherally alter the perceived needs of businesses and households to strengthen balance sheets," he said.
The Fed chairman said that by cutting rates, the central bank made it somewhat easier for companies and families to handle their debt burdens, for example, by helping foster lower rates for consumer loans and home mortgages.
In ways, Mr. Greenspan seemed to try to take President Bush off the hook for the nation's protracted slump, suggesting that the Government could do little to overcome the reasons behind tight credit.
"Part of the so-called credit crunch problem reflects deep-seated economic forces which government policy can only tangentially affect," he said.
In dissecting the credit crunch, Mr. Greenspan said that "by far the greatest source of stagnant loan markets is weak demand." But on a modestly upbeat note, he suggested that loan demand, economic growth and consumer spending could pick up even before debt burdens were reduced to comfortable levels.
In his typically dense language, he said, "If, as balance sheets become more comfortable, businesses and households decide to reduce their excess debt more slowly, cash flows will be diverted to purchases of goods and services."
After banks and businesses have debated for months whether lenders were denying loans to worthy borrowers, Mr. Greenspan rendered a firm verdict that banks were indeed sometimes being too reluctant.
"An impressive number of worthy applicants have been rejected as banks pressed to rein in asset growth to preserve capital positions eroded by loan losses," he said.
He acknowledged that it was understandable for banks to tighten their lending standards after they had made so many bad loans, especially on commercial real estate, in the 1980's.
At the same time, he acknowledged that there was some legitimacy to bankers' complaints that regulators have tightened their standards, forcing banks to be more cautious in lending.
"Human nature being what it is," Mr. Greenspan said, "it is entirely understandable and credible that examiners have become tougher in evaluating loans as the consequences of earlier lax lending standards became apparent."
Mr. Greenspan noted that many banks were using their deposits to load up on Government securities instead of making loans, and he suggested this could make banks vulnerable to losses if interest rates rose suddenly.
"It is probably true," he said, "that greater interest-rate risks have developed of late because securities tend to have longer maturities than bank loans."

HEADLINE: Counties in New Jersey Retain Above-Average Credit Ratings

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Despite the region's deep recession, the 21 counties of New Jersey retain better credit ratings and sounder fiscal policies than most American counties, according to a profile of the state released yesterday by Moody's Investors Service.
Moody's, one of the nation's largest credit-rating agencies, said roughly half of New Jersey's counties maintained its highest ratings, Aa and Aaa. Nationally, only 18 percent of counties achieved those ratings. 
 The report released yesterday was the sixth in which Moody's analyzed all the counties in a state, and the first in which it studied a state in the New York metropolitan region. Moody's said it selected New Jersey for the study because few other states had undergone such profound economic changes since the early 1980's, first being swept up in booming growth, then battered by job losses, a depressed housing market and other recessionary woes.
The ratings save the counties money when they sell bonds to raise money because they pay lower interest rates than jurisdictions with less-favorable ratings.
In New Jersey, "the 1990's will be a period when the growth is over," said Michael Johnston, a Moody's vice president in charge of credit ratings in the Middle Atlantic region. As a result, he said, some or all of the New Jersey counties may have to reduce spending for recreation, parks, libraries or other services.
But for now, the report concluded, the finances of New Jersey counties are "substantially more favorable than for U.S. counties overall."
One reason, Moody's said, is that New Jersey has an average per capita income of $24,936, 33 percent higher than the national average, making it the nation's second-wealthiest state, following Connecticut.
Another reason for the high credit ratings, Moody's said, is a tradition of conservative fiscal practice by county officials, who in most cases have maintained larger budget surpluses than their counterparts elsewhere.
 
Nettlesome Problems
 Still, Moody's said, New Jersey's counties face economic hurdles. Among the most nettlesome may be solid waste disposal, which has already cost taxpayers dearly because counties have been slow to form working partnerships, the report found.
Other problems may lie in migration patterns, which have already reduced the populations and narrowed the tax bases of Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Union Counties, the urban and suburban corridor across the Hudson River from New York City.
Over all, the study said, New Jersey's population increased by 5 percent during the 1980's, compared with a 9.8 percent increase for the nation. New Jersey's most robust growth, fueled by a flight of business and families to lower-cost real estate beyond the New York City suburbs, came in Ocean, Somerset and Hunterdon Counties, where population grew by more than 18 percent.
On the other hand, Moody's said some dire predictions made in the early 1980's for New Jersey's old industrial cities had proved to be wrong.
"Some of the state's oldest cities appear to have reached some degree of economic stabilization," the report said. It cited Camden, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Passaic and Paterson, each of which showed gains in population during the 1980's.
Other analysts said they agreed with the Moody's conclusion that New Jersey counties were on relatively firm fiscal footing but faced more difficult times for the remainder of the decade.
"They are between the devil and a hard place," said David Listokin, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. He said the counties would face increasing economic difficulty in maintaining roads, bridges and other physical structures, with some of the biggest bills coming due in counties that experienced high-growth levels in the 1980's.
The solid waste problem "is a crisis that has been mounting for years and could get worse," Mr. Johnston of Moody's said. It is particularly acute for New Jersey, the nation's most densely populated state, the report said, because the density means both vast amounts of waste and few suitable disposal sites.
"Counties will need to issue relatively large amounts of debt to finance landfills or waste-to-energy facilities," the Moody's report said.
The report criticized the counties for being slow to respond to the 1990 recommendation of a task force appointed by Gov. Jim Florio that they band together to finance and build waste-disposal plants. So far, it said, only three coalitions have been formed. The counties in one group are Warren, Somerset and Hunterdon; in another are Essex and Bergen, and the third joins Mercer and Atlantic.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Defend Data On Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

Still smarting from election-week attacks on the integrity of Government statistics, the Commerce Department today took the highly unusual step of inviting closer scrutiny of its methods for compiling reports on gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of American economic performance.
Top officials summoned reporters from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal to deny strenuously that there was any "cooking" of the data in the department's report on Oct. 27 -- the week before Election Day -- that the gross domestic product grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate for the third quarter. That was well above the 1.5 percent that expert consensus had predicted. 
 High figures for military spending, personal consumption and inventories -- all components of the G.D.P. figure -- met with skepticism among Wall Street and other private economists, leading to news accounts that raised the possibility that the Bush Administration had intervened in the process for political advantage. The strongest allegations were made in The New York Post, which also charged the Administration in a front-page article on Nov. 5 with subverting the employment data for September.
 
 
Television News Report
 Commerce officials said that Dan Rather, in his CBS news report the following evening, used a picture of The Post's article to help illustrate his report on the October employment figures.
Another prominent account appeared in The Christian Science Monitor on Nov. 2, the headline reading "Bush Team Said to Skew Latest Economic-Growth Data."
In response, various officials at the Commerce Department and Labor Department have insisted that there had been no effort to meddle in a process carried out at all stages by career civil servants; political appointees within the departments see the results only on the morning of publication. The officials also said that the system's internal checks made tampering virtually impossible.
Both departments have responded with plausible, generally persuasive, explanations of suspiciously high numbers over the last three weeks. But officials said they feared that confidence of was not fully restored in the Government data, which are closely scrutinized by the investment community for indications of the economy's strength.
 
 
'Very Serious Thing'
 "It's really a very serious thing" to be accusing the Government of, said Carol S. Carson, director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. "It still hasn't been put to rest."
Robert P. Parker, associate director for national economic accounts, added that that while the economics fraternity might well come to accept the figures and be reassured, "Outside the Beltway, the notion that this could happen is not very far-fetched."
The allegations may have received more credibility than they normally would because of the Bush Administration's political use of some other Government agencies, most visibly the State Department's passport office, which investigated the files of President-elect Bill Clinton during the campaign.
 
Revisions Due Next Week
 Today's session took place in anticipation of the publication next Wednesday of revised figures for third-quarter growth but before officials had knowledge of what they would show. The figures are routinely revised, sometimes up and sometimes down, with the average change about four-tenths of 1 percent.
Still, a downward revision exceeding that average would almost certainly touch off a new round of questions about the reliability of the original data, since this would tend to support suspicions of overstatement in the closing days of the campaign.
Although the Wall Street G.D.P. consensus was generally too low, Mr. Parker noted that the 10 most optimistic forecasters polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators offered predictions that on average called for a 2.9 percent rate of increase -- a figure even higher than the Government's. There are about 50 participants in this survey.
 
Ultimately, a Judgment Call
 The officials also described an intricate system for internal questioning of suspicious numbers and of cross-checking the results for consistency.
But they admitted it was often difficult to arrive at estimates for international trade and some other categories for which hard figures arrive too late for inclusion. The department, though it uses various rules of thumb to serve as benchmarks, ultimately relies on its best judgment, they said.
Assuming, for example, that missing figures for September would eventually prove to equal the average for July and August, would have resulted in a 4 percent G.D.P. rate of advance for the third quarter, Mr. Parker said. Extrapolating the rate of change from the preceding months, on the other hand, would have produced a figure of only 2.1.
The officials, using their judgment, selected a number in between those two extremes.

HEADLINE: 2d Casino Operator Woos Bridgeport in Gaming Bid

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 18

 BODY:
A second major casino operator, Harrah's Casino Hotels, made a presentation to Bridgeport business and political leaders today, making it likely that casinos will compete to open in this depressed industrial city if Connecticut legalizes casino gambling.
While Harrah's has not selected a site or sketched a plan, it said it wanted to invest $300 million in a 100,000-square-foot casino, a 1,000-room hotel, and restaurant and entertainment areas built around replicas of landmarks like the Parthenon, the Eiffel Tower, a Mayan pyramid and a Chinese temple. 
 To Harrah's as well as Mirage Resorts, which presented a plan here last week, Bridgeport's great attraction is its location: only 60 miles from New York City, on an interstate, with land available on the waterfront.
But other factors are also in play for casinos interested in the immense New York market, as the gaming industry searches for new opportunities beyond Las Vegas and Atlantic City. New Jersey will not allow casinos outside Atlantic City, and New York's parimutuel racing industry appears to stand in the way of any casino in that state.
It is far from certain that slot machines and table games will be legalized in Connecticut, either, where one casino is now operated by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, but where Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has vowed to veto any bill allowing casinos off the reservation.
But if the economic lure of the gaming industry does prevail in the General Assembly, Bridgeport appears to have one more advantage: its residents, having seen their industry leave town and their government flirt with bankruptcy, are leaning toward welcoming a casino.
"We're looking at two nationally known, nationally respected, nationally recognized, quality casino developers and operators who have expressed an interest in Bridgeport," said Paul S. Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, which sponsored the luncheon today where Harrah's made its presentation.
"When was the last time," he asked, "we had such capacity willing to look at the potential of investing $250 million to $300 million here?"
The put-upon self-image of the city was evident minutes later, when Michael D. Rose, chief executive of Harrah's corporate parent, The Promus Companies Inc., was asked how Bridgeport's experience might differ from that of Atlantic City, where New Jersey had hoped casinos would prove a catalyst for rebuilding the decayed resort town.
 
Looking for Positives
 "There's no comparison between Bridgeport and Atlantic City as it was in the mid-1970's," Mr. Rose began. "Atlantic City was in extremely dire straits." He was interrupted by a growing swell of disbelieving laughter. "A lot worse than Bridgeport," he tried again, evoking more laughter.
Bridgeport has not officially endorsed casino gambling. Instead, a task force established by the business council spent six months investigating the casino industry and its impact in other communities. In December the task force will recommend a position to the council's board.
The process is similar to one going on in Hartford, where many legislators are waiting for the conclusions of a legislative task force on gaming before committing themselves for or against casinos in the session that opens in January.
"The issue," Mr. Timpanelli said today, "is do we want it, and where do we want it, and how do we do it so it impacts our city in a positive way."
He said that a survey of council members one month ago found two-thirds favoring casino gambling, compared with slightly more than half in a survey five months ago.
Mirage Resorts and Harrah's are the only two major casino developers to express interest in Bridgeport. The task force, said its chairman, William A. Bevacqua, has already decided that any casino in the city "should be done by a major developer."
"Where development has come about as the result of someone other than major players," he said, "it's proven to be a much less satisfactory operation. The big people seem to be able to do the kinds of things that we're interested in seeing."
Harrah's and Mirage have proposed casinos of roughly equivalent scale. Mirage has entered a joint venture with Robert Zeff, owner of the Bridgeport Jai-Alai Fronton, thereby eliminating a potential foe while securing his land on the waterfront on the East Side, just north of the Connecticut Turnpike.
With Mr. Zeff, Mirage acquires a dog track he plans to build, an awkward fit in a fantasy-oriented amusement center that Mirage hopes will attract families as well as gamblers.
Harrah's today proposed a casino that would also face the water, though it has not acquired a site; one possibility is on the East Side just south of the turnpike. While the casino complex would feature extravagant fantasies like transporting the Parthenon to Bridgeport, Harrah's would not appeal directly to families.
"Casinos by their nature are not intended for children," Mr. Rose said, in response to a question from the audience. "We don't view this as a primary part of our market."
Mr. Rose said he hoped Harrah's would serve as an anchor for redeveloping Bridgeport's dormant harbor. He also pointed to Harrah's record of hiring, training and keeping local employees in Atlantic City, its financial contributions to community activities wherever it has casinos, and its programs for combating compulsive gamblers and under-age gamblers.
He also pledged not to seek tax abatements or other favors from the city, should a casino be permitted here (most people favor allowing only one casino in the city).
But to a city hoping for a savior, Mr. Rose offered the caution that Mirage's chief executive, Stephen A. Wynn, had issued a week before: "The one thing that you shouldn't expect from a casino operator is that they come in and solve all of your problems. We're not a panacea."

Allied-Signal Sells Stake in Union Texas

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Allied-Signal Inc. said yesterday that it had sold 33.3 million common shares of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings for $585 million, ending a relationship with the oil and gas exploration company that began three decades ago.
The stock was sold through a secondary public offering by a syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. Allied-Signal announced earlier this month that it was planning the common stock sale. It follows Allied's redemption in September of a total of $355 million in Union Texas preferred stock and warrants. 
 Allied-Signal said yesterday that the nearly $940 million it received would be used to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes. A spokesman for the company said some of the money might be used for "future projects associated with productivity."
At the end of September, Allied-Signal's total debt was $2.4 billion. The company said it intended to pay down outstanding commercial paper and other short-term borrowings as well as long-term debt that can be repurchased "on an economic basis."
Allied-Signal, which is Based in Morristown, N.J., acquired Union Texas in 1962. As recently as the late 1970's the energy company was responsible for the bulk of Allied's earnings.
But in 1985 Allied-Signal decided to begin to ease out of the business and sold half the company to Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm. A subsequent public offering of Union Texas's shares cut Allied's stake to 39 percent.
Alied-Signal is an advanced technology company with businesses in aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials, and the range of its products stretches from jet aircraft engines to Fram auto filters and Autolite spark plugs to chemicals, fibers and other materials.
On Oct. 27 the company reported third-quarter earnings of $140 million, up 75 percent from levels a year earlier levels, on sales of $2.94 billion.
Allied-Signal has about about 90,000 employees. Its stock slipped 12.5 cents yesterday, to $55.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries and Municipals Gain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices rose and yields fell yesterday across the board in the Treasury market. The municipal bond market also gained as investors bought up $1.26 billion in North Carolina power bonds.
Traders are not sure if this is a rally or just the other side of the sharp fall in prices at the end of last week. This will be answered in the next several days of trading, especially if the yield on the 30-year bond can break below the 7.50 percent it fell to yesterday. 
 But traders are a little more sure of some other themes. One is that the market should continue to be volatile until investors and traders know more about President-elect Bill Clinton's economic program and the people he will appoint to the important economic jobs in the new Administration.
 
Volatility Is Evident
 As a measure of volatility, take the new 5.125 percent three-year note auctioned last week. The average yield at the auction was 5.17 percent on Tuesday, it fell to 5 percent Thursday but jumped, as prices fell, to 5.20 percent Monday. It fell to 5.14 percent Tuesday, and yesterday as the price rose 6/32 , the yield dropped to 5.06 percent.
Another note heard in the market is that the rise in short-term interest rates has been greater than it should be because investors believe the Federal Reserve has decided not to cut short-term interest rates any further. On the three-month Treasury bill, the discount rate has jumped from 2.58 percent on Oct. 1 to 3.14 percent Tuesday.
David Ader, fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the reaction would be justified only if the Fed was expected to raise interest rates soon. But that is not the case. This means the short-end issues could rally a little, as it did yesterday as the discount rate on the three-month Treasury bill dropped to 3.12 percent.
The third theme is that the longer maturities -- the 10-year note and the 30-year bond -- will be the best performers. So in the last several trading days, while the rest of the market has been bouncing up and down, the prices on these two securities have moved only upward.
One reason for this is that investors fear short-term interest rates will rise, prompting them to sell short maturities and buy longer. In addition, this move to the longer end has been supported by the most recent data showing that inflation continues to be in check.
Since the Treasury auction last week, both the 10-year note due in August 2002 and the new 7.625 percent 30-year bond have rallied strongly. The yield on the 10-year note has dropped from the 6.93 percent at the auction to 6.75 percent yesterday. And the yield on the 30-year bond is down from the 7.66 percent at the auction to 7.50 percent yesterday, when the price rose 13/32 .
In trading yesterday, the market got a lift from the Federal Reserve, when it bought notes and bonds as part of a regular effort to keep the right level of reserves in the banking system. The Fed does this buying so that seasonal demands for money by consumers will not push short-term interest rates higher than the target level set by the central bank.
 
Municipal Bonds
 Prices of actively traded bonds were up about 3/4 point, traders said. The market got a lift from the rally in the Treasury market and because after-tax yields in the municipal bond market are attractive and will be even more so if President-elect Clinton goes through with his proposal to raise taxes on families with annual incomes over $200,000.
The sale of bonds by the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency went so well that the lead underwriter, Goldman, Sachs & Company, repriced the issue late yesterday and lowered yields in a range of 4 to 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
One measure of the demand, said Richard Kolman, the manager of the municipal syndicate, was that the bond due in 2017 was expected to be priced to yield more than 6.60 percent last week. But yesterday it was priced to yield 6.48 percent.
The bonds due in 1994 were priced to yield 3.55 percent; for 1997 the yield is 4.65 percent; for 2002, 5.80 percent; 2009, 6.15 percent, and 2015, 6.43 percent.
Another sale that went well, despite the state's budget problems, was the $400 million in general obligations sold by California. Goldman, Sachs won the bidding for the bonds. the bonds were priced to yield 2.90 percent in 1993, 5.65 percent in 2002; 6.15 percent in 2009; 6.20 percent in 2011, and 6.15 percent in 2017. The taxable equivalent for the 10-year bond due in 2002 is 8.19 percent, which is 144 basis points more than the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.

Tax-Exempt Yields Off a Bit While Taxables Are Flat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt money market funds moved slightly lower in the latest week, while taxable funds were unchanged, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, which surveys more than 850 funds.
Tax-exempt yields declined for the second consecutive week, and the assets of tax-exempt funds declined by $449 million, to a total of $97.5 billion. The average number of days left to maturity of securities was down a day, to 63. 
 The seven-day average compounded yield fell to 2.21 percent, from 2.25 percent the previous week, while the simple yield slipped to 2.18 percent from 2.22 percent. Over 30 days, the compounded average yield was at 2.23 percent, and the simple yield was at 2.21 percent, both unchanged.
Assuming no state taxes, the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket is about 3.07 percent and 3.20 percent for investors in the 31 percent bracket.
 
The Top Performer
 In surveying tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund distributed by the Strong/Corneliuson Capital Managementwas the top performer, with a yield of 2.85 percent.
"In effect, little has changed from last week," said Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist. "But the heavy supply of new municipal short-term paper being priced this week may have some impact on money market fund yields next week."
The average seven-day compounded yield for a taxable money market fund was unchanged at 2.78 percent, and the simple yield was 2.74 percent, also unchanged. Over 30 days, the average compounded yield was 2.78 percent, and the simple yield was 2.74 percent, both down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios fell by 2, to 63. That is not much of a move, the analysts said, but a move into the mid-50's could be a signal that rates may be headed higher.
The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, the top yield producer the last few weeks, had the best return in the latest week, too, with a yield of 3.77 percent.
For government-only funds with assets less than $100 million, the United Services Government Securities Savings Fund, distributed by United Services in San Antonio, fell to 3.86 percent, from 3.95 percent the previous week.
Elsewhere, the average yield on a bank money market account was at 2.78 percent, down a basis point from the previous week.

G.M. to Curtail Dealer Financing and Drop Allante

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
In another move to shore up its sagging finances, the General Motors Corporation notified its 9,000 dealers today that its General Motors Acceptance Corporation unit would no longer provide wholesale and retail financing for non-G.M. models sold by dealers who also sell General Motors cars.
Separately, G.M.'s Cadillac division said it was dropping its Allante two-seater luxury roadster next year, after a seven-year run in which it often fell short of Cadillac's, and owners', expectations. 
 The current level of wholesale and retail financing for non-G.M. cars amounts to about $6 billion, or 10 percent of G.M.A.C.'s $60 billion in worldwide automotive financing.
"Given our performance and the fact we're struggling on several fronts to be more productive," said John Rines, president of G.M.A.C., "we're focusing our assets primarily on G.M. products." Mr. Rines said he had spoken to about 30 dealers, "and my impression is this won't cause a big commotion."
 
2,000 Dealerships Affected
 A significant number of G.M. dealers also own non-G.M. franchises. A G.M. spokesman said about 2,000 dealerships nationwide would be affected, though banks and other financial institutions probably would be able to replace G.M.'s financing.
G.M. said its decision on retail financing would become effective Jan. 1 and on wholesale financing on March 1. The auto maker will continue to provide financing for non-G.M. used cars.
G.M. said its decision had been prompted by lowered credit ratings on its commercial paper, which are like corporate i.o.u.'s, and the prospect the ratings could fall further. "We want to make sure we prudently manage any liquidity risks," the G.M. spokesman said.
If G.M.'s credit ratings on commercial paper were to fall further, the auto maker might be shut out of that market, forcing it to borrow at a more expensive rate elsewhere. Thus, G.M. might not be able to lend except at rates that would preclude it from making money or might cause G.M. to lose money.
G.M. currently has borrowings of about $20 billion in the commercial paper market, down from about $28 billion last year, the spokesman said.
 
A 'Luxury They Could Ill Afford'
 In eliminating of the Cadillac Allante, Cadillac said the car was profitable but that sales of the $62,000 car had slowed with the sluggish economy. And the expensive manufacturing process -- undercarriages made in Detroit and flown to Italy, where the Pininfarina-built bodies and interiors are installed and flown back to the United States -- is out of step with the new management's eagerness to improve efficiency and focus on high-volume products.
"It was another luxury they can ill afford," said Thomas M. Dukes, director of competitive assessment for J. D. Power & Associates, an auto marketing consultant.
The Allante announcement disappointed many Cadillac dealers, who noted that the model brought additional business. But the car never created the halo with which Cadillac had hoped to illuminate the entire division.
 
A Roof That Annoyed
 The Allante's problems included a convertible roof that leaked and created bothersome wind noise. The manually operated roof was also a struggle for many owners, who believed the top on such an expensive car should operate with the push of a button. The newer models are semiautomated but still require manual help.
"I don't like to spend that kind of money and have a half-manual top," said Joel Must, president of Detroit City Dairy, who owned one before trading it for a Cadillac Seville.
Allante production has fallen since the 1987 model year, when 3,363 Allantes were made. In the first 10 months of 1992, Cadillac sold 1,844 Allantes, a 26 percent drop from the corresponding period in 1991. When it was introduced, Cadillac said it was prepared to build 7,800 of the luxury cars a year.
Although Cadillac introduced many technological innovations in the Allante, including its Northstar V-8 engine in April, the roadster did not measure up to many competitors in its handling and other performance characteristics. Mr. Dukes said the car's boxy body and square, button-laden dashboard also did not appeal to many consumers, who in general seem more taken with the flowing lines of many European and Japanese models.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished lower yesterday against most leading currencies, despite a report that the United States trade deficit shrank in September.
Gold prices were mixed. Gold for current delivery rose 80 cents an ounce, to $335.10, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. But in after-hours trading, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold at $334.75 an ounce, down 65 cents from Tuesday's late bid. 
 The dollar was mixed when foreign exchange trading wound down in Europe, but lost ground toward the end of domestic dealings.
"We are seeing a late selloff here," said Alan Jirkovsky, managing director of foreign exchange at the Continental Bank in Chicago. He attributed the late move to internal conditions in the currency market.
He said the report that the American trade deficit fell to $8.31 billion in September from $8.95 billion in August would normally have helped the dollar, particularly since it reflected an unexpected 6.8 percent rise in exports.
That is usually good news for the dollar because an increase in demand for American-made goods would mean more dollars would be required to make the purchases.
But Mr. Jirkovsky said the market shrugged off the report, possibly reasoning that export growth would not be sustained with recessions in Europe.
"It's good today, but what will it look like a month from now?" he asked.
John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ABN-AMRO Bank in New York, said the trade figures were essentially a nonevent for the currency markets, where attention was focused on trading among European currencies.
He said the Swedish krona, for example, was under severe pressure for most of the day with traders selling that currency for German marks.
"The dollar has been of secondary interest today," Mr. McCarthy said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.22 yen, down 0.34 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.85 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 123.70 yen, from 124.35 yen late Tuesday.
The dollar also lost ground to the British pound. In London, the pound rose to $1.5230, from $1.5225 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Under Siege: A Muslim Family Survives, With Fear and Grace, in Sarajevo

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nov. 18

 BODY:
It is cold now at the home of Amra and Sakir Dzirlo, bitterly so when the winter wind beats against the plastic sheeting that has replaced window glass broken by exploding shells. But the chill that pervades 27 Marshal Tito Street is deeper than the physical hardships of the Sarajevo siege.
As winter sets in, there is a bleakness of mood that pervades the old apartment, something that transcends the need to burn old furniture for heating and the dwindling food reserves that have cut the diet for the family of six to the meanest levels. 
 "There is a new saying in Sarajevo," Mr. Dzirlo said the other day: " 'We have all lived here together. We will all die here together.' "
 
An Intolerable Life
 The pressures from the Serbian nationalists who have besieged the city for seven months, reducing much of it to rubble with their artillery and denying supplies of food, electricity and water to the 400,000 residents, have made life for many intolerable.
Among the Dzirlos -- Sakir, a 44-year-old electrical engineer; Amra, a 42-year-old architect and interior designer, and their four children, two daughters and twin sons -- thoughts have turned to something that was once unthinkable: whether they should try to escape and join more than a million other Bosnian Muslims who have become refugees.
"Here is tragical situation, like Spania, when Ferdinand and Isabella say to Muslims, Jewish, 'Go out,' " said Mr. Dzirlo, who traces his family's roots to the last of the Spanish Moors. He continued in his fractured English: "But say me, where must we go if we cannot stay here -- to Libya or something? Maybe to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait? Are we complete rubbish people, to wander about for few hundred years, look for another place?"
 
Preparing for the Impossible
 For the moment, discussion of fleeing is moot, since the Bosnian Army defending Sarajevo has said it will permit no more evacuations, and the Serbian forces are seizing Muslims to exchange for Serbian prisoners.
The family's worst nightmare is that the city's defenders will crack and Serbs will pour into the city, exacting terrible revenge on the residents who have held out against them for so long. But many families, including the Dzirlos, have concluded that even if the defense holds, it may be impossible to survive the winter, with insufficient food and heat and with no way to seal the gaping holes in their roof and walls that have been made by Serbian shells.
To prepare for the moment when they can wait no longer, the family car has a jerrycan of gasoline, bought on the black market, and a new battery. Every document that could help the family resettle elsewhere has been pulled from dusty files, including the expired New York State driver's license that Mr. Dzirlo got during a year of graduate engineering studies at New York University.
 
A Funeral
The Adults Mourn, The Young Dream
 The turning point for the Dzirlos (the name is pronounced JEER-low) came two weeks ago, after their next-door neighbor and close family friend, Hamid Pasic, a 79-year-old retired professor of medicine at the University of Sarajevo, was killed by a mortar during an afternoon stroll.
As if to demonstrate that he, at least, would not be cowed by the shelling, Dr. Pasic had insisted on going out every day for a walk up and down Tito Street, visiting street-corner markets to see if there was any food that his modest pension could buy, consoling survivors. "Everything will be O.K.," he would say, chuckling.
After the mortar blast, it took two days for Mr. Dzirlo to trace his friend, telephoning police stations and morgues until officials at the old military hospital a mile away said a body fitting a description of the old man had been brought in.
A funeral was arranged in an old Muslim cemetery at Vrabanusja, up cobblestone alleyways that lead to one of the oldest Muslim quarters. Mr. Dzirlo was one of a handful of mourners, glancing nervously toward Serbian gun positions on the hills.
 
Allah's Will
 Afterwards, as he paced quickly back down the hill, the normally voluble Mr. Dzirlo was silent. The silence continued around the Dzirlos' cramped dining table, save for the studied cheeriness of Amra Dzirlo, who had laid on a late lunch of home-made quince juice and ustipak, the fried batter cakes that are a staple among the Muslims.
After a while, Mr. Dzirlo gave voice to his thoughts. "Who knows who will be next?" he asked. "You? Me? Amra? The children? Mrs. Pasic? We are alone now, except for Allah. If it is Allah's will, we will survive."
Mr. Dzirlo's remarks set off a brief debate, conducted in English out of courtesy to this reporter, who met the Dzirlos in early June and has spent weeks with the family, following their progress in several dispatches.
The 14-year-old twins, Mahir and Malik, were all for planning an escape. But Meliha, the 16-year-old daughter, demurred. "What is the point to talk about things that are impossible?" she asked.
Lejla, her 10-year-old sister, asked for a translation. "I would like to go to New York, maybe Hollywood," she said, reeling off names learned from television programs that have been mostly a memory since Serbian forces cut off electricity in July.
 
The Crossroads
Revenge Stains The Old Tolerance
 Sarajevo is at the northern fringe of the zone where the worlds of Europe and the Orient meet, and the city's ethnic heterogeneity is a testament to the fact that diversity was tolerated during much of its history.
Serbian nationalists have now seized much of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a Serbian mini-state that as been "ethnically cleansed" of Muslims and Croats. But the Ottoman Turks, the Muslims who ruled Bosnia for four centuries until they were driven out in 1878, tolerated Roman Catholic Croats and Eastern Orthodox Serbs, as well as Jews.
How completely the cultures blended is apparent after one mounts the darkened stone stairwell to the Dzirlos' second-floor apartment.
Inside, there is a foyer where shoes are removed in the Muslim tradition, and carpets where the family kneels at 5 A.M. for the first of five daily prayers. Beyond is a living room filled with filigreed screens and tables from Turkey, the home of Amra Dzirlo's ancestors, and delicate oil paintings of wooden vessels with graceful sails moving down the Nile.
But along with these, there is also a Viennese grand piano dating to the 1880's. On nights of intensive shelling, Meliha, considered one of Sarajevo's most promising young pianists, plays Beethoven sonatas and the twins play classical guitar.
In such a home there is no need to belabor points that Muslims in Sarajevo are often keen to make: that by standards of education and professional skills and cosmopolitan tastes, they have no reason to feel inferior to the Serbs, and that while they observe traditions of Islam engendered in the Middle East, they consider themselves no less European than, say, Germans or Italians, and in any case no more strangers here than Serbs.
As a matter of ethnicity the point is irrefutable since, unlike the Dzirlos, most Muslims in Sarajevo are Slavs, like the Serbs. The Slavic Muslims converted to Islam under Ottoman rule, filled many of the civil-service positions under the Ottomans and developed into a class of educated, urban landholders, more and more distinct from the predominantly rural, agricultural and less educated Serbs.
 
'Genocide' Against the 'Filth'
 But the Serbian nationalists accuse the Muslims of being traitors to the Slavic people, and such denunciations have been used to justify, and perhaps to inspire, the "ethnic cleansing" that has driven more half of Bosnia's Muslims from their homes, and killed and wounded tens of thousands.
The Serbian militiamen who have done much of the killing refer to Muslims as borije, or filth, and say their job will be done when Muslims revert to being Serbs, or are eliminated.
To Sakir Dzirlo, this amounts to "genocide," requiring Muslims to fight back as long as it takes to avenge what has happened in the war. But Amra Dzirlo takes the lead in citing the Koran's teachings on tolerance. "Tomorrow, I forget all, if war is stop," she said.
 
Interethnic 'Honesty'
 What all the Dzirlos agree on is that Sarajevo should be neither a Muslim nor a Serbian city, but a place where all groups co-exist.
Within the family, the war is seen as being not so much between between Serbs and Muslims and Croats as between raja, a Bosnian term meaning honest people of any ethnic group, and papak, literally the hoof of a farm animal, a disparaging phrase to refer to people hostile to urban mingling. Few things please Mr. Dzirlo more than meeting a Serbian friend and proclaiming: "This man is raja."
In contrast, he denounces Radovan Karadzic, the Sarajevo psychiatrist who is leader of the Serbian nationalist party in Bosnia. Mr. Karadzic came to Sarajevo as a boy from a mountain village in Montenegro, the smaller of the two remaining republics of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav federation, and Mr. Dzirlo delights in mocking him: "Karadzic is papak, he come from mountains, from sheep, and he want to be king."
 
A Gadfly
Beseeching Serbs, Beseeching Bush
 Until the outbreak of the war, Mr. Dzirlo took little interest in politics. As long as Yugoslavia was under Communist rule, Mr. Dzirlo, like many professional people here, concentrated on his work and his family, privately disparaging the Communist system but avoiding open opposition.
But since the siege began, the apartment on Tito Street has become a sort of unofficial citizen's bureau. Before the Serbian forces cut off telephone links with the outside world, Mr. Dzirlo tried to dial President Bush, President Francois Mitterand and other international figures, seeking their intercession in the war.
"My name is Sakir Dzirlo, and I am writing to you in the name of all honest citizens who stayed in ruins in Sarajevo," he wrote to Mr. Bush in June. "This is crime war from robbers of Serbia, Montenegro and Yugoslav Army on citizens of Sarajevo. You could stop this holocaust but you did not, and we don't know why."
In the early weeks of the siege, when the Serbian officers commanding Yugoslav Army units shelling the city were still in nearby barracks, Mr. Dzirlo walked to the barracks, argued his way in and confronted Gen. Milutin Kukanjac, the army commander.
"What do you think you are doing?" he asked, according to a friend from Tito Street who was present. "Are you mad or something?"
 
The Children
The Cruel Lessons Learned Under Fire
 For the Dzirlo children, the war has meant an end to schooling. But it has not meant an end to learning: their mother takes them to libraries and borrows books from friends on languages and science and literature, reminding the children of the Koran's insistence on the need for study. Anything about the United States is encouraged, particularly books dealing with American liberties.
"It is reason why America go straight up, in economy, in politics, because you are watching individual," Mr. Dzirlo said.
Education of a more unusual kind has come from dodging from doorway to doorway under shellfire, and dashing across intersections to avoid Serbian snipers.
Mahir and Malik have been on the streets almost every day, usually accompanying their father in a daily round of fetching water from the mosques, visiting Mr. Dzirlo's ailing mother, who lives nearby, lining up for bread and scouring the city for increasingly scarce bundles of wood.
Now, when the neighborhood is hit by a shell, the boys identify it instantly. "That was PAM," Malik said one day, using the Yugoslav military term for 40-millimeter antiaircraft guns.
 
Making Do for Food
 On other occasions, when sniper bullets have whizzed overhead, the twins have talked like battle veterans, advising on routes that narrow the snipers' field of fire. "Fast here!" they will shout, springing across a roadway, or "Keep down!"
Usually, the daughters stay inside, helping their mother, and it is to them, as much as to the men, that the family will owe its survival if it makes it through until spring. For months, they have been preparing stocks of food, discreetly, so as not to stir resentment among neighbors.
They will not estimate how long they can hold out on their reserves of flour and cooking oil, tea and toilet paper and candles and soap. A hint has come from Meliha, but it has been grim. "Until January, if we are still alive by then," she said, with a grim chuckle.
It is a tribute to Amra Dzirlo's ingenuity that the family has anything to eat but bread, pasta and rice. She has scoured the city for rose petals and herb grasses and fruits of every kind, apples and quinces and pears, to make jams and preserves, as well as delicacies like kiflice, a sweet cake.
 
Generosity Through Sacrifice
 Visitors are treated to generous snacks and meals, and she waves away compliments as if anything less would be a dereliction of hospitality.
Often, visitors eat alone. Even at mealtimes, the family's habit is to say that they have already eaten, although the absence of any dirty plates suggests otherwise, as does the fact that Amra Dzirlo has lost more than 30 pounds during the siege.
But it is part of the protocol of the siege, and of the Dzirlos' family pride, that visitors accept the hospitality without demurral. Sooner than eat herself, Amra Dzirlo will frequently offer a second helping.
 
25 Funerals, and More
 Little is said about the Dzirlos' economic losses in the war, which include the disappearance of tens of thousands of dollars in savings from the Sarajevo branches of banks with headquarters in Serbia.
The family has lost count of relatives and friends and neighbors who have been killed, including friends of the children. Mr. Dzirlo has attended at least 25 funerals, and those were only the ones that he could get to when he was not at work.
His job, as an executive of the Sarajevo electricity utility, Elektroprivreda, has been a source of relentless frustration. Every time transmission towers and transformer stations attacked by the Serbian forces are repaired, they are attacked again, so the city never has more than a fraction of its peacetime electrical power, and often none at all.
In September, the utility's headquarters was destroyed by fire, along with its records. Now, going to work is largely a formality for Sakir Dzirlo.
Before the war, Amra Dzirlo also juggled her career with her family; now, like most Sarajevans, she is out of work.
"We are sitting and we are watching," Mr. Dzirlo said.
 
'A Little Trick' Goes Awry
 Mostly, his inventiveness goes into schemes to keep the household working. Candles have been made from strips of polyethylene cut from lighting fixtures in abandoned buildings, or from shoelaces floating in cooking oil. To assure getting news after the batteries in their transistor radio ran out, an old car battery has been hooked to a Sony Walkman. One of the children tunes into Radio Sarajevo or the British Broadcasting Corporation, listens through the headphones and relays items to the others.
Sometimes, Mr. Dzirlo's efforts go awry, as they did when he announced that he had organized "a little trick" that would divert a small amount of emergency electricity to the family from a local distribution board.
The plan was for the power to be fed to the home of a friendly neighbor, from there to Dr. Pasic's apartment, and by a cable through Dr. Pasic's back window to the Dzirlos. Each apartment along the way would get power, so neighbors would not accuse Mr. Dzirlo of abusing his position at the utility.
But the scheme went wrong when a technician routed the power to an apartment of a family the Dzirlos hardly knew. Mr. Dzirlo, frantic, ended up stringing cables from a balcony overlooking Tito Street, with a crowd of eager onlookers shouting queries about where the power was coming from.
By the time he had strung cables to every neighbor who needed mollifying, there was only enough left for the Dzirlos to light a single table lamp and the children's fish tank.
Pretty soon, even that supply failed. Weeks later, the family was still laughing over the incident.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Backing Serbian President's Internal Foes

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Having failed to budge President Slobodan Milosevic from his position as Serbia's strongman with economic and political sanctions, the United States is now trying to increase pressure for his ouster by supporting Serbian opposition to him, especially on Yugoslav television.
While the Bush Administration is pushing to tighten enforcement of a United Nations embargo against Yugoslavia, it is seeking an exemption to the sanctions to permit the export of communications equipment to independent television stations in Belgrade, the Serbian and the federal Yugoslav capital. 
 On Monday the Security Council passed a resolution, proposed by the United States, to enforce the embargo with a naval blockade of Yugoslavia's Adriatic ports in an effort to halt the smuggling of crucial goods like oil.
Administration officials said the effort on behalf of the independent Studio-B channel and TV-Politika in the Serbian capital is intended to assist forces opposed to Mr. Milosevic, who faces an election in about a month.
Mr. Milosevic is perceived here and in other Western capitals as the principal architect of the seven-month-old campaign against Bosnia and Herzegovina and the war last year in Croatia.
Senior State Department officials have said privately that the ousting of the Serbian President is a basic policy goal, although the Administration has avoided saying this in public. Although it has promoted harsh economic and political sanctions, the United States has done little to support Serbian forces opposed to Mr. Milosevic.
His Socialist Party won office in December 1990 largely because his supporters dominated not only the principal Belgrade television network, but also the major Serbian newspapers.
The Milosevic monoply in the print media was largely eliminated during the summer by the staffs of the dailies Politika and Borba and of the weekly Nin. But Belgrade's Channel 1 television, the principal source of information for the nearly nine million Serbs, remains firmly in the hands of the Milosevic Government.
The main television alternatives is Studio-B, a small station with rudimentary equipment whose range is limited to a radius of about 40 miles, reaching a maximum of barely two million Serbs.
"We strongly support the effort to help Studio B and the other free media," an Administration official said today. He said Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Acting Secretary of State, was personally backing the proposal. It also has the support of Cyrus R. Vance, the former American Secretary of State who is now the special United Nations envoy for the Yugoslav conflict.
The drive to increase the strength of independent broadcasters was stepped up last week by Milan Panic, an American-Serbian who is Prime Minister of federal Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. On Nov. 11, Mr. Panic wrote the 15-member Sanctions Committee of the United Nations Security Council saying, "I request your urgent consideration of this request of my Government to import the television equipment."
He said it was needed "to provide all of Yugoslavia's political parties with a television capability equal to that of Serbia's ruling regime, which now controls the only television broadcasting transmitters powerful enough to reach the entire nation." Otherwise, he said, the Milosevic Government will retain "unfair advantage."
Mr. Panic put a price tag of about $5 million on the equipment required, although technical specialists said the enhancement plan could probably be accomplished for far less. The equipment needed consists mainly of repeater stations and antennas.
The proposal for an embargo exemption was initially opposed by Britain, a permanent member of the Security Council. Administration officials said they were hopeful that they could obtain unanimous approval by the Council by the end of the week.
The embargo exemption received the endorsements in recent days of Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana. Two foreign policy advisers of President-elect Bill Clinton have also voiced support for the idea.

HEADLINE: Redoubling the Efforts At Teaching Geography

 BODY:
Students in Allyson Geary's ninth-grade class at Central High School in Independence, Ore., watch the Los Angeles Dodgers on television at home. But when Ms. Geary asked them in September where Los Angeles was, most responded with blank stares.
Alarmed that her class knew more about bunts than borders, Ms. Geary turned to the National Geographic Society for help. That help has now arrived in the form of the 160,000 geography teaching kits that the society sent to schools earlier this month for use during National Geography Awareness Week, Nov. 15-21. 
 "By the end of the week the class will know where Somalia, Yugoslavia and even Switzerland are," Ms. Geary said.
She said that as part of National Geography Awareness Week, designated by Congress in 1988, she would divide her class into sections representing different continents. The students will analyze the politics and geography of each continent and discuss how its resources should be allocated.
National Geography Awareness Week was ordered by Congress to combat a widespread ignorance of geography. A survey of 12,320 people in 10 countries conducted by the Gallup Organization for the National Geographic Society in 1988 found that Americans 18 to 24 years old ranked last in geographic knowledge. A quarter of the Americans could not find the Pacific Ocean on a map.
Gilbert M. Grosvenor, the president and chairman of the society, said that after World War II, many schools stopped teaching geography as a separate course, folding it into social-studies classes, where it was given little emphasis. "Geography is not just about memorizing state capitals," he said. "Do you know from what major city in the United States you can drive south and enter Canada? Do you know the fourth-largest state in the United States? Most Americans don't know the answers to these questions."
As part of its own efforts to help re-educate people about geography, American Express has established a toll-free phone number that will operate through Feb. 28: (800) 395-4562. The line is open from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. E.S.T. Monday through Friday.
And the answers to Mr. Grosvenor's questions? Detroit and Montana.

HEADLINE: To Be Rescued, Historical Society May End Up Joining Its Savior

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The board of trustees of the New York Public Library approved a plan to assist the financially troubled New-York Historical Society yesterday. The directors of the library will consider lending the society about $1.5 million and will enter into formal discussions that could result in a merger of the two institutions.
"We don't know exactly where this will lead," said Dr. Timothy S. Healy, the president of the library. "The possibilities range from folding the society to merge with us to finding a white knight and not needing our help. 
 "We're very pleased. The society has a collection that dovetails with ours."
 
Fine and Decorative Art Objects
 The society is housed in a four-story limestone classical landmark at 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, and is among the first cultural and educational institutions established in the United States. The collections include 1.6 million fine and decorative art objects and nearly three million manuscripts, maps and historical documents.
The society's research library, which has 650,000 volumes and nearly three million manuscripts, maps and historic documents, focuses on the early years of the United States and the Civil War.
Typically, about 200 objects are on display in the society's galleries. These include such permanent exhibitions as 40 Tiffany lamps and windows, 40 Audubon watercolors and many paintings, including Thomas Cole's five-part allegorical series, "The Course of Empire."
Marshall Rose, the chairman of the library, said, "This agreement gives both of us enough time to see what the proper solution will be."
He added that since the library's endowment is $225 million, a loan of about $1.5 million to the hard-pressed society is reasonable.
 
The Need for Money
 Norman Pearlstine, the chairman of the society, said that six weeks ago he approached Dr. Healy and Mr. Rose with a proposal when it became clear that without an emergency infusion of cash the society would have to close. The society's board formally approached the library on Monday.
On the verge of financial collapse and under investigation by the State Attorney General for the mismanagement of its collections in the summer of 1988, the society replaced its directors and most of its board. Over the last four years, the new leaders raised more than $22 million, secured the collections and reduced the deficit by half, but that was not enough.
"We have made considerable progress over the past few years in preserving our collections and making them more available to the public," Mr. Pearlstine said, "but the plain fact is that we have run out of cash and we have run out of time."
He added that although a loan from the library would enable the society to get through its current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, he did not think it would be possible for the society to remain "independent and viable" beyond then.
Mr. Pearlstine, a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal who has been a board member of the society since 1985 and its chairman since 1989, said he had approached the library after coming to the belief that the library provided the best hope for preserving its collections and keeping them in New York City.
 
'To Consider Appropriate Options'
 "The library's assistance," he said, "will give us time to consider appropriate options, including possible affiliations with the library or some other institution."
He said that the library's approval of the proposed loan would permit the institution to remain open after December, but that the society would continue to pursue plans to temporarily close its exhibition galleries in January.
"The society's collections are uniquely complementary with those of the library," he said.
The New York Public Library consists of 82 branches, which circulate materials, and four research centers, including the Central Research Library at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, the annex on West 43d Street, the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street, in Harlem.
In May, the library bought 213,000 square feet of space in the old B. Altman Building at 34th Street and Madison Avenue, and plans to move its science and business collections there in 1995.
 
With Various Options
 One possibility to be studied, Mr. Pearlstine said, would be to move the society's library to space vacated in the Central Research Library when the science and business collections are moved out in 1995, and to combine the society's newspaper collection with that of the library's extensive newspaper collection housed in the 43d Street Annex.
In addition, he said, the society has a strong collection of 19th-century black-history materials, which might well be moved to the Schomburg Center.
"These are exciting possibilities," Mr. Pearlstine said, "but I think the final decisions in such matters are better made by curators than by administrative heads of organizations."
In recent years, the society has lurched from one crisis to another. In 1982, Dr. James B. Bell, then the director, became embroiled in controversy because of his treatment of a senior employee. He had dismissed Mary Childs Black, the highly regarded curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts. Mrs. Black protested the abrupt dismissal and this was widely supported throughout the museum world. The matter was finally resolved when the society agreed to pay Mrs. Black, who died last February, the back pay and vacation owed to her together with her pension.
 
With Dismissals and Fewer Hours
 Six years later, the society found itself on the brink of bankruptcy. A mounting budget deficit, a dwindling endowment and everything from a leaky roof to storage conditions that were steadily destroying the collection forced the society to take drastic action. In June 1988, the trustees ended Sunday visiting hours, closed two of the museum's four floors and dismissed nearly a quarter of the institution's 106-member staff.
The next month, after disclosures in The New York Times revealed the woeful state of the collection, Dr. Bell resigned and his deputy was dismissed.
Also that year, the society had a brush with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work was soon to become notorious. Mr. Mapplethorpe, acting as the executor of the estate of Samuel Wagstaff Jr., sued the society for the return of a silver collection that Mr. Wagstaff had lent it in 1986. Eventually, the society returned the silver and Mr. Mapplethorpe dropped his lawsuit.
In April 1989, a largely new board and staff came in with Barbara Knowles Debs, a former president of Manhattanville College who was named director and president of the society.
 
Despite Some Improvements . . .
 Within a few months, Ms. Debs was able to announce the results of a successful fund-raising drive, which included a gift of $2.5 million from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and a $1.8 million contribution from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. The roof was repaired, conservation studios were opened, and the collection seemed secure, at least for the time being.
But financial problems continued to bedevil the society. In the fall of 1991, Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, then the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, suggested that a financial crisis might be avoided if the society were to merge with the Museum of the City of New York.
Trustees and board members of the two institutions met in January to consider the proposal. Advocates of the merger said it would save administrative costs and create a worldclass historical museum, research library and archive, but the costs of combining the two institutions proved unexpectedly high and in March the parties announced that the merger would not take place.

HEADLINE: Review/Television;
On the Argentine Economic Miracle

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Probably no one explains economics to the American public in simpler, more vivid half-hour television bites than Adam Smith. But simplicity seems to have worked against Mr. Smith in his latest effort, a two-part series that tries to explain Latin America's latest surge toward prosperity. The answer never quite emerges from the talking heads that he has chosen to interview or from his own narrative.
Perhaps Mr. Smith attempted too much. Three years ago, he had traveled to Argentina to report on that nation's violent hyper-inflation. The inflation has since disappeared, and Mr. Smith returned recently to explain how President Carlos Saul Menem had achieved this goal. The first show, broadcast last Thursday night, answered this question. The second, to be shown tonight at 8 on Channel 13, should have explored who got hurt in Argentina from Mr. Menem's solutions and why those solutions might therefore be short-lived. Instead, Mr. Smith wanders off into a survey of Latin economics and the program loses its edge. 
 There is a "Nightline" quality to Mr. Smith's Latin reporting, almost as if he could have done the shows from New York, with a few feeds from Buenos Aires and other Latin American capitals. More than once, Jorge Casteneda, a Mexican economist temporarily at Princeton, and Susan Kaufman Purcell, a Latin expert at the Americas Society in Manhattan, come on camera to explain or warn about the future.
Absorbed in offering crystal clear explanation, in the talking-head interviews and in his own narrative, Mr. Smith fails to tell a more powerful story through film. Mr. Menem's economic anti-inflation program is essentially an austerity program: cut the budget to eliminate the deficit, lay off Government workers, cap pensions and other entitlement programs, sell off money-losing state companies, freeze the peso-dollar exchange rate and hope that a balanced budget and the new stability will persuade the private sector to invest and hire the people that the Government laid off.
That has not happened, and Argentines are getting restless. But only briefly do we see crowds of the elderly demonstrating angrily for larger pensions or the Rev. Julio Cesar Grassi walking through a muddy shantytown, greeting residents and explaining, "They don't have inflation, but they also haven't had any raises in salaries or wages, or any new jobs."
The Argentine economic miracle that Mr. Smith describes is beginning to fray at the edges and unravel, as similar solutions in the past have unraveled. Just as television images from Iraq or Yugoslavia make those countries vivid for Americans, so can scenes in Buenos Aires explain the unnerving dimensions of the Argentine economic solution. But Mr. Smith, preferring crystal clear narrative to film, misses this opportunity. And Mr. Menem, in the brief interview with him in the Casa Rosada, is never cross-examined on the shortcomings of his economic program.
Still, Mr. Smith suggests the shortcomings. The pensioners do appear. So do hard-pressed middle-class people. And Father Grassi. And then unfortunately, Mr. Smith veers off into his Latin survey, reviewing such standard issues as corruption and militarism.
If only he had given more time to a character who obviously caught his attention, an Argentine comic named Tato Bores whose Sunday night program has for 32 years been satirizing Argentine officials and their policies. For a few tantalizing moments at the end, we get a suggestion of Mr. Bores's skill at dissecting Mr. Menem. His humor has more to tell us about Argentine -- and Latin -- economics than Mr. Smith's talking heads.

Looking Around
A Journey Through Architecture
By Witold Rybczynski
Illustrated. 301 pages. Viking Penguin. $22.
The fun and stimulation of reading Witold Rybczynski is that he sees objects in the framework of time. For example, in "Good Housekeeping," one of the early essays in his new book, "Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture," he notes the growing luxuriousness of bathrooms and kitchens in contemporary houses. 
 Why should this be? he asks. The rise of the kitchen can be seen as a shift from a backstage space where the help once did the work, to a more public space where families increasingly live and entertain. As for the bathroom, he writes: "It is truly a place for self-presentation -- of oneself, to oneself. A fitting sign of the self-absorbed, individualistic 1980's."
Meantime, the living room has diminished in importance because, according to one authority Mr. Rybczynski cites, the automobile has come to serve as a "portable facade" that publicly expresses social standing. "Cars and car travel also diverted time, attention and money away from parlor life."
The three-dozen pieces in this collection were published in a variety of publications, from the magazine Wigwag (now defunct), where Mr. Rybczynski served as architecture critic, to Art and Antiques and The New York Review of Books, among others. And although their subjects are equally various, their themes are of a piece and reflect some of the obsessions that the author exercised in previous books like "Home: A Short History of an Idea," "The Most Beautiful House in the World" and "Waiting for the Weekend."
One of his chief concerns is what the balance between art and utility in architecture should be ("If a Chair Is a Work of Art, Can You Still Sit on It?," "Should Suburbs Be Designed?," "But Is It Art?" and "Reprise: The Art of Building, or the Building of Art?"). It almost goes without saying that he admires the beauty of well-designed buildings. In "Listen to the Melody," he celebrates the "music" of "successful cities."
In "How to Pick an Architect," he describes how Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of Samuel Bronfman, went from success to success by selecting first Mies van der Rohe to design the Seagram Building in New York City, which Mies's biographer called "the most important tall building of the post-World War II period," and then Peter Rose to create the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, of which Mr. Rybczynski writes, "The building raises my spirits each time I pass it."
Yet it vexes him that in the journal Progressive Architecture, below a photograph of a house designed by Richard Meier for a couple with an extensive collection of art and craft objects, "the caption notes that because the architect did not approve every artifact in the collection, some pieces were temporarily removed when the photographs were taken." He concludes, "Le Corbusier's famous statement that 'life always has the last word' appears quaint and old-fashioned in this context."
Again and again in this volume Mr. Rybczynski is assailed by considerations of the practical tests that architecture must pass. Why do single-family dwellings continue to be so large when the average size of the North American family is shrinking? He has no particular problem when largeness is clearly necessary, as he makes evident in various instructive pieces about campuses, museums, art galleries, embassies, airports, shopping malls, municipal buildings and the Richard Nixon Library.
Still, he wonders why -- at a time when land values are rising, when construction costs and the prices of existing homes seem impervious to recession and when shrinking families have shown a willingness to make do with less space -- "municipalities, reflecting the attitude of homeowners, have staunchly resisted the idea of modifying zoning regulations to permit the construction of smaller houses or to allow the subdivision of land into smaller plots."
He concludes, "The chief reason is, sadly, selfish: smaller, less expensive houses are perceived as a threat to property values and to community status, even though housing in the $50,000 to $80,000 range, 'less expensive' by today's standards, is still accessible only to solid middle-class citizens."
Occasionally, the brevity of these essays is frustrating. You would like him to have explored more deeply and imaginatively the history and appeal of toy building materials, which he traces somewhat desultorily from Anchor Stone Blocks, manufactured by Richter in Germany from 1879 to 1963, through Lincoln Logs, which "smelled good," to "a more refined architectural toy" called Bayko ("Little Architects, Little Architecture").
You wish he had explained at greater length why a revisit to Moshe Safdie's Habitat shows that the experimental housing project in Montreal that resembles a mountain of shoe boxes has successfully withstood the test of time ("Habitat Revisited").
But of course the answer to this last question is everywhere in "Looking Around." It lies in the author's observation that "unlike books, completed buildings should be a little dog-eared before they are reviewed" ("The Birthplace of Post-Modernism"). It lies in his piece called "The Seven Implants of Post-Modern Architecture," which updates a famous talk given by Philip Johnson at Harvard, "The Seven Crutches of Modern Architecture," which in turn was a lampoon of John Ruskin's "Seven Lamps of Architecture."
You only have to look around to see how thought-provoking these essays are.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Bonds Now 2 for 3 in M.V.P. Titles for the 90's

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
No one ever confused Barry Bonds with Mr. October, but he has gained the right to be dubbed Mr. November.
For the second time in three years, Bonds was named National League most valuable player, winning easily yesterday over Terry Pendleton of Atlanta, who edged him a year ago. 
 The 1991 vote was so close -- 274-259 -- that if two voters had reversed their selections for first and second on the 10-place ballot, Bonds would have won and would now be the m.v.p. an unprecedented three years in a row.
"What was done was done," he said yesterday when asked about last year's outcome. "I'm very proud of Terry Pendleton for winning it."
 
Hardly a 'Fluke'
 Winning the award for a second time, on the other hand, was important for Bonds, who is a free agent after seven seasons with the Pirates. "It's something I've been able to accomplish once and I didn't want anyone to think it was a fluke," he said from his agent's office in Los Angeles in a telephone conference call. "I set my goals to win it. Once you climb the mountain, it's harder to stay. I want to stay."
Bonds, 28 years old, is the 10th player to win the N.L. award at least twice. Stan Musial, Roy Campanella and Mike Schmidt each won three times. Previous members of the Pirates who were the league m.v.p. were Roberto Clemente in 1966, Dave Parker in 1978 and Willie Stargell (co-winner with Keith Hernandez) in 1979.
In the balloting, which was completed before he suffered his third successive poor playoff performance, Bonds received 18 of the 24 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers Association panel. He was second on four ballots and third on the other two for a total of 304 points. Pendleton, whose performance this year mirrored his effort with the Braves in 1991, compiled 232 points based on four firsts, 16 seconds and four thirds.
Gary Sheffield of San Diego, who made a remarkable run at the Triple Crown (batting average, home runs, runs batted in), finished third with 204 points. He received the other two first-place votes. Andy Van Slyke, Bonds's outfield mate in Pittsburgh for six years, was fourth with 145 points, and Larry Walker of Montreal was fifth with 111.
 
Gets a Bonus
 Bonds will receive a $250,000 bonus from the Pirates for winning the award, raising his season's income to $5.15 million. That's the fourth highest in baseball behind three New York players, Bobby Bonilla, Danny Tartabull and Dwight Gooden.
Bonds's agent, Dennis Gilbert, who also represents Bonilla and Tartabull, said he didn't think the award would result in a more lucrative contract.
"The people in the bidding already were cognizant of Barry's ability," Gilbert said. "Getting an extra award or two won't change anything."
Gilbert said he thought Bonds would receive more than Bonilla's $29 million for five years, but he declined to answer when he was asked if Bonds would surpass Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs, who has a $7.1 million-per-year contract beginning next year.
When Bonds was asked if it was important to him to be the highest paid player, he said simply, "No." But Gilbert quickly said: "It's important to me. I want to do the best job I can for my client. The best should be paid the best."
Gilbert said he has spoken with seven clubs about Bonds and eliminated two. He wouldn't identify the remaining clubs, but it was clear that the Yankees, the Atlanta Braves and at least one of the Chicago teams were among them. The Pirates, unless they have a sudden economic change of heart, are not.
Bonds said he has sold his house in Pittsburgh but denied having already bought one in Atlanta, which some people there have said he has done.
Gilbert said he has had contact with the California Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers, "but they have not shown interest to date."
 
Wants a Winner
 "By this time next week, the picture will be a lot clearer and we'll narrow this down considerably," Gilbert said. "There's no reason why we can't get it done before the winter meetings."
Asked what his priorities were in selecting a team, Bonds said, "a team that's committed to winning." Gilbert added, "Barry Bonds will be playing next year for a team that is a contender."
Bonds played a vital role in making the Pirates successful contenders the past three seasons. He provided a vivid five-week exhibition of his value from Aug. 25 through the day the Pirates clinched their third consecutive division championship. In that span, he batted .426 (43 for 101), hit 11 home runs, drove in 31 runs, scored 34 and had 12 stolen bases in 31 games.

HEADLINE: Save the Peace Dividend

SERIES: Bill's List

BYLINE: By Richard Nixon; Richard Nixon, the former President, is honorary chairman of the Fund for Democracy and Development.

DATELINE: WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton deserves high marks for aggressively addressing a number of important issues during the transition period. But as was the case during the campaign, the most important issue since the end of World War II has received minimal attention.
It may be politically shrewd to give domestic policy, as it affects an economy just beginning to recover from recession, a higher priority than foreign policy. But the collapse of Boris Yeltsin's pro-Western, democratic Russian Government would have a far greater impact on the American economy than anything the new Administration could do at home. 
 The Yeltsin Government is in mortal danger. The National Salvation Front, an unholy alliance of ex-Communists and ultra-nationalists, have boldly demanded Boris Yeltsin's resignation, a return to authoritarian rule and the restoration of the Soviet Union within its 1991 borders. That would be a prescription for the beginning of cold war II.
The peace dividend, which the Clinton Administration is counting on to help finance its new domestic policies, will be down the tube. Instead of cutting the defense budget, it will be necessary to increase defense spending by billions of dollars.
It has been projected that the United States over the next 10 years can save between $250 billion and $300 billion in defense expenditures if present trends continue. A new Russian nationalist authoritarianism government, heavily controlled by the military and shorn of the failed faith of Communism, would be a greater threat to the forces of peace and freedom in the world than the old Soviet totalitarianism.
What are the chances that the Yeltsin Government will survive? On the minus side, Russia is plagued by massive corruption and runaway inflation. Bloody ethnic conflicts are on the rise. The gridlock in Moscow between President Yeltsin's Cabinet and the heavily Communist Parliament he inherited from the Soviet era is much worse than anything ever witnessed in Washington.
On the plus side, Mr. Yeltsin has proved to be a skillful politician and formidable statesman. His popularity, at a time when his country is suffering not just from a recession but from a deep depression, is still above 50 percent.
Russia is a rich country; we are not dealing here with a nuclear-armed Bangladesh. Ninety-five percent of the Russian people are literate, and 90 percent of the Russian work force has graduated from high school. The press is free, and Mr. Yeltsin has acted as its greatest defender against undue interference from both conservatives in the Parliament and his own Government. There is considerable progress in overall judiciary reform. Most important, in foreign policy, both vis-a-vis the West and the newly independent post-Soviet states, Mr. Yeltsin has consistently acted with enlightened moderation. He needs our help and he deserves it.
It is essential that we be understanding and tolerant as he tries to find a new way of ruling the country through a compromise with the centrist forces organized under the umbrella of the Civic Union. I personally know some of the top leaders in this diverse coalition. While questioning many of the current Government tactics, they have a fundamental commitment to democracy and a free-market economy and are loyal to Mr. Yeltsin as the Russian President. If he makes a compromise with the Civic Union, there is no need to panic and to perceive it as a mortal blow to the Russian democratic experiment.
One of the most effective ways we can help Mr. Yeltsin survive is to champion the rights of the 25 million Russian-speaking people in the Baltic and the other post-Soviet states -- both bilaterally and in international forums. The Russian people should be able to feel that their human rights are a priority for American diplomacy. This will be a constructive way to respond to xenophobic Russian nationalists who are paranoid and suspicious of the West and violently opposed to President Yeltsin.
The Yeltsin Government will not survive unless it receives a major new economic assistance package. The Freedom Support Act was a positive first step, but it has been overtaken by events. Urgent action on three fronts is required.
1. The $80 billion debt that Mr. Yeltsin inherited from Mikhail Gorbachev must be rescheduled for 15 years as Mr. Yeltsin has requested.
2. There must be a substantial bridge loan from Western governments to help the Russian people through a cruel, cold winter and to assist the transition from a command to a free-market economy that is unprecedented in a major country.
3. Russia needs massive investment from the private sector in the West. Government aid is limited by budgets. Investment from the private sector is limited only by opportunity. If Russia adopts the same legal guarantees for private property as we have in the West, it has been estimated that $300 billion would be invested over the next five years, dwarfing the $25 billion in Western government aid currently allotted.
4. As Senator Sam Nunn has recommended, responsibility for the aid program should be given to one high-level individual reporting directly to the President who would act as the principal coordinator of all U.S. Government efforts. This individual should be of sufficient stature so that he can talk to Mr. Yeltsin and to Western leaders as an equal.
None of these things will happen unless the President plays a direct role. Only he can persuade the Europeans to accept debt relief, force the American bureaucracy to shape up and get Congress to approve foreign aid appropriations.
What's in it for us? If Mr. Yeltsin fails, we will again live in a dangerous world with the threat of nuclear war hanging over our heads. The wave of freedom sweeping the world will ebb and we could get caught in the undertow. If Mr. Yeltsin survives, and freedom and democracy succeed in Russia, we will live in a safer world.
We will also live in a richer world. A vigorous free-enterprise economy in Russia will mean billions of dollars in trade and hundreds of thousands of jobs for American workers. We will live in a freer world because the success of democracy and free markets in Russia will be an example for China and other dictatorships around the world to follow.

Correction on Mara Letica

 BODY:
An item in Topics of the Times on Nov. 2 incorrectly described Mara Letica, President Bush's nominee for ambassador to the former Yugoslav state of Croatia.
The article gave two grounds for opposing her nomination. It referred inaccurately to her father as the chief U.S. fund-raiser for Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman. 
 Her attorneys say that neither she nor her father has ever raised money for Mr. Tudjman, his party or his Government. And the editorial described her, also incorrectly, as the niece of a longtime Tudjman adviser.
We regret these errors. At the same time, we remain of the opinion that Ms. Letica lacks the independence such an appointment calls for. Her father has served officially as a special representative of President Tudjman for economic matters. And Ms. Letica was described warmly as "a passionate lobbyist for Croatia" in an Oct. 25 article in a Croatian weekly by Slaven Letica, a former adviser to Mr. Tudjman though no relation to Ms. Letica.
"I understood she was named Ambassador of Croatia to the USA. when I finally understood [she] was the US ambassador to Croatia," Mr. Letica wrote, with those emphases, "I decided that this was the most beautiful diplomatic gesture of the American Administration in the last two years." President Bush, and the public, would be better served by less gesture and more disinterest.

HEADLINE: Breast Cancer Research Must Have the Funds;
Projects Lack Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Medical Madness on Capitol Hill" (editorial, Oct. 29), you state that cancer research "is already well funded." This is both untrue and dangerously misleading. 
The level of public and private funds available to support cancer research is indeed higher than ever before. However, these funds can support fewer and fewer research projects because of inflation and the high costs of the new technologies.
The American Cancer Society, as an example, could finance only 9 percent of new project grant proposals last year. We would have to double the research budget of nearly $100 million to finance all the grant applications that were rated as "excellent." The Government's cancer program at the National Cancer Institute mirrors this strained situation.
We have built a base of knowledge about cancer by supporting basic science and clinical research. This knowledge is the foundation for all advances in clinical practice. But unless support for cancer research grows substantially, we will not merely be standing still, but will even fall behind.
Americans have defined cancer as their greatest personal health concern today. With the major predictable demographic change toward lower birth rates and older citizenry, the impact of cancer could become even more devastating unless we find the means to make great forward strides in cancer research.
The opportunities are enormous but they are certainly not well funded.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops in U.S. Reject Policy Letter on Role of Women

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops refused today to adopt a proposed pastoral letter on the role of women in the church and society, a document nine years in the making that had ended up being dominated by traditional church views.
The vote marked the first time since the National Conference of Catholic Bishops was formed in 1966 that the nation's Catholic hierarchy failed to reached a two-thirds majority consensus on a proposed pastoral letter, the bishops' weightiest form of policy statement. 
 In a debate before the vote, the bishops' comments revealed a broad dissatisfaction with the document as incomplete and likely to alienate many women.
Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee issued a dramatic warning that passage of the letter could create a reaction in the church as vast as that caused by "Humanae Vitae," the 1968 papal encyclical prohibiting the use of contraception by Catholics.
 
'Another Tremendous Crisis'
 "It would add another tremendous crisis to the church," he said, "We would lose another generation, especially another generation of very wonderful women."
Bishops who supported the document warned that a rejection would be seen as disloyalty to church precepts, particularly on the question of ordaining women to the priesthood. In fact, however, very few of those who voted against the document wanted to see women as priests; among the bishops, that is the position of a small minority and was never seriously considered.
The tally, taken by secret written ballot, fell 53 votes short of the two-thirds majority of the active hierarchy necessary to approve a pastoral letter. Favoring the text were 137 bishops. Voting against it were 110 bishops.
 
Most 'Nays' Ever Cast
 No previous pastoral letter has ever been opposed by more than 30 votes. Because the church hierarchy puts a high value on consensus, it usually succeeds at refining texts so that the bishops can rally behind them.
For example, despite fierce public disputes associated with the 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear weapons and with the 1986 letter on economic issues, only nine negative votes were cast against the final drafts of each.
The letter voted on today, like three previous drafts of the same document, had been produced by a bishops' committee headed by Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill. All four drafts affirmed the equality of men and women and condemned sexism as a "moral and social evil." The letter deplored violence directed at women, the high rates of poverty among single mothers and elderly women, abusive or broken family relationships and discrimination in the work place.
The final draft also retained some criticism of the church's insensitivity to women and endorsed a widening of nonliturgical opportunities for women in the church.
But the letter could not be read apart from its own history. Under Vatican prodding, later drafts adopted an increasingly guarded tone. The fourth draft warned, for instance, that "to identify sexism as the principal evil" harming women socially would be "to analyze the underlying problem too superficially."
Whereas the first draft, issued in 1988, highlighted statements by women who had testified in hearings held by the bishops, the fourth draft highlighted Pope John Paul II's view that equality of the sexes should not rest on minimizing the differences between them.
The pastoral letter was brought to a vote today, the third day of the semiannual meeting of the bishops, despite the efforts of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago to avoid a showdown. On Tuesday he suggested that instead of issuing the document as a pastoral letter, it be turned over to committees that could pursue some of the stated objectives at a less authoritative level.
This morning, Cardinal Bernardin announced that at the request of the conference's top leadership, he was withdrawing his proposal temporarily. But after the pastoral letter was defeated his suggestion was revived and was approved as a way of salvaging some of the bishops' work and of indicating that the hierarchy remained determined to deal with questions of discrimination and sexism.
The bishops also authorized publication of the present text as a simple report from the drafting committee, without the authority of a teaching document.
 
'We Need to Speak'
 Although pastoral letters do not automatically bind Catholics in their entirety, they frequently contain binding precepts, and always set out positions that Catholics are obliged to consider seriously. Pastoral letters also set policy for all the Church's national agencies.
The bishops, all dressed in similar black suits and seated behind long rows of white-draped tables in the Regency Ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel, spoke at several microphones in well-modulated tones. But the outward appearance of order and serenity did not disguise the intensity of today's debate.
The bishops were divided over different notions of how to carry out their responsibilities as teachers and pastors rather than over the question of whether women should be ordained.
Conservative bishops insisted that despite the danger of stirring a hostile reaction among many Catholics by approving the fourth draft, not passing it would do greater harm by creating the impression that the bishops did not support the church's teaching.
"I find myself identifying with Jeremiah the prophet, saying I'd rather not speak on this," Bishop John G. Vlazny of Winona, Minn., said. Nonetheless, he concluded, "We need to speak."
Archbishop Oscar H. Lipscomb of Mobile, Ala., said the bishops had to teach the "hard truth about ordination," regardless of "the added pain and controversy it might cause." Not passing the letter might only feed false hopes of change in the church's position on ordination, he said, and result in greater pain later.
 
Greater Division Feared
 "We have set the stage for teaching, and we should teach," said Bishop John J. Myers of Peoria, Ill., noting that ordinary pastors, when asked difficult questions by parishioners, can not escape by referring them to a committee.
But Bishop Pierre R. DuMaine of San Jose, Calif., argued that the problem was "not with what we are teaching but how we teach, not with orthodoxy but pedagogy." The fourth draft, he said, had not succeeded in conveying its message, "and we won't succeed just by repeating ourselves or turning up the volume."
Rather than fulfilling the letter's purpose as reflected in the fourth draft's title, "One In Jesus Christ," Bishop Michael D. Pfeifer of San Angelo, Tex., said, "The contrary will happen: we will be more divided." He said the letter, if approved, would "further distance the bishops from the many voices of women who have spoken to us."
 
Not a Closed Issue
 Bishop after bishop stated that he supported the teaching. "If the media chooses to disregard that, it is just a misrepresentation of the fact," Archbishop Lipscomb said at a news conference following the vote.
Only a handful of bishops have indicated that they favor a change in the church's ban of ordaining women priests. But Bishop DuMaine said that although "everyone accepts and will uphold" the present teaching, there is a range of views on whether it could ever be changed.
Bishop Imesch added that many bishops were also uncomfortable with the idea that discussion of the issue is closed. Passage of the letter, Bishop DuMaine had told the bishops earlier, would not "end or frame the debate, but only take the bishops out of it."
The bishops will meet once more on Thursday before adjourning.

Chart: "Struggling With Words: The Bishops' Letter on Women"
For nine years, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops have been trying to draft and approve a pastoral letter about the role of women in the church and in American society. Four drafts of the letter were prepared, as a committee of bishops struggled to reach closer compliance with Vatican teachings.
Although the issue of ordaining women to the priesthood played a central role in the letter, changes in the drafts can also be seen in the way the committee handled the question of opening other ministerial offices to women, ranging from the major ordained office of deacon to that of acolyte or altar server.
 
1988: The first draft urged a quick study of ordaining female deacons, indicated its positive attitude toward that change, and strongly recommended opening the other roles.
 "In particular, we recommend that the question of admission of women to the diaconal office . . . be submitted to thorough investigation... We urge that this study be undertaken and brought to completion soon. Women serving in pastoral ministry accomplish, by virtue of some other title or commission, many of the functions performed by ordained deacons and are capable of accomplishing all of them. The question of women being formally installed in the permanent diaconate arises quite naturally, and pastoral reasons prompt its evaluation.
"Even more compelling is the question of women being installed in the lay ministries of lector and acolyte. The exclusion of women and girls from certain aspects of service at the altar likewise raises concern...
"For this reason, we recommend that women participate in all liturgical ministries that do not require ordination."
 
1990: The second draft called for a study of ordaining female deacons but dropped the implied endorsement. It no longer called allowing women in other ministries "even more compelling".
"We recommend that the question of admission of women to the diaconal office . . . be submitted to thorough investigation... We urge that this study be undertaken and brought to completion soon. We support further the study for admission of women to the lay ministries of lector and acolyte. The exclusion of women and girls from certain aspects of service at the altar likewise demands consideration. . . For this reason, we encourage participation by women in all liturgical ministries that do not require ordination."
 
April 1992: The third draft dropped the call for a study on the diaconate and contained only a reduced reference to the need for "continuing dialogue and reflection".
"We also recognize the need for continuing dialogue and reflection on the meaning of ministry in the church, particularly in regard to the diaconate, to the offices of lector and acolyte, and to servers at the altar."
 
September 1992: The fourth draft repeated the third draft's language but added a caveat about respecting the official teaching of the church.
"We recognize the need also for continuing reflection on the meaning of ministry in the Church, particularly in regard to the diaconate and the offices of lector, acolyte, and servers at the altar. Such study should proceed with an objectivity and serenity whose necessary context is respect for the authority of the magisterium of the Church." (pg. B9)

HEADLINE: Dow Posts 14.05 Gain; Volume Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
A powerful rally in Tokyo spilled over to the United States yesterday, where a snapback in oil and technology stocks enabled the market to rebound from Tuesday's losses.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 14.05 points higher, at 3,207.37, after a 12-point drop a day earlier. 
Advancing issues outpaced those that declined in price by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1 among common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was extremely active, with 219.1 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.58, to 422.85, with international oils, telecommunications and health-care stocks leading the way. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter shares leaped 7.79, to 634.86.
 
More Optimism
 "There's a little more optimism out there," said Ronald Doran, director of institutional trading at C. L. King & Associates. "After yesterday's mini-correction in the Nasdaq, it's back up again. We had a good jump in the Japanese market, and I'm sure that helped us a little bit."
In addition, recent economic reports in the United States have been encouraging, traders said. The Commerce Department said yesterday that the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 7.1 percent in September. The report touched off a brief dip in Treasury bond prices, before the market reversed course amid talk that the recovery was spotty enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
The stable Treasury yields prompted investors to funnel money into stocks like oils, whose prices have tumbled in recent sessions, traders said.
"If rates are coming down, and Exxon and Mobil are yielding about 5 percent, that's pretty attractive in this environment," said Bob Aquilina, who trades oil stocks for Lehman Brothers.
Reflecting lower fuel costs, the Dow Jones transportation average rose 13.90, to 1,355.13, led by airlines and trucking companies.
Specialty retailers were another bright spot, with Gap, the Limited and Merry-Go-Round all scoring gains. Positive analysts' comments, coupled with some better-than-expected earnings and anticipation of better Christmas sales than in the last few years, attracted institutional investors, traders said.
Costco slipped 7/8, to 25, after Alex. Brown removed the stock from its "strong buy" list on lower growth assumptions. It was the most heavily traded over-the-counter stock, with more than 5.9 million shares changing hands.
Hewlett-Packard jumped 3 1/2, to 58 7/8, despite a 46 percent plunge in fiscal fourth-quarter net income as analysts focused on the company's vigorous order momentum.
Apple Computer gained 2 1/2, to 57 3/4, on news of a 10-million-share stock buyback.
 
Gloomy Projection
 Moorco International, an industrial products company, plunged 6 1/8, to 16 7/8, on its projection of lower second-quarter earnings.
Republic Capital soared 4 1/8, to 30 5/8, after TCF Financial said it had signed a letter of intent to acquire Republic for stock valued at $34.50 a share, or a total of about $62 million.
Anthem Electronics skidded 4, to 37 1/2, after Smith Barney cut earnings estimates.
Watkins-Johnson climbed 2 1/8, to 13, after the electronics company received a new purchase recommendation from Paine Webber.
Andrea Electronics, up 6 5/8, to 23, continued to gain in the wake of the company's disclosure that it was negotiating to sell some businesses. The stock jumped 6 on Tuesday.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 21, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about Wednesday's stock trading misstated a disclosure by Andrea Electronics. The company said that it was negotiating to sell its active noise cancellation products to several telecommunications companies and that it had named John and Douglas Andrea as co-presidents to succeed their father.

Jacobs Engineering Names New Chief Executive Officer

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Joseph J. Jacobs, the 76-year-old founder and chairman of the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., said today that he was turning over the chief executive reins to a successor before ill health or a crisis forced him out.
Noel G. Watson, who became president and chief operating officer of the company in 1987, will take on the additional duties of chief executive, effective Thursday. Mr. Jacobs will continue as chairman. 
 "The business is so mature, it should be run by someone who has his management qualities," Mr. Jacobs said. "I don't have the patience with all the details of running a company of this size."
In an effort to groom a successor since the mid-1970's, Mr. Jacobs brought in three successive chief operating officers. Mr. Watson, who is 56 and has been with the company since the early 1960's, became the fourth heir apparent.
 
Growth of a One-Man Operation
 Mr. Jacobs started the company, based in Pasadena, Calif., from a one-man consultancy in 1947. His management was marked by risk-taking, ingenuity and integrity. When a client had trouble starting up a fertilizer plant in Vicksburg, Miss., Mr. Jacobs worked shifts alongside an engineering team for six months to get it running. "I don't believe you succeed as an entrepreneur unless you bust your gut to make it work," he said.
Today, the company employs 12,500 people and has become a force in environmental cleanup, including work restoring Energy Department sites contaminated with radioactive materials. The company had revenues of $1.1 billion in the year that ended Sept. 30.
Like other engineering and construction concerns, Jacobs was hurt by the collapse of oil markets in the early 1980's. The company's revenue fell, losses piled up and overhead and payroll were cut.
"Restructuring is a gut-wrenching emotional thing for any feeling executive," said Mr. Jacobs, who came out of semiretirement to oversee the cutbacks.
 
Successful New Directions
 As a consequence of the shake-up in the late 1980's, the company has improved its profitability and has not so far been hurt by the current recession, John Simon, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles said. He credited Mr. Watson with picking sectors like environmental cleanup and refinery building, which has offset declining business elsewhere. But he expects the company's earnings growth to slow.
Richard J. Sweetman, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody, said he did not expect a turbulent management transition: "Strategy has become the guiding light, not the entrepreneur."
The company stock declined 12.5 cents a share yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $27.
Mr. Watson, who was not available for comment, is expected to press the company into new growth areas, like building laboratories for biotechnology companies. He first joined the company in 1960 as a process engineer and except for a three-year stint in the early 1960's has been with the company ever since.
Mr. Jacobs, whose first book, "Anatomy of an Entrepreneur: Family, Culture and Ethics," was published in 1991, plans a second, tentatively titled "Compassionate Conservative."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The President-Elect;
CLINTON SAYS BUSH MADE CHINA GAINS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton, who accused President Bush during the campaign of coddling China's dictators, suggested today that Mr. Bush's policies toward China were showing signs of reducing human rights and trade violations.
Mr. Clinton did not explain his sudden, striking difference in tone, which came one day after he held a long chat with President Bush, mostly about foreign affairs. Many analysts had warned during the campaign that some of Mr. Clinton's more idealistic foreign policy proposals would need to be moderated in a new administration to prevent disruptions in relations with important countries. 
 Mr. Clinton made his remarks after spending his morning holding talks with Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, talks in which both sides pledged an end to the gridlock in Congress. It was another whirlwind day for the President-elect, who went from breakfast at a McDonald's near the White House to lunch with the power barons in Congress to dinner with the Washington social elite at the Georgetown home of a Democratic Party fund raiser, Pamela Harriman.
He also met for an hour with Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for the first time since the general warned about the Pentagon's opposition to Mr. Clinton's plan to lift the Pentagon's ban on homosexuals in the military.
Mr. Clinton said afterward that he liked General Powell "very much" because he "laid it on the line and did not fudge one of our disagreements."
"He said exactly what he thought but then he said, 'You're the boss,' " Mr. Clinton related.
Mr. Clinton's message to Congress was a mixture of gentle lobbying for his proposals to restructure the economy and the health-care system, combined with some pointed observations about controlling soaring government health-care costs.
Two of the Congressmen who met with Mr. Clinton today said there was a general agreement that without harnessing automatic benefit programs -- which include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps and farm subsidies -- it could be impossible for Mr. Clinton to finance his programs and still fulfill his promise to begin cutting the deficit.
While Mr. Clinton stressed that in his view the best way to begin was by getting control of health-care costs, he nevertheless seemed willing to look at the possibility of cutting or taxing these entitlement programs if he could find no better way to pay for his programs, the lawmakers said.
During his news conference at the Capitol, Mr. Clinton was reminded that Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, had called the Bush Administration's policy toward China "immoral" and declared that Washington should withdraw favored-trade status from China to force it to comply with human-rights standards.
 
Applauds Recent Events
 Mr. Clinton said, "I noted with satisfaction that in the last several months, when the Bush Administration, for whatever reason, maybe because of the changing political climate, took a tougher line on goods made with prison labor, on unfair trade practices, we began to have more moderation.
"China now has a $15 billion-a-year trade surplus with us," Mr. Clinton continued. "I know we create a lot of jobs with trade with China, but they've got a $15 billion surplus. They have a big stake in that. We have a big stake in not isolating China, in seeing that China continues to develop a market economy. But we also have to insist, I believe, on progress in human rights and human decency. And I think there are indications in the last few months that a firm hand by our Government can help to achieve that."
On Oct. 1, in a speech in Milwaukee, Mr. Clinton said: "There is no more striking example of Mr. Bush's indifference toward democracy than his policy toward China."
"Today," he continued in that speech, one of the major foreign-policy addresses of the campaign, "we must ask ourselves, 'What has the President's China policy really achieved?' The Chinese leadership still sells missiles and nuclear technology to Middle Eastern dictators who threaten us and our friends. They still arrest and hold in prison leaders of the pro-democracy movement. They restrict American access to their markets, while our trade deficit with China will reach $15 billion this year."
He added, "I do believe that our nation has a higher purpose than to coddle dictators and to stand aside from the global movement toward democracy."
The Bush Administration's policies toward China that Mr. Clinton seemed to endorse today were a year old, and first came to light when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visited Beijing last November.
On the domestic front, the President-elect pointedly relayed to the Congressional leaders what he heard from the breakfast crowd at McDonald's and during his walk Wednesday through a polyglot Washington commercial strip.
"The sense I get from the American people is that they don't expect miracles from us but they do expect progress," Mr. Clinton told the Congressional leaders during a post-lunch news conference. "They want the finger-pointing and the blame-placing to stop."
For today, at least, that spirit of bipartisanship reigned, as everyone from Mr. Clinton to the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, exchanged warm compliments and vows of cooperation. Vice President-elect Al Gore said, "If you listen carefully, you can hear the first sounds of gridlock loosening."
 
'Knows His Oats'
 Many legislators also commented favorably on the command Mr. Clinton displayed on a wide range of domestic policy problems. Mr. Clinton, they noted, talked about domestic policy with the grasp and verve that Mr. Bush reserved for foreign policy.
"This guy knows his oats," said Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the Democrat who heads the Budget Committee.
Senator Dole, the de facto leader of Republicans in Washington, had greeted Mr. Clinton's election with a harsh pledge to block his "awful" programs. But he has softened his oratory in recent days, and today he promised: "We're going to have a lot of areas of agreement, we're going to have some areas of disagreement. But our common interest is in moving the country forward, about jobs, the economy, health care, deficit reduction, whatever it may be."
Mr. Dole couldn't resist enlivening his remarks, though, with a special thank you to Speaker Thomas S. Foley "for the lunch -- when you're a Republican these days, you take all you can get."
 
Seeing the Dilemma
 Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said there was a general sense that automatic spending programs might have to be reined in to cut the deficit. Every year, Medicare and Medicaid eat up increasing portions of the budget.
Mr. Hoyer said "the President-elect brought up entitlements," as did several other lawmakers, but there was no detailed discussion. Mr. Hoyer said Mr. Clinton's view was that "we need a comprehensive approach to dealing with health-care costs and not just controlling Federal expenditures."
"If I would sum up some of the exchanges that took place," said Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, "the President-elect is quite conscious and well aware of the dilemma of attempting to stimulate the economy on one hand without exacerbating the deficit problem that confronts."
Mr. Clinton promised to try to solidify his economic proposals in advance of his Jan. 20 inauguration and would then work with Congress on a program that reflects "the consensus of where we ought to go."
Mr. Clinton, who made plans to fly back to Little Rock, Ark., tonight, said after his get-acquainted meeting with General Powell:
"We called the meeting because when I become President he'll be the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs," and that General Powell would be a person "that I'll have to rely on for military advice."

Disney Net Up on U.S. Theme-Park Results

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company reported today that fiscal fourth-quarter net income increased 29 percent, mainly because of strong attendance at United States theme parks and the success of animated films.
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Disney, based in Burbank, reported earnings of $223.7 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $174.1 million, or 33 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 21 percent, to $2.08 billion from $1.72 billion. 
 For the 1992 fiscal year, net rose 28 percent, to $816.7 million, or $1.52 a share, from $636.6 million, or $1.20 a share, in the 1991 fiscal year. Revenue grew 23 percent, to $7.5 billion from $6.11 billion.
But the entertainment company said Euro Disney, the new theme park near Paris, had a $35.1 million loss for the year. Since it opened in April, Euro Disney has attracted fewer customers than expected.
Disney owns a 50 percent stake in the French theme park, but its share of the loss from Euro Disney was offset as royalties and interest income from the venture generated $11 million in profits for the full year, the company said.
Analysts said the results were consistent with their expectations and noted that screenings and sales of videos and merchandise relating to Disney's animated films, including "Beauty and the Beast" and "Fantasia," were particularly strong.
"Their film business is still on a hot streak, and park attendance continues to be strong -- those positives offset the Euro Disney negative," Alan Kassan, analyst for Morgan Stanley, said.
Disney's shares rose 62.5 cents today, to $40.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Revenue for Disney's filmed-entertainment segment rose 6 percent, to $785 million, for the quarter, from $737 million. Operating earnings grew 21 percent, to $121.5 million. Disney said the results reflected the success of its animated releases and its theatrical films, including "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
In the theme park and resorts segment, Disney's revenue jumped 26 percent, to $996.2 million, for the quarter. Operating profit rose 44 percent, to $213.9 million. Attendance at United States parks and resorts was higher, and increased per capita spending at theme parks contributed to improved operating results, the company said.
Consumer product revenues rose 54 percent, to $294 million, for the quarter, and operating profit climbed 18 percent, to $60.4 million, because of brisk sales of merchandise related to "The Little Mermaid, "101 Dalmatians" and "Beauty and the Beast."
Separately, Disney said it was negotiating to build a new marine theme park in Tokyo. The company had planned to build a similar park, called Disney Sea, in Long Beach, Calif., but abandoned the project because of the weak economy. A Disney spokesman said the company was negotiating with the Oriental Land Company, which owns Tokyo Disneyland, to build the marine park.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees 'Good Progress' on European Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The United States and the European Community failed again today to reach an agreement on a farm subsidy dispute that threatens to explode into a trade war. But at the end of the talks here, both sides said they had made progress and would meet again soon.
For two years, the dispute has blocked world trade talks aimed at reducing international trade barriers and stimulating the global economy. 
 Officials on both sides have announced progress after every meeting, but sounded somewhat more optimistic today than after their last round ended on Nov. 4 in Chicago. Trade disputes are almost always resolved on the eve of a deadline, if at all; a little more than two weeks remain to strike a deal.

 An American official said tonight that Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan would telephone Ray MacSharry, the European Community's agriculture commissioner, early Friday morning. The two men will try to settle a few of the details left outstanding today, and will schedule the next round of face-to-face talks, said the official, who insisted on anonymity.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, promised two weeks ago to impose 200 percent import taxes on Dec. 5 on white wines, rapeseed oil and wheat gluten from the European Community if the community did not agree to reduce its subsidized production of soybeans, rapeseed and sunflower seeds.
"We've made very good progress today," Mrs. Hills told reporters after the two days of talks ended late this afternoon. "In fact, I can go so far as to say we're quite close together, and we're going to continue to work."
Frans Andriessen, the European Community's Commissioner of External Relations, added, "We had a good conversation, which contributed largely to find solutions to points we have still pending between the United States and the European Community."
 Mrs. Hills said the two sides needed to gather more data and they had not yet set a date for further negotiations.
 
 
Progress in Other Areas
Today's talks produced progress not only on soybeans but also on two other disputes: reductions in the tonnage of the European Community's grain exports and compensation payments to farmers who will be losing subsidies, the official added, while declining to elaborate. The United States has been concerned that the compensation payments not be disguised subsidies for yet more farm production.
The Administration contends that if European subsidies did not exist, American farmers would sell an extra $1 billion a year worth of soybeans in Europe and that other food exporters like Brazil would sell an extra $1 billion annually of soybeans. The community contends that the lost sales amount to only a few hundred million dollars a year and that subsidy reductions are not politically feasible because of protests by farmers.
France is Europe's largest producer and exporter of food, including oilseeds, and its farmers have been the fiercest opponents of European concessions. The Associated Press reported today that about 300 French farmers had torched an American flag and stirred the embers with a pitchfork outside the American Embassy in Paris in a protest that left about 20 people injured in clashes with the police.
The French Government has followed its farmers' wishes in vigorously fighting concessions in meetings of ministers from European Community nations. Alarmed that the dispute could scuttle the world trade talks, Britain and the Netherlands have fought back at these meetings and have increasingly enlisted German support since Mrs. Hills announced the prospective taxes on white wine.
Mrs. Hills also announced on Nov. 5 that if the dispute was not resolved soon, she might impose additional taxes on up to $1.7 billion worth of imported industrial goods, many from Germany. German industrial groups have become increasingly active in lobbying for a settlement.
Administration officials publicly deny that they deliberately instigated a crisis within the community in an attempt to resolve the dispute. But a few officials say privately that the threat of a trade war has succeeded beyond their expectations in forcing the community to confront its divisions.
 The oilseeds dispute is not the only farm subsidy issue dividing the United States and the community. And even if all subsidy issues are resolved together, as Mrs. Hills and her European counterparts have sought, many other sticky issues remain that could hold up a successful conclusion.
The United States and the community are still divided over maritime services and competition in the market for telephone calls. The two sides are also united in urging Japan to drop its ban on rice imports and want developing countries to open their insurance and banking markets to competition.

HEADLINE: Olympia May Yield Real Estate

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Warned by Canada's leading banks that its three-week-old plan to restructure debts would be rejected, Olympia & York is preparing sweeping new proposals that would allow its creditors to seize some of Canada's most prestigious office buildings, lawyers for the insolvent Canadian real estate giant said today.
The forced change of direction represents another striking setback for the world's largest real estate developer, which has been a participant in property markets for the last two decades, building up assets once calculated at more than $20 billion. 
 The newest proposals suggest that the real estate development company, owned by the Reichmann brothers of Toronto, would turn itself into what would basically be a property management company. Some experts have estimated that it would retain ownership of only 10 percent of the Canadian holdings.
 
 
New Vote Is Planned
 A lawyer who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Olympia & York would ask an Ontario bankruptcy court on Monday to extend its protection of the company's assets by about a month, to Jan. 31, to permit a vote on the new plan sometime in mid-January. Olympia's Canadian operations have been under court protection since its original bankruptcy filing on May 14.
The May 14 filing covered Olympia and 28 subsidiaries. Five of those companies have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. But Olympia is still seeking to restructure the debts of its main United States properties outside the bankruptcy courts.
The new submission would mark the third time that Olympia's management has tried to win over its creditors with a complex plan to reorganize the company. The most recent plan, which was presented on Oct. 27, ran into a storm of opposition. The company had asked creditors to suspend for five years their rights to seize property put up as loan collateral.
In warning about the Oct. 27 plan, the four Canadian banks -- the Royal Bank of Canada, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Bank of Nova Scotia and the National Bank of Canada -- suggested that creditors who so desired would be allowed to walk away with their collateral.
 
 
A 3d Level of Claims
 The four banks have securities in First Canadian Place, a 72-story tower in the heart of Toronto's financial district, in return for a $131 million loan they made earlier this year to Olympia. This represents a third level of claim against the building, after $10 million of first-mortgage and $475 million of second-mortgage bonds.
The same four banks also have claims against two other neighboring skyscrapers, Scotia Plaza and the Exchange Tower.
The three towers include 5.3 million square feet of rentable space and have combined debts of $1.3 billion. Built to warm praise, they helped power the Reichmanns empire's growth of during inflationary times but also positioned the brothers -- Paul, Albert and Ralph -- for their deflation-induced fall.
Although details of the new plan are not available, lawyers from Olympia and from some of the creditors who are familiar with its details said it would allow the most secured creditors to vote to seize the properties against which their loans are secured.
An Olympia lawyer said the company would probably announce on Friday its intention to seek extension of the bankruptcy court's protection.
Under the current schedule, which the court is being asked to revise, 34 groups of creditors are to vote, between next Wednesday and Nov. 30, on the proposals that were presented on Oct. 27.
A lawyer who represents a leading bank creditor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he understood that the new plan would provide not only for greater freedom of action by the secured creditors but greater involvement in management by the creditors.
Asked whether there would be a widespread seizure of assets, he said that would be a "premature conclusion."
"Each creditor group will look at individual circumstances, including cash flow," he said.
But he acknowledged that the aim, over the long term, would be to proceed with an orderly liquidation of most of the company's Canadian property empire.
It is unlikely, lawyers and other experts said, that in the present depressed market for commercial real estate, any efforts would be undertaken to sell any seized real estate.
"It is a question," one creditor lawyer said, "of whether you would want the Reichmanns as managers or whether you think someone else will do a better job."

HEADLINE: Panel Proposes New Rockets to Keep U.S. Competitive

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The United States should move quickly to develop a new, more economical and safer family of rockets for launching space payloads to decrease dependence on its current fleet of dated rockets, a special White House panel said today.
The panel, consisting of experts commissioned by the National Space Council, a policy group whose chairman is Vice President Quayle, said the Air Force should be allowed to develop a modular system of rockets. They say this Spacelifter system could cut by half the cost of launching payloads into space. 
 The panel, part of the Vice President's Space Policy Advisory Board, said the new rockets would eventually replace the Delta, Atlas and Titan rockets and the space shuttle. These vehicles form the backbone of the current launcher fleet and are all based on 1950's and 1960's technology.
The panel also discouraged the use of surplus space rockets available from Russia as well as the use of the United States' own surplus of decommissioned ballistic missiles as launching vehicles. Disarmament has made hundreds of such missiles available, but the panel expressed concern that they, like Russian launchers, would compete with rockets produced by the nation's commercial launching industry, which already faces excess capacity and competition.
The panel, headed by Edward C. Aldridge Jr., a former secretary of the Air Force and president of The Aerospace Corporation of El Segundo, Calif., recommended using giant Russian boosters, but only for missions that required a payload greater than 50,000 pounds, the maximum for both the shuttle and the proposed Spacelifter family of rockets.
If the space agency formally proposes the Spacelift program, it will require Congressional approval.
 
Competitive With Ariane
 The Spacelifter, capable of launching light to medium-heavy cargoes of 20,000 to 50,000 pounds into near-Earth orbit, could be used by the nation's military, civilian and commercial space programs to fly payloads as cheaply and efficiently as new rockets being developed by competitors, like the Ariane V of the European Space Agency, the panel said.
"Without the introduction of a new launch vehicle that meets cost and performance goals, we can write off future U.S. competitiveness in this area," the panel said.
If started now, the new rockets could be phased into use between the years 2005 and 2010, Mr. Aldridge said at a briefing. The group gave no cost estimate for the program, but similar proposals for new rockets in the past have put the figure at about $10 billion. Independent space experts say the Spacelifter system could cost slightly less because it does not include a heavy-lift booster for payloads of up to 100,000 pounds, as other plans have.

 
Replaces 1990 Proposal
 The Spacelifter system would replace the New Launch System, or N.L.S., which the National Space Council has backed since 1990, but which Congress effectively killed in October. The N.L.S. proposal called for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air Force to develop a family of rockets around a giant booster capable of launching 100,000 pounds.
The proposal lacked industry support and was not backed enthusiastically by either NASA or the Defense Department.
Mr. Aldridge said Spacelifter could get the support N.L.S. lacked because it would have a narrower focus, would be open to design ideas and bids from the entire aerospace industry and would be built by the Air Force, which has a clear need for a new rocket.
 
Reduction of Shuttle Flights
 The plan calls for NASA to develop a manned module to enable the new rockets to carry crews to the proposed Space Station Freedom, and an unmanned "Cargo Transfer and Return Vehicle" to service the station.
NASA could pay for its part of the program with savings in its shuttle operations, by increasing economy and reducing flights, the panel said.
"The shuttle is very expensive relative to its role in the U.S. space program," the panel's report said. At $5 billion a year, the shuttle program consumes about one-third of NASA's $14.3 billion budget to support seven or eight flights a year, it said.
The panel, composed of industry executives, retired military officers and civilian space specialists, said it was "extremely important that a consensus be developed between the current and forthcoming Administrations, the affected Government agencies, Congress and industry for the nation's new space launch program."
 
'Like N.L.S. Repackaged'
 John E. Pike, director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, said the proposal "seems a lot like N.L.S. repackaged."
"I'm not sure this proposal will get a good reception in Congress," Mr. Pike said, "With only a limited amount of money available, it might be better spent in upgrading existing rockets and developing a new crew capsule that can be used on a Titan rocket to reduce use of the space shuttle."
In addition to the Spacelifter rocket, the panel recommended creating a single, independent "space launch authority" with one person in charge of all military, civilian and commercial rocket launchings. As a stopgap, the panel recommended upgrading current rockets and space launching operations to make them more economical.

HEADLINE: YELTSIN PLANS END TO A-SUB PROGRAM

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Seeking to persuade South Korea of Russia's peaceful intentions in Asia and around the world, President Boris N. Yeltsin told the National Assembly here today that his country would halt the production of nuclear submarines in two or three years.
Mr. Yeltsin, who is on a three-day state visit here, said Russia was cutting in half its production of new submarines and indicated that still more reductions in the military were planned. "I think in two or three years' time, we will stop making submarines for military purposes," he said, according to news agency translations of his speech. 
 In a gesture of particular interest to his hosts, Mr. Yeltsin also gave South Korea the flight recorders from the Korean Air Lines flight that was shot down by a Soviet fighter in 1983, killing all 269 people on board, and expressed condolences to relatives of the victims. "I can assure you that such a criminal action will not happen again," he said.
 
Pledges to Reduce Arms
 In saying Russia would halt submarine manufacturing, Mr. Yeltsin was apparently trying to reassure South Korea and other Asian countries that Russia wanted to preserve peace in the region. Mr. Yeltsin is trying to integrate his country into fast-growing East Asia in hopes of attracting trade and investment that could help Russia's ailing economy.
Earlier in the day, in a two-hour meeting with President Roh Tae Woo, the Russian leader made other pledges on arms reductions, according to the summary of the meeting providing by the Korean Government.
Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Roh that Russia hoped to sign an agreement with the new Clinton Administration calling for a 60 percent reduction in strategic weapons. President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin have already agreed in principle to the pact.
But even before such a treaty is signed, Russia will unilaterally halt the production of medium-sized bombers and continue to dismantle SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, he said. He also said that Russia and the United States would continue a freeze on nuclear testing until July 1993 and that he would urge China to do the same when he visits Beijing next month.
 
Re-examining K.A.L. 007
 The presentation of the flight recorders from K.A.L. Flight 007 came as something of a surprise to Korean officials. As late as Wednesday morning, a few hours before Mr. Yeltsin arrived, Korean officials were not sure whether Mr. Yeltsin would indeed bring the "black boxes."
"I have something for the Korean people," Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Roh during their meeting, according to summaries by Korean officials. Mr. Yeltsin then presented a gray suitcase with the cockpit voice recorder and the flight instrument recorder.
South Korea has long been pressing for access to the recorders, in hopes of answering questions like why Flight 007 veered hundreds of miles off course and passed over Soviet territory. However, it is unclear whether anything new will be learned.
Recently Russia provided South Korea with transcripts of the cockpit voice recorder and expressed regrets about the incident, but South Korean officials were not sure they were getting complete information.
On Wednesday, 40 relatives of the victims held a protest here demanding compensation.
 
Strengthening Relations
 During their talks, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Roh signed several agreements, including one setting out the basic framework for relations between Russia and South Korea. Another called for the exchange of military personnel, perhaps a first step toward more military cooperation. Mr. Yeltsin also offered to sell South Korea weapons or military technology, and Mr. Roh said he would study the offer.
The former enemies established diplomatic relations only two years ago. Since then Russia has grown more distant from North Korea, although it still maintains relations with the Communist country. Today, Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Roh that Russia would review a 1961 agreement with North Korea that calls for each country to come to the other's aid in a war.
Mr. Yeltsin thanked South Korea for agreeing to resume $3 billion in aid that had been suspended because Russia had fallen behind on its interest payments. He also proposed many areas of cooperation between Korean and Russian companies in areas like development of natural resources and science and technology.

HEADLINE: United Way Says Slump and Scandal Are Bringing Sharp Dip in Donations

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Wrestling with the effects of a sluggish economy and of the corrosive scandal at its national association this year, officials at the United Way say they fear that 1992 will bring the sharpest decline in donations in more than 40 years.
The early returns from the fall campaigns of 2,200 local United Ways are mixed, but individual fund-raisers in several large metropolitan areas say the overall numbers are dipping below earlier years. Total contributions fell in each of the last two years. But when the figures are adjusted for inflation, not since World War II have they dropped in absolute dollars, too. 
 In Cleveland, pledges are down about 9 percent, from $51.3 million in 1991 to $46.3 million this year. In San Diego, a United Way spokesman, John Liarakos, said, "We're at the midpoint of our campaign and we're running 6 to 8 percent behind last year."
At the United Way of America, the national association of all the local United Ways, Bob O'Connor, a vice president, said, "We'd feel very happy if we came out even with last year."
 
Frustration and Fury
 It was the national association whose former president, William Aramony, was forced out last winter after disclosures of his hefty expense accounts and the financial manipulations that created a series of profit-making spinoff organizations.
While the scandal was a source of frustration and fury throughout the winter and spring, fund-raisers in several local offices called the economy the year's chief villain.
Jim Ridge, vice president for operations at the United Way for Southeastern Michigan, said: "We've got a lot fewer jobs in this community, and that translates into fewer people to solicit and fewer people to give. It's not only the jobs that have been lost, but people's attitudes. With corporations downsizing, many people don't know if they're going to have a job tomorrow, and they are concerned about that."
He added that with the recession, the needs of the charities to which the United Way contributes are greater. "That's obviously what we're concerned about," he said.
 
Growth for Some Funds
 It is unclear whether the problems of the United Way, the nation's largest network of charities, have been felt by other charities. A recent survey by the journal The Chronicle of Philanthropy indicated that giving had increased 5.8 percent in the last year, but many of the participating charities were citing figures for the fiscal year 1991, which ended almost 18 months ago.
A more dramatic comparison is offered by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, which contends that 164 "alternative" funds seeking work-place donations have far outstripped the United Way in growth, averaging increases of 42 percent over the last three years, as against a 7.8 percent increase for the United Way.
The group's executive director, Robert O. Bothwell, has said for a decade that the United Way is too exclusive, too hidebound in its attitude toward alternative charities and too unresponsive to donor concerns.
His comparisons tend to favor statistics showing percentage growth, a measure that makes small, fast-growing organizations look better than their large, established counterparts.
 
Environmental Philanthropies
 A new report by Mr. Bothwell's organization was made public on Wednesday, saying that "corporations in areas like Boston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Seattle and San Francisco seem particularly willing to open their campaigns to alternative funds."
Environmentally oriented philanthropies, only occasionally included in local United Way efforts, have been among the fastest-growing of the charities that solicit work-place donations. The report by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy projected that revenue raised by nine environmental funds would increase by 50 percent from 1991 to 1992.
The charities supported by the United Way tend to be more traditional human-service groups like the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and the Salvation Army. Support for more politically controversial groups has sometimes caused rifts that hampered local fund-raising efforts. For example, the Rochester United Way, traditionally among the most successful local United Ways, had a 5 percent dropoff in contributions in their major campaign earlier this year.
Unlike most other members of the network, the Rochester group does its most intensive fund raising in the spring. The vast majority of campaigns involve companies soliciting their workers and executives for United Way payroll deductions from September to December.
 
Double Trouble in Rochester
 In Rochester, fund-raisers were asking for donations just when the headlines about the United Way of America were most prominent and most damaging. At the same time, the local offices of Planned Parenthood, which had been part of the campaign for 20 years, announced the opening of an abortion clinic. This prompted anti-abortion groups to mount a "de-pledge" campaign to deny donations to the local United Way.
The Rochester group, which also runs a smaller fund-raising campaign in the fall, said that its latest campaign is doing better than it had last year. "We've been trying to be very aggressive," said Diane Ryan, a spokeswoman for the Rochester group.
"There's not much we can do about the economy," she said. "But certainly, we can do something about the United Way of America issue. We're very pro-active in letting the community know that the United Way of America issue has been resolved, that a new president has been named."
Ms. Ryan also noted that, as the nation's workplace changes, with growth in the number of retired people, small businesses and services like health care -- all groups usually outside the ambit of the United Way -- the network of charities is rethinking its basic fund-raising strategies.
 
New Markets and New Venues
 Robert M. Beggan, a vice president of the United Way of America, said: "We're not only looking at new markets, but at new venues -- how we can help people in carrying out their caring. The retirees are one of the fastest-growing segments of our market. We would like to go with pension checkoff and pension deduction."
He also said there had been a recent push for big donors.
Expanding on this theme, Tony DeCristofaro, spokesman for United Way of America, said: "We have over 4,000 individuals giving $10,000 or more. We have 70 to 80 people giving $100,000. In the 10,000-and-above category , 4,700 individuals gave $75 million last year."
At the United Way of King County, in Seattle, William Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, offered a $1 million challenge grant to match the contributions of donors giving $10,000 and more.
Metropolitan areas like Seattle, in fact, are defying the general fund-raising doldrums. "Last year we raised $45.5 million," said Lynann Marcellis of the United Way of King County. "Right now we're at $46 million and our campaign goes through Dec. 9."

The economy wasn't the only thing that went into decline under George Bush. When it came to partying, he turned out to be a real pooper, throwing only the required bashes, hardly ever venturing to the salons of Georgetown and hurrying off to Camp David on weekends.
That didn't stop the partying, of course. But it set the tone for entertainment that was as soporific as a church supper, especially with drawing rooms filled with faces that had been hanging around Washington since Ronald Reagan, who imported old Hollywood buddies and pinstriped businessmen for his parties. Before that there was Jimmy Carter, who took a dim view of strong drink. 
 But take heart, Washington. With the Clintons, the new power couple, in town -- just for a two-day "drop-by," in Washington party argot -- already the party pace is picking up.
 
'We've Come Alive!'
 Or, as Esther Coopersmith, a local socialite who hosts more than most, put it: "We've come alive! Alive! Alive!"
Consider:
Thursday, Day 1, President-elect Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, had been in town only a few hours when they attended a fund raiser for one of their favorite charities, the Children's Defense Fund, and then moved on to the home of Vernon E. Jordan, head of the Clinton transition team, for some power dining with the likes of Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat; Lane Kirkland, the president of the AFL-CIO; Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee; John Hechinger, a Washington businessman; James Wolfensohn, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, and Ted Koppel, the television journalist.
There were people waiting in the cold, wet street to spot the arrival of the President-elect and the other guests. There were reporters. And photographers. And television teams.
Tonight, Pamela Harriman, the British transplant whose elegant Georgetown fund raisers helped hold the Democratic Party together during the lean Reagan-Bush years, invited the Clintons for drinks and dinner, along with another group of legislators, culture mavens and journalists. Again people and reporters waited in the cold and damp to see the guests arrive.
 
'All the New Faces'
 "It's been a long time since that kind of thing last happened," said Mary Hoyt, who served as Rosalynn Carter's friend-in-waiting and press secretary and who knows Washington at work and at play, not that there is any real difference.
"It's exciting, all the new faces and the energy and the comings and goings," Ms. Hoyt added. "The fact that the Clintons are getting out and about right at the start is a good sign that this town is springing back to life and ready to party. And last night's guest list: now that tells you that not only are the Clintons people who like ideas and issues but that their friends and guests will be idea and issue people who'll come from everywhere. This is going to be fun after what we've been through."
 
Wandering in the Wilderness
 Because the Democrats have been out in the political cold for so many years, they also have been out in the social cold. When you're out of power in Washington, you're off the party A-list, no matter your breeding, your school or your previous contribution to mankind.
A few Democrats have had the political adeptness during this period to work both sides of the ideological fence partywise. Robert S. Strauss, the Ambassador to Moscow, is one.
Others, mainly Congressional leaders, have retained their place on the A-list by virtue of their power on Capitol Hill. Still, most Democrats have been wandering in the wilderness for the better part of 12 years, reduced to chicken-in-the-pot lunches at Duke Zeibert's and misery-loves-company suppers with fellow also-rans.
 
The Changing Scene
 But while the general expectation is that the return of the Democrats will make for a livelier scene in the capital -- the Clintons have led an active social life in Little Rock -- hardly anybody expects the basic style of Washington partying to change.
The glittering but impersonal White House state dinner and the quiet private party for a dozen at the home of a Cabinet member or senator or lobbyist will almost certainly continue to be the staple form of socializing, as will the larger party for, say, a hundred at the homes of wealthy, involved people like Mrs. Harriman and Mrs. Coopersmith.
There will probably be some quiet competition for a reputation as host or hostess with the mostest, but nothing in the nature of Perle Mesta, since party givers these days tend to be mainly interested in causes rather than pure socializing.
But the huge, costly bashes of yore at sprawling private homes and at diplomatic residences have given way to charity fund raisers sponsored by corporations and sometimes embassies. Congressional leaders and Cabinet members, maybe even the President or Vice President, sign on as co-hosts for such events, but all guests contribute for the privilege of mixing and, more often than not with the intent to make a contact or press a cause.
"Parties, whatever kind they are, help make Washington go 'round, and there are a lot of people out there right now who can hardly wait to get back into swinging where it counts," said Alma Viator, a public events organizer and publicist who specializes in putting together theater openings and other events.
"No matter whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, it's been dull, dull, dull for many, many, many years," she said. "Now we've got a young, energetic, enthusiastic President coming in. And away we go!"

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasuries Move Lower

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market yesterday continued to sound its one sure theme -- volatility.
After a rally in the short end of the market on Wednesday and a rally for several days in the price of the 10-year Treasury note and the 30-year bond, investors did an about-face and sold. 
 Among the explanations that traders offered were a sale by a big speculator in the morning and the surprising jump in the money supply reported by the Federal Reserve in the afternoon. And there is usually selling ahead of Treasury auctions, with the sale of two-year and five-year notes coming up Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
But the bottom line is that this is just an uncertain period for the market. While the economy is growing, its strength is unknown. President-elect Bill Clinton has yet to make any key appointments or given the details of his economic plan. The market is getting thinner as traders and investors think of taking profits and closing their books for the year.
 
Waiting for News
 In this atmosphere, the market is likely to jump around, often moving in unexpected directions, as it waits for news or data that could put it on a surer footing or even a new course.
In trading yesterday, the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was down 15/32 to yield 7.54 percent, up from 7.50 percent Wednesday. The prices of notes were also off, from 11/32 for the 10-year note due in August 2002 to 4/32 for the two-year note.
In trading in the pre-auction, or when-issued, market, the yield on the two-year note to be sold Monday was up to 4.69 percent, from 4.60 percent Wednesday, and the yield on the five-year note to be sold Tuesday jumped to 6.07 percent, from 6.00 percent the day before.
The discount rates on Treasury bills also rose, with the rate on the one-year bill finishing at 3.58 percent, up from 3.51 percent.
Traders said two economic reports yesterday that might normally have supported the market were ignored. They both showed the economy was weak, with new-home construction declining 1.1 percent in October and initial claims for unemployment compensation rising 31,000, to 386,000, in the first week of November.
So what pushed the market around, several traders said, was a sale of longer maturities, like the 30-year bond and the 10-year note, by a very large speculator in the market.
Jay Goldinger, a trader at Capital Insights in Los Angeles, said the speculator was undoing a trade in which he had bought longer maturities and sold shorter ones. This maneuver, which is called a flattening trade, is done when investors think that short-term interest rates are going to rise.
Mr. Goldinger said it appeared that the speculator decided to take his profits in the flattening trade, but that because his position was large and trading was getting thinner, the move had an impact on the market, forcing others to follow suit.
In the late afternoon, the market also got a small downward push from the weekly money supply report from the Federal Reserve. It showed that M-2, which includes currency in circulation, checking accounts and savings accounts, rose $6.6 billion in the week that ended Nov. 9, far more than the forecasts of about a $1 billion increase.
More important, the annual growth rate in M-2 is now at 2.5 percent, the bottom of the Fed's target range. This is the first time in six months that the growth rate has been near target, which decreases the likelihood of another cut in interest rates by the Fed.
 
Move by Sweden
 The American bond market was not affected by the devaluation of the Swedish krona by about 8 percent yesterday. But European buyers of $2 billion of dollar-denominated Swedish three-year bonds earlier in the week were not blamed for feeling pretty bad, if not a little betrayed.
At the time of the sale on Tuesday, the issue was priced to yield 5.636 percent, or 46 basis points more than the yield on the three-year Treasury note. Because of the devaluation, that spread jumped to as much as 58 basis points, or hundredths of percentage points, in trading in London yesterday and closed at around 54 basis points over the three-year Treasury note.
The issue was already having problems selling before the devaluation because the spread had risen to 50 basis points yesterday morning. This could all add up to losses for the underwriters, J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston.
 
Corporate Debt
 In trading in the corporate market, the prices of bonds issued by financial institutions were a little weak, in part because about $800 million in such bonds have been issued recently.
But Citicorp did set a milestone of sorts with its sale of $150 million in subordinated notes. The sale was the first since February and was aimed at taking advantage of the narrowing spreads between the yield on Citcorp paper and the Treasury market.
The yield on the 10-year Citicorp notes was 8.636 percent, 185 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The spread was as wide as 300 basis points a year ago, when the bank's financial outlook was much more shaky.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Sweden Abandons Its Effort To Prop Up the Krona's Value

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
After a long and expensive battle against the markets to maintain the strength of its currency, Sweden gave up the fight today and allowed the krona to fall in value.
The surrender came after an unsuccessful attempt to head off speculators by raising Sweden's benchmark interest rate to 20 percent from 11.5 percent earlier in the day. After giving up and allowing its currency to float in value, the Government pushed the interest rate back down to 12.5 percent. 
 The Swedish action, which left the krona worth about 8 percent less against the dollar and against most European currencies by the end of the trading day in Europe, came amid recurring speculation that the European monetary system will soon agree to a revaluation involving the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and perhaps the Irish punt, all of which are considered by analysts to be overvalued.
 
Had Taken Extreme Steps
 Sweden had taken one of the hardest lines in Europe against devaluation, and had gone to extreme lengths to avoid it in September when it pushed marginal interest rates up to 500 percent at one point during the economic crisis that nearly ripped apart Europe's monetary system.
Although not yet a member of the European Community, Sweden under the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt has been working to get its financial house in order and to join Europe's system of semifixed exchange rates.
But speculative pressure against the krona has been mounting in the last few days, with investors betting heavily on a further drop in the currency's value. And with Sweden's economy extremely weak, economists said, Mr. Bildt had little leeway to raise interest rates for any sustained period.

Dollar in Broad Loss
By The Associated Press
The dollar lost ground yesterday against most other leading currencies for the third consecutive session as new Government reports suggested weakness in the American economy.
But initially, the dollar was up, a move that coincided with news that the Swedish Government had effectively devalued its currency. In late New York trading yesterday, the krona was down, selling at 6.5635 to the dollar, compared with 6.0900 on Wednesday.
Gold prices edged up in domestic trading after falling in Europe. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose 20 cents an ounce, to $335.30.

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Indicate Setbacks for Economy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits jumped sharply early this month and housing starts fell in October, the Government said today in reports that were seen as evidence of a temporary setback for the economy.
The number of Americans filing unemployment claims shot up by 31,000, to 386,000, for the week that ended on Nov. 7, the Labor Department said. It was the biggest increase in three months and the highest level of claims in six weeks. 
 Housing starts fell 1.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million, the Commerce Department said. Housing starts had risen in August and September.
Both the housing and employment reports were unexpectedly bleak, but they did not shake analysts' belief that the economy is growing gradually and will continue to improve during President-elect Bill Clinton's first year in office.
Overall housing starts strongly advanced in the Midwest in October, but were unable to overcome declines elsewhere.
An 11.8 percent plunge in the volatile apartment sector more than offset a modest increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in construction of single-family homes.
The Commerce Department said the September advance was revised to eight-tenths of a percent, a rate of 1.24 million, smaller than its original estimate last month of 1.4 percent.
Starts of single-family homes increased seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a 1.07 million rate, the third straight advance. But apartment construction fell for the second straight month, down 11.8 percent, to a rate of 157,000.
David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said a survey of home builders in late October and early November found "some perking up," particularly in expectations for six months in the future.
Applications for building permits, which some economists consider a barometer of future activity, rose 1.1 percent in October after jumping 4.6 percent a month earlier.
Regionally, starts rose only in the Midwest, gaining 10.4 percent, to a 307,000 annual rate. In the Northeast, they dropped 7.3 percent, to a 127,000 rate. after surging 23.4 percent a month earlier. That had been the largest increase in the region since a 31.5 percent gain in June 1991.
Starts were off 4.8 percent in the South, to a 511,000 rate, and 2.4 percent in the West, to a 284,000 rate.
The jump in unemployment claims came after they had fallen in five of the previous six weeks. And a moving four-week average, although higher, remained near a two-year low. The average was 369,250 for the latest period, up from 364,500.
Before the report was released, economists were expecting the level of claims to remain unchanged from the previous week. They cautioned, though, against reading too much into unexpected weekly movements in the claims number. They said that the number of new claims probably reflected, in part, temporary layoffs of construction workers after an early snowstorm in the upper Midwest.
Despite the increase, new benefit claims are still well below the 440,000 to 460,000 they averaged in the first three months of this year and the 410,000 to 430,000 range that held through much of the summer.
In the first week of November, 18 states reported increases of 1,000 or more claims. The three states with the biggest rise in claims were California, with 10,148; Minnesota, 5,031, and Pennsylvania, 4,300.

HEADLINE: TENNIS;
Amid All the Smoke, the Ethics Are Indistinct

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
This is about smoke and coke, proud sponsors of American sport.
Smoke, the legal product, is the cloud on which women's tennis floats. A premier event, the $3 million Virginia Slims Championships, is in town this week. This has always seemed to be the most cynical promotion in professional sports, one whose slogan should really be "You've come a lung way, baby." 
 "They're cleaning up their image and killing women at the same time," said Phyllis Kriegel, editor-in-chief of the feminist bimonthly New Directions for Women. "But what money isn't tainted these days?"
Crack cocaine, the illegal product, is the concrete under many inner-city basketball tournaments. Dope dealers probably buy more trophies for teen-agers than Nike does. Why not? They probably have more discretionary money and fewer advertising outlets.
"Now let's not go blaming women's tennis or these tournaments," said Dean Meminger, who played on the Knicks championship team in 1973. "What other alternatives do they have? Who else is going to support them? People will do what they must to survive."
So much for voices of reason. Back to smoke. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, more than 50,000 women will die of lung cancer this year. The disease has become the leading cancer killer of women, passing breast cancer. Critics of the tobacco industry's involvement in sponsoring women's political and business conferences and organizations, as well as sports, say that cigarette companies have been successful in the women's market because they play on fears of getting fat and the desire for independence.

 We go from the slime to the ridiculous. With the Slims in town, this has been a week of breathless reams and reels on Jennifer Capriati's teen-age angst and Martina Navratilova's middle-aged consciousness-raising. We can assume neither of them inhales, but who knows? Maybe that's how Jennifer really lost those 20 pounds; maybe that's how Martina relieved the stress of her fiscal-sexual traumas. Neither has made major statements to their fans that their relationship to cigarettes is purely mercenary.
It is disappointing to see newspapers, including the best, carrying advertising for the Slims tournament, even with the Surgeon General's warning attached, and covering it so ingenuously. Worse yet is television coverage, sleazing around the ban on cigarette advertising.
Women in tennis get testy about this issue. Last year, Pam Shriver, president of the Women's Tennis Association, snapped: "We are offering a healthy image here. No one in the company has ever asked us to smoke or endorse cigarettes."
Kriegel snorted. "Some image," she said. "I see more and more young women smoking all the time."
What if New Directions for Women were in trouble and tobacco money were offered?
Kriegel sighed. "Maybe it's not so terrible in an imperfect world," she said. "How pure can you be? Probably we wouldn't take the money. But we haven't faced it."
Meminger said: "More important than the blood money sponsoring the event is that the dope dealer becomes the hero. He's the one the kids look up to. And eventually go to work for."
Dean the Dream is 44 now, working for the New Jersey State Department of Labor and still trying to get his own community-help group into the air. He has been concerned about this issue for years; in fact this conversation the other day was the continuation of one started several years ago during one of Micheal Ray Richardson's last comeback attempts from drug abuse.
Since then, the hundreds of tournaments for youngsters that faltered after Reagan-Bush defundings of inner-city programs became even more vulnerable to the big spenders who rolled up in their Jeeps and Beamers, dripping with gold and cellulars and sycophants and the ready-to-buy shirts and hardware and, most important, referees. The dealers, who are already crucial to the neighborhood economy, now become patrons of the playground arts.
It gets worse, according to Meminger. Because so many young athletes are "processed" through the educational system without real family, school and community support networks, when they finally drop the ball, in high school or college, they return to their neighborhoods as "liabilities."
"Who hires them?" asked Meminger. "The big dealers hire them. Athletes make great dope pushers. They're well known in the community. They've got leadership qualities. They have a platform."
If the dealers are power brokers in these neighborhoods, consider the clout of the smoke peddlers, who also filtered several million into the recent Presidential campaigns. The tobacco industry has been criticized for its cynicism in subsidizing black music groups, stock-car racers and, of course, women's tennis. Early on, when no one else wanted to foot the bill, Philip Morris made the women's tour possible. A few women got rich.
The illegal peddlers uptown probably made it possible for a few youngsters to get out of the playground and into college and on with productive lives.
The solution, please. Money, of course. Uptown, local businesses, city, state and Federal governments and corporations can take the tournaments back from the dope dealers.
Downtown, it might be easier. Millionaire female tennis players with all their corporate connections can stop betraying their fans by playing with smoke. Just say no.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
During the heady boom years of the late 1980's, when auctions became public spectacles and prices rose to heights that astonished even the experts, some in the art world bemoaned the fact that it was no longer the art that mattered. Record prices were what made headlines. "There were too many people who had no idea what they were buying," one dealer proclaimed; caught up in the excitement and frenzy of buying at public auction, they were "simply bidding on pretty colors across a crowded room." 
 As the two most important weeks of fall auctions in New York ended on Wednesday night, price was still foremost in everyone's mind. But in the more sober 90's, the discussions take a decidedly different spin. "We have to adjust to a new price structure," the SoHo dealer Mary Boone said after Christie's sale of contemporary art on Wednesday night. "Now $100,000 is a lot of money."
Buyers today are approaching auctions the way they shop at tag sales: hunting for quality but buying only if it involves a bargain. Indeed, the speculators who drove up prices in the late 80's have totally disappeared from the auction salesrooms. The old collectors are back, wiser than ever. Buyers this fall tended to ignore the estimates that both Sotheby's and Christie's put on works of art. Instead, they fixed what they considered a fair price in their minds and, for the most part, stuck to it.
Works by artists like Picasso and Degas, Roy Lichtenstein and Malcolm Morley were snapped up for considerably less than they would have been at the peak of the market. And many works failed to sell at all. The sales totals of the last two weeks reflected the market's new levels. Sotheby's sales totaled $73.4 million, below the $110 million to $148 million the house had expected. Christie's sales totaled $104.6 million, not far below its estimated $107.4 million to $142.6 million.
"In the contemporary field, I'd say we are back where we were in 1987," said Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in New York. "For Impressionist and modern art, we're ahead of the first half of 1988."
That's not to say there weren't some bright spots over the last two weeks. Just six months ago, works with estimates of more than $1 million were almost impossible to sell. This fall, at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Tuesday night, seven works sold for more than $1 million each, and Christie's boasted four works that fetched $1 million plus. At the sales of Impressionist and modern art, Christie's sold seven works for more than $2 million, and Sotheby's sold four.
In May, the top price paid in New York for a painting was $7.7 million for Braque's "Studio VIII," sold at Christie's. Last week, Christie's fetched a record $14.5 for Matisse's "Harmony in Yellow," sold to an unidentified telephone bidder. (The previous record for a Matisse was in 1989, at the height of the market, when "Woman With a Red Umbrella Seated in Profile" (1919-21), sold at Sotheby's in New York for $12.4 million.) Another surprise came when Monet's "Water Lily Basin," from 1919, sold for $12.1 million at Christie's on Nov. 11, way above its estimate of $7 million to $8 million.
"It's safe to come back into the market again," said David Nash, the director of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art. "It's healthier than it has been for two years. And insiders, who know what things are worth, are pleased by the results."
Mr. Burge also took the last two weeks as an optimistic sign. "Sure, the market is delicate, but people want to collect again at prices that make sense," he said. "The biggest difference between this fall and last is that now there was bidding at every level." Mr. Burge also said bidders weren't simply private collectors; dealers, too, were participating again. Often they started bidding but dropped out when prices began to rise. "Dealers are realizing the only way to make the market work is to start having new things to sell again," Mr. Burge said.
Predictably, Matisse upstaged every other artist over the last two weeks. It has been years since an important Matisse was offered at auction. This fall, both by the coincidence of estate offerings and a hefty number of collectors trying to cash in on the success of the blockbuster Matisse retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, 28 works by Matisse were up for sale.
In addition to "Harmony in Yellow," another important work, "Asia," from 1946, sold at Sotheby's for $11 million to the New York dealer William Acquavella, who was bidding for the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth. The work, which was sold by the estate of the fashion designer Mollie Parnis Livingston, far exceeded the auction house's estimate of $7 million to $8 million.
But many Matisses sold at or below their low estimates, and some didn't sell at all. At Sotheby's, "The Red Beach," from 1905, sold from the estate of Wright S. Ludington, founder of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in California, fetched $1.37 million, not far above Sotheby's low estimate of $1.25 million. "Pink Shrimp," a 1920 work being offered by the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pa., never found a buyer; bidding stopped at $1.6 million, far short of Sotheby's low estimate of $2.6 million. At Christie's, "Still Life With Pitcher and Fruit," painted in 1898 in Toulouse, France, and estimated to bring $500,000 to $700,000, sold for just $451,000, and "The Bridge from Sevres to St.-Cloud," from 1917, estimated at $550,000 to $650,000, was not sold. Bidding stopped at $380,000.
At both Sotheby's and Christie's, the works that sold underscored how prices have fallen since the height of the market.
Renoir's "Young Boy With a Cat," from 1868-69, which had been sold at Christie's in 1988 to a Japanese collector in London for $2 million, was bought at Sotheby's this fall by the Musee d'Orsay for $797,500.
At Christie's, Picasso's "Yellow Iris," from 1901, which sold at Sotheby's in May 1989 for $2.2 million, fetched $935,000 this fall. And Monet's "Spring in Giverny," which sold for $1.38 million in a Sotheby's London sale 10 years ago and fetched $3.3 million at another Sotheby's sale in London three years ago, sold this fall for $1.76 million.
The same downward slide occurred at the contemporary-art auctions. Contemporary art has always been the most volatile of the markets for paintings, showing dramatic inflation when times are good and the quickest drop when the going gets rough. At both Sotheby's and Christie's, it seemed as though estimates meant nothing. Buyers brazenly bid exactly what they felt like bidding, regardless of what the estimates suggested. And surprisingly, some works sold for half their predicted prices. Each sale's outcome had a lot to do with the level of the reserves (the secret minimum prices agreed upon by the seller and the auction house). Christie's sold 81 percent of its offerings, while Sotheby's sold only 65 percent.
Many works went for low prices. At Sotheby's, Malcolm Morley's realist painting "S.S. Amsterdam in Front of Rotterdam," from 1966, offered by the advertising magnate Charles Saatchi and estimated to bring $700,000 to $800,000, was sold for $440,000 to Jeffrey Deitch, a New York dealer. Another good buy from the same seller was Roy Lichtenstein's "Girl With Piano." Estimated at $3 million to $3.5 million, it was sold for $1.8 million to an unidentified American collector.
There were bargains at Christie's, too. Willem de Kooning's "Abstraction," from 1948, was bought for $440,000 by a Chicago dealer, Richard Gray; the estimate had been $600,000 to $800,000. Anselm Kiefer's "Markischer Sand V," estimated to bring $100,00 to $150,000, was bought by a telephone bidder for $77,000.f
By far the star of the contemporary sales was Andy Warhol's "Marilyn X 100," a 1962 silk-screen that sold at Sotehby's on Tuesday night for $3.7 million. This was not far short of the artist's record of $4.03 million, paid in 1989 for "Shot Red Marilyn," a 40-inch-square painting from 1964. At Christie's Wednesday night, it was Jasper Johns who brought the highest price. "0 Through 9," from 1961, estimated at $2.8 million to $3.5 million, sold to a telephone bidder for $2.1 million, just under Christie's low estimate.
For now, auction houses are pleased that works sell and that interest in the market is back. "There's no question the market is going to stay this way for another season," said Mr. Burge of Christie's. "But if we can just repeat our performance in the spring, I'll be happy."

MGM Grand Shifting to All-Charter Flights

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 19

 BODY:
MGM Grand Air, the luxury airline that pampers its customers with caviar and Champagne, said today that it planned to halt its flight schedule between Los Angeles and New York on New Year's Eve.
In discontinuing its money-losing scheduled passenger service, the airline will cut its work force by 155 people, to 167 employees. 
 The airline intends to redeploy the seven aircraft it operates as an all-charter service. Since the company began offering flights for hire in 1989, it has won a number of high-profile contracts to ferry rock groups and professional athletic teams including the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks.
"This appears to be a market they are set up to do, and they will be taking less risk with long-term contracts," said Willard Brown, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.
MGM Grand anticipates that its charter revenue, estimated at $18 million in 1992, will increase more than 50 percent next year. "By redeploying our assets from an unprofitable division to a profitable one, we will be in a better position to enhance value for our shareholders," said Robert Maxey, the company's president and chief executive.
MGM Grand's scheduled passenger service had losses of $4.9 million in the first nine months of 1992, said Alex Yemenidjian, an executive vice president of the airline. Scheduled service, which began in 1987, was profitable only in 1988 and 1989 and has since piled up losses. "Economic conditions changed," he said.
 Not only did the economy slump, but half-price fare wars in the airline industry made MGM Grand's $1,600 one-way first-class tickets seem especially extravagant. (In contrast, discounted round-trip tickets on some other airlines have been offered for less than $350.) Most recent flights have been half full.
The airline has two nonstop flights leaving daily from New York and Los Angeles. Passengers board DC-8's, which normally seat 189 people. On MGM Grand, the plane carries only 71 passengers, who are seated in spacious, living-room-like areas and lavished with seven-course meals prepared by a chef on board.
Other amenities include a choice of three movies, freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies handed out at the end of the flight and baggage claim in less than seven minutes.
MGM Grand, a hotel and airline company in which the financier Kirk Kerkorian has a 76 percent stake, expects the conversion to all-charter service to result in a $1.5 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter. The company already expected a year-end loss from operations and interest expenses on construction financing.

Occidental to Cut 500 Jobs And Freeze Many Salaries

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The Occidental Petroleum Corporation said today that it would cut its operating costs by about $155 million next year by dismissing 500 workers and freezing the salaries of high-paid employees. The company also intends to reduce capital spending by $150 million.
The planned cuts represent a second round of cost-cutting by Occidental since 1991 and should result in a $10 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter. 
 Analysts said Occidental's move was based on the expectation that slow economic growth would last another eight months or so. Economic lethargy has particularly hurt the profitability of the company's petrochemical business. Analysts said the moves should permit the company to channel more money to oil and gas exploration.
 Robin Shoemaker, an oil industry analyst with Lehman Brothers, said the potential benefits of Occidental's cost-cutting drive could be offset by soft business conditions. "Any fundamental improvement will be late in 1993, '94 or '95," he said.
The salary freeze, which is effective immediately, will remain in place through 1993 for all salaried employees earning more than $40,000 a year; about a third of the company's work force of 24,700 people will be affected. These people represent 80 percent of the company's outlay for salaries, said Ray R. Irani, the chairman and chief executive.
Salaried employees who earn less than $40,000 will receive a 3 percent increase on April 1 to offset inflation, compared with previous raises of about 5 percent. Unionized workers are not affected.
The company expects to save $55 million from the salary freeze. Another $100 million is expected to be saved from 500 unspecified job cuts.
Occidental, based in Los Angeles, began a restructuring in 1991 that has improved net income by an estimated $350 million. The company has reduced its revenue to $10 billion, from $21 billion, mostly from the sale of its stake in IBP Inc., a beef packer, and has cut debt by $3 billion.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Brokerage Accounts
Q How do the managed accounts offered by brokerage firms work?
 
MARY ANN HILTERHAUS, GLEN RIDGE, N.J.
 
A Managed accounts are often called wrap accounts because they wrap the investment adviser's fee and stockbroker's commission into one all-inclusive fee. 
 "No matter how much or how little trading is done, you pay just one annual fee, so that the broker's interest is the same as the client's interest," said James L. Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a New York money management company. "Usually a brokerage firm offers clients a shopping list of investment advisers to choose from, sometimes even including an in-house asset manager."
Most wrap fees start at 3 percent of assets and decline as the account increases in size. You usually need at least $100,000 to open a wrap account and can sometimes obtain a lower fee because of competitive pressures, Mr. Melcher said.
 
Safety of Bank Vaults
?
Q What happens if a bank vault box is rifled or destroyed by a natural catastrophe or in some other way?
 
ESTELLE YELLIN, ORANGE, N.J.
 
A Items in a safe deposit box in a bank are not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "But items are safer in a safety deposit box than lying around the house because of bank alarm systems," said Don S. Tokunaga, vice president of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.
If property in your safe deposit box is stolen or otherwise lost, it may be covered by your homeowner or personal floater policy, Mr. Tokunaga added. In addition, you can purchase special insurance policies tailored for the valuables placed in a safe deposit box. Insurance for any cash in a box is specifically excluded from these policies.
Some victims of safe deposit burglaries have sued banks in an attempt to recover their losses. But a suit may be costly and time-consuming.
 
Savings Bonds for Elders
Q Are United States Savings Bonds a good investment for people over 60 years old?
 
IRMA ROSENTHAL, HARTSDALE, N.Y.
 
A When you do not want to put your money into an investment with risk, Series EE Savings Bonds are a good choice for older people, said Janet Briaud, president of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers.
"If you retain them for at least five years, the return is a guaranteed 6 percent -- about 3 percent above inflation, which historically is very high," she said. "But Savings Bonds would not be appropriate when you need income."
If you hold Savings Bonds for less than five years, a market-based interest rate, which had been 5.58 percent until the beginning of this month and will be 5.04 percent until April 1993, is used.
As long as you have owned at least $500 worth of Series EE bonds for at least six months, you can exchange them for Series HH bonds, which pay semiannual interest at the rate of 6 percent. By doing so, you can defer the Federal income tax that has accrued on the Series EE bonds until you dispose of the Series HH bonds.

HEADLINE: HOW THEY DO IT;
A Family's Savings Strategy Spreads College Costs Over 20 Years

 BODY:
Mark Schiess, 40, a medical technologist in Carmel, Ind., and his wife Christine, 38, a nurse, have charted a long-term savings plan to finance the college education of their two children. Their goal: $150,000 for each child, to meet the projected cost of four years of college. 
 They began by opening savings accounts for the children at birth - the first for Maris, their daughter, now 21 months old; the second for Justin, now 3 months old. Recently, they made a bolder move; they refinanced their home mortgage to restructure expenses and, in the long run, add more to the college fund. The main components of their long-term savings plan are described below.
 
Long-Terms C.D.'s
 
Automatic monthly payments, drawn from the couple's checking account, go into certificates of deposit for each child. Interest is variable, and is pegged to fluctuations in U.S. college tuition rates. $500 is added quarterly to Maris's account; $250 monthy to Justin's. Annual savings: $5,000 excluding interest. In 20 years: $100,000 excluding interest.
 
Mutual Funds
 
Shortly after Maris was born, the Schiesses selected a mix of stock funds, using two different families of funds for greater diversity. An automatic pay-in plan adds a total of $400 a month to the funds. Annual contribution: $4,800. In 20 years: $96,000 (Dividends not included).
 
Refinancing The Mortgage
 
In September they refinanced the $130,000 mortgage on their home, changing from a 30-year to a 15-year term. Lower interest rates decreased monthly payments from $1,500 to about $1,250; they are using the savings to make extra payments on the principal and further shorten the term to 11 years. The mortgage should be paid five years before Maris starts college, leaving more for savings. Potential annual savings (after mortgage is paid): $15,000. In 5 years: $75,000.
 
Life Insurance
 
Mr. Schiess is now paying into three life insurance policies. He plans to cash one in at maturity in eight years, when it should be worth $20,000, and reinvest the proceeds. The policy's proceeds: $20,000.
 
How It All Adds Up
 
Projected savings by the 2012. Interest and dividends are unknown, and are not included. Even at modest rates of return, and with taxes on earnings, the fund can be expected to reach the $300,000 goal.

 COMPULSIVE GAMBLING: SIN OR SICKNESS?
The question of whether pathological gambling should be considered a disease or a moral weakness is a matter of much debate in academic and addiction-treatment circles these days. The answer will likely have major implications for how money is spent on research into compulsive gambling and for employers and insurers who have resisted paying for intensive inpatient treatment.

 GRIDLOCK ALERTS
RUN OFF THE ROAD
Yes, the end-of-the-year gridlock alert day, a New York holiday fixture for a decade, has been discontinued, a victim of the recession and its own effectiveness.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Leader Seeks to Address Clinton's Concerns on Trade Pact

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 20

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, seeking to calm President-elect Bill Clinton's concerns about the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, says he is eager to negotiate a solution to problems created by the accord soon after Mr. Clinton takes office in January.
In an interview Thursday evening, Mr. Salinas said he shared Mr. Clinton's belief that steps must be taken to protect the environment from damage that might be caused by the accord known as the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 "We are open to this issue of the environment, which interests both countries," Mr. Salinas said.
He said that it seemed "natural" that the environmental issues be negotiated by a standing commission of Mexican and American officials who meet periodically to discuss differences between the two countries.
"If that is the scheme that suits the new Administration of President Clinton, then with great pleasure," Mr. Salinas said.
But he said that the Binational Commission, which was scheduled to meet next in March, should also take up Mexican concerns. Among them, he said, were his Government's desire to ease restrictions on the flow of Mexicans into the United States and improve the way they are treated by the American authorities.
 
Broad Bilateral Agenda
 Other officials said Mexico would also renew its demands for permanent assurances that the United States not try to kidnap criminal suspects abroad.
President Bush made a personal pledge to that effect in June after Mexicans were enraged by a Supreme Court decision upholding the United States Government's kidnapping of a doctor from Mexico wanted in the killing of an American drug agent. But Mr. Bush would not write the assurances into a treaty.
"The bilateral agenda is very broad," Mr. Salinas said. "I am ready for us to immediately begin the dialogue with the Administration of President Clinton on those issues of the complex bilateral relationship."
Even if Mr. Salinas and Mr. Clinton resolve their differences on the trade agreement, there might be problems standing in the way of its approval in the United States. Bush Administration officials said that approval of the North American treaty might have to be delayed if the Congress also has to consider approval of a separate international trade agreement being negotiated under the so-called Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr. Salinas was careful to indicate that how and when issues surrounding the North American Free Trade Agreement were discussed would depend largely on Mr. Clinton.
At times in the interview, Mr. Salinas spoke warmly about the Arkansas Governor, whose election he was said by aides to have hoped against. The aides said that in part, the Salinas administration feared that Congressional approval of the free-trade agreement might be more difficult with a Democratic President.
Asked what similarities he saw between himself and Mr. Clinton, Mr. Salinas said first, "His spirit of change.
"He is a modern man, brave," the 44-year-old Mexican President said. "He conducted a very brave campaign. He appears determined. Warm in his attitude. Also, his interest in being close to the people, in traveling inside his country. In forming a domestic economic council. I have now had 172 meetings of our economic Cabinet. Tomorrow I have another."
 
Environmental Safeguards
 The North American Free Trade Agreement was concluded in August after more than a year of intensive negotiations. It would reduce tariff barriers to American and Canadian markets for Mexican fruits, vegetables and other commodities while making it easier for Americans and Canadians to sell their products and invest in Mexico.
But the accord has raised fears that American industries in particular will relocate to Mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor costs and looser environmental regulations, creating a border haven for polluters.
After the accord was reached, Mr. Clinton took some time to decide whether to support it. Finally, he said he endorsed the treaty in principle but said it would have to be accompanied by measures to safeguard the border environment and help American workers who might lose their jobs.
Mr. Salinas said he had not yet discussed with President Bush, Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada when the trade agreement might be signed, a step that effectively sets in motion a countdown for its consideration by the United States Congress. But senior Mexican officials indicated that Mr. Salinas would prefer to sign it with Mr. Bush before Mr. Clinton takes office.
 
'This Is What I Got'
 Under the "fast track" negotiating authority granted by the Congress last year, the agreement cannot be signed before mid-December. But from the moment of its transmission to Congress, which could occur any time after the treaty is signed, the Congress will have only 90 working days before it must bring the agreements' enabling legislation to a yes-or-no vote.
A senior Mexican official speculated that Mr. Clinton might want President Bush to sign it.
"It suits him because he receives it finished," he said. "And he can say, 'Gentlemen, this is what I got.' "
Mr. Clinton has not addressed the issue in detail since his election. He was asked at a news conference on Thursday whether he would make the trade agreement a priority for his first 100 days in office.
 
Renegotiation Opposed
 "Yes, it is a priority," the president-elect said. "And I expect it will have to be because of the time frame for consideration of the treaty by the Congress and for the President's authority to negotiate with Mexico."
Mexican officials said Mr. Salinas's suggestion of the commission reflected Mexico's desire to move as quickly as possible toward United States Congressional approval of the trade pact and to redraw the agenda of issues that surround it.
Mr. Salinas reiterated his strong opposition to any renegotiation of the trade agreement. He also insisted that the problem of how to aid workers who lost their jobs because of the accord was one for each country to deal with on its own.
While Mexico has long accepted that some agreements beyond the treaty will be the price of its passage by the United States Congress, Mr. Salinas was emphatic.
"We are totally committed and determined in favor of the environment," he said. "We are going to invest more resources and government determination, and encourage peoples' participation. Mexico's commitment to the environment is complete because it is a demand of the Mexican people."
 
Mexican Border Access
 Mr. Salinas's senior aide in charge of environmental policy, Social Development Secretary Luis Donaldo Colosio, said Mexico would seek agreements to strengthen its environmental enforcement capabilities in particular. He said the United States might be asked for assistance in training Mexico's new force of environmental-protection inspectors and for technological help in areas such as emissions control.
Mr. Salinas did not explicitly link Mexico's support for new environmental safeguards under the trade agreement to the resolution of its complaints with other American policies related to the accord. But he said he hoped that with a new Administration in Washington, the two countries would be "able to deal with different aspects of the bilateral relationship."
In particular, the Mexican President argued that Mexicans should be allowed to travel freely to the United States and assured of humane treatment there.
"We are very concerned about abuses that are committed against Mexicans when they are working as migrant workers in the United States," he said. "It seems that the law already establishes that they should be protected, but in practice they are not."
The Bush Administration has sought to keep immigration issues outside the purview of the trade agreement.
 
Gortari's Political Changes
 But the Mexican Government has continued to push for measures like an increase in the number of Mexican border residents allowed to work or shop in the United States. By accepting such cross-border movements as inevitable and effectively decriminalizing them, Mexican officials contend, the problems of abuse against immigrants by American law-enforcement authorities could be sharply reduced.
In his first detailed discussion of his proposals for political changes in Mexico, Mr. Salinas also said he would support a public accounting of where political parties get their funds and limits on how they spend them in election campaigns. He also endorsed some sort of independent oversight to insure that what parties spend matches the amounts they raise.
Mr. Salinas indicated that he was less willing to try to impose new regulations on Mexican newspapers and television stations in order to equalize the access of political parties to news organizations, as demanded by some proponents of changes in the Mexican political system.

HEADLINE: Arabs' Warning to Clinton: Prod the Israelis Over Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Staking out their negotiating position vis-a-vis the Clinton Administration, Arab delegates to the Middle East peace talks warned today that unless the new President moves quickly to prod Israel into concessions, they would abandon the discussions early next year.
But at the same time, the head of the Syria's delegation to the talks signaled his country's willingness to take part in another round of negotiations next month. 
 The mixed messages put forward by the Arab delegates seemed intended to serve two purposes. The virtual acceptance by Syria of an invitation to another rounds of talks insures that momentum in the negotiations will be maintained until the new Administration takes office.
But coupled with that was a clear warning shot across the bow of the incoming Administration by the Arabs who want to see, at the very least, if they have the diplomatic influence to win an early focus on the Middle East.
 
Little Progress So Far
 "Our patience cannot last forever," the Syrian delegate, Muwaffiq al-Allaf, said at a news conference today. "We are the parties whose territory is under occupation, so waiting is not in our interest."
Mr. Allaf's statements were typical of the frustrations voiced by all parties to the latest round of the peace talks, which ended on Thursday with little progress having been achieved and with many of the negotiators appearing to want to wait and see what policies or positions would be forthcoming from the Clinton Administration.
Yossi Gal, spokesman for the Israeli delegation, told reporters on Thursday that the pending change in Washington should not influence the talks. "I think that we should all concentrate on the process without any delays," Mr. Gal said, "that too much is at stake, that the future of our region is at stake, and negotiations should continue regardless of developments anywhere in the world."
Mr. Allaf said Syria would give "reasonable time" to the Clinton Administration to pursue the peace efforts begun by the Bush Administration in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. But he added, that "three or four months after the arrival of the new President to the White House," if there is no progress toward a comprehensive settlement, "then it will be time to reconsider the whole thing."
But for the shorter range, Mr. Allaf added that he had been authorized by his Government to say that if all the other parties to the talks agree to meet again in Washington, his country would attend. Arab foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Beirut this month to decide whether to accept an offer to resume negotiations in Washington on Dec. 7. Israel has already said it would return to the table.
After the news conference, Mr. Allaf told a reporter that "while it was not within my competence" to predict what other Arab delegations would do, he thought it was "very likely" they would agree to come back to the talks.
Maintaining the appearance of momentum in the talks could be important since there are a number of forces in the Middle East -- from hard-line Arab opposed to talks to hawkish Israelis -- who would use the collapse of the discussions to increase their influence in their governments or movements.
During the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton took a staunchly pro-Israel stand.
In an interview with the French quarterly Politique Internationale that was published on the eve of the election, Mr. Clinton accused President Hafez al-Assad of Syria of "territorial ambitions" and said the "tyranny" he exercises in his own country "should lead us to be more prudent in our relations with him."
In another interview, published in the November-December issue of Middle East Insight magazine, Mr. Clinton said he does "recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital," though he would not move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during the negotiations.
Arab nations have consistently rejected Israel's claim to Jerusalem, and the United States has not recognized the city as Israel's capital.
The comments by the leaders of the four Arab delegations came a day after the end of the latest round of discussions, which saw little progress on the central issues of possible Israel withdrawal from territory conquered during the 1967 war and incursions into southern Lebanon, some form of self-rule for the Palestinians and a cessation of the state of war that has existed between Israel and its Arab neighbors since 1948.
The latest round was also marked by new violence in the region, particularly on Israel's northern border with Lebanon. There, guerrillas from the Party of God, a pro-Iranian organization, fired rockets at Israeli settlements. In response, the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin massed troops on the border, but members of the Israeli Cabinet reportedly persuaded Mr. Rabin not to conduct a strike across the border.
Bush Administration officials insist that while the general perception is that the parties in the negotiations were marking time until the new President takes office, progress, albeit incremental progress, was being made.
Edward P. Djerejian, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, told reporters this week that the most substantial progress was made between Israeli and Jordanian negotiators who were "engaged in in-depth work on key issues" involving water, energy, economic relationships and the environment.
Mr. Djerejian, a former Ambassador to Syria, acknowledged that "much hard work remains on the road ahead."

HEADLINE: NATO and European Warships Blockade Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Both NATO and the Western European Union ordered their warships in the Adriatic today to carry out a full naval blockade on the former Yugoslavia to enforce a United Nations embargo.
The effect of the naval action remained unclear, however, because only a small limited amount of the strategic trade to Serbia and Montenegro covered by United Nations embargoes arrive by sea, diplomats in Rome said. 
 Most shipments of oil and other supplies covered by the sanctions are believed to reach Serbia and Montenegro, which are the only two republics left in what was once Yugoslavia, by road or by barge along the Danube, the diplomats said.
Technically, the measures agreed today will give warships of NATO and the Western European Union the same powers to stop and search merchant shipping as the Western allies used to impose United Nations sanctions against Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis.
 
Seeks to End Bosnia War
 Diplomats in Brussels said North Atlantic Treaty Organization ambassadors in Brussels agreed that the new measures, intended to interdict shipping of banned goods and thereby increase pressure for an end to the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be carried out as soon as possible.
In Rome, foreign and defense ministers of the Western European Union, enlarged today to 10 members with the accession of Greece to the organization, announced that they committed aircraft and naval vessels to insure "strict implementation of the embargo at sea."
At a news conference, Defense Minister Volker Ruhe of Germany said the decisions would permit Western European Union vessels to fire warning shots to halt suspect vessels "but they are not allowed to destroy ships." The same rules of engagement are expected to apply to NATO vessels.
The Western Economic Union, long a moribund organization with only a nominal role in Western Europe's defense during the cold war, has emerged since the fall of Communism as the potential military arm of the European Community. However, its precise role, both in relation to the Community and to NATO, with whom the organization's members largely overlap, remains ill-defined and disputed.
At present, the Western European Union has five warships assigned to patrolling the Adriatic, but until today they were permitted only to question suspicious vessels about their origin and cargo. NATO has seven warships in the region from its Standing Mediterranean Fleet, and the two fleets have shared duties of monitoring shipping to Yugoslavia since July.
The United States guided-missile frigate Halyburton is one of the seven NATO vessels that have been ordered to enforce the embargo. In addition, two Sixth Fleet ships -- the cruiser Wainwright and the amphibious assault ship Guam -- have been taking part in surveillance operations in the Adriatic, but are not part of the NATO operation.
A NATO statement in Brussels said that "all ships entering or leaving the territorial waters of the former Yugoslavia will be halted to inspect and verify their cargo and destination."
Italian officials said the coordinated deployment of warships of NATO and the Western European Union to enforce the new measures would probably begin next Tuesday after officials had worked out details on Monday.
 
Appeal for More Ships
 Defense Minister Salvo Ando of Italy, said, however, that "this new operation will require more resources" and urged West European nations to send more warships to the Adriatic. The Italian official said the existing number of allied warships in the Adriatic was not enough to enforce the embargo. Last week, NATO said the number of its ships would be reduced, but there was no word tonight whether this decision still held.
A further impediment to the new measures is that, of the seven NATO vessels, the German destroyer Hamburg is barred by German government policy from doing more than asking merchant ships to identify themselves and their cargo.
"For German foreign and defense policy, the fact that we cannot participate fully in these operations is unfortunate," Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany told the Rome news conference.
Also in Rome, the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, urged coordination between the two fleets. His presence at the Rome meeting was the first time a NATO Secretary General had attended a high-level Western European Union gathering.
The United States has accused the two Western European members closest to Yugoslavia -- Greece and Italy-- of permitting supplies of fuel to be shippied to Serbia via Montenegro.
A week ago, the American delegate to the United Nations, Edward J. Perkins, publicized a list of companies in Greece, Italy, Egypt and Malta accused of delivering supplies to the former Yugoslavia in violation of United Nations embargoes.
"These are completely unsubstantiated," an Italian official spokesman said of the accusations. "These suspicions have not been substantiated and the same is true for Greece."
Mr. Perkins had said an Italian shipping company had agreed to take 8,000 tons of coke to the Montenegran port of Bar, while a Greek shipping concern had delivered 200,000 tons of petroleum products to the same port since June.

Serbians Launch New Attack
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, (Reuters) -- Serbian forces began a heavy artillery assault on the Bosnian town of Travnik today in an apparent attempt to open a new corridor toward Sarajevo.
A barrage of constant shelling could be heard around nearby Vitez, a major refugee center that is defended by Muslim and Croation fighters.
The offensive was begun as the commander of United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, Gen. Philippe Morillon, met the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, to urge his side to honor a cease-fire.
A Croatian military commander acknowledged two days ago that Serbian forces had broken through the front line near Travnik and had the town, 50 miles northwest of Sarajevo, at their mercy.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE ACCORD;
Excerpts From Joint Statement by U.S. and Europe

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the text of the joint statement issued by the Commission of the European Community and the United States on the completion of their trade negotiations, as transcribed by The Associated Press:
The United States and the Commission of the European Community intend to pursue a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. As a result of our discussions, we believe that we have achieved the progress necessary to assure agreements on the major elements blocking progress in Geneva, notably in agriculture, services and market access. A successful outcome will be a positive factor for the trade and economic growth of the economies of the world. 
 Our negotiators are returning to Geneva to work together to build the comprehensive, global and balanced package we both seek. . . .
In agriculture we have resolved our differences on the main elements concerning domestic support, export subsidies and market access in a manner that should enable the Director General to move the negotiations to a successful conclusion. . . . We are in full accord that an effective agreement on agricultural reform requires the participation of all countries in the negotiations.
The United States and the E.C. Commission agreed how to resolve the oilseeds dispute.
On market access, the United States and the E.C. Commission have found the basis to achieve an ambitious result that meets their respective objectives as follows: detailed negotiations will continue on specific sectors or products in order to make progress towards the completion of a substantial and balanced package. Tariff reductions will be maximized, with as few exceptions as possible, including the substantial reduction of high tariffs, the harmonization of tariffs at very low levels, and the elimination of tariffs in key sectors. . . .
However, participation of third countries -- not only the developing countries, but other industrialized countries -- and elimination of nontariff distortions are considered to be of essential importance, and both parties will continue efforts to achieve maximum results in this regard in Geneva in the coming weeks. . . .
In services, we are in strong agreement that the market-access offers must form an integral part of the ambitious result we seek. We have now agreed to take a common approach on financial services. In addition, we discussed improvements in our respective offers, and have agreed to seek maximum liberalization and minimum exemptions. . . .
We have full expectations that the breakthrough we have achieved will unblock the negotiations and provide new impetus necessary to complete the Round. We encourage our trading partners to return to the negotiating table in Geneva, prepared to show the necessary flexibility to bring these negotiations to a close.
Earlier this year at the Munich Economic Summit, G-7 leaders called for conclusion of the Uruguay Round by the end of the year. Time is short, but negotiators are returning to Geneva confident that substantial progress can be achieved to meet the intent of the G-7 leaders' commitment, provided other countries are prepared to work with us to secure an ambitious and far-reaching result to these important talks.

HEADLINE: Plane Noise Faces Limits From F.A.A.

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration yesterday announced measures intended to better protect residents of the New York region, who live beneath the busiest airspace in the world, from aircraft noise.
The measures, which will affect people from Newburgh, N.Y., to Newark, include shifting aircraft approaches to La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports, making helicopters fly higher over Westchester County and making air traffic controllers more solicitous to residents' eardrums. 
 The changes are not expected to increase delays at area airports, the F.A.A. said.
The steps, some of which have already been put into effect, came after a yearlong review of air-traffic noise within 75 miles of La Guardia Airport. The review, which included 18 public hearings, was mandated by Congress.
 
'This Balancing Act'
 As it issued its findings to Congress yesterday, the aviation agency made it clear that there was only so much it could do.
"The problem is we have 6,000 aircraft that fly in that airspace a day, so you're never going to get rid of air traffic noise, period," said Paul Steucke, a spokesman for the agency. "We're trying to juggle this balancing act of providing the services that everybody needs, and reducing the noise."
Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, said the authority had not yet analyzed the measures. "The only thing I can tell you at this point is that the only Port Authority involvement was providing some data from our flight track noise monitoring system," he said.
 
New Steps to Come
 The major measures that have not yet been put into effect include these:
*Testing to see if planes can be better dispersed as they land and take off from Kennedy and La Guardia Airports so that the same neighborhoods are not always subjected to the noise.
*Charting a new approach into Westchester County Airport that would bring flights in over Long Island Sound.
*Establishing a second instrument landing system at Stewart Airport in Newburgh so that planes can take more than one approach.
*Increasing the amount of noise reduction training for air-traffic controllers.
*Asking pilots flying out of Newark to use their on-board computers to keep a precise heading over the Arthur Kill waterway, to avoid straying over Staten Island.
Two other changes have already been made. Six weeks ago, the aviation administration began amending flight patterns at La Guardia to keep as many planes as possible over Long Island Sound during approach and landing.
Dan Andrews, a spokesman for Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, who has long sought a reduction in air-traffic noise, said that he was surprised to hear of the change, and that he did not think residents had detected a difference.
But, he said, Ms. Shulman was pleased that the F.A.A. was taking steps to disperse aircraft better. The second measure that has been started affected Westchester County. There, helicopter pilots voluntarily began flying 600 feet higher several months ago after a public hearing established that helicopter noise was a major concern.
Joel F. Russell, manager of the Westchester County Airport, said that step had helped reduce noise and that a second planned change, creating a new approach over Long Island Sound, was already in informal use.
 
Quieter Planes Coming
 Mr. Steucke of the Federal agency said that, through noise reduction training, air traffic controllers are reminded of ways to protect residents from noise. For instance, he said, a controller, concerned about guiding the next aircraft, might simply send an outgoing plane over the most obvious route. Instead, Mr. Steucke said, "If he had flown 1.5 minutes longer, he could have been out over water rather than over houses."
The most significant reduction in air traffic noise, Mr. Steucke said, will take place gradually over the next eight years, as the airline industry phases out noisy aircraft in favor of quieter ones, in compliance with Federal regulations.
By the year 2000, he said, the number of people in the region exposed to "significant aviation noise" will decline from about 700,000 to 100,000.
The Port Authority is studying the economic impact of requiring that the quieter planes be phased in faster, said Lloyd Schwalb, a Port Authority spokesman.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Point Man on Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
From among a welter of advisers, a noneconomist -- Robert B. Reich of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government -- is emerging as one who has President-elect Bill Clinton's ear on economic policy.
The two are struggling with ideas that appear to go well beyond the market-oriented economics that became standard in the Reagan and Bush years. 
 After little more than a week as chief of the team preparing a menu of economic actions for the President-elect to choose from, Mr. Reich is the only economic adviser with daily access to Mr. Clinton, people in the Clinton camp say. Mr. Reich has worked with the President-elect in Little Rock, Ark., since last weekend and traveled with him to Washington on Wednesday.
Mr. Reich says that he and Mr. Clinton have engaged in a running discussion about economic policies and politics since their days together as Rhodes Scholars at Oxford and classmates at Yale Law School. The President-elect has read Mr. Reich's books and articles. Mr. Reich's key role in Mr. Clinton's thinking is likely to continue, the President-elect's advisers say, even if Mr. Reich returns to Harvard in January, as he says he will do.
 
Candidate to Head Council
 But Mr. Reich has been mentioned as a candidate for chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, which under Mr. Reich would undoubtedly take on a bigger role in a Clinton Administration, similar in stature to what it was when Walter Heller was chairman under President John F. Kennedy and Kennedy's most trusted economic adviser.
Mr. Reich's new position and his ties to Mr. Clinton clearly suggest that the President-elect is already relying on Mr. Reich as his chief thinker on economics. "He wanted someone he could trust and who could mediate among a wide array of advisers," Mr. Reich said of the President-elect.
Inevitably, Mr. Reich's priorities seem likely to appear in the brokerage process, and those priorities have begun to take Mr. Clinton in a different economic direction from that of the Reagan and Bush years.
In the Reich scheme of things, evident in Mr. Clinton's campaign literature and now in the post-election planning, interest rates, for example, cannot be separated from education or job training, highway repair from product prices, taxes from trade policy, or Government-financed research from Corporate America's competitiveness.
The Reagan and Bush Administrations, in contrast, concentrated on taxes, interest rates, the budget deficit, the unemployment rate and inflation -- the standard themes of America's mainstream economists. The hope was that if economic policy could get these elements right, then the private sector would boom and take care of all the other issues.
"Certainly for the last 12 years, the message has been only for the Government to get out of the way, and here is a message that now says it should get involved," said Robert Z. Lawrence, a Harvard economist. "Reich represents that approach as well as anyone in the country."
Some economists point out that Mr. Reich is not alone in developing a broader economic menu, though he is Mr. Clinton's main representative in the process and his frequent appearances as a television talk-show guest have popularized his economics. "I think that we have been crossing an intellectual watershed in economic policy, away from a belief in the magic of the marketplace toward a belief that markets are very good but not perfect things and they sometimes need a little help from Government," said Paul Krugman, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Mr. Reich's contribution to this process is most evident in his book "The Work of Nations," published in 1991. It argues, in effect, that for the United States to prosper, it must become a center for the most advanced production. Companies, both foreign and American, will locate such operations here only if the nation offers components like highly educated people, advanced technology and much-upgraded transportation and communications systems -- all projects that require a government role.
Although the general approach of Mr. Reich is increasingly shared by others, his specific work has nevertheless been criticized by trained economists, mostly on the ground that he is a lawyer, not a Ph.D. in economics, and his insights lack the rigor and precision that economists provide through their training in mathematics and economic theory.
That criticism has been one reason that Mr. Reich, who is on leave from Harvard, has failed to get a tenured professorship at the Kennedy School, where he has been a lecturer in political economy for more than a decade, under a contract renewed every few years. In the last year, the school offered Mr. Reich a lifetime contract as a lecturer, no longer subject to faculty review. Mr. Reich has not yet responded to the offer, which falls short of full tenure.
"We would be delighted to have him stay until he retires," said Albert Carnesale, dean of the Kennedy School.
Still, the criticism of Mr. Reich's credentials in economics has intensified with his appointment last week as chief of the economics transition team. He has countered by declaring that he is seeking advice from numerous trained economists and is relying in particular on Lawrence Summers, who began a leave of absence on Thursday as chief economist at the World Bank to join Mr. Reich.
"All of us hold Larry Summers in high regard, and he will be very important," said Gene Sperling, who was Mr. Clinton's economic coordinator in the Presidential campaign and is now Mr. Reich's deputy. And from Robert Hall, a Stanford University professor and often a spokesman for university economists, came this expression of relief: "Reich is an enigma to economists, and I am glad Larry Summers is there. I have a great deal of confidence in Larry."
 
Skepticism On Wall Street
 Mr. Reich is also criticized on Wall Street. Any policy that seems to get away from inflation or the threat of it as the main economic issue tends to make the nation's security markets nervous, and Mr. Reich, for this reason, is not a favorite on Wall Street.
"I was surprised at his appointment," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment firm. "My own sense was that Mr. Clinton would make a real effort in the transition to broaden his base. And he is not going to get that with Reich."
In an interview, Mr. Reich, 46 years old, offered an example of the questions his team is trying to answer for Mr. Clinton. The President-elect's infrastructure program includes as one possibility a new national fiber-optics telecommunications network. Would private industry undertake the project if the Clinton Administration "unknotted" regulations that companies consider costly obstacles?
If not, what is the minimum the Government must spend to get the network started in 1993 or 1994? Would a fiber-optic network have a greater multiplier effect -- create more jobs and more economic growth -- than highway repair or a high-speed rail system? Each of these options will be subject to the sort of technical analysis that Mr. Summers represents. And under Mr. Reich's direction, similar alternatives and answers are to be developed in other fields, like labor, education, health insurance and trade policy.
Despite the criticisms of Mr. Reich heard in the economics establishment, there are those within it who stand up for him.
"I have had to do a lot of defending of Bob Reich to my professional colleagues in the last few months, and one thing I have said is that the Reich of 1992 is not the Reich of 1982, who stood much more for an industrial policy in which cutting-edge industries were targeted for special government help," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a sometime adviser to the Clinton camp. "My defense is greeted with different degrees of skepticism."

HEADLINE: Experience Required, but Not Too Much of It;
For Job Applicants 55 and Over, the Search for Employment Is Often Frustrating

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Thomas McGovern walked into the job fair in midtown Manhattan clutching his glossy leather briefcase and chasing a dream he had deferred for decades. Since he sold his liquor business two years ago, he has been searching for a job as a paralegal, to get a start in the profession he was too poor to join as a young man with family obligations.
Now, at the age of 63, after about a hundred unsuccessful applications, he wonders if he waited too long. 
 "I don't know if it's because of age," Mr. McGovern said. "They haven't said anything, but you always get a feeling, the way the interview goes."
The special disadvantages -- and, they would hasten to add, the considerable advantages -- of being an aging job applicant were very much on the minds of Mr. McGovern and more than 900 others who attended the job fair for people 55 and older, held at the Roosevelt Hotel this week. They were not frisky college graduates: Some had white hair, canes and a need every now and then to sit and rest. But they also had decades of experience and a finely honed work ethic.
Economists say that the corporate restructuring that took place in the New York City region during the 1980's, which has accelerated during the current recession, has particularly affected aging workers. Traditionally such workers have held onto their jobs, even in tough times, because of seniority.
But as companies restructured to cut costs and compete better, they began thinning out the ranks of middle managers.
"Middle management tends to be middle aged and older," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "So the shifts in corporate structure have hit particularly hard at men in the middle ages and older."
Once out of a job, older people have a harder time finding a new one. "There's still a lot of prejudice against older people," said Patricia A. Dorin, coordinator of the New York State Department of Labor's Older Worker Program. Almost 500,000 of the city's workers are 55 or older.
Unemployment among people 55 and older in New York City remains lower than it is among all workers. But it has risen in recent years. Although unemployment overall in New York City declined by 4.4 percent, to 8.6 percent, between 1981 and 1991, it jumped by 61 percent in the older group, to 6.3 percent, according to Mr. Ehrenhalt.
Nationally, unemployment also rose among people 55 and older, though less markedly -- from 3.6 percent in 1981 to 3.9 percent in 1991. In October, it stood at 5 percent, compared with 7.4 percent for the population as a whole.
Robert Rheinstein, who is 63 and was laid off as a construction company project manager, did not express his loss in macroeconomic terms.
"I got satisfaction out of work and enjoyed the challenge and personal relation that went with it, and I'm not ready to give that up," he said. Plus, he said, "I need the money."
He came to the job fair seeking "work which is challenging, responsible and that can use my 40 years of experience." But he had held only two different jobs during those 40 years, he said, and he didn't really know how to find a new one.
Even for people who voluntarily leave the work force, retirement can be a disappointment. "If you're just going to sit down and suck your thumb, you might as well give up and take a cyanide pill," said Thomas Sheehan, 64, a former executive in an automotive-leasing company who, after a heart attack and two strokes, came to the fair leaning on a cane.
Since the work force is expected to shrink as the baby boomers age, pushing people to retire by age 65 seems not only unfair but economically wrong headed, some economists and advocates for the elderly said.
"We have a whole set of institutional assumptions about age and retirement that date back a half century," said Mr. Ehrenhalt, who is 67.
Some, of course, cannot afford to retire. Olympia Kitchen, who is 78, quit her job as a computer programmer in Tallahassee, Fla., in 1981 and moved to New York City to take care of her ailing mother. Her mother lingered nine years, exhausting Ms. Kitchen's savings. Her rent consumes most of her Social Security.
She came to the job fair wearing her "corporate outfit" -- pinstripe suit, grey blouse, red cloth rose peeking out of her breast pocket -- but she was not aiming high.
"To survive, to meet my expenses, I have to work, so I don't become homeless, so I don't get put on welfare," she said, beginning to cry. "I'll do anything -- I'll sell apples on the street corner. I have damn good experience, and this is what it's resolved to."
Case studies released last year by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research foundation, found that, contrary to stereotypes, older workers learned to use computers as quickly as younger ones, stayed on the job longer and took fewer sick days. Employers at the job fair said those were the sorts of benefits they hoped to cash in on.
"They know what to expect," said Leslie Julich, senior human-resources specialist for Empire Insurance Company. "You're not going to be in love with your boss, you're not going to be best friends with everyone you work with."
The only problem older applicants posed for her, she said, cropped up in the interviews. "A lot of times they treat me as if I'm their daughter," said Ms. Julich, who is 30. "That respect thing sort of goes out the window."
For the most part, people were not hired at the job fair. Instead, they had the chance to drop off their often lengthy resumes with 35 different employers, from the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell to the Ford Foundation. In addition, the New York City Department for the Aging, which sponsored the fair, offered seminars on polishing a resume and other marketing techniques.
The backgrounds of those who attended the fair ranged widely, but the ambitions of most did not seem grandiose. Jin Zhenduo, a 61-year-old Chinese immigrant who was a chemical engineer in his native country, came to the fair hoping to find work as a handyman or an elevator operator. Phyllis Black, 57, who has been trained in a computer class run by the Department for the Aging, said she would "love to do anything with computers."
"I don't want to set the world on fire," she said. "I just want to do a good, competent job."
Some, like Jagen Gulati, were looking to stick with a career they already knew. Mr. Gulati, 65, was a legal secretary in India before immigrating to the United States in 1991. He carried photocopies of his Bachelor of Arts degree from an Indian university, said he could type 75 words per minute and take down 125 in shorthand and, like several others at the fair, asked a reporter if he might have a job for him. "I am very proficient in my work; I've worked all my life," he said.
He said that he suspects his age is stopping employers from hiring him. "I am feeling very bad; in a country where opportunity is advertised, there is nothing," he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Policy Left Unchanged

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
A divided Federal Reserve policy-making panel decided at an Oct. 6 meeting to leave monetary policy unchanged, although it leaned toward lower interest rates if the economy showed signs of ebbing, according to minutes released today.
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee reviewed information suggesting that "economic activity was expanding at a subdued pace," the minutes of the meeting said. 
 But they "generally agreed that current uncertainties made an assessment of the economic outlook and determination of an appropriate course for monetary policy particularly difficult," the minutes said.
Because of the uncertainty, the panel, by an 8-to-4 vote, said it supported a directive that left monetary policy unchanged but "included a decided presumption of some easing" if the economy did not improve.
The Fed has not acted to lower interest rates since the meeting. The central bank may have been influenced in October by the approach of the elections on Nov. 3. Many analysts had said any action by the Fed before the elections would have had political implications.
The Open Market Committee met again this week, but its meetings are closed to the public. Minutes of this week's meeting will not be released until late December.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The Economy;
Aides Say Clinton Might Back Deficit Spending as Growth Stimulus

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 20

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton might favor increasing the budget deficit in this fiscal year to stimulate the economy and generate new jobs quickly, members of his staff said today.
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, told reporters that the President-elect and Congressional leaders had agreed during Mr. Clinton's visit to Washington this week on a two-pronged approach: an economic stimulus, like new public works spending, to give an immediate jolt to the economy combined with deficit reduction "over the long haul." 
 Mr. Stephanopoulos and others on the transition staff said no decisions had been made about how to achieve those two goals or whether increasing the short-term deficit would be wise. They suggested that to help the economy this winter the new Administration could take some quick steps that would not affect the annual deficit. One such step would be to speed the spending of highway construction money that is now scheduled to be spent later in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
 
Few Tools Available
 In the past, such modest measures have proved to have little effect on the economy. As an economic rule, the only tools Mr. Clinton and lawmakers will have to spur growth quickly and induce a sudden surge of new jobs will be overall tax cuts and spending increases that would raise the deficit in this fiscal year.
When pressed, Mr. Stephanopoulos acknowledged that Mr. Clinton had not ruled out an increase in this year's deficit. But he said Mr. Clinton was determined to fulfill his campaign promise to halve the annual deficit, now nearly $300 billion, by the end of his four-year term.
Mr. Clinton arrived here in a downpour early this morning after spending two days in Washington meeting with President Bush, Congressional leaders and other officials and attending social functions in the evenings.
The President-elect made no public appearances today and plans none for the weekend. On Monday, he is flying to Georgia to campaign for Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., the Democrat in a run-off election on Tuesday.
 
Going Over the Cabinet
 Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr. Clinton met today with Warren M. Christopher, the transition director, "to go through Cabinet departments one by one and look at memorandums."
Mr. Clinton's economic advisers continued to review the state of the budget and to prepare a strategy for dealing with the economy immediately on taking office.
In theory, Mr. Clinton and Congress could lock themselves into procedures that guaranteed deficit reduction, say, in 1994 and 1995, while allowing the deficit to rise in 1993.
But in practice, previous attempts to legislate deficit reduction years down the road, no matter how well intentioned, have proved futile. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings laws of 1985 and 1987 set five-year deficit ceilings that seemed plausible when they were enacted but were quickly breached.
Similarly, the deficit has continued to rise yearly despite rigid controls enacted in the budget law two years ago.
If Mr. Clinton does allow the deficit to rise in this fiscal year and if the markets doubt that his long-term plan to lower the deficit will work, then interest rates are likely to rise. Higher interest rates would inhibit business activity, and that could offset the President's efforts to create jobs.
Mr. Clinton's capacity to reduce the deficit would be seriously hampered if he sticks by his campaign pledge to give tax cuts to families with incomes below about $80,000 a year, but Mr. Stephanopoulos said the promise had not been abandoned.
"Governor Clinton said throughout the campaign that it was his plan to put people first, and he intended to propose a middle-class tax cut, and there's nothing to change," the spokesman told reporters.
On another matter, Mr. Stephanopoulos said that Mr. Clinton, like his recent predecessors, would accept private donations to help finance the transition. Under a 1964 law, Mr. Clinton is entitled to $3.5 million to cover transition expenses, but in the last several transitions that amount has proved insufficient.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said a limit would be placed on how much donors could contribute.

HEADLINE: Freeing Drivers From the Ghost of Gridlock Past

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
As surely as snow will fall in Buffalo and squirrels will hide nuts, November brings signs of what every New Yorker fondly knows as the Holidays. A Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. Menorahs in store windows. Gridlock alert days.
Alas for the harried commuter: one of these is no longer. (Hint: the tree is up and no embargo has been declared on menorahs.) 
 Yes, the end-of-the-year gridlock alert day, a New York holiday fixture for a decade, has been discontinued, a victim of the recession and its own effectiveness.
The city Department of Transportation says traffic has declined enough in recent years to make public announcements urging motorists to stay out of Manhattan unnecessary.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know the traffic is heavy" during the holidays, said Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. "People aren't flying at radar speed, but traffic is moving."
Created in 1982, gridlock alert days grew as Manhattan traffic became increasingly congested in the booming economy. By last year, there were 14 gridlock alert days, 9 of which fell between mid-November and the New Year. By city tradition, yesterday was the first of the holiday season. Over the years, officials have noticed a significant increase in traffic on the Friday before Thanksgiving.
But in the last two years, as jobs have been lost, traffic has declined by 2 percent, Mr. DePlasco said. Holiday traffic, usually 10 percent heavier than the daily average of 870,000 cars, is down even more, he said.
Gridlock alerts will not vanish completely: the city will issue a warning for Dec. 2, when the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is lighted. It will continue to issue warnings for special events, like visits by the President.
Yesterday, there was both praise and criticism for the demise of a holiday tradition.
For the owners of parking garages and midtown Manhattan businesses, the annual traffic warnings meant their most car-dependent customers would be driven away. They were delighted to see gridlock alert go.
"In parking garages, business was down 30 percent on gridlock alert days," said Hugh M. Heller, general counsel to the Metropolitan Garage Owners Association, which has been lobbying for an end to the public announcements for six years. "Instead of relatively fewer people, nobody came in. I would always drive on gridlock alert days."
But some fans of gridlock alert, dubbed "traffic mavens" by the Department of Transportation, asked whether the city let itself be swayed by business interests to the detriment of environmental concerns.
"Traffic levels may have flattened out, but that just means we are frozen at record levels," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for mass transit. "I'll be sorry to see them go. They had a certain New York quality to them."
Samuel I. Schwartz, who helped initiate gridlock alerts in 1982 while he was Deputy Commissioner of Transportation, said he plans to continue issuing the holiday warnings in his traffic column in The Daily News.
"Traffic did go down on gridlock alert days," Mr. Schwartz said. "But we weren't creating a ghost town in midtown Manhattan. People were switching to mass transit. And that is a good goal."
Mr. DePlasco said the city was "conscious of the recession" when it decided to discontinue the holiday traffic alerts. "But there was nothing conspiratorial about it," he said.
So, was midtown traffic any worse yesterday in the absence of a gridlock alert? No, said parking lot managers. Yes, said drivers.
"Every day is gridlock to me," said Ron Roth, an insurance broker from Manhattan as he sat in a line outside a West 46th Street parking garage. "People don't drive in Manhattan because they want to, they drive because they have to."

HEADLINE: Unhappy Accord in Trenton on Health Care for Indigent

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Ending weeks of frequently strained negotiations, Gov. Jim Florio and the Republican leaders in the Legislature today announced a plan to divert $1.6 billion from the state's unemployment insurance fund to restore New Jersey's outlawed system for financing health care for indigent patients.
The plan, under attack from labor and business groups alike and called "inadvisable" by the Federal Department of Labor, now goes before both houses of the Legislature for a vote on Nov. 30. The outcome has grown increasingly uncertain. 
 Conceding that the plan "may not be anyone's first choice," Mr. Florio said that he "cannot let the entire health-care system in this state collapse," and therefore would sign the legislation if it reached his desk unless a workable alternative was presented within 10 days.
In a separate statement, the Republican leaders, Senate President Donald T. DiFranceso and Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, said, "Shifting money earmarked for the unemployed from the compensation fund to a hospital fund that pays bills for the unemployed and working poor is an appropriate use."
 
Hospital Rates Deregulated
 The plan agreed upon today would create a new health-care tax while lowering unemployment taxes by the same amount, and its supporters say it would raise $1.6 billion over three years. If the unemployment fund, now at $2.4 billion, drops below $1.5 billion, the unemployment tax on employers will increase by six-tenths of 1 percent of their total payrolls.
The plan would deregulate hospital rates and impose limits on hospital revenues, requiring all but urban and teaching hospitals to absorb into their basic rates the costs of bad debts and charity care.
The plan drew wide criticism. "It is not popular with the business people; it is not popular with labor," said Bruce Coe, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a lobbying group. "They have come up with the only thing politically they can do at this time."
Mr. Coe's group initially objected to some parts of the plan, but he left today's meeting supporting the idea after officials said they would impose a three-year limit on the use of the unemployment fund.
 
10 Days Before Deadline
 The compromise came just 10 days before the Nov. 30 deadline Mr. Florio, a Democrat, and the Republican leaders had imposed on themselves for approving a new plan to deal with the health-care crisis.
There are 823,000 indigent people without health insurance in New Jersey. Their hospital bills have been paid through a 19.1 percent surcharge on the hospital bills of insured patients. But the system, known as the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund, was thrown into chaos in May when Judge Alfred M. Wolin of Federal District Court in Newark, acting on a lawsuit brought by 14 unions, barred the state from imposing the surcharge on self-insured groups. Those groups account for 40 percent of all insured patients.
People covered by Medicare, who account for another 40 percent of insured patients, were not required to pay the surcharge. That meant that the remaining 20 percent of insured patients, most of them individual policyholders, would have to pay about $900 million this year for indigent patient care.
Mr. Florio, Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Haytaian announced the compromise after a two-hour meeting with labor and business leaders that one of the non-governmental officials involved described as "highly intense."
 
Foes Equally Unhappy
 James Kirk, vice president of the State A.F.L.-C.I.O., left the meeting stony-faced and visibly angry.
"Labor is not happy with the compromise," said Mr. Kirk, who was joined in his criticism by William R. Healey, an assistant vice president of the State Chamber of Commerce.
"We are together on some things, and this is one of them," said Mr. Healey. "We felt a sales tax would be the fairest possible way."
The chamber had enthusiastically backed the Republicans in June when they overrode a gubernatorial veto and rolled the sales tax back from 7 percent to 6 percent. "But the Wolin decision came about a week later," Mr. Wolin added.
New Jersey is one of only three states -- the others are Pennsylvania and Alaska -- in which employees as well as employers contribute to the unemployment insurance fund.
 
Least Onerous Solution
 The idea of tapping into the fund has been seen as the least onerous of several solutions the Governor and legislative leaders have considered since Judge Wolin invalidated the 12-year-old health care system. But the compromise plan has an uncertain chance of success.
The idea that two of the state's most powerful lobbying groups, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Chamber of Commerce, are aligned against the bill is enough to give some legislators pause. Even more troubling to lawmakers is a concern that the plan could imperil the unemployment insurance fund.
The $2.4 billion unemployment insurance fund is the second biggest in the country, after California's, according to the Federal Department of Labor. But it is ranked 33d in its reserves after paying claims, according to a Labor Department formula, and a bipartisan state commission recommended in 1988 that the fund be increased to $3.7 billion.

HEADLINE: A Trade War Averted

 BODY:
The trade deal reached yesterday by the U.S. and the European Community ends a bitter six-year dispute over European farm subsidies. The agreement not only averts a ruinous trade war, but also unleashes the all-important international trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, that were stalled by the farm dispute. Yesterday's settlement will benefit consumers around the world.
Though details are sketchy, the agreement appears to be a reasonable compromise. Neither France, the most recalcitrant of the European nations, nor the U.S. got everything it wanted, but each got something important. 
 The French largely prevailed on soybeans, whose subsidized production by the Europeans violated previous trade commitments with the U.S. Soybean acreage will be limited, but not soybean production, an approach the U.S. fears won't produce sufficiently large cutbacks.
But disputes will be settled by binding arbitration -- a mechanism the U.S. had sought but the E.C. had refused to accept. And on grain production, the U.S. won substantial cutbacks in subsidized E.C. exports, providing ample relief for beleaguered American farmers.
The agreement represents a major achievement for the Bush Administration in its waning days. The Administration gambled by imposing stiff tariffs on selected E.C. exports, including white wine, in retaliation for Europe's refusal to live by its commitments on soybean production.
That introduced the very real danger that the European Community might retaliate with its own tariffs on U.S. exports -- igniting a trade war that could devastate economies already on the brink of recession.
With yesterday's agreement, however, the danger is over. Now Mr. Bush can move swiftly to settle the Uruguay Round negotiations. That would strip away protectionist barriers in all 108 of the world's trading partners, generate $200 billion of new international trade -- and provide a glorious end to Mr. Bush's reign.

HEADLINE: Veto the Chiropractors' Power Play

 BODY:
Score one for the special-interest lobbyists. The New York State Legislature has sent to Gov. Mario Cuomo a bill that would require group health insurance policies to include unlimited chiropractic services. The bill has everything to do with the lobbying power of the American Chiropractic Association -- and nothing to do with proper health care. It deserves a swift veto.
Recent studies in Britain and the U.S. show that chiropractic care for some types of lower back and other musculoskeletal pain is cost-effective, but that other services are not demonstrably better than a placebo. Currently, insurers can let customers decide which, if any, chiropractic services they want covered. But if the Legislature gets its way, everyone in a group plan will be forced to pay for the entire range of chiropractic services. 
 The bill would add an estimated $160 million a year to premiums of Blue Cross and Blue Shield subscribers. It would drive up health care costs, at a time when those skyrocketing costs are already the number one domestic financial crisis. By adding to insurance costs the bill would drive some employers to drop group insurance, leaving families vulnerable to financial disaster from the next medical catastrophe.
The bill should make chiropractors deliriously happy. Once workers are covered for an unlimited range of services, they can be expected to start using them. And even though employers pay the premiums, they take the extra costs out of each worker's paycheck.
This bill reeks of special pleading. Governor Cuomo: Show no mercy.

HEADLINE: Rooting for Russian Reform

 BODY:
Soaring inflation and plunging production have provided opponents of reform in Russia with plenty of ammunition with which to attack President Boris Yeltsin and his reformist allies at the upcoming Congress of People's Deputies. But don't count Mr. Yeltsin out yet. He is allying with reform-minded industrial managers in an effort to beat back the hard-liners.
Last weekend he lashed out at "scandalous" opposition groups backed by "practically no social base, and not many ideas" who "seek to sow panic, to destroy reforms, to wring from that some political capital." That was a bold rebuff to the hard-liners. But it was also a caution to the industrial managers not to demand too high a price from him for their support. 
 If Mr. Yeltsin succeeds, he could keep market reforms from being destroyed by hyperinflation. And he could keep the checks and balances of crude democracy from being overwhelmed by resurgent authoritarianism.
The 1,000-member People's Congress convenes on Dec. 1. Like the Parliament, its deputies were chosen before last year's abortive coup and the breakup of the Soviet Union, even before Mr. Yeltsin was elected President. The Congress is packed with former party hacks, who have joined with nationalists to form the National Salvation Front in opposition to Mr. Yeltsin.
President Yeltsin tried to keep Parliament from convening the Congress, but failed. And he hasn't dared to dissolve it and call for new elections. Instead he's been enacting reforms by decree, which Parliament has criticized but not overruled. His authority to issue such decrees lapses the day the Congress convenes.
Despite the talk of coups, the real danger is a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's Government, which would be tantamount to repudiation of reform.
The reform-minded industrialists may settle for less drastic personnel changes. But they also need to give up easy money policies. Such policies may be keeping many state-owned factories afloat for now, but could generate hyperinflation that would force a shutdown of production.
Mr. Yeltsin's coalition with the industrialists won't keep the Congress from trying to throw more sand in the gears of reform. But it could keep the reform process from grinding to a halt. Americans, lacking leverage, can do little more in this winter of Russian discontent than root for reform.

HEADLINE: Reform Defense Now

BYLINE: By Gary Hart; Gary Hart, a Democrat and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1975 to 1987, is co-author of "America Can Win: The Case for Military Reform."

DATELINE: KITTREDGE, Colo.

 BODY:
If war, to paraphrase Clausewitz, is the continuation of national policy by other means, then the triumph of democracy in the cold war without bloodshed must rank as one of history's greatest military victories. The question now is what to do with our military. There are three options: our military structures can be maintained, they can be reduced or they can be reformed. The Clinton Administration should choose reform.
This option sounds easier than it is. No modern nation has reformed its military without a major military defeat. The military is a disciplined, well-entrenched bureaucracy with enormous economic and industrial power. George Bush's promise of new contracts for F-15's and F-16's for foreign sales and Bill Clinton's support for those sales along with his commitment to the Seawolf submarine and the V-22 Osprey -- none of which are necessary for our future security -- testify to the military's power. 
 To complicate matters further, defenders of the military cite the success of the Persian Gulf war as evidence that the armed forces don't need reform. But if victory is defined by the achievement of the strategic objective -- the removal of Saddam Hussein -- then Desert Storm cannot be considered a major victory.
The military must be reformed to prepare the U.S. for the post-cold-war world. The Clinton Administration has an opportunity to carry out these reforms. Indeed, given fiscal realities, it may have little choice.
Reformers believe that our national security priorities are people, then strategy, tactics and doctrine, and, finally, weapons. People win wars, weapons don't. This truth was lost or misplaced in the cold war because of the intense political hypnosis such high-tech weapons as Aegis cruisers and "smart" bombs produced. This mismatch of technology to threat is illustrated by our use of F-117 stealth aircraft in the Panama invasion.
Military educational institutions -- from West Point to the National War College -- must learn to stress military history and theory instead of engineering, math and rote learning. Annapolis requires only one semester of military history for graduation. West Point requires two.
Contrary to present practice, officers must be promoted on the basis of leadership in combat and in the field and for their willingness to innovate under pressure. Right now, it's easier for officers to get ahead by carrying out routine staff assignments.
Moreover, enlisted personnel switch companies too often. These high troop rotations should be replaced with a type of regimental system, which would keep servicemen and women in one place long enough to develop esprit and comradeship. Currently, our turnover rate of 25 percent per quarter in an infantry company is one of the highest rotation rates of any military power in the world.
The best personnel must have the best military doctrines. Maneuver warfare, with its emphasis on initiative by local commanders, decentralized command, mobility and goal orientation, must replace the traditional attrition doctrines that emphasize trading men and materiel with the enemy. Our strategies must also take advantage of our natural maritime circumstances. We are an island nation, but our forces are structured as if we were a land power.
Even if people and doctrines are reformed, we are still stuck with weapons designed for a confrontation with the former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. We have a huge Air Force and giant ships, as well as tanks and other land weapons designed to fight a war in Central Europe.
The threat of the future is in regional and local conflicts (possibly nuclear), guerrilla insurgencies and terrorist operations. Thus, we need versatile weapons that will work on the varied battlefields of the future. Our Navy should be expanded to include a coastal fleet of amphibious ships, minesweepers and small diesel-powered submarines. We can increase our flexibility on land with light-armored vehicles and aircraft, such as the A-10, that are designed for low-altitude bombing and strafing.
Even before the cold war's close, our armed forces were in desperate need of reform. Now, Bill Clinton has a historic chance to carry out major military reforms without bloodshed or political recrimination.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE ACCORD: EUROPEANS AGREE WITH U.S. ON CUTTING FARM SUBSIDIES;
FRENCH WITHHOLD SUPPORT;
2 SIDES COMPROMISE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
After six tortuous years of confrontation, the United States and the European Community found a compromise today on how to reduce farm subsidies, clearing the way for broader world trade talks to proceed.
 In France, which has been uncompromising in its opposition to American demands, Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson quickly said he could not accept the deal. But he stopped short of saying his country would invoke its right under community rules to veto the agreement. 
The Bush Administration, which is eager to see the trade talks progress, sought to play down the likelihood of a French veto. Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan said tonight that he had been assured by Europe's negotiators that the French objections would not derail the deal.
 
French Vow to Protest
 France is the community's largest producer and exporter of food, and its farmers, a potent political force, have vowed to organize demonstrations against the deal across the length and breadth of the country.
 But Mr. Madigan, in his optimistic appraisal, noted that the European Commission, the executive branch of the community, had endorsed the agreement today. The commission is headed by Jacques Delors, who is expected to run for president of France in 1994 and who has been accused in recent weeks by some Europeans of undercutting trade negotiations to advance France's cause.
 Today's compromise calls for deep cuts in the European Community's subsidized grain exports and subsidized production of soybeans and other oilseed crops. It averts a trade war that would have started with punitive American taxes on European white wine, and might have spread to many other products.
 
Imperiled Global Talks
 Facing a Dec. 5 deadline, when the American import taxes of 200 percent would have taken effect, both sides blinked. The United States accepted far more modest subsidy restraints than it had initially sought, and the Europeans agreed to across-the-board limits on farm subsidies, which they had refused to consider for more than two decades.
 The imposition of sanctions would have killed the prospects for broader world trade talks, which began six years ago in Uruguay and have tried to stitch the world's economies more closely together by eliminating barriers to trade in corn, wheat and a broad range of goods and financial and telecommunications services.
 But the progress announced today does not assure that these broader negotiations will be successfully concluded.
 Among the remaining obstacles are disputes between the United States and the European Community over shipping and television programs, Japan's refusal to drop its ban on rice imports, and the reluctance of poor countries to allow entry to banks and other financial institutions from wealthier countries.
 The announcement of the compromise on farm supports was made almost simultaneously in Brussels, by Frans Andriessen, the community's Minister of External Affairs, and at the White House by President Bush. It represents a poignant achievement for Mr. Bush, coming 17 days after his re-election defeat and a day after the death of his mother.
 Three months ago, Mr. Bush announced the completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement, which would eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico. The two accords, if eventually confirmed by all parties, would lay the foundation for the most sweeping change in world trade rules since President Harry S. Truman oversaw the establishment of the current system after World War II.
 President-elect Bill Clinton and most Congressional leaders said today that they would have to study the details of the arrangement before they could endorse or condemn it. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the broadest American farm group, criticized the provision that limits European subsidies on oilseeds, which are used to make vegetable oils and animal feed, while giving lukewarm praise to the compromise on grain exports.
 The politically powerful American Soybean Association strongly criticized the agreement, saying it accepted European oilseed production "above any position supported or endorsed by any U.S. farm group."
 But Gary P. Riedel, the association's chairman, predicted that his group, which is based in St. Louis, would eventually support the pact.
 
Action Shifts to Geneva
 The deal annnounced today included a binding agreement on production of oilseeds and a separate, draft agreement with many provisions on broad farm subsidy issues.
 The next step is for trade officials from the United States, the 12 nations of the European Community and 92 other countries to descend on the GATT headquarters in Geneva and begin trying to pound out the details of the overall pact.
 The draft agreement, which calls for a 21 percent reduction in the international tonnage of subsidized grain exports, now goes to Geneva. The United States and the community hope it will be adopted as the main text of the agricultural section of the overall GATT agreement.
 The pace of the approval process is important. In March, 18-year-old American legislation will expire that has allowed Presidents to negotiate trade agreements and submit them for consideration by Congress with no amendments permitted.
 But while the United States has been eager to press ahead, France has been reluctant to draft an overall agreement before its general elections in March.
 And some European officials have been nervous that the Clinton Administration might not seek a renewal of this "fast track" legislation, or might carry through on campaign promises to pursue a more confrontational approach on trade.
 During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton expressed support for the broad goals of liberalizing world trade, but also said he believed the United States should take strong action against nations whose trade barriers block American exports.
 With so much at stake and so many competing national interests, it is far from clear whether the many remaining obstacles to an overall deal can be cleared away before President Bush leaves office. If a deal is reached after that point, Mr. Clinton would have to decide whether to support it or seek renegotiation.
 Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has feared that if a world trade agreement and the North American pact go to Congress at the same time, lawmakers will have the opportunity to be free traders on one but vote onbehalf of local protectionist interests on the other. A North Carolina representative, for example, might vote for the North American agreement, which textile interests support, but against a GATT agreement, because it would expose textile companies that are currently protected to open competition from India and other poor countries.
 Even if compromises can be reached quickly in Geneva on the outstanding disputes, the necessary legal language will take at least two more months to draft.
 Before today's agreement, professions of optimism have alternated for months, even years, with unsuccessful negotiations on liberalizing world trade. At three different economic summit meetings of heads of state, and at innumerable meetings of trade officials, talks started, sputtered and ended in deadlock. Other trans-Atlantic pacts, such as one earlier this year on aircraft production subsidies, have fallen apart after they were announced and had to be stitched back together.
 In the end, the United States, which began by calling for an end to all farm subsidies, made significant concessions today on oilseeds in order to strike a better deal on grain-export subsidies and other issues.
 The United States had sought a European promise to reduce oilseed production to 8 million metric tons, from 12.8 million tons last year. But American officials settled for a European commitment to reduce the acreage reserved for oilseeds by 15 percent next year and by at least 10 percent permanently.
 Mr. Madigan said that provision -- combined with changes last year in the structure of European subsidies that discourage producing a lot of food on each acre -- would cut output to 8.5 million to 9.7 million tons. But European yields per acre this year, after the change in the structure of subsidies, suggest that actual production may be at the high end of this range.
 On grain, the United States had been seeking a 24 percent reduction over six years in the tonnage of European subsidized exports, while the European Community had advocated a reduction of only 18 percent. The final figure of 21 percent over six years appeared to split the difference, and was presented as such by Mr. Madigan.
 But the final deal also used a new system for calculating the reduction, making it the equivalent of 23 percent in terms of the previous offers.
 The effects of today's agreement in the United States will vary by region. South of an east-west line that runs through Indianapolis and Springfield, Ill., soybeans are commonly planted in early summer after the harvest of spring wheat. So the same farmers who lose from the soybean concessions will tend to gain from the arrangement on grain-export subsidies.
 North of that line, the summer is usually short for two crops and farmers usually have a choice of planting corn, which will benefit from the agreement, or planting soybeans.
 The least happy farmers may be in certain sections of the Southeast, particularly parts of Georgia, where corn does not grow well and farmers tend to have a choice between cotton and soybeans. Trade negotiators have already agreed tentatively to new rules for trade in raw cotton, textiles and apparel that will expose American cotton farmers to more international competition.
 Asked whether the United States had quietly wrung an unusually broad deal out of the Europeans, Mr. Madigan, in a telephone interview, replied: "The better part of being a negotiator, I think, is knowing when not to brag. If somebody else wants to make that observation, they can, but I'm not going to say that."
 American and European officials agreed on the change of method during two days of talks this week at Blair House, the White House's residence for visiting dignitaries. The United States also made a last-minute concession, agreeing that a small quantity of oilseeds could be planted on the acreage taken out of general cultivation, provided the oilseeds were used for industrial purposes, like paint manufacturing.

What is GATT?
GATT is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based organization with 105 member countries that have committed themselves to expanding free trade. GATT adjudicates trade disputes among member nations and oversees periodic rounds of negotiations to reduce trade barriers like tariffs and subsidies.
What is the Uruguay Round?
It is the eighth round of negotiations to lower trade barriers in the hope of spurring global economic growth by increasing world trade. The current round of talks began in Punta del Este, Uruguay in 1986.
What issues are being negotiated?
The talks seeks to reduce trade barriers in farm products, banking, telecommunications and apparel from developing nations. The talks also seek to reduce tariffs, accelerate hearings on trade disputes and establish worldwide rules to protect patents, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets.
Why have the talks dragged on for six years?
The main obstacle to an accord has been a bitter dispute between the United States and the European Community over subsidies to farmers. Washington sought far swifter cuts than the Europeans want in the subsidies farmers receive to grow and export certain crops.
How do farm subsidies hurt Americans?
American farmers complain that Europe's subsidies and quotas make it harder for them to sell their grain and other goods in Europe and around the world. Export subsidies also cost taxpayers around the world billions of dollars, as many nations seek to give their own farmers the upper hand in the export market.
What is the European Community?
The Community, founded by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, now is a group of 12 nations with close economic and political ties. The countries have eliminated tariff barriers among themselves and share a common foreign policy on several matters, including trade; they are also developing common rules in areas like antitrust law and the environmental protection. The 12 nations are Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
Why did the United States threaten to impose punitive taxes on European white wines and some other goods?
The punitive taxes were designed to pressure France to back down from its steadfast opposition to trimming farm subsidies. Washington announced the taxes after GATT twice ruled that that European subsidies to farms of soybeans, rapeseed -- which is used to make canola oil -- and other seeds used in animal feed have hurt American farmers' access to European markets.
What is the next step in the trade negotiations?
The European Community will first put Friday's agreement to a weighted majority vote, and it is expected to pass despite France's objections. But the French can exercise a veto by by declaring that the farm issue is a matter of vital national interest. Should the French not veto the agreement despite their complaints, then the broader GATT talks are likely to proceed, seeking common ground in other areas. (pg. 36)
Table: "Stubling Toward a Trade Deal"
 As diplomats have tried for years to agree on ways ton increase world trade, their efforts have sometimes seemed like the Perils of Pauline.
 At the latest round ot talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, begun in 1986, negotiators from 105 countries work to find ways to lower trade barriers between nations, hoping to promote world prosperity.
 Meanwhile, the United States and the European Community squabble over Europe's subsidies to growers of soybeans and other oilseed crops. Washington says the subsidies violate a 1962 agreement and deprive American farmers of sales abroad.
 A GATT panel rules twice, in 1991 and again this year, that the community is in the wrong. But rather than risk angering its politically powerful farmers, especially those in France, the community makes only token changes in the subsidies.
 The United States treatens to impose 200 percent import taxes on French white wine and other goods from the community. The GATT talks come to a halt in the face of the logjam over agricultural trade.
 A flurry of high-level talks yields a compromise. The community agrees to limit the land used to grow oilseed crops. But France continues to object. It is uncertain whether a trade war has been averted or whether France will veto the compromise. (pg. 36)

THE COLOR COMPLEX
The Politics of Skin Color Among African Americans.
By Kathy Russell, Midge Wilson and Ronald Hall.
200 pp. New York:
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $21.95. 
 LIKE most African-Americans, I find that my skin crawls at the mention of black-on-black skin-color discrimination. It is difficult to understand how a people who share a history of oppression based on skin color would do unto members of their own race what others have done to them for centuries.
In past years, such racial conflict and questions of racial definition have seldom been discussed outside the black community, lest whites learn of what many blacks describe as "our dirty little secret." Yet few blacks would deny that intraracial prejudice based on skin color has been prevalent since the time of slavery.
In "The Color Complex," Kathy Russell, Midge Wilson and Ronald Hall examine how differences in color and facial features have played and continue to play a role in the socioeconomic status, family and personal relationships, and professional lives of many black Americans. Their analysis, at times funny, at others painful, presents a powerful argument, backed by historical fact and anecdotal evidence, that color prejudice remains a devastating divide within black America. The strongest chapters are those that explore the historical legacy of color discrimination.
"Throughout American history degrees of skin coloring and kinkiness of hair have had the power to shape the quality of black people's lives," the authors write. "Social scientists have advanced various theories to explain the widespread preference for light skin and straighter features. The first theory contends that the 'establishment' sets standards for behavior and appearance and that those who strive for success must conform accordingly. Standards change only after enough members of a subordinate group have moved into positions of power."
The authors have various professional backgrounds: Ms. Russell, a scriptwriter and poet, works for I.B.M.; Ms. Wilson teaches psychology and women's studies at DePaul University in Chicago, and Mr. Hall teaches social work at Augsburg College in Minneapolis. But writing from personal experiences and social observations, they note that the book is intended to "raise awareness" of the controversial issues surrounding physical appearance, especially skin color, in the African-American community.
While the title suggests that the book will primarily examine "colorism" and its impact on blacks of varying skin shades, the authors explore other examples of intraracial prejudice based on physical characteristics like hair texture, eye color and the contour of one's mouth and nose. For example, a woman in her 20's says that the man she had fallen in love with rejected her because of her color. "You're pretty smart and you're a lotta fun," she reports him as saying, "but . . . I just can't get too serious with a dark-skinned woman. It's important to me to have light-skinned children."
In no way is colorism one-sided. During the 1960's, darker-skinned blacks found themselves being touted and embraced by the black power movement for reflecting the true heritage of the race; many lighter-skinned blacks were rejected because of their complexions. "Increasingly," the authors write, "the color complex shows up in the form of dark-skinned African-Americans spurning their lighter-skinned brothers and sisters for not being black enough."
The authors stress in their epilogue that the book is "not the final word" on intraracial skin-color discrimination, "nor was it ever meant to be." Despite the disclaimer, many readers may be left unsatisfied. Such a broad, complex issue cannot really be reduced to fewer than 200 pages of analysis. The final chapter, crammed with titillating examples from contemporary life -- everything from Michael Jackson's physical alterations to the tendency of rappers to use lighter-complexioned women in their music videos -- reads more like a magazine story than a serious discussion.
One longs for more: how, for example, the continued emphasis on skin color may be exacerbated by this country's growing ethnic diversity; the impact skin color and physical traits have on the psychological development of black children (the chapter dealing with this issue is one of the most interesting in the book); and the extent to which color discrimination plays a role in employment, housing, politics and criminality.
One senses that the authors became overwhelmed with their material. In a somewhat cursory fashion, they offer five recommendations for both blacks and whites to "minimize the damage that colorism will inflict on future generations," from therapy to bringing the issue out of the closet. But readers who want to know more will have to rely on the many sources cited in the book.
Many blacks say that African-Americans cannot afford to waste time on such superficial issues when so many of them face a multitude of problems like unemployment, drug abuse and homelessness. But "The Color Complex" clearly illustrates that in order for blacks even to begin to tackle such deep-rooted difficulties, they may first have to shed some burdensome psychological baggage.

LATINOS
A Biography of the People.
By Earl Shorris.
520 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $25. 
 SINCE the 1960's, when non-European immigrants began to surpass in number those coming from Europe, the United States has undergone the most dramatic cultural and demographic shifts in its history. Not only has it become an immigrant nation once again, with close to 11 percent of the population foreign born, but, of greater importance, today nearly one in four Americans is of African, Asian or Hispanic ancestry. And among these, Latinos, as many Hispanic people prefer to be called, are by far the fastest growing. Demographers expect them to number at least 39 million by 2010, which is likely to make Hispanics, Mr. Shorris observes, "the largest group of minorities in the United States." But who are these peoples? No book answers the question better than "Latinos."
Earl Shorris, the author of three novels (including "Under the Fifth Sun") and four works of nonfiction (among them "The Death of the Great Spirit" and "Jews Without Mercy") and a contributing editor of Harper's Magazine, notes that he waited 20 years for a book like this to appear. It didn't, and, fortunately for us, he decided to wait no longer. By combining his skills as a journalist and a novelist to weave well-annotated sketches of Latino individuals and families and the predicaments they face into a single, compelling story, he has shown how much journalism can contribute to the making of ethnographies of complicated societies. Without Mr. Shorris's eye for the telling detail and the summarizing symbol, his capacity to mold wide-ranging data into concise narratives and his keen interviewing skills, this credible profile of the cultural world of more than 20 million people intermixed among 226 million others would have been impossible.
A sizable part of his book concerns the histories of the Latino communities, going back to their Spanish and African roots. But like most journalists, Mr. Shorris deals with the present better than he deals with the past. For instance, what he says about the Aztec language and culture, and their supposed influences on Mexican character, is usually wrong and best skipped ("macho" does not come from the Nahuatl "to know"). On the other hand, his discussion of the cultural role of multilinguality in the United States is well informed and remarkably free of the partisan baggage the topic usually carries. Along with other experienced observers (including anyone who rides the subways of New York), he argues that the nation is becoming linguistically bicultural with or without bilingual education, and no matter what English-only policies are adopted.
He goes even farther. Using the comedian Paul Rodriguez as an example of the bilingual television host who can move easily from one cultural sphere to another, he advances a conclusion familiar to anyone with cosmopolitan experience: an ability to use two languages makes one more social and less ignorant, helpless and isolated.
The author sheds a much-needed light on many other related issues that are currently unhinging less knowledgeable observers. Among these are the persistence of ethnic identity, the failure of the old model of immigrant assimilation to hold true in the case of many Latinos, and the assumption that multiculturalist initiatives could lead to the disuniting of America.
Concerning the first two issues, Mr. Shorris makes the necessary but usually neglected distinction between the motives and experiences of turn-of-the-century European immigrants and those of Latinos. With no intention of returning, immigration for the Europeans was an end to an old world. Their goal as "real" immigrants was a new social contract in which language, culture, names and even lives would be sacrificed for liberty, equality, food and the promise of wealth. But for many Latinos, racism, proximity to their homelands and their status as exiles have intervened, making a similar social contract possible for only a few. When a "true" immigrant experience (one in which some form of equality and economic mobility is achieved) fails to materialize for the first generation, Mr. Shorris maintains, it may not occur at all. The devastating result, he asserts, is that "the second generation -- the hope of the immigrant, the generation in which the great social and economic leaps most often occur, the dream incarnate -- is born dead."
In agreement with much contemporary scholarship, Mr. Shorris points to the crucial errors of mid century sociology that established as truth the immigrant paradigm of inevitable assimilation in the course of three generations. He argues that the proponents of this model, like Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan in their book "Beyond the Melting Pot" (1970), failed to understand Latinos and blacks, passing over the importance and tenacity of culture while greatly underestimating the importance of race. "From the vantage of an aerie at Columbia or Harvard the prognosis of one immigrant group looked a lot like that of another," he writes. But reality was otherwise. For most blacks and Latinos, poverty followed each generation. And for many among the Latinos, he maintains, the closeness to the ancestral land, the continuous arrival of new immigrants and the isolation engendered by racism all contributed to the maintenance across the generations of the Spanish language and Hispanic cultural traits.
Does this mean unassimilated Latinos are fragmenting America? Not according to Mr. Shorris, who is quick to note that neither poverty, discrimination nor neglect have discouraged the overwhelming majority of Latinos from seeking their version of the American dream. Except for a few young activists in the 1960's and 70's, Latinos have not advanced a separatist agenda. They are instead, the book suggests (Mr. Shorris makes the process of assimilation the book's "core" issue), doing much to help themselves gain a greater share of wealth, power and visibility. After all, E pluribus unum is a Latin, not an Anglo-Saxon, motto.
Mr. Shorris, who was raised in El Paso and is married to a Hispanic woman, is an affectionate and sensitive observer of cultural differences. But he is not an ethnic cheerleader, and he is too preoccupied with covering all sides of the story to be concerned with the orthodoxies of political agendas. The Hispanic as well as the non-Hispanic origins of the predicaments of Latinos are given their proper due. His many references to the insidious nature of the prejudices and discriminations practiced among Latinos (which he labels "racismo") and the racism practiced against them leaves no doubt that he believes both sides of the Rio Grande handle the question of race with dirty hands.
The search for cultural unity in the face of historical, socioeconomic and racial diversity, a burden common to all comparative studies of Hispanics, is undertaken by Mr. Shorris with great hesitation. Having studied Latinos in depth from coast to coast and class to class, he refuses to romanticize the possible links and instead identifies them as no more than a complex of peoples, sharing in different degrees vocabularies, values and feelings toward European-Americans. His reluctance is also informed by an awareness that cultural distinctions and stereotypes can easily be confused. Considering the wide range of topics covered -- history, religion, politics, education, business, the arts, music, literature, employment and world view -- Mr. Shorris does a laudable job of maintaining the boundary between the actual and the stereotypical. Nonetheless, many readers, especially Latinos, will be unforgiving when they meet occasional questionable depictions of, say, Mexican fatalism or Cuban fanaticism.
Still, "Latinos" is a powerful, beautifully written and thoughtful book that is likely to remain unequaled in its sweep and profundity for some time to come. It is also a timely education for Americans of all nationalities, classes and races. "A snapshot of America taken now," he observes, "would reveal strong Latino influences in language, cuisine, music and entertainment. These are not signs of conquest, however; history is not a matter of repetitions." At a moment when much divisive propaganda is parading in the guise of concerned scholarship, it is good to know that on the basis of actual empirical research someone can credibly assert that "civilization need not be a zero-sum game." Mr. Shorris is wise to argue that "the victories of Latino culture are victories of pluralism. . . . Nothing is taken in return for this enrichment; it is, by definition, a gift."

BYLINE: By Alessandra Stanley; Alessandra Stanley is a metro reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
It was obvious in 1969 that Bill Clinton would someday run for President. It was just as clear that his roommate at Oxford, Frank Aller, would become a big-time journalist, another Edward R. Murrow. The two Rhodes scholars were good-looking, gifted, well liked -- close friends who had everything in common, particularly a hatred of the Vietnam War. After Aller decided to resist the draft, Clinton called him "one of the bravest, best men I know," in his now famous letter to an R.O.T.C. director in Arkansas explaining why he had given up his own thoughts of resistance to safeguard his "political viability."
Bill Clinton will become the next President of the United States on Jan. 20. Frank Aller committed suicide in 1971 -- in despair, his friends say, over a decision that had ruined his life. 
 "I hoped that the spectacle of young men refusing to fight would somehow 'move the conscience of America' " is how Aller explained himself in a Nov. 5, 1970, letter to a friend in New York City. Clinton had left Oxford for Yale Law School. Aller had stayed in England, a fugitive from justice. "The problem is that," he wrote, "while the exile goes on and on and on, the effect does not."
In the same letter, Aller mocked his predicament, inventing a future conversation between strangers straining to remember the Rhodes scholar who, as he put it, "refused induction and went to Canada or something way back in 1971." And he was prescient about his best friend's destiny, having an imaginary respondent reply: "I'm not sure, you mean the guy who was at Oxford when Governor Clinton was. . . ."
Aller had brains, humor, talent and as much drive and ambition as any of his friends. Something Clinton describes as "a very finely developed ethical sensibility" made him give up the pursuit of glittering prizes to protest the Vietnam War. On Sept. 12, 1971, Aller, who had returned to his hometown, Spokane, Wash., borrowed the keys to the apartment of a childhood friend and shot himself through the head with a .22-caliber Smith & Wesson. He died instantly.
The next morning, Bill Clinton was having breakfast with his girlfriend, Hillary Rodham, at the Blue Bell Cafe in New Haven when a friend, Doug Yeats, rushed in to tell him there was an urgent phone call. "Instinctively, I knew it had something to do with Frank," Clinton recalled in an interview before the election. "I just felt this incredible premonition. It was awesome."
THE DISPARATE FATES OF THOSE TWO FRIENDS serve as a reminder of how tumultuous and wrenching the late 1960's really were. Many men served in Vietnam, and 58,000 died. Many others found ways not to go, and some who refused to go also paid dearly for it. Frank Aller was not typical, but he was emblematic of an era when millions of young men believed they were living on the razor's edge.
It is almost too fitting that the first baby boomer President would have a "Big Chill" experience in the midst of his first run for the White House. Yet, just as one character's suicide in that movie prompted a soul-searching reunion of his peers, Bill Clinton's campaign and election have resurrected Frank Aller -- and the mysterious tragedy of his death -- among his circle of friends.
In 1969, there were a few Rhodes scholars who were headed for military service in Vietnam. But almost all of Clinton and Aller's friends had placed themselves beyond the reach of combat -- some with deferments from obliging draft boards; others with trick knees, bad eyesight, allergies and even self-induced maladies. Clinton and Aller, however, were both classified 1-A (available to be drafted) and both had exhausted their student deferments.
Clinton says he and his friend "agonized" over what to do. Aller was particularly anguished over how his strait-laced parents would feel if he became, in their eyes, a draft dodger. Herbert Aller wept when his son told him he was considering resisting the draft. Others urged Aller to apply for conscientious objector status. But Aller felt he could not honestly claim to oppose all wars. Finally, he concluded he could not maneuver for an easier way out.
Frank Aller's decision to resist was the road not taken, and he remains a haunting figure to those who chose a less difficult route. Clinton's friends have become legendary, so numerous and, like the President-elect, so accomplished that they are known collectively by a nickname, F.O.B.'s (Friends of Bill). None of them were willing to risk their futures by resisting.
Instead, they have swathed Frank Aller's death in myth, erecting a collective memory of him as a 60's martyr. "Frank was a casualty of the war just like any dead U.S. soldier or dead Vietcong," says Derek Shearer, an urban planner who knew Aller well at Oxford. That image helps soothe uneasy consciences. Or, as Richard Stearns, another Rhodes scholar from that time who is now a Superior Court judge in Massachusetts, puts it, "It confers dignity on an otherwise unexplainable event." To this day, his male friends describe Aller as a victim of the Vietnam War, the unknown soldier of the antiwar movement, and even, as David Edwards, an investment banker in Little Rock who befriended Clinton and Aller in England, says, "someone who died for what he believed in."
But suicide is never that simple.
WHAT BILL CLINTON DID during the Vietnam War has turned out to be the most controversial issue of his political career, and the actions he has the most difficulty explaining. But his experiences then were also among the most formative of his entire life. Clinton describes the bond he forged with Aller more than 20 years ago by saying slowly, "It is just almost impossible to recreate the personal agony we felt then." Edwards puts it this way: "At the end of the day, this was our first real struggle over right and wrong."
Right and wrong were clearly delineated in Aller's hometown of Spokane in the 60's. Aller grew up in an insular, middle-class community in a modest, ranch-style house. His father, Herbert, was a World War II veteran who worked for the Internal Revenue Service; his mother, Anita, did volunteer church work. Both his parents were conservative Presbyterians whose lives revolved around their church -- and their son.
Frank Aller was always exceptionally smart. He skipped the fourth grade, and by the time he left University High School, where he was the valedictorian and the only alumnus ever to become a Rhodes scholar, he was routinely described as "brilliant." Tall, with strawberry-blond hair and a sweetly goofy grin, Aller was friendly, confident and popular -- a class officer with a mischievous streak. He once sneaked through a trapdoor leading out of a crawl space and popped up in the middle of English class, brandishing a Soviet flag. It was a prank, not a statement. Aller's liberal views didn't fully develop until college, and even there he was a buttoned-down Kennedy Democrat.
No one was surprised when he won a Rhodes scholarship after graduating Phi Beta Kappa in Far Eastern and Slavic studies from the University of Washington in 1968. But many were shocked when he became a draft resister one year later. His closest friends knew how strongly he felt about the war, however, and how compelled he felt to act upon his convictions. "It was really the old Martin Luther King thing," Clinton says. " 'I'm doing this because I can't do anything else.' "
But after a miserable year in exile, Aller went home to try and piece his life together. To his own surprise, he succeeded. In the end, he couldn't forgive himself for that -- anymore than he could shake the black bouts of depression that had begun clouding his perspective in England.
His suicide came as a shock to everyone. Clinton says he understood firsthand how painful it was for Aller to rebel against his upbringing and parents. Clinton's father, like Aller's, had been a World War II veteran. Clinton, like Aller, had hero-worshiped John F. Kennedy -- not just the President but the dashing war hero, the commander of PT-109. Until Vietnam, all boys dreamed of being warriors. As Clinton put it, "We both grew up on John Wayne movies."
Clinton says Aller never told him how much his decision to resist was costing him. "What struck me about Frank," he says, "was that no matter how much he was hurting, he never showed it. In the end, it was part of his undoing."
ON A WALL OF HIS study in Little Rock, Bill Clinton keeps a blown-up poster-size picture of himself, Frank Aller and a third roommate from Oxford in 1969, Strobe Talbott. "I really loved him," he says of Aller.
Robert Reich, the well-known Harvard political economist who was also a Rhodes scholar in 1969 and is now a key policy adviser to Clinton, says there has been "a great deal of reaching out" -- by telephone, letter and in person since the famous letter to the R.O.T.C. first aired in its entirety on ABC's "Nightline" in February. "Frank's death threw us for a loop," Reich says. "Even 20 years later, it's still unresolved."
Clinton recalls being close to all his Oxford friends -- the war had created an unusually tight bond among the Americans studying there. Yet Aller and he were, in many ways, the closest. "I remember him coming to talk to me when he made his decision," Clinton says of the day Aller made up his mind to resist the draft. "He told me: 'I know you couldn't make this decision, and I don't think you should. I want you to know that I respect what you are doing.' "
Clinton speaks elliptically of the guilt he and other friends felt about not taking so principled a stand. "Frank was the most unsanctimonious person," Clinton says. "He never felt superior."
Frank Aller is still a kind of obsession among Clinton and his circle. "Bill and I talk about Frank all the time," David Edwards says. "We feel Frank paid the price for all of us."
Aller's defiance made him a legend at Oxford. The night he wrote his draft board and officially became a resister, Clinton and Reich, who both belonged to University College, threw a party for Aller in Reich's rooms, a raucous gathering that was partly a mock wake.
"Frank sort of became everyone's alter ego," says Robin Raphel, a college girlfriend of Aller's who was at Cambridge while he was at Oxford. "It was like a mantle on his shoulders, put there by people who didn't really understand where he came from."
Raphel, now the political counselor at the United States Embassy in New Delhi, says that Aller was ill suited to the role of anti-establishment martyr and that it pained him more than anyone knew. "Others were able to live their own need to resist through Frank," she says, "but even thinking about rebelling didn't come naturally to Frank."
Unlike some of the other Rhodes scholars, Raphel says, Clinton never prodded Aller to refuse induction. "Bill had to weigh what it really meant to resist," she says. "He understood the consequences more than the others."
But when Aller changed his mind and decided to give up his resistance and submit to the draft, many of his friends in the antiwar movement did not understand. "He did not get the support he needed," says Sara Maitland, an English feminist writer who attended Oxford with Aller and Clinton. "He had this hero status and his decision to go home was dreadful for everyone."
THE MOST PUZZLING aspect of the Aller story is that at the time he died, his life -- on the surface, at least -- seemed on the mend at last. In July 1971, he finally submitted to an Army physical and flunked it, after which the Government dropped its charges against him. In addition, after six months of searching for work, Aller had received a good offer. Lloyd Shearer, a columnist with Parade magazine (and the father of Derek), arranged for an interview with Robert Gibson, the foreign editor of The Los Angeles Times. So taken with Aller was Gibson that when there was a sudden opening in the paper's Saigon bureau, he bestowed upon him one of the most coveted posts in journalism.
Aller was all too conscious of the irony of going to Saigon, but he seemed to welcome his fate. "Vietnam -- there could be no more appropriate place for me to go," he wrote his former girlfriend, Jan Brenning, on May 30, 1971. "It seemed like the third bridge to myself."
The letter contains no hint that only a few months later Aller would take his own life. He had never revealed the full extent of his inner struggle with despair to anyone -- not even to Bill Clinton. With friends, he kept up the illusion that he was his same old self.
Which may be one reason why, after 20 years, memories of what drove him to suicide have grown selective. Edwards still blames the Nixon Administration for Aller's death, insisting that the Justice Department repeatedly changed its position about prosecuting the Rhodes scholar. "They played him like a yo-yo," he says. "Frank was torn up, not knowing if he could have a life or be sent to prison." Frank Fischer, Aller's roommate at the University of Washington, even suspected murder. "Spokane was such a conservative place," he says. "For years, I was half-convinced someone killed him and made it look like suicide."
While Aller's male friends point to outside forces, the women who knew him best tend to reproach themselves. Jan Brenning (who now goes by the name of Jana Brenning McNamara) says she still regrets speaking harshly to Aller in their last phone conversation a few days before he died; she was angry at him for not letting her know he had finally escaped the draft. Brenning McNamara admits she never understood the real reason Aller killed himself, only that "he was caught in a skin that had gotten too tight."
IT IS PERHAPS TO BE expected that by dying young, Aller remains frozen in the collective consciousness of his closest friends as a graduate school version of Phineas in "A Separate Peace" -- a young man who seemed effortlessly better than those around him. But, in that sense, he was not unlike Bill Clinton. He was a bright, charming kid from a modest background, a little quieter than his extroverted, glad-handing roommate from Arkansas but just as intelligent, just as promising.
A gifted classical pianist, Aller picked up polish at Oxford, discovering pubs, wine shops, rowing, esoteric bookstores and jazz. Clinton recollects most vividly their mornings together, when he would cook breakfast for Aller and their third roommate, Strobe Talbott, a Soviet scholar who is now a Time magazine columnist. "My two erudite roommates," Clinton says. "I felt like I was running a country kitchen."
Aller had a playful sense of humor and delighted in teasing Sara Maitland about her upper-class background, dubbing her "Lady Sara." But she remembers him best for his kindnesses after she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. Aller visited her every day. "He was a very, very gentle man," she recalls, "but he wasn't weak or soppy." Maitland says she first saw her friend's mettle after her doctors recommended electroshock therapy. Appalled, Aller began a one-man campaign to dissuade her from this course of treatment, eventually convincing her and her physicians that there was too much risk of a dangerous side effect -- memory loss.
Scholarly, but also sweet-natured and funny, Aller stood out even at Oxford. "Frank was the one you wanted to have dinner with -- he was everybody's favorite," Edwards recalls. Yet Aller was privately a little awed by the Ivy League savoir-faire of many of the other Rhodes scholars. This may be one reason he gravitated to Clinton. "Bill was the most comforting figure among that crowd of confident blue bloods," Robin Raphel says.
Pink Floyd played at Oxford their first year there in 1969. Vietnam overwhelmed everything else. Aller and Clinton burned candles and grew beards, but neither was a bomb-thrower or a flag-burner; theirs was a temperate revolt against the establishment.
Aller debated the Vietnam War at the Oxford Union. Clinton helped organize antiwar demonstrations and spoke at a special protest rally for Americans in England outside the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square. The day before, British antiwar marchers and several British left-wing organizations had gathered in the same spot to demand that American troops be withdrawn from Southeast Asia. Clinton and others refused to blend their demonstration with the British one, deeming it too radical.
"Frank and Bill politicized me," Maitland says. "I remember Bill telling people what to think and Frank making jokes about it." Aller wore his convictions lightly. Clinton, always given to pontification, took himself far more seriously.
The Rhodes scholar from Arkansas also kept an index card file, where he meticulously recorded the name of every new person he met. "Bill was unusual in that he was very much oriented to a political career," says David Satter, a Soviet expert now living in Moscow. "Very few of us could imagine a place for ourselves in regular politics in 1969."
Brenning McNamara, who was with Aller for much of that year, recalls with a smile: "Bill would join us at the pubs at night -- but not until after he had jotted down the day's names. I liked Bill -- you couldn't not like him -- but he never freaked out on the emotions of the times." Aller, on the other hand, she remembers, "threw himself into his convictions."
Strobe Talbott, who wrote about his two roommates in a Time essay defending Clinton's explanations of his draft avoidance, described their flat at 46 Leckford Road as a "permanent, floating, teacherless seminar on Vietnam." Aller, who was writing his thesis on Mao Zedong's Long March, would argue that to the Vietnamese, Communism was merely a vehicle to overthrow centuries of imperial rule, be it Chinese, French or American. Clinton, who had worked for Arkansas Senator J. W. Fulbright's Foreign Relations Committee, brought his insights on America's Southeast Asia policy into the mix. Talbott wrote that during one Thanksgiving dinner, his two roommates became so engrossed in a discussion of the war that they stayed talking in the kitchen for four hours while basting the turkey.
It wasn't all war and no play. There were big, noisy parties, with wine, marijuana and casual sex. It was a time of revolving-door relationships, and Clinton pursued a lot of women, his friends remember, including the girlfriends of his friends. He even once tried to seduce a girlfriend of Aller's, according to a Clinton friend, but this seems to have had no effect on their friendship.
There was one other emotion that went unspoken: fear. About 200 American soldiers were dying a week, and the recurring television news images of body bags stacked up in helicopters had a particular hold over draft-age men. Brenning McNamara remembers Aller discussing his dread of having to kill, but never his fear of being killed.
On Jan. 20, 1969, Aller sent a three-page letter to the Spokane draft board that began, ". . . I cannot in good conscience accept induction into the Armed Forces of the United States." Ardent yet formal, somewhere between a legal brief and the Declaration of Independence, Aller's letter is less personal and less ingratiating than Clinton's to Col. Eugene Holmes of the Arkansas R.O.T.C. "I believe there are times when concerned men can no longer remain obedient," Aller wrote in one passage.
Aller charged that the Government's power to deny deferments to critics of the Vietnam War was forcing young Americans to act against their principles. He lamented "the fact that many of us who have come to disagree with American military involvement in Vietnam have refrained from actions which would imperil our deferred status and have continued to comply with Selective Service regulations despite moral or political objections to the war." He was, of course, inadvertently summing up Clinton's circumstances.
Clinton drew the high lottery number of 311 on Dec. 1, 1969, and was therefore out of reach of the draft. On Dec. 3, he wrote to the R.O.T.C. to say that he would not be enlisting after all -- and letting Colonel Holmes know at last how he truly felt about the war.
The next day, Aller was indicted, in absentia, by a Federal grand jury in Spokane for failure to submit to induction. "Frank was the only guy among the Rhodes scholars who actually did something about the war -- who risked himself," says David Satter. "Frank stood out not just because he made a choice the rest of us were spared, but because he did it with such grace."
Clinton, freed from the draft, enrolled at Yale Law School -- and fell out of touch with Aller. While other close friends also went home to continue on with their brilliant careers, Aller remained behind, dividing his time between working on his thesis at Oxford and protesting the war in London. "He thought if he, a Rhodes scholar, did it, others would pay attention," David Edwards says bitterly. "Guess what -- he did it and nobody cared."
In addition, Aller was finding himself to be temperamentally unfit for rebellion. A straight arrow who always wore a tie to news conferences, he was pushed forward by his shaggier, counterculture compatriots as a front man. He was beginning to fear that he would be an outlaw forever, and the thought tortured him. "At times like this I am literally fighting for my life," he wrote to Jan Brenning.
He was anxious, homesick and turning inward, smoking a lot of marijuana. But he kept up a sunny facade, encouraging friends to talk about their problems, while making light of his own. Visiting Aller in the summer of 1970, his college roommate, Frank Fischer, remembers a long talk they had in Hyde Park. "It was the only time he admitted to me he was hurting," he says. Aller thought Fischer would understand because they both came from the same kind of strict Calvinist background. "Our sense of conscience was hyperacute," Fischer says. "We thought it immoral not to do a lot of soul-searching."
SUICIDE AMONG DRAFT evaders was not uncommon. Harry Pincus, another expatriate resister who, unlike Aller, became involved in the wilder London scene of drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll, hanging out with the likes of Vanessa Redgrave and R. D. Laing, killed himself not long after Aller. "Harry was the first person you would think would commit suicide," says Clancy Sigal, a writer who was an antiwar agitator in London at the time. "Frank was the last. Frank had to have been harboring a lot of rage, but you never saw it."
Aller went to Spain in the summer of 1970 to write and look for work. There, cut off from the support of other American draft resisters and adrift in an alien culture, loneliness seemed to engulf him. Feeling abandoned, Aller was also growing "paranoid," his father says, about being hunted down by American authorities. He poured some of his darker feelings into an autobiographical novel, which he never finished. Beneath the novel's Hemingwayesque characters and dialogue about draft resistance, the book amounted, as his father put it, to a "long letter to himself."
Aller wrote scores of letters and began dreaming of going home. In one letter dated Oct. 3, 1970, he wrote, "I don't want to become a broken old man nursing a faded ideal which no one else remembers."
Two months later, he returned to the United States through Canada, and was met at the Spokane airport on Dec. 9 by his parents, his younger sister Margaret and George A. Locke, a U.S. marshal. Aller, his mother remembers, walked off the plane with his hands up, expecting to be handcuffed. The marshal waited until he got in the car to serve his warrant.
His mother saw the change right away. "He had always had a sunny personality, but now he seemed to be wearing the weight of the world on his shoulders," Anita Aller says.
Aller flew to Boston soon after his arraignment, telling his parents he wanted to see old friends. He also saw a lawyer, Edward Rudnitsky, who in the 60's and 70's handled more than a thousand deserter and draft-resister cases. Rudnitsky sent Aller to Robert Cserr, a Boston psychiatrist who diagnosed many draft-age men. As Rudnitsky puts it, "In almost every case, he found them not fit for the military."
After one appointment, Cserr concluded that Aller was psychologically unqualified for military service. Cserr says that while he vaguely recalls examining a Rhodes scholar who was under emotional strain, he has long since misplaced the records. Rudnitsky, who destroyed his records years ago, remembers Aller well -- because of what later became of him. When he first read Cserr's report on Aller's psychological state, Rudnitsky says: "I was surprised at how strong the language was. I remember thinking: Boy, Bob is really laying it on thick this time."
But Aller himself was shocked and very upset by what the doctor had written. He had not yet begun to think of himself as clinically depressed. "It was not part of his self-image," recalls Jeff Stamps, whom Aller was staying with while in Boston.
Armed with the letter, Aller returned to Spokane and reported for his physical. His Selective Service records show that he was found 1-Y (not qualified for service -- but still on the hook to be called in case of a national emergency). But supplementary documents revealing the exact reason he failed his physical were destroyed after his death, following then commmon practice. The same day he flunked his physical, the United States Attorney's office dropped the charges against him.
Aller told almost no one among his friends why he was found unfit. To this day, most of them think he was saved by a bad ear.
ALLER SPENT MUCH OF the spring and early summer of 1971 in Southern California, hunting for work, anguishing over what he called his "legal hassles" and staying in the West Los Angeles guest house of Lloyd Shearer, whose daughter Brooke was engaged to his old roommate, Talbott. (Unlike many of her children's friends, Lloyd Shearer's wife Marva says Aller was a tidy and considerate house guest, keeping his room "really neat -- as if he were in the Navy.")
The Shearers introduced Aller to Robert Gibson of The Los Angeles Times, who was so impressed with the young man's quiet intelligence -- and mastery of Chinese -- that he decided to groom him as an eventual Beijing bureau chief. "There was just something special about Frank," Gibson says. "I can't describe it. It's almost like he had this aura about him -- people were immediately drawn to him."
Once he was offered the Saigon job, Aller began studying Vietnamese. He wrote to Jan about his Vietnam assignment and the irony of his ending up there. After detailing in the letter Gibson's warnings about the dangers of working in a war zone, Aller wrote, "I had no apprehensions, and accepted immediately. Isn't that a [expletive] hoot?
Three weeks after writing that letter, he had eased his legal predicament, but not his conscience. His mother remembers the moment her son told her about his new job overseas and confided timorously, "I'm not an Asia expert." The admission shocked her. He had never expressed a lack of confidence before.
Meanwhile, his love life had grown complicated, adding pressure. He was still involved with Jan, in a 60's-style open relationship, but that winter he also began dating Barbara Kiem, a Spokane native who was going for a master's degree in English at Washington State. Kiem remembers the two of them spending a carefree, happy week with Talbott and his girlfriend in Palo Alto, Calif., particularly after Bill Clinton showed up. Clinton remembers one highlight, the five of them going to see the Jack Nicholson movie "Five Easy Pieces." It was the last time Aller and Clinton would see each other.
Kiem does recall one particular detail about Clinton: he was carrying a volume of William Blake's poetry in his back pocket. But the future President didn't fool anyone. "It was clear to me he was very political," Kiem says.
Frank Aller fooled almost everyone. Kiem went to England in late July to do research, certain she would be seeing him again. "I knew there were problems, but 95 percent of the time Frank's letters were extremely upbeat, witty and happy," she says. At the same time, Brenning McNamara thought she and Aller would patch things up and was contemplating a move to the Far East to be closer to him.
After signing his contract with The Los Angeles Times, Aller flew back to Spokane for what was thought to be a long-weekend visit to say goodbye before heading out for Vietnam. But instead, on Friday night, he made a halfhearted suicide attempt, swallowing a handful of sleeping pills and drinking a bottle of wine. He went for a walk, then returned to his parents' house, his face ashen. Alarmed, his mother attempted to reach a psychologist Aller had been seeing off and on for several months, but he was out of town for the weekend. Aller slept it off and later admitted to his mother he had tried to take his life.
On Saturday, he seemed his old self. He spent the day with his best friend from high school, Bernie Johnson, who had returned the previous year from working alongside South Vietnamese soldiers as a member of a mobile advisory team. Aller peppered the Vietnam veteran with questions about his tour, and that night he insisted they go to a Vietnamese restaurant for dinner so Aller could try out his language skills. "I was amazed by how much Vietnamese he already knew," Johnson says.
Johnson also recalls that Aller asked him some very specific questions about the workings of guns and armaments. "He told me he didn't want to look foolish over there," he says. Johnson didn't suspect what was really on his friend's mind. "He seemed happier than I'd ever seen him," Johnson says. "I thought it was because he was happy with the direction his life was taking. Later, I realized it was because he had made up his mind to kill himself."
On Sunday morning, Aller asked his friend for the use of his apartment, saying he needed a quiet place to calculate some travel expenses. Johnson went off to teach a civil-defense class at a local school. There were two guns in the apartment. Aller drank some wine and wrote a note.
When Johnson returned to his apartment early that afternoon, he opened the front door to find Aller sprawled out on the living-room floor, lying in a pool of "red stuff." "For a second, I thought he had drunk the whole bottle and passed out," Johnson says. In the next second, he saw the gun and realized what had really happened.
It took Johnson a long time to get over the sight of his friend. "I sometimes think he did it at my place because he knew I'd seen bad things in Vietnam and could take it better," Johnson says.
Unlike the students at Oxford, Johnson never believed that the war alone had driven Aller, at the age of 24, to suicide. "That couldn't have been the only thing," he says. "There had to be the personal crises of trying to grow up and reach the age of 25."
Johnson read Aller's suicide note in a state of shock and can't remember a word of it. Aller's mother says she could never bring herself to read it. She was told that it said something about her son's desire to be "at peace."
Some friends firmly believe that Aller's decision to resist -- and his change of heart -- devastated his self-esteem. Others point to the emotional trauma he suffered as a fugitive from justice and the guilt he felt for having hurt his family.
If there is one thing that almost everybody agrees on, it is that Frank Aller was a sensitive young man who was torn apart in the tempest of the times. "I'll never forget," David Satter says, "how he once told me he took his decision with him to bed every night -- and woke up with it each morning."
Robin Raphel says she cannot explain Aller's suicide any better than anyone else. "At the end of the day, he took it all too seriously," she says wearily. "Most people checked out of the intensity of those times -- and Frank never did."

Teeth on the Sidewalk

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Newsweek, in "The Inside Story" of the '92 campaign, points out proudly that "Mark Miller was given extraordinary access to the inner workings of the Clinton campaign, thanks to the permission of the candidate himself."
Miller reports an episode of interest to students of vivid figures of speech in general, and of Southern American dialect in particular. 
 When the Bush campaign suggested that Clinton's "People first" economics would mean higher taxes for everyone who makes more than $36,000 a year, Clinton, according to Newsweek, blew up. Speechwriter Paul Begala sought to assuage his anger, Mr. Miller reports, but Governor Clinton said: "I want to put a fist halfway down their throats with this. I don't want subtlety. I want their teeth on the sidewalk."
This is not the cherubic, resolutely respectful Clinton that a plurality of American voters came to know and love. Historians and biographers will look at that direct quotation and ask: Was the reporter present to hear the words? Was his source Mr. Begala or someone else who was present, and was the source, if firsthand, paraphrasing or quoting directly? Was this quotation relayed to the reporter from vivid memory, contemporaneous notes -- or from general recollection weeks afterward? Will President-elect Clinton confirm that these figures of speech -- even if spoken on inside-background rules for publication after election -- are indeed his own?
If so, we have a challenge to dialect etymology. First, to put a fist halfway down their throats -- qualified violence, not so strong as to put a fist all the way down their throats -- was presaged by Shakespeare in a Hamlet soliloquy: "Who calls me villain, . . . tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lye i' the throate as deepe as to the lungs?" Earlier, in "Titus Andronicus," the Bard pioneered the metaphor of fist-toward-larynx: "Till I have . . . thrust these reprochfull speeches downe his throat, that he hath breath'd in my dishonour heere."
The image split in American dialect usage: to ram down the throat means "to force acceptance," while to jump down (someone's) throat means "to criticize suddenly." A third variant, to cut (someone's) throat, became a trope for intense competition.
Teeth on the sidewalk was presumably coined on the analogy of the more familiar blood on the floor; both are horrific images meant to exaggerate "severe consequences." The nautical word picture a shot across the bow has been replaced with the less cautionary, more forthright a shot in the teeth. False teeth are used in dialect as the basis of to drop one's teeth, calling up the picture of gaping in surprise and losing one's dentures.
The two strands -- throat and teeth -- combine in the hyperbolic threat to knock your teeth down your throat.
According to Joan Hall at the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE), a black, Spanish-speaking informant from Florida is cited in the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (Lee Pederson's great work at Emory University) as saying, "You'd be picking up your teeth off the floor with a broken arm." Ms. Hall's colleagues at the University of Wisconsin recall, but cannot immediately cite, a detective novel line, "All I could think of was how good his teeth would look on the floor." (Says the woman from DARE: "We could really use a concordance of Mickey Spillane.")
Will the President-elect, once ensconced in the White House, lose connection with the figures of speech of his campaign trail? Or will he emulate Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson and retain them, as he likes to say publicly, until the last dog dies?
Assuming the quotations attributed to him in Newsweek's "Inside Story" are accurate, we can await future memoirs by aides along the same revealing lines. Sooner or later, there will be a confrontation between President Clinton and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, who has an especially toothy smile. Dialecticians can't wait for a confirming citation.
 
BLOWOUT!
 THE ONE-WORD HEADLINE OF New York Newsday read: Blowout!
To some, this meant landslide, which had replaced avalanche in political parlance for "overwhelming election victory." To political lexicographers, it meant that an old word had a new meaning.
Blowout began in the language as a synonym for quarrel, and was used alongside ruction and ruckus. When automobiles came along at the turn of the 20th century, it was a depiction of the bursting of a pneumatic tire. (Electricians, heart specialists and oil-well drillers: do not send angry postcards about the suppression of arcs, aneurysms and the uprush of fluids; we're dealing here with the general lingo.)
In this generation, the most common slang meaning of blowout was "raucous party, swinging shindig"; in the new American Heritage Dictionary, the citation is from Vanity Fair: "Lunch was a billion-calorie blowout beside the pool."
Meanwhile, the expression to blow away took root, meaning "to overpower, to crush all resistance"; extending the metaphor, a music lover could be "blown away" by the latest hip-hop.
Somehow, these two locutions intersected. The political meaning of blowout is now "landslide"; in a political blowout, the opponent is blown away. (Strictly speaking, the noun should be blowaway, but nobody speaks slang strictly.)
Was the 1992 result a blowout? No; although no objective standard exists, especially in a three-way division, a difference of 10 points in the popular-vote percentages would be indisputably a blowout; in the Electoral College, the number 400 might be a blowout point. Many newspapers went for decisive as the defining adjective for the Clinton victory; those who went for landslide and blowout added that they meant in the Electoral College. (At NBC, an assistant producer of "Today," Chris Brown, reminded those on the air that electoral was pronounced e-LEC-ter-ul, not the voguish e-lec-TOR-al.)
Use all current meanings in a sentence: On the way to the blowout after the blowout, the victors' motorcade had a blowout.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Andy Garcia: An Enigma Wrapped Inside Charisma

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAMOND; Jamie Diamond, a contributing editor at Lear's magazine, writes about movies for Premiere and Entertainment Weekly.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
You would expect Andy Garcia to look cheerful. After years of searing performances in supporting roles, he is starring in two films, "Hero" and "Jennifer 8," that recently opened within weeks of each other. But this morning, in his office at Paramount, Mr. Garcia is unsmiling, his face pinched tight. Even so, he projects that pass-through-lead intensity that makes him a riveting screen presence.
Today, dressed in a beautifully cut black suit and a black T-shirt, he looks like a GQ priest. But for the most part, Hollywood has seen him as the type of guy who points a pistol. Sometimes he's the cop; sometimes he's the criminal. He was the dapper drugster in "Eight Million Ways to Die" (1986) and the responsible gangster in "The Godfather III," in 1990, for which he earned an Oscar nomination. When he fought for the guys in white hats, Mr. Garcia worked as a G-man opposite Kevin Costner in the 1987 movie "The Untouchables," as Michael Douglas's partner in "Black Rain" (1989) and as Richard Gere's nemesis in "Internal Affairs" (1990). 
 Mr. Garcia did not touch a gun for "Hero," in which he stars with Geena Davis and Dustin Hoffman. He plays a homeless veteran who is elevated to hero status under false pretenses only to discover that he possesses true heroic qualities. Vincent Canby, writing in The Times, described Mr. Garcia's performance as "funny and intense." Despite the film's stars, however, the movie has not soared at the box office.
Mr. Garcia waves a police pistol again in "Jennifer 8," this time to defend a blind witness played by Uma Thurman. The film, which opened Nov. 6 to mixed reviews, is an important step for Mr. Garcia: his name appears for the first time above the title -- Hollywood semiotics for He's No Longer a Second Banana.
Where did this 36-year-old actor come from? Mr. Garcia isn't telling. Try to find out about his unusual background -- his childhood in Havana, his family's flight from Castro's regime to settle in Miami when he was 5 years old, his adaptation to a new economic status and culture -- and you won't get any answers.
Was it difficult for Mr. Garcia's father, a lawyer and landowner with a thriving produce business in Havana, to re-establish himself in Miami? Mr. Garcia says, "Why verify facts?"
Ask whether he had a hard time announcing to his family his intention to plunge into the financially precarious waters of acting, and Mr. Garcia says, "I can't respond to that."
Maybe Mr. Garcia has a different, more forthcoming personality when he's speaking Spanish? He glances around his office, which is covered with pictures of Fulgencio Batista and Fidel Castro and maps of Cuba. "I'd say, 'Ask my therapist,' but I don't have one."
Does he think the difficulties of grappling with a new language shaped him? "Maybe," Mr. Garcia says, as if speaking about a stranger. "When you struggle with a foreign language, you're surrounded by people who don't know what you're saying, and you don't know what they're saying. So you are in isolation. That probably has a definite impact on your point of view."
What is he willing to talk about? "The movies," Mr. Garcia says, adding, "but my work is all on the screen. The actor behind the role is not important. The enigma of the performer is important."
Upon encountering this wall, some have called Mr. Garcia shy. It may be that without a role to wear, he simply disappears. On the other hand, Mr. Garcia may have such a firm sense of himself that he finds it difficult to play the secondary role of a person being interviewed. He does want to discuss a few things. His was not the typical experience of a family's coming to America to seek the American dream. "We were not immigrants," he stresses. "We were in political exile in Miami." (He maintains his ties with the Cuban community in Miami, where he keeps a house, and where he recently was a co-host for the Hurricane Relief benefit.)
He came to acting late. In high school, the 5-foot-10-inch Mr. Garcia was an avid basketball player. "My outlet for creativity was the court and the game," he says. After a bout of mononucleosis dulled his athletic edge, Mr. Garcia discovered acting. In 1978, he set down stakes in a seedy section of Hollywood, in what he calls "a hooker community," and joined that dance called waiter-by-day, actor-by-night. In 1980, while performing with an improvisational group at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, he was spotted by a casting agent. Her interest led to his first screen role, as a gang member in the pilot episode of the television series "Hill Street Blues."
"He's very sure," says Bridget Fonda, who worked with Mr. Garcia in "The Godfather III." "Acting is the ultimate way of making a living at playing. But it takes an incredible amount of ambition, aggressiveness and faith, especially if you don't have a family background to fall back on. And Andy has that faith. To do an improv, you refuse the lifeline and say, 'No, I'll just swim it and see where I end up.' There's a certain bravery in doing that."
 Mr. Garcia consistently uses improvisation as a tool to pry open his characters. Yet not everyone likes actors to improvise, particularly Bruce Robinson, the director and screenwriter for "Jennifer 8." "I want actors to learn the lines, get on the set and say them," says Mr. Robinson. "And if they can't say them, I'll tell them how to. Andy's a famous actor with a massive earning power, but nonetheless, I'm behind the camera and I have a right to say, 'I want it like this.' We pretty quickly found a way to work. I'd say, 'Here's a free take. Do what you like in it. Once you've done that, I want you to do it my way.' "
Mr. Garcia accepted the compromise. "Bruce knew it was important for me not to get stuck in a result-oriented process," he says. Even when the shoot encountered trouble, Mr. Garcia stood behind his director. Mr. Robinson reports that "it was a complicated film with a lot of problems going on at the studio. Andy was very supportive of me."
"Jennifer 8," "Black Rain" (directed by Ridley Scott) and "Internal Affairs" (directed by Mike Figgis) bear the distinction of being Paramount enterprises in which English directors direct a Cuban-born actor in films about American cops. Asked what may have attracted Mr. Garcia to British directors (he has had six), and Mr. Garcia gets a faraway look, as if trying to explain the motivations behind cave paintings. "It wasn't by design," he says. "It just happened. I'm attracted to the sensibilities of European directors, maybe, I guess. Maybe subconsciously."
Mr. Robinson says, "It could be that Andy's attracted to foreigners and outsiders because he is one. Maybe he likes the theater connection in British directors."
More than being tuned in to European sensibilities, Mr. Garcia's heart belongs to Cuba -- its culture, its music, its literature. He is producing a documentary in Spanish about Israel (Cachao) Lopez, a Cuban forefather of the mambo, revealing something of the enigma behind that performer. He has commissioned the Cuban novelist Guillermo Infante to write a screenplay, "The Lost City," which Mr. Garcia will star in and direct. The story is set in Havana at the start of the revolution and features a protagonist who runs a cabaret.
"It's about that man's eventual exile, the end of an era, a loss of a culture, a city, a way of life," says the actor. "And finding solace in exile with the one thing that's never betrayed him -- which is the music." This is the closest Mr. Garcia, who himself plays percussion, ever comes to describing his own life.
Mr. Robinson says: "It used to drive me bananas, those bongo drums coming out of Andy's trailer day and night. But he's incredibly warm. He ran a really nice bar out of his trailer, kind of like Andy's Bar, and we'd all go in there and listen to music and drink beer and eat curry."
Mr. Garcia, who has been married for 11 years to Maria Victoria, a Cuban-American, and has three daughters, has a reputation as a family man. On screen, he avoids explicit sex scenes. "I'm not interested in a close-up of two people sweating over each other," he says. "Hitchcock was right -- the longer you keep two people apart, the better. The interesting scene is the seduction. Everybody's been to bed. Let people imagine that. That stuff's private. It should stay private, I think."
Ms. Fonda, who has performed in a bedroom scene with Mr. Garcia, says, "Yes, Andy's a prude. But Andy's way is the best way." And what is Andy's way? "You leave your underwear on."
With his magnetic eyes and his high-voltage smile, Mr. Garcia belongs to that group of men women swoon over. Even his face, with its prominent widow's peak, is a valentine.
Beautiful actresses sometimes complain about being offered roles as ornaments. Do beautiful actors encounter the same problem? Mr. Garcia sidesteps the issue: "You don't know when they send you a script what their image of the part is." But he does describe a situation in which someone tried to cash in on his looks. To play the prosecuting attorney in the 1990 movie "Show of Force," Mr. Garcia grew a beard. When filming was about to start, he was asked to shave it off. "The producer gave me a rap about nobody would recognize me," Mr. Garcia says, "and the public wanted to see my face." Mr. Garcia insisted on keeping the beard.
Yet it is not just his appearance that makes him appealing. "He sticks to the celluloid," Mr. Robinson says. "Some actors seem not even on it. He is it." One of the things people respond to, Mr. Robinson says, is Mr. Garcia's sense of humor. "Andy's brighter intellectually than one might glean at first," he says. "You've got to remember that English is his second language. He's sharp-minded and he's got a sophisticated sense of humor you don't latch on to for a long time."
Ms. Fonda points to yet another factor. "In Hollywood you see a lot of pretty people. But Andy's dashing, in that old-fashioned way. He's got that chivalry thing happening in spades."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Lorna Luft, on the Road Again

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

DATELINE: HERSHEY, Pa.

 BODY:
IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME THE CURTAIN GOES up.
"Looks like her mother." 
 "Sounds like her mother."
"It is her mother."
The mother in question is Judy Garland, and Lorna Luft -- Judy's Other Daughter -- is now playing Adelaide in the national tour of "Guys and Dolls." But the Ghost of Judy Past is everywhere. The previous week, when the show opened in Hartford, a fan told Ms. Luft: "It was so frightening to see you on stage. It was your mother on that stage." At which point the actress turned to her director, Jerry Zaks, and said, "Did you put her in the show again?"
Telling the story, she shrugs. "It's just the way they're trying to compliment you."
When Ms. Luft appears in the front door of the Comfort Inn, you know she's no local. Skintight black leggings and top. Black suede cowboy boots covered with silver studs. Eggbeater red hair and eye liner with a vengeance. In a town where half the population makes chocolate bars for a living, she is turning lots of heads. Especially when she arrives at the Hershey factory to take the V.I.P. tour and plug the show, somewhere between the almond bars and kisses.
"Guys and Dolls" is booked here for only a week, so promotion is essential to ticket sales. Appearances like this one are part of any star's job on the road, campaigning in a new town each week to a potential audience that is often unsophisticated about, even uninterested in, the theater. (A local television show introduced Ms. Luft as "one of the acts" in the musical.) And a ticket to "Guys and Dolls" costs $43, higher than other shows usually charge, so it needs an extra push.
No one can tell Ms. Luft something about the road she doesn't already know. She grew up there, ordering milk and cookies from room service. She knows what a recession means, and the empty seats that "Guys and Dolls" has had on the road don't surprise her, rundown dressing rooms never rattle her, and the mall in the next town always interests her. She is a persistent good egg, the best sport, a brick. Not to mention, at 40, a survivor. She was only 16 when her mother died from an overdose of pills and liquor, and Liza Minnelli, her half-sister, seven years her senior, says, "Lorna can deal with anything. We all have that in our family, but it helps when you're really close like we are."
Sid Luft, the producer who was Miss Garland's third husband and Ms. Luft's father, says, "One thing that has always kept Lorna together is that she's never taken herself too seriously, though she really knows how to work hard, like her mother. Judy was very determined, a tough little gal and a genius. She was the most unique creature I ever hoped to know in my lifetime and part of it has rubbed off on her children."
It was the work ethic that rubbed Ms. Luft the hardest. In a Hertz kind of family, she's an Avis kind of daughter.
THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY tour is beginning. Ms. Luft good-naturedly dons the requisite hairnet, even though she knows she will be photographed. Several employees are there to escort her, one with her own camera, for the company's newsletter, The Candy Rapper. They are thrilled. And they've all bought tickets to "Guys and Dolls."
As the group watches kisses being wrapped in red and green foil for Christmas, someone grabs the actress's sleeve. "Could I have your autograph, Miss Luft?" It is a man in his late 50's, with a gray crew cut, flushed as a schoolboy. "Make it to Bobby," he instructs her loudly. "I love your show. I saw it last night. As a matter of fact, I'm the one who got them standing up for you, darling." There's a vague menace to his adoration. Groups of workers have gathered, staring.
Ms. Luft's smile flashes clear to the chocolate chips. She's so glad he liked the show. She's so glad he came to see it. Later, she says: "I was brought up to respect your public because they're the ones who make you. All this man wanted was a signature. It's the nicest compliment."
Finally, it's lunchtime, and the best hotel in town is -- what else -- the Hotel Hershey. Food on the road is notoriously dreadful and many stars travel with their own supplies. But Ms. Luft is game for most anything, though she only allows herself one large meal at midday. She asks for tomato juice, pronouncing it "tomahto." Shrimp cocktail. Iced tea without the ice, which mightily confuses the waitress, but Ms. Luft says it hurts her throat. And for a main course something called chicken champignon, constructed with enough puff pastry and brown gravy to send Nathan Pritikin screaming into the night. She eats every bite.
"When I started touring, about 20 years ago now, I used to stay in my room and watch soap operas all day long," she says. "I sometimes still do it to chill out. But I really don't mind the road, since I grew up in hotels."
Her marriage has suffered, apparently. She recently separated from her husband of 15 years, Jake Hooker, a musician. He lives in Los Angeles with the couple's 8-year-old son, Jesse, and 2-year-old daughter, Vanessa. Isn't there an easier way to earn a living?
"The road pays well and I have two kids, and a certain life style I want to lead," she says. "I have to work incredibly hard. Why the hell is Michael Jackson touring? He's on the road, too. In today's economy I am so grateful to be working. I've been there from when I couldn't get a job. I've spent my time following Wanda the Wonderhorse in Atlantic City five shows a day."
She made her Broadway debut in 1967 at the age of 15 with her mother in "Judy at the Palace" and has starred in the national tours of "They're Playing Our Song" and "Jerry Herman's Broadway Years." She was a series regular on the television show "Trapper John, M.D." and has sung in concert everywhere from Rainbow and Stars in New York to the Hollywood Bowl. Even in the midst of the "Guys and Dolls" tour, she's off for 10 days to sing 20 shows in Reno.
Yet with all this effort, fame has eluded her. Ms. Minnelli says: "I have a feeling it has to do with the fact that when she first started working, she chose more of a pop route than a Broadway route, and I think the pop route is so incredibly hard for anyone who tries it. Broadway really shows her off to the best of her ability, and I think she has committed to that now."
And although most actors would rather die than admit it, Ms. Luft comes right out and says that she auditioned for Adelaide in the Broadway production of "Guys and Dolls" -- and lost to Faith Prince who went on to win a Tony Award for best actress. "When I spoke to her about doing this on the road, she was so nice to me, so kind," Ms. Luft says, sounding truly surprised.
This is a genuine moment in Ms. Luft's conversation, which tends to consist of one-liner comebacks, many of which have already appeared in print.
"I grew up with the press," she says, barely batting an eye at being caught reciting her own clips. "My mother never paraded us for reporters, she always tried to keep a semi-normal existence. But I do remember one time these reporters from Life magazine were coming, and she got it in her head to dress Liza and me alike. Liza was 14 and I was 7. I remember Liza saying, 'What do you mean?' She hoots. "Mama got over that in about 10 minutes."
"But," she adds, "I also watched my mother one day with tears on her face over something that had been written about her and she said, 'I guess I'll never get over it.' "
Ms. Luft says she has learned how. "It bothers you but then you go, 'Oh, well, nobody's dead.' The National Enquirer was on me for my separation this summer, and three days later the Woody Allen thing hit. And I thought, phew, I'm off the hook. But if you go into this industry, this is part of the job. Certain people handle it well and have an intelligence about it. The people who don't handle it well are the ones who are new. I was sitting with Ed Begley Jr. one day reading some horrible thing about Delta Burke walking off a series and we just laughed. Who was she 10 minutes ago? You've got to be kidding me. When was the last time you heard a famous Hollywood story about Greer Garson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Delta Burke? It sort of sums it all up."
There isn't a moment's hesitation when she tells this story. She is Old Hollywood Class A. Non-negotiable.
"Hollywood today is different in so many ways," she says. "You can't just be an actor anymore. You have to be a producer, director, agent and press agent. Agents don't want to pick up the phone now, they want to be called with a package. Women today who are stars have their own production companies to survive. And if you had said that to my mother she would have said, 'What the hell are you talking about?' Because the MGM machine did all that for her."
THE RESTAURANT HAS emptied, and the waitress has learned how to make iced tea without the ice. The talk turns, inexorably, to mother. Now that Ms. Luft has children, does she carry a lesson from her own? She stares a moment, her blue eyes huge.
"The most important thing was always knowing I was loved," she says. "By actions. Because my mom was always on the road. So now that I am, I felt like Joan Crawford, not being with Vanessa on her second birthday last week. I thought, maybe she'll grow up to be one of those people who go into a Wendy's and start killing everyone. But I bring the kids to rehearsal so I can say, 'See, this is what I do,' so they can visualize it, and so they don't feel abandoned. And Jake is a great father, and I have a sensational nanny.
"I never told my mother everything," she continues. "Certain things I could and others definitely not. At least, I felt that way. Like the first time I ever tried pot." She starts to laugh and bangs on the table. "That wasn't a day at the beach, I can tell you. I was 15 years old and she just went bananas." She stops laughing. "Of course, all of her medicine was given by a doctor so it was O.K. But marijuana was using drugs.
"My father was always in the reality business, and my mother was in fantasyland. I loved that part, with her, but then there was always my father bringing me back to earth. He would say, 'That's a nice idea, but.' "
Ms. Luft's relationship with her father, who lives in Los Angeles, remains close. "I can tell my dad anything," she says. Now 76 years old, he traveled to Hartford for her opening night. "He cried during the entire show," Ms. Luft says. "Liza came, too. My whole family was there."
Mr. Luft says, "Lorna and I are a lot alike. It just took her a very long time to develop confidence, which is hard in this business. But once you have it you don't lose it. She has a lot of things going for her, a determination and desire. In April I went to see her at the Palladium in London, which is where the romance started between her mother and myself. Thinking back, when her mother was scared to death to play the Palladium, well, it was goose-bump time."
Ms. Minnelli adds: "It is tough when your whole family is in one business. But I really feel that it's Lorna's time now. I don't know why, just everything landed suddenly. She's worked hard and her voice became better than ever. The voice itself is extraordinary, the way she emotionally breaks down a song, the purity of how she sings. She's a wonderful actress when she sings. And she's funny."
As for Ms. Minnelli, Ms. Luft says: "She I tell everything to. And she to me. When we were growing up, Liza always baby-sat me, and I wanted to do everything she did. I was an impossible middle child. I would say, 'If you don't open the bathroom door, I'll tell. You're smoking cigarettes in there.' She wanted to kill me. When Liza had a date, I wanted to go. When I was living in England and she was in L.A. I didn't see her a lot. But ever since the whole thing with her sobriety we couldn't be closer. The happiest we are is lying in bed reading trash magazines and watching TV." She adds, laughing, "Magazines that both of us are not in!"
Does she ever feel jealousy toward Liza, who became a star so early? "Liza was lucky enough to have 'Cabaret,' " Ms. Luft says. "It was the right vehicle at the right time. In today's market you need that one vehicle. If you don't get it you just keep working and eventually it will pay off."
She's not bitter then that she did not, in the family tradition, become a star? She doesn't even flinch.
"I'm not done yet."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
For Staten Island, A Ferry Terminal Rooted in the Past

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
It's about time. That's one way to read the big clock that adorns the winning entry, announced this month, in the competition to design a new Manhattan terminal for the Staten Island ferry. No, our Swatch-infested city doesn't need another clock. But a building by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown is long overdue.
These Philadelphia architects have been on the verge of building in New York many times over the years: a housing project for Brighton Beach; a juicy Big Apple for Times Square; neighborhood parks for Westway. And their influence has long been felt here. Buildings as diverse as the A.T.& T. headquarters and the new Stuyvesant High School look as they do because of the path Mr. Venturi blazed out of the International Style with his 1966 book, "Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture." Now New York will have a Venturi, Scott Brown original. And the architects (in association with Anderson/ Schwartz Architects of Manhattan) have outdone themselves to make this the Venturiest, Scott Browniest building ever. 
 The terminal, which is scheduled to be completed by 1998, is a hybrid of the two types into which Mr. Venturi once breezily divided all buildings: the Decorated Shed (a container enlivened by ornament) and the Duck (the landmark of unique shape). With its landmark clock affixed to a barrel-vaulted nave, the terminal is a shed that quacks. And tells time, too.
In form and spirit, the design harks back to the Football Hall of Fame, an unbuilt work of Mr. Venturi's from 1967. In that project (for which Mr. Venturi coined the term "billdingboard"), a 100-foot-tall electric sign was clamped to the side of a barrel-vaulted structure whose cathedral scale alluded to our worshipful attitude toward sports heroes. For the terminal, the billboard has been transformed into a clock 125 feet in diameter, overlooking the harbor. The nave houses a waiting room with a 125-foot ceiling, though the allusion here is to Grand Central and the old Penn Station: temples to civic amenity. One wall of the waiting room features a Sony Jumbotron television sign that could be programmed to display, among other things, live-action pictures of ferries pulling into the terminal.
These hyper-scale features somewhat overshadow the design's more refined elements: circulation, lighting, the interplay of expansive indoor space and snug exterior arcades. As in much of their recent work, the architects use windows brilliantly to animate large expanses of wall; the tartan weave of the terminal's windows may be its most impressive feature.
To match the green-tinted glass, the terminal's walls are clad with green metal panels. On the south wall, the panels are painted with a full-scale rendering of a Beaux-Arts facade echoing that of the Battery Maritime Building next door. (The existing ferry terminal, a resolutely undecorated shed, wore the same facade until it was renovated in 1954.)
The clock has stirred up a commotion. Some Staten Island residents, including Borough President Guy V. Molinari, object to its scale and playfulness. Since Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown pride themselves on their ability to appeal to a broad range of tastes, this clock-bashing must give them pause. Still, they are sophisticated enough to know that public outcry is often the necessary precondition to public embrace. And, with the likelihood that changes in the design will be negotiated, we can probably look forward to 1993 as the year of the incredible shrinking clock.
Of course, the real problem with the design isn't the size of the clock. It's that the whole building has lost track of the time. Ferry travelers will have no trouble figuring out the hour. But what about the year? What is a transit hub for the year 2000 doing wearing a Beaux-Arts ball gown? Why must a new civic symbol flirt with the old, even in jest?
Actually, the design's deference to the past could have been predicted from the way the competition was pitched by its sponsors, the city's Economic Development Corporation. The booklet the agency prepared for the six finalists is an illuminating document. It starts off with a period photograph of lower Manhattan. It recounts the history of the site and of the city's ferry service, with passing nods to Giovanni da Verrazano, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Edna St. Vincent Millay. It explicitly advises the architects to "acknowledge sympathetically" the landmark Battery Maritime Building.
But this program of instructions has nothing whatever to say about the transportation needs of New York in the approaching century; about projected changes in the kinds of jobs New Yorkers will be commuting to; about the impact of those changes on commuting patterns; about the power of a transportation system to shape that impact toward urbanistically desirable ends. In calling for architects to create a civic symbol, the program sets forth a notion of civic identity rooted in the past.
Given this retro slant, it is not surprising that the designs by the six finalists ran heavily toward nostalgia. The question that then confronted the jurors was: Which nostalgia would be best? Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown, at least, know how to deflect nostalgia with humor. Their use of tradition is almost progressive. They know how to play with Beaux-Arts scale, symmetry, hierarchy; how to substitute food stands and electric signs for allegorical statues and academic murals; how to make monuments laugh at themselves. No one grasps more fully the irony of a city that tries to hold on to the past even as time visibly dissolves it.
Alas, it will take more than irony to rebuild the city's infrastructure. It will take clear, straightforward thinking about how urbanism and engineering can be brought into coherent relationship. Architecture is a medium in which that coherence might be formally expressed. But the expression won't mean much if the thinking remains backwards. The context of a transportation building, for example, is much more than the building next door. It is a network of steel, space and power that continues to shape a metropolitan region. The civic symbols of our time will be clearly rooted in that context.
In short, the Venturi, Scott Brown design is the right building for the wrong program. The architects have done more than accommodate the brief set before them. With their Jumbotron wit, they've transcended it. They deserve to catch this ferry. It's their sponsors who are missing the boat.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Two New Airlines Vie for New York-Florida Trade

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
TWO new companies operating at Newark Airport, Kiwi and Skybus, have grabbed attention recently by advertising $99 unrestricted one-way air fares to Florida. Kiwi goes to Orlando nonstop six times a day and also to Atlanta and Chicago, using three leased planes. Skybus, a charter operator that uses someone else's planes and crews, goes to Fort Lauderdale and back twice a day now; it plans to increase frequency to four times a day by Dec. 18.
Earlier this month, I flew Skybus from Newark to Fort Lauderdale, and then went up to Orlando and flew Kiwi back to Newark. 
 The two companies, both owned by their employees, who are mostly airline career people, seem to have a similar idea: To garner some of the heavy New York-Florida traffic, particularly people who travel at the last moment, with a cheap fare and no requirement for advance purchase or a Saturday-night stay. But the trips were different. Skybus offers scheduled public charter flights. Meals and drinks are sold on board, not included in the ticket price, and there is a charge of $15 or $25 -- depending on the number of tickets -- for seats reserved in advance, and $5 for each checked bag.
One other difference: Skybus plans to stick with its $99 basic fare indefinitely, while Kiwi says it will raise the Orlando price to $150 each way, from Tuesday to Nov. 30, and after Dec. 14.
Kiwi, which is a regular scheduled airline, provides free reservations, luggage checking, box lunches and soft drinks. On Skybus, the seat pitch -- the distance between the front of your seat and front of the one behind you -- is 29 inches, which is what you get in most lines' economy classes. On Kiwi, the pitch is 32 inches.
Skybus left on time and arrived within 10 minutes of schedule. Kiwi left a little late but arrived 25 minutes early.
I made my reservations a week ahead. Both had space available, although both flights took off with only four or five empty seats. On the phone, the Skybus clerk, Janine, took my credit card number and told me to be at the counter behind door 10 at Newark Terminal B an hour before flight time to get my boarding pass. Unless someone picks it up for you, this is your only route to getting aboard Skybus. I ordered and picked up my Kiwi ticket from a travel agent before I left New York although I was not given a seat number.
When I got to the Skybus counter Nov. 5, I did not get a ticket, because the company is a charter operator, but a boarding pass and contract. I signed it and then read my copy. It was pretty much the standard contract form, but since we were within an hour of the flight, most of the provisions were moot.
 
Like the Old Days
 I was an hour and a half ahead of departure, so there was not a big crowd, and we were sent to the gate to get seat assignments and wait. The passengers accumulating echoed the screwball days of Peoplexpress. Two little girls were sprawled out crayoning while their blue-jeaned grandmother sat on the floor nearby. Five athletic youths were pushing around a blindfolded and handcuffed friend in a wheelchair.
Skybus hires an airline, Private Jet Expeditions Inc., a company founded in 1988 with eight planes and crew that also serves other charter operators, to provide the crews and the MD-80's, narrow-body planes that seat five abreast,with a capacity of 165 passengers with the 29-inch pitch. (Delta and others fly this model with about 20 passengers fewer.) Our flight was virtually full. I counted 11 infants and children under school age; those 2 and younger were traveling free and the rest were paying full fare. The general housekeeping was spiffy. But the passengers, especially the youth in plastic handcuffs and a man in an abbreviated pink tank top, made me fear I had won a role in "Animal House Takes to the Air."
A flight attendant, Lisa, told me the manacled youth had been "kidnapped" for a bachelor party of several days. That sort of prank is probably more feasible at $201 -- $99 plus $3 going south and $99 return -- than at $510 or $610 for an unrestricted round-trip economy seat on Continental or Delta.
My neighbor, a Brooklyn man now living in Palm Beach, had flown Skybus to Newark earlier in the week, to go to a family funeral in Bay Ridge. "From West Palm," he said, "the regular airline had wanted $670-something for a round trip, so I got driven over to Fort Lauderdale and did it for $198." Across the aisle were two New York sisters whose father in Florida had given them Skybus trips so they could surprise a relative at her baby shower.
All refreshments on Skybus were sold: Coffee, juice or soft drink -- $1; beer or wine -- $2; liquor with any mixer -- $3; sandwich -- $5. For the sake of research, I bought; the turkey sandwich was the usual tasteless processed fowl on a soggy roll. I heard no one complain about quality or price.
A party mood settled on our 4 P.M. flight. The sisters compared notes with a young television employee going to Florida for two days' taping. Babies were diapered in the rear of the single aisle and the prospective bridegroom was unmanacled and stood by the forward galley.
When we debarked, the two sisters had established that they would be flying back on Sunday with their TV friend. "Bloody Marys at 8!" they shouted as they rushed into the terminal.
To get to Orlando and my Kiwi flight back to Newark the next day, I took a $172 Delta commuter flight. Aboard a little turboprop, I was again in the no-laughs world of flying -- briefcases, laptop computers, ties and drinks at $4.
On Kiwi there was no particular party atmosphere, partly because departure was in the morning. The 150 seats on the 727, arranged six abreast, were mostly filled out of Orlando, and chock-full out of Atlanta, including seven children. My seatmates were a woman who had needed to get to Tampa for a court appearance and found Kiwi cheaper than Amtrak, and a businessman who needed to get to Atlanta in a hurry. Neither had stayed over a Saturday.
All five members of the cabin crew and three on the flight deck for Flight 8 had worked for Eastern Airlines. Steve, an "inflight assistant" who expected to requalify as a full flight attendant again by Monday, commented on the brisk, helpful atmosphere: "Yes, it's like the good days of Eastern, when everyone was happy to go to work." Kiwi's top officer is a former pilot, and the employees are mostly from Eastern, with some from Pan Am and some from Midway. The three planes formerly belonged to Lufthansa and are leased from G.M.A.S., a London company.
 
Chicken and Chocolate
 Because the Nov. 6 trip had a stop -- subsequently dropped -- we were fed twice. In the hour leg from Orlando to Atlanta, we got a box of three cold boneless fried chicken pieces with a mustard-honey sauce on the side, seedless red grapes and a soft drink. It was better than McDonald's chicken pieces, and I ate it all. In the two-hour leg to Newark, similar chicken, fruit and a bean salad were offered, but I asked for something else and got a box of cut fruit, some cottage cheese, three chunks of cheese, crackers and a soft drink. It was good economy airline food. Each time, I got a square of Ghirardelli chocolate. Wine or beer was $3 and liquor was $4.
Kiwi Airlines, which began Sept. 21, now provides service between Newark and Orlando; Newark and Atlanta, and Newark and Midway in Chicago, all nonstop. The $99 one-way Orlando fare is to continue until Dec. 14, with the exception of Nov. 24 to 30, when the "regular" fare of $150 each way will be in effect.
Kiwi sells through travel agents as well as directly by phone, (800) 538-5494 or (201) 622-3232. When I tried the 800 number it seemed to be constantly busy; the 201 number, which opens the way to a touch-tone information tree, was so much in demand that I heard the initial message several times before being switched to the flight schedule. Since I still could not get through to buy a ticket, I used a travel agent, which cost no more. The airline code for Kiwi is KP.
Skybus Airlines, which began flying Sept. 30, uses two planes to provide nonstop service between Newark and Fort Lauderdale, two round trips a day now, four as of Dec. 18. The $99 one-way fare will not rise, according to its spokesman. Skybus does not offer commissions to travel agents, so you must call directly: (800) 475-9287 for recorded messages and (800) 775-9287 to buy a ticket.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SNOW;
Skiing: Finding the Price That's Right

BYLINE: By STANLEY CARR

 BODY:
OPERATORS of ski areas have long encouraged the idea that skiers can cut costs by adopting various strategies -- seeking out discounted lift tickets, for example, or buying packages that combine tickets and lodging , or avoiding holiday periods, and even weekends. The ski operators generally leave it to hotels and spas to suggest that skiing can be high style, too, and that one can enjoy luxurious quarters and elegant dining near the slopes.
Both ends of the sport have something to be pleased about. A survey conducted by the United Ski Industries Association, which represents most major ski areas, reported that last winter skiing bucked the recession after a three-year decline. During the 1991-92 season the number of skier visits (a skier visit is one person visiting a ski area to ski part of the day or night) rose 8.8 percent over the previous season. Visits went up to 50.8 million from 46.7 million. Attendance at beginner lessons, the report said, surged 21.2 percent. 
 The rebound helped spur investment at some ski centers, notably at Vail-Beaver Creek, where $8.5 million has been spent on four lifts and expanded terrain. Two other Colorado resorts were among the big spenders this year, Steamboat adding two quad chairlifts and Crested Butte one. Many mountains extended their snowmaking equipment, among them Sun Valley and Deer Valley in the Rockies, and Sunday River, Me., and Waterville Valley, N.H.
Another sign of confidence: a new Ritz-Carlton Hotel, with rooms starting at $325 for two most of the season, opens Dec. 12 in Aspen, between the two base lifts serving Aspen Mountain. That is not a choice for budget skiers, but even at Aspen, people save money by going in the low part of the season. Many ski areas make 15 to 25 percent of their annual lift revenue in the high-season period just before and just after Christmas; hotels at ski resorts make from 40 to 50 percent of their revenue between Dec. 19 and Jan. 15, according to a spokesman for the Denver-based Colorado Ski Country USA.
The single day lift price at the slopes at Aspen from Dec. 19 to Jan. 2 will be a whopping $45; at Breckenridge a single day ticket is $38. Across the country as a whole, according to a Ski Industries Association survey, only 37 percent of skiers pay full price for a weekend day ticket. Most people pay less by buying a multiday or half-day ticket or a discounted ticket at a grocery or ski store. Flexible pricing systems for lift tickets, in which skiers pay for what they ski on a point system rather than a flat rate, are likely to spread, ski officials say. The idea has been adopted by Loon and Attitash in New Hampshire, Ski Roundtop in Pennsylvania, and Mount Bachelor in Oregon.
Wherever they go, skiers on a budget will have to think twice not only about the Christmas and New Year's period but also President's Week when Lincoln's Birthday (Feb. 12) and Washington's Birthday (Feb. 15) combine to create a rush to the slopes. When calling reservation services, ask how high and low season are defined at the resort at which you plan to ski. In the Rockies, the low, or off, season is generally described as between Nov. 25 and Dec. 19, and between March 28 and April 11, when the slopes close, not usually for want of snow, but for lack of skiers. The change in seasons is most complicated in Canada: Mont Tremblant in Quebec says low season is before Dec. 25 and from Jan. 3 to Feb. 13 and then from March 21 until skiing ends. For groups, Mont Tremblant also has both regular and high season lift prices. Some lodges follow suit with their rates.
In Canada, a 7 percent Federal tax is applied to most goods and services. There are also varying provincial sales taxes. In Quebec it's 8 percent on goods including meals and 4 percent on services including lodging; in Alberta, there is no provincial sales tax, but there is a 5 percent tax on accommodations. Visitors from the United States can get the Federal and provincial taxes on lodging and goods -- but not meals -- refunded by filling out required forms, thus saving a substantial amount.
Skiers who belong to the electronic bulletin boards of Prodigy or Compuserve (requiring a monthly fee) can look for deals there. Prodigy's on-line ski guide gives information about resorts, and its sports club bulletin board exchanges information about ski resorts. You don't have to belong to Colorado Travel bank to make contact and scout for cut rates, either through modem, (303) 671-7669, or voice, (303) 320-8550.
The following survey offers a selection of ski areas in the West, Northeast and Canada and suggests how visitors following the budget or the deluxe trail might approach them.
 
THE WEST
 
CALIFORNIA
SQUAW VALLEY USA
Squaw Valley, Calif. 95730
(916) 583-6955: central reservations, (800) 545-4350
Budget -- Squaw Valley offers a lot of skiing for the money. A lift pass -- the regular day rate is $40 for an adult -- gives access to six mountains serviced by 33 lifts, and lift passes include unlimited use of the cable car. For $1, skiers can buy a guarantee that allows them to ski free if they average more than a 10-minute wait on lift lines. (Their lift pass fee is refunded.) Management keeps track of the lines and keeps records if people have to wait.
One of the best deals at Squaw Valley is for children under 13 and people over 65, who can purchase lift tickets for $5 every day. There are many packages that include skiing at up to seven other Tahoe area ski resorts, and accommodations if required, that bring the lift price down. Squaw Valley also offers first-time skiers a free lift ticket, free ski rentals and a free ski orientation.
If you take your own sleeping bag and are willing to share a bathroom, the Hostel at Squaw Valley provides shelter for as little as $35 a night off-season and $40 in peak times like Christmas and Easter weeks and on weekends. The dormitory-style rooms with three to eight beds in each come with pillow, pillowcase and towel. The Hostel, (800) 544-4723, is within easy walking distance of the main lifts; make reservations early.
Squaw Valley's new "Ski Your Pro" instruction system costs $25 for up to a day; participants can join any one of the four levels of lessons at any time during the day and stay with it until the lifts shut down.
Inexpensive diversions off the slopes include ice skating on top of the mountain at the Olympic Ice Pavilion, which costs $5 and has a view over Lake Tahoe.
Deluxe -- Although Squaw Valley USA as a whole is focused more strongly on terrain development and access than on pampering, guests at the Resort at Squaw Creek, (800) 327-3353, are offered in-room ski and boot fitting. The Resort is the only hotel in the Lake Tahoe region given four stars by the American Automobile Association.
Most of the 405 rooms are suites. The hotel has four restaurants and in-house masseurs; a high-speed lift ascends directly from the Guest House building.
Apres-skiers can contemplate the waterfall that emerges from beneath the smoked-glass lobby building as they steam and soak in the various outdoor hot tubs and swimming pools. Daily room rates at the Resort at Squaw Creek start at $135.
For skiers who prefer to remain on the slopes all day, lunch doesn't have to be a microwaved chili-dog and a chocolate bar. Alexander's is a full-service restaurant on the middle of the mountain at 8,200 feet, serving lunch at about $15 and dinner at $25.
 
COLORADO
ASPEN
Aspen Skiing Company, Post Office Box 1248, Aspen, Colo. 81612
Information and snow report, (303) 923-1220 or (800) 525-5200; central reservations, (800) 262-7736
Budget -- In Aspen economical folk have always mingled with extravagant ones, and, at about $100 a person daily, the typical ski vacation strains the definition of the word budget. But Aspen does offer affordable pleasures for the cost-conscious.
To save, begin by going in the off-season. In Aspen, off-season is generally Nov. 25 to Dec. 19, and March 28 to April 11, when the slopes close. Off-season packages start at $186 a person for three nights' lodging and lift tickets. Visiting at the slowest times of the year may offer such bonuses as signing up for a group lesson at $48 a day, but getting a private lesson, which ordinarily runs $130 for two hours, if nobody else shows up.
Nothing says you have to buy your lunch at the high-altitude restaurants; since these are built on National Forest land you can take a lunch of your own and still eat inside any restaurant, or at one of the picnic tables outside. For about $6, such delis as the Jour de Fete, 710 East Durant Avenue, (303) 925-8691, or the Charcuterie, 520 East Durant Avenue, (303) 925-8010, prepare a lunch you can carry in your fanny pack.
Where skiing is concerned, multiday lift tickets purchased in advance are always less expensive than those bought at the ticket window. A ticket good for six out of seven days for Aspen, Snowmass and Buttermilk is $228; single day tickets cost $43, or $258 for six days, most of the season. Skiers under 6 and over 70 ski free.
Aspen has a number of low and moderate priced restaurants. Kids love the pizza, $2.10 a slice, at New York Pizza, 409 East Hyman, (303) 920-3088. Su Casa, 315 East Hyman, (303) 920-1488, serves quesadillas and enchiladas for about $7. The Red Onion, 420 East Cooper Avenue, (303) 925-9043, has chicken wings at $2.50 and onion rings at $1.75.
The Innsbruck Inn, 233 West Main Street, (303) 925-2980, offers large rooms and a full breakfast served in an Austrian-style dining room, $154 a night for a family of four. Just outside of town and along the free bus route is the Alpine Lodge, 1240 East Cooper Avenue, (303) 925-7351, offering rooms for two with shared bath for $68 a night, with private bath for $80 or $85. This Bavarian-style lodge built 100 years ago is white stucco with dark brown wood trim; all the rooms have down comforters. Breakfast is an extra $5 a person, and dinner, $14.
Close to town are 80 kilometers of free groomed, public cross-country ski terrain, and of course there are hundreds of square miles of White River National Forest for the more experienced back-country skier. Indoor ice skating in town is $5.50 including skate rental.
Deluxe -- If vacationing off-season is the best way to beat the highest prices, visiting at Christmas time assures you will pay them. The opening of the Ritz-Carlton, 315 East Dean Street, (800) 241-3333, on Dec. 12 heightens yet again Aspen's notoriety for being chock-full of rich people, especially when you are informed that every one of the hotel's 257 rooms and suites, priced from $475 to $3,000 a night, is booked through Jan. 2. Rates then begin at $325. The staid, red-brick building with dark green trim is two blocks from Aspen Ski Company's Silver Queen Gondola, so it does not offer the ski-in access of its closest rival, the Little Nell. Nevertheless it provides a fitness center with a host of body treatment rooms.
Down the street, the Little Nell, 675 East Durant, (303) 920-4600, with more than 100 rooms, boasts of being just 17 steps from the gondola. Rooms with a town view begin at $335 a night, and its two-bedroom suite goes for $2,100 nightly. The contemporary Nell, is booked solid through New Year's Day for several years to come.
The 100-year old Sardy House, 128 East Main Street, (303) 925-2525, offers 20 rooms and has a private brick mews. The red-brick house has pretty porches, bay windows and a cone-shaped tower. Rooms run between $240 and $550 a night during the regular season, $100 more a night at Christmastime.
For expensive, exquisite dining, Szygy, 520 East Hyman Avenue, (303) 925-3700, fits the bill. Its stark interior is offset by dramatic dinner presentations that combine elements of French, Italian, Oriental and Southwestern cooking. About $130 for two with wine. The equally elegant Renaissance Restaurant, 304 East Hopkins, (303) 925-2402 -- it reopens Dec. 11 -- features a fixed-price menu that changes daily, $95 a person with wine. The menu, which changes frequently, offers a wide variety from finely prepared lamb and veal to scallops.
The latest peak experience is a four-day course in paragliding, $375 for a group lesson or $450 a day for a private lesson. (303) 925-7625.
 
COPPER MOUNTAIN RESORT
Post Office Box 3001, Copper Mountain, Colo. 80443
(800) 458-8386
Budget -- For the budget-minded, the best place to stay is in Frisco or the Dillon and Silverthorne area, which are six miles east of Copper Mountain, and are the centers of activity in Summit County.
The Holiday Inn-Summit County in Frisco, (303) 668-5000, has regular reason room rates that range from $95 to $145 a night, compared with rates of $145 to $470 a night at the resort. The Alpen Hutte Lodge in Silverthorne, (303) 468-6336, is another choice for skiers willing to forgo the benefits of the resort. This European-style ski dormitory offers queen-size bunk beds that go for $20 to $23 a person a night during the height of the season. It's comfortable and clean, not fancy, not a party place, and popular.
Equipment rental and lift tickets are also cheaper away from the resort. Many rental places charge $11 to $14 a day for skis, poles and boots, which cost $21 at Copper. Adult, single day tickets go for $30 at rental shops, gas stations and grocery stores, and $37 at the resort.
Copper is part of the Ski the Summit lift ticket package that offers access to Copper's 1,330 acres of skiing and the Breckenridge, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin ski areas. These packages start at $132 for four days.
For skiers who want to stay at the resort, Copper offers packages that include lodging, daily lift tickets and access to the athletic club. Family packages range from $85 to $105 a person a night during regular season; $88 to $125 during the holidays, and from $59 for early and late season skiing. A new single occupancy package starts at $86.
Club Med, (800) 258-2633, operates a resort at Copper, with seven-night rates, starting at $900 a person, double occupancy, Dec. 6 to 13, rising to $1,390 for the week beginning Dec. 27. An early season deal: from Dec. 6 to 20 you can get 10 nights for $900. All rates include three meals a day, wine or beer at lunch and dinner, and one-week lift ticket.
Dining at Copper is somewhat limited, with O'Shea's Copper Bar, (303) 968-2882, ext. 6504, serving American and Mexican food upstairs and featuring live music in the bar downstairs. Prices for main courses range from $5.95 to $12.95. In the Dillon area, dining ranges from a plethora of fast-food places to restaurants like Charity's in Frisco, (303) 668-3644, which serves international cuisine in a former bordello. Entrees range from $6.95 to $14.95.
Deluxe -- Copper offers everything from single rooms at $99 to $190 to four-bedroom condos that go for $350 to $625 a night, rates depending on date. Three-bedroom penthouses are from $280 to $565. The Telemark Lodge, with one-bedroom units, is one of the most comfortable complexes.
A wide variety of skiing instruction ranges from introductory cross country skiing on a 25-kilometer track to all-day private lessons in downhill skiing that go for $285. Sleigh rides, ice skating and shopping are also available.
Colorado Heli-Ski in Dillon, (800) 435-4754, has daily packages that go for $330 to $400 a day, and include five runs in the Arapahoe, White River and San Isabel National Forests, a buffet lunch in the back country and guide.
Rackets, at the resort's athletic club, (303) 968-2882, ext. 6386, is one of the fancier restaurants, with Southwestern dishes from $13.95 to $26.95.
The Briar Rose Restaurant at Breckenridge, (303) 453-9948, serves such items as frogs' legs in garlic butter, moose steaks and veal medallions in lemon butter. Prices for entrees range from $13 to $26.
 
SNOWMASS
Snowmass at Aspen, Post Office Box 1248, Aspen, Colo. 81612
(303) 925-1220 or (800) 525-6200
Budget -- The Aspen Skiing Company, which owns and operates Aspen Mountain and Tiehack-Buttermilk Mountain in Aspen, also owns the vast Snowmass area, and offers a lift ticket that entitles skiers to ski any of its four properties. A free shuttle bus runs between Snowmass and Aspen, 12 miles away. More than 50 percent of the skiing in Snowmass is rated intermediate.
Most Snowmass visitors stay in condominiums or homes, since there are relatively few hotels. Many of the accommodations allow ski-in, ski-out access, and virtually all have at least a three-day minimum stay. For condominium prices call Village Property Management, (800) 525-9402.
One of the least expensive places to stay in Snowmass is the Stonebridge Inn, (800) 525-4200, a short walk from the lifts. The Stonebridge package rate is $786 a person for a seven-night visit, including lift tickets. Rooms are comfortable though simple.
Slopeside, and across from the Snowmass nursery and children's ski school, is the Pokolodi Lodge, (800) 666-4556. It offers a five-night package of $844 a person including lift tickets.
If you have a car, the best budget accommodation is the Aspenalt Motel in Basalt, (303) 927-3191, about a 20-minute drive from the Snowmass shuttle bus stop. Here, long-term parking is available, and be forewarned: it is next to impossible to find parking nearer the ski area. The 35-room Aspenalt, a Best Western, costs $75 a night for two people in a room on the creek, and $65 a night for two in a room away from the creek. Prices between Dec. 18 and Jan. 2 are $90 a night for two, and there is a three-night miniumum. All prices include Continental breakfast.
The Snowmass pedestrian mall offers several budget-minded restaurants open for lunch and dinner. The Stewpot, (303) 923-2263, serves hearty stews and, with salad and bread, the price is about $8.25. At La Pinata's, (303) 923-2153, Mexican specials start at about $9.
If you want to be frugal in Snowmass and stay off the slopes, visit the renowned Krabloonik Kennel free. You take the free shuttle bus to the top of the village to hear and see more than 200 huskies and malamutes, many of which take part in dog-sled races. Call (303) 923-3953 for information.
Deluxe -- The Silvertree Hotel, (303) 923-3520, is the only full-service deluxe hotel in Snowmass Village, and offers a ski-in, ski-out location. Rooms between Dec. 19 and Jan. 2 run from $270 to $375 a night, and are $100 less in the regular ski season. Suite prices are available upon request.
The Snowmass Lodge and Club, (800) 262-7736, which bills itself as Snowmass Village's other exclusive hotel, is owned and operated by the Aspen Skiing Company. Accommodation packages at the Lodge include two lift tickets, and begin at $325 a room a night during the Christmas season, or $230 a night afterward. One-bedroom villas that sleep four are $460 a night with two lift passes during Christmas week, and $280 afterward. The Snowmass Club also provides a full-service athletic center, with weight and cardiovascular workout rooms, aerobic classes and a heated outdoor lap pool. While still considered part of Snowmass Village, the Snowmass Lodge and Club is about six miles from the slopes. A free shuttle bus runs frequently.
The frequency and ease of bus transportation to Aspen gives Snowmass visitors the opportunity to go to town for an elegant dinner, but there are comparable restaurants near at hand: Chez Grandmere, in the village, (303) 923-2570, prepares Continental dishes in a cozy yellow house, $110 for two, with wine, and Krabloonik at the top of the village, (303) 923-3953, is a gourmet restaurant as well as a kennel. Its menu features specialty game and fish entrees, $120 for two, including wine. A two-hour dog-sled ride, with driver and four-course lunch, is $175 a person. Wine is extra.
For off-slope thrills, visitors to Snowmass can enroll in Aspen's paragliding school, a bus ride away. A four-day course is $375.
 
VAIL
Vail Associates, Resort Information, Post Office Box 7, Vail, Colo. 81658
Reservations, (800) 525-2257; snow report, (303) 476-5601
Budget -- Vail has a value season like Aspen and Snowmass', and such cost-saving measures as signing up for a group lesson at unpopular times (when you may be the only student), work equally well here. During the more affordable times (Nov. 25 to Dec. 18, April 3 to 18), a five-night stay with four days of lift tickets starts at $417 a person in Vail, $514 down Interstate 70 in Avon, and $647 at Vail's luxurious sister resort, Beaver Creek. Through the Vail-Beaver Creek reservations system -- (800) 525-2257 for Vail travel packages, and (800) 622-3131 for Beaver Creek packages -- skiers can do everything from checking airline availability to reserving a spot for their children in ski school.
Inexpensive dining spots are scattered along the I-70 corridor. Among them are Cassidy's Hole in the Wall in Avon, (303) 949-9449, which serves breakfast through dinner, with entrees such as hamburgers and Southwestern specialties, $5 to $15. A good place to eat on the pedestrian mall in downtown Vail is bright and contemporary Blue's, (303) 476-3113, which serves innovative dishes like smoked trout, hash and eggs for breakfast at $6.25. A Jamaican-spiced Rasta sandwich in a tortilla at lunch is $5.95; the mustard pepper steak at dinner is $11.95.
Skate indoors at the Dobson Ice Arena, for $5, or outdoors, free, in Beaver Creek. Cross-country skiers can take a short day trip up from Vail Pass to the popular Shrine Mountain Hut, one of the stopping places on the 10th Mountain Division Memorial Ski Trail.
Deluxe -- The 190-room Sonnenalp Resort, (800) 654-8312, opens a number of new suites this season, which cost from $340 to $1,050 a night from Christmas to New Year's, and $290 to $900 thereafter. The new suites have gas fireplaces. Hotel rooms are available during Christmas for $255 to $285 a night, and from $225 to $255 in the regular season. Full buffet breakfast is included in all rates. The Sonnenalp has four restaurants, an outdoor heated pool and a health spa offering hydrotherapy tubs, facials and massages. The resort is a four-minute walk from the nearest lift, the Vista Bahn quad.
The Christiania at Vail, (303) 476-5641, offers elegance on a smaller scale, and it has an outdoor heated pool and a sauna. The big plus about the Christiania is that it's 100 yards from the Vista Bahn chairlift. Its 22 rooms cost $200 to $300 a night during the Christmas season, and from $160 to $250 thereafter. Suites begin, in the low season, at $250, rising to from $300 for regular season. At holiday times they start at $350.
Ten miles west in Beaver Creek, the former $20 million Shearson Lehman Executive Retreat has been transformed into the Saddleridge at Beaver Creek, an enclave of 12 villas connected to a private club. Each villa features a river-rock fireplace and antique furnishings, with prices starting at $1,000 a night for a two-bedroom villa at Christmas. After the holidays rates fall to $475 for a two-bedroom, $600 for a three-bedroom. Information, (800) 352-7557.
Perhaps the best ski instruction available at Vail is embodied in Pepi's Wedel Weeks (named for wedeln, a short parallel turn) returning for its eighth year. For $1,375 a person, in double occupancy, the four scheduled Wedel Weeks -- the first from Nov. 30 to Dec. 6 -- include a comprehensive teaching program, lodging at Vail's best hotels, a Bogner fashion show and farewell dinner. Information, (800) 323-4386.
To pamper yourself after a punishing day on the slopes you can take the free shuttle to the Cordillera, (303) 926-2200, a small lodge and spa posted on 3,200 acres high in the Sawatch 20 minutes from Vail in Edwards, Colo. Its $195 day-away package is open to nonguests, and includes lunch, hydrotherapy, exercise instruction and a facial massage. For those who wish to stay over, the Cordillera's 22 rooms range from $175 to $400 a night.
Diners at the lodge's restaurant, Picasso, which is open to nonguests, can see three original Picassos hanging in the dining room. They also pay $75 a person for the set-price, four-course dinner. The style is nouvelle cuisine and pureed vegetable sauces are a specialty.
Back in Vail, the Sweet Basil, 193 Gore Creek Drive, (303) 476-0125, is known for its cheerful atmosphere, nouvelle-style cuisine and fanciful desserts. $100 for two, not including wine.
 
WINTER PARK
Winter Park Resort, Post Office Box 36, Winter Park, Colo. 80482
(303) 726-5587; reservations, (800) 453-2525
Budget -- Winter Park's innovative lift-ticket pricing structure allows skiers to pay $3 to use the Galloping Goose beginner's lift; $15 for a mini-mountain ticket (five lifts), and $24 for either morning or afternoon for all 20 lifts. You can also pay $30 a day for a multiday ticket, valid from two to six days. Then skiers can save $6 by buying off site. There are $30 tickets for the entire mountain for a day that are sold at more than 150 outlets in the Denver area. A regular all-day ticket at the slopes is $36. Children age 5 and younger, and seniors 70 and older ski free.
The all-area tickets let skiers reach the resort's new Timberline double chairlift, which climbs to the 12,000-foot summit of North Cone, opening up the 1,038 vertical-foot Parsenn Bowl and its more than 200 acres of above treeline and glade skiing. (Winter Park's vertical is 2,220, and the adjacent Mary Jane has a 3,060 vertical.)
Those who have never skied before get their first ski lesson free with the purchase of an adult all-day lift ticket. First-timers' packages, which include three days' lifts, three nights' lodging at a mountain inn, breakfast and dinner daily, and three four-and-a-half-hour ski lessons, start at $357 a person, double occupancy. Rentals are extra.
The National Sports Center for the Disabled, at Winter Park, has a $35 half-day, one-on-one lesson, including lift ticket and adaptive equipment.
During White Sale season, Jan. 4 to Feb. 12, vacation packages offering seven nights' lodging with breakfast and dinner daily, and six days' lifts start at $635 a person, double occupancy, in a mountain inn and from $467 in a bed and breakfast. During regular and peak seasons, Dec. 14 to Jan. 3 and Feb. 13 to April 4, the price is $656 in a mountain inn, $467 in a bed and breakfast. For inexpensive food, look for daily specials at mountain restaurants where entree, drink and side dish costs under $5. You can use the Pizza Hotline atop the mountain to have a pizza waiting for you at the midmountain Mama Mia pizzeria.
The hottest (and reasonably priced) apres-ski spots include the Derailer Bar in the ski area's base lodge, the Slope and the Stampede. For dinner, try the Last Waltz, (303) 726-4877, the Crooked Creek, (303) 726-9250, Dino's Mountain Bistro, (303) 726-5332, or Finnegans on the Fraser, (303) 726-9845, all serving American food. A meal is from $10 to $20, plus wine.
Off-slope activities include cross-country skiing and tubing on a tow-serviced hill. For tubing, call (303) 726-5954; it cost $9 an hour last year.
Deluxe -- The Iron Horse, (800) 621-8190, and the Vintage Hotel, (800) 472-7017, are about as upscale as it gets in Winter Park. At the Vintage, rates run from $105 a night for a hotel room to $360 for the tower suite in regular season. The Iron Horse is the only ski-in, ski-out property (the Vintage is close and other lodging properties are in town, about two miles down the road). In regular season, which at the irson Horse means Jan. 29 to April 2, prices are $140 a night for a studio to $370 for a two-bedroom, three-bath suite. Visitors should ask about suites with fireplace and kitchen.
The well-appointed C Lazy U Ranch, (303) 887-3344, a half hour away, has cross-country skiing and offers daily shuttles to Winter Park. Depending on the date, rates are from $90 to $165 a person a night for lodging, all meals, cross-country equipment and cross-country lessons on the ranch.
The dining room at the dramatic new mountaintop Lodge at Sunspot serves pasta and game for lunch. Ask about sleigh ride dinners to Sunspot; they cost $49, including the sleigh. At dinnertime, Gasthaus Eichler serves German fare, Restaurant on the Ridge offers Continental cuisine and the Divide Grill (not fancy but a nice atmosphere) has steaks, fish and a loaded salad bar. Prices for dinner at these are from $15 to $30.
Off-slope activities include dog sledding through the Arapahoe National Forest, or snowmobiling up onto the Continental Divide. Dog sledding, (303) 726-8301, $80 for two for 90 minutes. Trailblazer Snowmobile Tours, (800) 669-0134, charges $33 a person for a one-hour trip.

Seven nights' accommodations at the Sun Valley Inn (see reservations number above), a five-of-six-day lift ticket and a week with parties and activities costs $318 a person, double occupancy.

Packages start at $378 for Sun Valley's Winter Sports Week, Jan. 16 to 23, with a communitywide smorgasbord of winter sports opportunities like skating and cross-country skiing. Packages for Western Ski Week, Jan. 23 to 30, including swing dance lessons and other activities, are also from $378.
Other inexpensive lodging choices include the Lift Tower Lodge, (208) 726-5163, a four-minute shuttle ride from the new high-speed River Run quad chairlift. A tidy little motel with hot tub, it charges $69 a night for a double room. The Ketchum Korral Motel, (208) 726-3510, has a $45 nightly room rate ($65 over the holidays).
One child per parent, aged 17 and under, stays free in the same room with parents at Sun Valley Resort. If you book a one-bedroom condo with a separate living room, costing $160, or $260 for the deluxe units, one child could sleep free in the living room. Youngsters aged 17 and under also ski free from Nov. 26 to Dec. 19, Jan. 2 to Feb. 6, and March 20 to closing (around May 1). Many lodges in Ketchum also allow children 17 and under to stay free. The same program is available at participating Wood River Valley lodges.
Budget dining choices include The Konditorei, (208) 622-2235, in Sun Valley Village, which has great pastries, and Gretchen's, (208) 622-2144, in the Sun Valley Lodge, which serves salad dishes for around $6.50 as well as chicken and shrimp plates at lunch.

Top spots for inexpensive apres-ski life include listening to Mike Murphy's guitar at The Ram, the Vuarnettes at Creekside and the Drifters at the Elkhorn Saloon. Whiskey Jacques has dancing and hot bands.
Deluxe -- The elegant Sun Valley Lodge is sold out for Christmas Week but for the rest of the season rooms for two are available at $125, $150 and $172. Ask about upgrading to a parlor suite, such as No. 206 where Hemingway wrote parts of "For Whom the Bell Tolls." The parlor suites, which have a sitting room as well as a bedroom, are $275 a night.
Some guests request a room overlooking the ice-skating rink. They can also sip an apres-ski drink while soaking in the huge round, outdoor heated pool.
A day of helicopter skiing in the Sawtooth Mountains with Sun Valley Helicopter Ski Guides, (208) 622-3108, costs about $400 a day -- the exact price has yet to be set.
A skier can dine luxuriously in the Sun Valley Lodge's old-world dining room, or go to the Sunday buffet brunch ($14.95), which is elegantly served by the staff behind the laden tables, even though guests dress casually in ski clothes. Dinner in the dining room will cost from $25 to $50. Chez Michel, (208) 726-3032, in Ketchum, serves French cuisine, with dinner costing about $20. A sleigh ride can be taken to dinner in the rustic Trail Creek Cabin, little unchanged since Hemingway and Gary Cooper partied there a few times on New Year's Eve. The sleigh ride is $12 and $10 for children under 12; dinner prices range from $16 to $22; children's portions available at reduced prices. (206) 622-2135.
Visitors exploring Ketchum should visit Aventura (exclusive women's European clothing); the Galleria (smart shops displaying Western wear and jewelry), and the many art galleries, including the American West Gallery and the Roland Gallery.
 
MONTANA
BIG SKY OF MONTANA
Big Sky, Post Office Box 160001, Big Sky, Mont. 59716
(406) 995-4211 or (800) 548-4486 for information and reservations
Budget -- Children 10 and younger (up to two per adult) ski free here, and they stay free in some lodges too. (Lift tickets are half the adult rate for additional children.) At the ski-in, ski-out Huntley Lodge, children 10 and under stay free in the same room with parents. When parents reserve a one-bedroom condo at the neighboring Shoshone Condominium Hotel, children can sleep on the Murphy bed in the living room.
The budget-minded adult crowd books into the three-story Mountain Lodge, a five-minute walk from the lifts, which has sleeping rooms for up to four people. Each room has its own shower. For two people in a room it's $22 a person, and for four, $15 each. The Mountain Lodge, (800) 831-3509, also has condominiums with kitchenette that run from $95, for a unit sleeping up to four, to $400 for a three-bedroom unit with Jacuzzi bath and sleeping up to eight. The Mountain Lodge has a pub with live country and rock music, a TV and game room and an outdoor Jacuzzi bath.
The early season Right Turn package, good Dec. 11 to 25, include four nights' lodging at Huntley Lodge, three days' lifts, breakfast buffet daily and a 50 percent discount on rental equipment. Prices start at $234 a person, double occupancy, for the package, which also includes daily ski lessons, a ski race and awards party.
The Lookout Cafe, the skiers' cafeteria at the base, has hearty breakfasts. For light fare you can visit the New York Deli. These two have the same number, (406) 995-4211. Levinski's Pizza, (406) 995-4646, is a popular lunch spot. At all three you can eat well for about $7.
There is free cross-country skiing at Yellowstone National Park; trailheads are about 20 miles from Big Sky.
Deluxe -- One option is to check into a seventh-floor loft unit or a Shoshone suite at the Shoshone Condominium Hotel (call Big Sky), a ski-in, ski-out property with a pool, health spa and fitness club. A unit on the higher floors has the best views of the slopes and surrounding wilderness of snowclad, jagged peaks and lodgepole pines. The Shoshone Suites have a living room with a Murphy bed and gas fireplace, kitchen, private bedroom and two bathrooms. The loft units also have a second bedroom (partially open) with private bath in the loft.
In prime season, Jan. 3 to March 27, the package rate for seven nights' lodging and five days' lifts in a Shoshone suite is $1,067 a person, double occupancy. The prime season nightly rate for loft units (up to six guests) is $365 a night plus tax. You could book a private instructor for your group. Private all-day lessons are $225 a person; $20 per additional person.
The Huntley Lodge buffet breakfast has omelet and waffle bars. The cost is $8.95; children, $6.75.
Andiamo, (406) 995-2220, serves Italian cuisine; the Cafe Edelweiss, (406) 995-4665, for German and Austrian dishes. Dinner at these restaurants runs between $10 and $20 plus wine.
A sleigh ride dinner at Lone Mountain Ranch, (406) 995-4644, has to be reserved way ahead -- book when you make your lodging reservations. The sleigh, pulled by Belgian draft horses, heads to a log cabin where dinner is cooked on a century-old stove. Afterward, an entertainer spins yarns and croons Western ballads. The cost of the dinner and ride is $42; children, $37.
One of the most extraordinary nonskiing activities in ski country is a snowmobile (or a snowcoach) ride through Yellowstone National Park. West Yellowstone, where you pick up the snow vehicles, is about 50 miles from Big Sky. In the winter, elk, bison and trumpeter swans collect around the thermal geysers framed by rime-coated trees. Daylong trips go to Old Faithful or Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The trips cost $58.50 for snowmobiling, for one or two riders; from $55 a person for a snowcoach ride. These trips can be booked through the concierge at Huntley or Shoshone.
 
OREGON
MOUNT BACHELOR
Mount Bachelor, Post Office Box 1030, Bend, Ore. 97709
(503) 382-2442; central reservations, (800) 829-2442
Budget -- In addition to the usual daily passes, weekly passes and season tickets, Mount Bachelor also offers the Flextime Point Ticket. The Point Ticket is sold in two versions: 200 points for $33 or 400 points for $65. Each time a skier boards a lift, 13 to 20 points, depending on the length of the lift, are deleted from the ticket. A ticket is good for three years or as long as it takes for you to ski up your points, whichever comes first. The resort also allows skiers to share tickets.
Of course, if you plan on skiing more than 10 long runs a day, a normal day pass for $31 makes more sense. But the Point Ticket is good for late-risers, early-retirers, and couples who feel that the mountain isn't big enough for both of them.
Children 6 and under ski -- or can play on the slopes -- free. Children 7 to 12 pay $17.50 for a one-day lift ticket.
Fifteen dollars gets you a fully-equipped bed in the bunk room of the Mill Inn, (503) 389-9198, cooked breakfast and access to the outdoor hot tub. A private room starts at $35 for two, and a room with private bath is $50. The 10-room inn is well within walking distance of the town of Bend; a free shuttle bus to the slopes, 20 miles away, runs four times a day in each direction. Shuttle service begins Dec.19.
Inexpensive alternatives to skiing include a visit to the Crooked River National Grasslands, (503) 447-9640. It can be very cold in the wildlife viewing blinds, but glimpses of bald eagles, wild horses, antelope and elk are always possible, and free.
For $9, cross-country skiers have access to 55 kilometers of groomed trails that encompass areas declared by Powder Magazine to be "the best close-to-home back-country skiing in America."
Deluxe -- The Sunriver Lodge represents the high end of the Bachelor's accommodations spectrum. On this sprawling complex on 9,600 acres, complete with village mall, there are several hot tubs and a racquetball club as well condominiums. At the lodge's restaurant, Meadows, lunches average $20, dinners $30. Rooms for two are $87, or $110 from Dec. 18 to Jan. 2. (800) 547-3922.
The ultimate rarefied apres-ski experience is a trip to the Pine Mountain Observatory at 6,300 feet above sea-level, and about 45 minutes' drive from Bend. During thin-moon nights, the 15- , 24- and 32-inch telescopes provide a view of local stars, galaxies and planets that is difficult to forget. Visits for groups are organized by special arrangement and by appointment only, (503) 382-8331. A donation of $2 a person is suggested.
Among the little luxuries at Mount Bachelor are the espresso and cappuccino sold at the West Village (base) and Pine Marten (midmountain) lodges and also from a movable vendor wagon. An espresso is $1.50, a cappuccino, $1.75.
 
UTAH
DEER VALLEY
Box 3149, Park City, Utah 84060
Information and reservations, (800) 424-3337 or (801) 649-1000
 Budget -- Deer Valley is indisputably a luxury resort, so even the least expensive package isn't cheap. However, the ambiance can cost as little as $93 a person a night -- a rate based on six people lodging four nights in a luxury three-bedroom condo with fireplace and hot tub. The package includes three days of skiing for each person. The condo will probably not be ski-in, ski-out, but close to the free shuttle bus stops.
If you want to ski Deer Valley for $43, the cost of a one-day lift ticket (or $46 during the more expensive holiday period, Dec. 26 to Jan. 3), but that $93 lodging is still too much, there are lots of less expensive accommodations in the heart of Park City, 12 miles away or 45 minutes away in Salt Lake City. Call (800) 453-1360 for information about lodging in Park City. Contact Ski Utah, 150 West 500 South, Salt Lake City, Utah 84101; (801) 534-1779, for information about lodging in Salt Lake City. Price out the multiday passes at Deer Valley -- example: a six-day-out-of-seven pass is $234 -- and use the shuttle buses moving skiers around Deer Valley and Park City, or the inexpensive ski buses running to and from Salt Lake City.
Breakfast is cheapest if you cook your own in a condo, but McHenry's Grill is a good choice for lunch (on a warm day, join the sun worshipers on McHenry's beach). McHenry's serves grilled sandwiches, chilis, soups and salads, and a couple of these would be $5 to $8. It can be reached through the resort's number. Park City's streets are lined with inexpensive and moderately priced restaurants, such as Mount Air Cafe, (801) 649-8968, the Eating Establishment, (801) 649-8284, and Pastabilities, (801) 645-8898. In all three, dinner can be had for less than $15.
Deluxe -- The options for a luxury stay are abundant. A premium lesson package ($37) includes top-of-the-line skis, boots and poles. A four-hour "style and elegance" clinic is $55. If you really have an unlimited budget, you can plunk down $1,000 and ski with Stein Eriksen for the day. Deer Valley Photography will follow you around the slopes for a fee (approximately $500 for the day) that includes judicious editing.
Book well ahead for fine dining at the intimate Cafe Mariposa (booked through the resort), with its reputation for blending classic and current cuisines. Entrees range from $21 to $30. The seafood buffet at the Snow Park Lodge now runs six nights a week ($34, $17 for 12 and under).
Three nights in the 117-unit Stein Ericksen Lodge and two days skiing at Deer Valley costs $673 a person, double occupancy. The rate drops to $476 a person, double occupancy, in a one-bedroom condo. Amenities include a eated outdoor pool with a glass shield, heated sidewalks, a health club and two restaurants.
The ultimate extravagance might be purchasing a membership in the Deer Valley Club, scheduled to open Dec. 15. This ski-in, ski-out property will have full hotel services for members and guests, including a restaurant (limited service in the first season), lounge, clubhouse and fitness center. Memberships (which range from $82,000 to $124,000) include an interest in the entire project and lodging. It's like a private country club with 82 bedrooms in 30 condominiums. (801) 649-4446.
 
SUNDANCE
Box A-1, Sundance, Utah 84604
(801) 225-4107; information and reservations, (800) 892-1600; snow report, (801) 225-4100.
Budget -- Robert Redford's Sundance, perched on the flank of Mount Timpanogos, is more a retreat than a ski resort. Lift tickets at Sundance are just $25 every day and the skiing is very good. Cross-country skiing on Sundance's Nordic trails, which wind through the pristine Elk Meadows Preserve, is both a budget saver -- costing only a trail fee -- and a visual pleasure.
Two people ski free with stays of three nights or more in the resort's Sundance Cottages. (The offer must be booked at the time of reservations and is not valid Dec. 19 to Jan. 2.) The choice of these adjoining and elegantly rustic privately owned homes directly affects one's budget. The rough-hewn pine buildings are set in the woods, the most expensive of them in the new cottages at the base. Cottages range from $150 to $575 a night from Jan. 1 to March 31, less outside those dates, except for Christmas week. Lodging guests pay $25 a day for the two-hour learn-to-ski group lesson and equipment rental (not valid before Jan. 2).
Cottages have full kitchens and the resort runs a grocery shopping service. Continental breakfast is free to overnight guests. At lunchtime you can go through the cafeteria line at Creekside or have a bowl of soup at Bearclaw's atop the mountain.
There are only two restaurants open in the evening at Sundance, so skiers on a budget often join local residents having burgers or trout at the nearby Chalet, on the Provo River, (801) 224-4850, or drive into Provo for Mexican food at Los Hermanos, (801) 375-5732, and a stop at Johnny B's stand-up comedy club, (801) 377-6910. At both restaurants dinner can be had for $8 to $10. Johnny B's has a $5 cover charge. Other low budget entertainment includes the weekend performances by Sundance Theater, a group of local actors,of Broadway shows at Sundance ($10); and plays at the Hales Center Theater ($6), a theater in the round featuring local talent, in Provo, (801) 226-8600.
Park City, 30 minutes away, has lots of entertaining, inexpensive restaurants, bars and a brewpub called Wasatch. The cheapest entertainment of all is to check out one of the outstanding movies from the Sundance Video Library. Many of the Sundance Institute Films are on file.
Deluxe -- Visitors can book three nights in a Sundance Village Cottage, dinner in the Tree Room restaurant, daily breakfast in the Grill Room, one two-hour ski lesson and daily passes for Alpine or Nordic skiing. Cost: $499 a person, double occupancy, available Dec. 11 to 19 and Jan. 3 to March 31. A private instructor to show you the mountain and help your skiing can be hired for for $175 a day.
Those who like lots of space may reserve one of the luxurious Sundance mountain homes set in the pines. The Bullock "cabin," for example, has all the amenities of a luxury home including a large indoor Jacuzzi bath. Price is $575 a night during regular season, and it sleeps 13. Breakfast can be had in the Grill Room at the base of the slopes, and lunch or dinner in the Tree Room, enriched with native American art and Western memorabilia from Robert Redford's private collection. Most dinner entrees are $16 to $20; lunch will be about $8.
Off-slope activities include snowmobiling in Provo Canyon or around Park City, (801) 222-0882; glider plane rides over Mount Timpanogos, (801) 654-5831, and hot-air balloon rides, (801) 649-1217. A snowmobile ride costs $50 a person for two hours; glider, $95 for an hour; balloon, $75 for half-hour, $135 an hour. Through guest services, one could arrange for a chauffeured limousine ride into Salt Lake City (one hour away) for a symphony and an elegant dinner. The round-trip limo would cost about $150, the concert, $15, and dinner, around $25.

MAINE
SUGARLOAF/USA
Sugarloaf/USA, Kingfield, Me. 04947
(207) 237-2000; on-mountain lodging, (800) 843-5623; area-wide reservations, (800) 843-2732
Budget -- At this resort in western Maine, early season and spring skiing offer lower rates: $25 a day for a lift pass until Christmas and the same price most of April compared with the regular price of $38. During White White World Week, Jan. 25 to 29, adult lift prices are $20 a day, and a lift-and-lodging package is $59 a person a day compared with $80 to $100 during most of the season. The package, which includes one of the resort's rooms on the mountain, comes with a group lesson, Alpine or Nordic, and use of health club.
Another possible saving is offered by a midmountain lift ticket that limits the holder to beginning and intermediate trails. That all-day ticket costs $19 and is available all season. So is the minimountain ticket, good for beginner slopes only, at $5 a day.
Restaurants in the area offer two meals for the price of one on a rotating schedule on Sunday through Thursday, and the Seasons Restaurant at the Sugarloaf Inn, (207) 237-2000, has a popular family dinner special every Friday night.
If you still have some spring in your legs after a day of downhill or cross-country, there's always free skating at Sugarloaf Inn. During school vacation weeks, children's festivals and day and night activities -- sliding, movies and such -- are often free.
When slopeside activities pall, visitors may take in the Stanley Museum in Kingfield, about 16 miles away, and get an eyeful of three old Stanley Steamer cars -- 1905, 1910 and 1916 -- produced by the brothers F. E. and F. O. Stanley. These are working cars, not just museum pieces. As an added fillip, the museum also displays photographs by Chansonetta Stanley Emmons (1858-1937), sister of the twins F. E. and F. O. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M.; the suggested donation is $1 and 50 cents for children. Closed in November and April.
Deluxe -- The penthouse suite at Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel has three bedrooms, hot tub and sauna, and the rate is $350 and $500 a night, depending on the season.
A private skiing instructor costs $250 a day. At the Sugartree Health Club, a half-hour massage costs $30, an hour is $48, and an hour and a half is $60. A session with a certified personal trainer is $25; the trainer will also do a body composition analysis. Three sessions cost $65.
Visitors can also take a ride on a two-person dog sled pulled by a team of Samoyeds. A 25-minute trip costs $50.
For dining, try One Stanley Avenue in Kingfield, (207) 265-5541 -- reopening Dec. 1. A memorable meal for two will cost about $80, including a bottle of wine. The classic Maine cuisine includes roast duck with rhubarb glaze, sweetbreads with chives in applejack, maple cider chicken, and dilled lobster in a cream sauce on a bed of shredded zucchini.
Arabella's, in Sugarloaf Village Center, (207) 237-2262, charges about $55 a couple, including wine, for dinner. It blends New England, French and American cuisine, an example being one appetizer, smoked Maine mussel in a cream vin blanc sauce over angel hair pasta.
 
NEW HAMPSHIRE
LOON MOUNTAIN
Loon Mountain, Kancamagus Highway, Lincoln, N.H.03251
(603) 745-8111; snow conditions, (603) 745-8100; lodging, (800) 229-7829, ext. 5262, or (800) 227-4191
Budget -- For skiers who want to save time or money or both, Loon has introduced pay-by-the-run ticketing. With this plan, available on weekdays, skiers buy a quantity of points instead of a regular all-day lift ticket. The points are bar-coded on their tickets and each lift has a designated point value that is deducted by an electronic scanner before riding. This allows skiers to ski for part of a day or take only a few rides, and the tickets are good for the entire season.
Early and late season -- from opening until Dec. 13 and from March 29 until closing -- provide the best lift ticket deals at Loon, with prices at $20 a day for adults and $14 for juniors, versus $32 and $21 during the regular season. Loon also has a new reduced price ticket at $26 for skiers age 13 to 21 for the regular season.
An instruction bargain for advanced skiers who want to perfect their skills is the Hard Core Ski Clinics that specialize in steeps, bumps, powder or hardpack, depending on snow conditions. These classes are $25 for two hours of intensive skiing. For skiers 50 and over, the Flying 50's Plus program is offered on Thursdays and Fridays. Skiers join the program for $15 and for $21 a day get a morning snack, all-day guided skiing and lift tickets.
Midweek during non-holiday periods, skiers can stay at the Mountain Club on Loon (800-433-3413), within skiing distance to the lifts, for $69.95 per person, per night, double occupancy. The packages include daily lift tickets and for an additional $25 per person, breakfast and dinner are also included.
The best meal deals at the mountain can be found in any of the cafeterias in the two base lodges or mid-mountain at Camp 3 or at the top of the Gondola in the Summit Lodge.
Deluxe -- The weekend and holiday rates at the Mountain Club on Loon range from $159 for a room up to $369 for a three-room suite on the top floor with a broad view of the mountain. Both full-price and bargain-package guests have free access to the fitness club in the hotel, which has workout equipment, an outdoor hot tub, racquetball, saunas, steam rooms and an indoor swimming pool.
While the Mountain Club has Rachel's restaurant with dinner entrees ranging from $5 to $15, the Woodstock Inn (603-745-3951) in in North Woodstock about three miles away, is the spot for an elegant evening of leisurely, candlelight dining in the Clement Room.

NEW YORK
HUNTER MOUNTAIN SKI BOWL
Hunter, N.Y. 12442
Information: (518) 263-4223; snow conditions (800) 367-7669; lodging (800) 775-4641 and (518) 263-4641
 Budget -- Hunter's daily adult lift ticket went up $1 to $39 this season, but several other prices went down. Children 12 and under, for instance, ski free during midweek nonholiday periods when they are accompanied by an adult who buys a lift ticket; second and third children with the same adult pay half the regular $26 junior price. To give skiers age 13 to 17 a break, a new Youth ticket has been introduced at $32.
The beginner package that includes a lift ticket, class lesson and rental equipment has been reduced from $52 to $48. Seniors, 65 and older, pay the junior price of $26 for a lift ticket, while those 70 and over who are members of the 70 Plus Club (which they can join for a $5-lifetime membership fee) can ski free.
Inexpensive meals in Hunter's base lodge begin with the Pizza Bar ($1.25 a slice) and Colonel Hall's Soup Bar ($1.50) up to the cafeteria with burgers, franks and snacks. Jerry's Deli has sandwiches from $3.95.
The lowest-priced accommodations in the region can be found at the bed and breakfast inns for about $85 a room per night; the resort's new telephone reservation service (number above) can help with arrangements 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Deluxe -- Luxury is not Hunter's main appeal, but occasionally a bit of elegance is added to the scene. The Gallery in the base lodge, for instance, exhibits arts and crafts of local artists with a few works at higher prices as well as many less expensive pieces. Hunter's deluxe skiing offering is a two-hour private lesson with an instructor, who is proficient enough to be an examiner of other instructors, for $95 for the first person, $30 for each additional student. High-performance demonstration skis can be rented daily for $27.50 or, with boots and poles, for $45.50.
In the base lodge, The Restaurant offers dining with waiter service and wide-open views of the slopes with lunches ranging from $5.50 for burgers to $12.95 for main entrees. The Sushi Bar in the Summit Lounge serves all day with prices beginning at $3 an item. For evening meals starting at around $30 a person, there are La Griglia in Windham, (518) 734-4499, serving Italian food; Chateau Belleview in Tannersville, (518) 589-5525, French, and the Swiss Chalet (formerly Werner's Swiss Chalet) in Hunter, (518) 589-5445, with Continental dishes.
The Liftside condominiums offer ski-in, ski-out access (when there is natural snow on the ground), plus fireplaces, cable TV, washer-dryers and whirlpools. Prices per night are $225 for a one-bedroom unit that sleeps four, $300 for two bedrooms or $375 for three bedrooms. The two and three-bedroom condos both sleep up to six people.
The nearby Scribner Hollow Lodge, (800) 395-4683, has a variety of accommodations ranging from theme rooms, decorated like a hunting lodge or a Southwestern adobe to a penthouse suite. The basic room rate, which includes two meals, is $72 weekdays and $80 weekends, per person, double occupancy. The two-bedroom penthouse suite with a sunken living room, fireplace, stereo and large balcony is $140 weekdays and $175 weekends, a person, double occupancy. Scribner Hollow also has an indoor pool that is designed like an underground cave with four waterfalls, plus a Jacuzzi bath, saunas, a massage room and an adjacent cocktail bar.
 
VERMONT
STOWE
Stowe Mountain Resort, Stowe, Vt. 05672
(802) 253-7311; information and central reservations, (800) 247-8693; reservations for Inn at the Mountain and adjacent condominums, (800) 253-4754; ski conditions, (802) 253-2222
Budget -- One of the best things in Stowe is free. It's the 5.3-mile paved Recreation Path, which links town and surrounds, by bicycle in summer, on cross-country skis in winter. Another 100 kilometers of interconnected cross-country trails can be reached with the purchase of a single ticket costing $8.
While Stowe lift tickets are among the most expensive in Vermont, buying a multiday package -- as at most areas -- brings down the price. Last season Stowe charged $39 for a single day; at this writing it had not announced this season's price for a daily ticket. Multiday tickets this season will be $70 for two days, $102 for three, $134 for four, $165 for five.
This year the ski area is offering free skiing and lodging for each child under 12 accompanied by a parent who buys lodging for at least five days. It also has the Two-Day Guarantee. If the owner of a two-day pass doesn't like the look of conditions on the second morning, and returns the ticket by 8:50 A.M., he or she gets either a refund for the difference between a one- and two-day ticket or a voucher for another full day's skiing.
Lodging at lower cost -- compared with several other local accommodations -- can be had at the Sun and Ski, (800) 448-5223, which will charge $61 for a room on weekdays in January and March, $65 in February. Weekend rates will be $77 in January and March, $81 in February. These rates are for two people and include a home-baked breakfast buffet. The Sun and Ski is five miles from the slopes.
Cheaper still is the simple but comfortable Vermont State Ski Dorm and Hostel, (802) 253-4010, which from Dec 1 to April charges $27.50 a person, including dinner and breakfast, for a bed in a communal room. Book ahead. There are men's and women's sections and a common room with fireplace. Most guests are young people who walk the quarter mile or so to the slopes.
Stowe's best food buys are McCarthy's, (802) 253-8626, for breakfast and lunch; China Garden, (802) 253-7191, for Cantonese and Szechuan; Miguel's Stowe Away, (802) 253-7574, for Mexican, and what must be the most discreet McDonald's in the country for burgers and fries -- it's disguised as a brick Colonial building and has the smallest of golden arches. Breakfast at McCarthy's can include pancakes at $3.09, while for lunch there are hamburgers from $2.39, roast pork and potato, $4.49, and Reuben sandwich, $4.29. China Garden's appetizers are about $4 and main dishes from $5 to $10. At Miguel's a favorite dish is fajitas with beef or shrimp, warm tortillas, rice, beans and a vegetable for $12.50. An enchilada plate is $9.75. You can eat well for about $15. Mexican beers are $3 a bottle.
Deluxe -- Among the top-of-the-line hostelries are Topnotch at Stowe, (800) 451-8686, which houses Stowe's only true spa, and has room rates of $77 to $112 a person a day, depending on size and location of room, in ski season. Another is the Trapp Family Lodge, (800) 826-7000, where rates for a double room in the main lodge are $240 a night, including breakfast and dinner and cross-country trail fees. Three-night packages include room for two, breakfast and dinner and either cross-country or downhill ski ticket. With the cross-country fee, the package costs $597 to $669, depending on day of arrival; the downhill package is from $793 to $865.
The Inn at the Mountain, a New England-style inn that has been modernized, is among the accommodations run by the Stowe Mountain Resort, which owns the ski operation. The Inn can be booked through the resort's number; it charges $195 for two, including breakfast and dinner at H. H.Bingham's, a restaurant owned by the resort (higher at Christmas). The inn has a fitness center and restaurant.
H. H. Bingham's and the Cliff House have the same number, (802) 253-3000, and were refurbished recently. Cliff House is perched at the top of the Mount Mansfield gondola and is reached by riding the lift; the round trip is included in the set price for dinner of $35, excluding drinks. Among the entrees: North Atlantic salmon rolled in fresh herbs and served with a white butter sauce, and grilled marinated south Texas antelope served with a perigourdine sauce. At Bingham's, at the base of the mountain, dishes include roasted Vermont turkey with apricot chutney, and a shellfish stew. Entrees are around $15.
 
STRATTON MOUNTAIN
Stratton Mountain, Vt. 05155
(800) 843-6867; 24-hour information line, (802) 297-2200
Budget -- The $25 Frequent Skier Card saves $17 off the lift ticket price in early and late season, and $10 off in mid-season, except holidays. As at most ski areas, buying a multiday package brings appreciable savings. When skiers reserve lodging, a two-day pass costs $64; a three-day pass is $93; four-day, $120, and five-day, $125.You purchase the pass when you make your reservation; the ticket is waiting for you at the hotel at check-in time. A regular adult lift ticket costs $34 in midweek, $39 on weekends.
Stratton offers additional savings for families. When adults buy a lift pass for three days or more, they can buy a junior ticket for a youngster aged 7 to 12 for $10 a day. Children under 6 ski free. Ordinarily, junior tickets are $24.
Midweek lodging can be had for as little as $39 for two at the Lodge at Trout Pond in Londonderry, (802) 824-6608, eight miles from the slopes. The gray and blue painted lodge is a long low two-story building with 24 rooms, restaurant and bar, and rooms have private bath.
It costs $10 a day to ski the area's 22 kilometers of groomed cross-country trails.
Another diversion is the $5 sleigh rides that leave most afternoons and evenings from the Sun Bowl Base Lodge. A $4 cover charge gains entry to a Tyrolean Night with the Stratton Mountain Boys' oompah band in the Bear's Den at the main base lodge most evenings.
For hungry families, Mulligan's in the Village Square, (802) 297-9293, has sandwiches, steaks, seafood and a children's menu. A full-size hamburger for an under-12-year-old is $1.95. Entrees run from $11.95 to $16.95.
Deluxe -- When it opened in 1960, Stratton had the reputation as a playground for well-heeled travelers, and, by and large, it has retained its upscale atmosphere. The Stratton Mountain Village, which cost $75 million to construct in the late 1980's, is half Kitzbuhel, half Disney
esque Main Street, U.S.A., and while it's not quite as self-consciously posh as it was a decade ago, the finer things in life are still in evidence.
Von Bargen's Jewelry, (802) 297-2975, sells designergold earrings for up to $10,000 a pair. The Bogner Ski Shop, (802) 297-2767, features Melody, a one-piece ski suit that relieves liftline boredom by playing "Old MacDonald" on a sewn-in computer chip. It sells for $2,898. Neither look out of place on Stratton's well-groomed slopes.
Some of the most comfortable accommodations are in the Stratton Village Lodge, behind the base lodge at the mountain, and the nearby Stratton Mountain Inn, which are both Colony Resort properties and have the same number, (802) 297-2500. The inn has a restaurant and a small spa with sauna, Jacuzzi bath, whirlpool and exercise apparatus. Rates for two at both places range from around $109 or $119 a night in midweek to $165 on a holiday weekend. The lodge has 91 rooms, the inn, 120.
One of the resort's own one-bedroom, ski-in, ski-out mountain villas with a fireplace costs from $90 to $290 a night, depending on room and season. Prices are generally around $170 in midweek; the lower rates apply in early December and after mid March, and the top rate would apply on a holiday weekend.
Private ski school lessons are $45 an hour. Really dedicated students can rent an all-day instructor for $245.
The most expensive skiing package at Stratton is the Tyrolean Ski Week. For $275, it includes five days of lift tickets, small-class ski lessons and escorted skiing with an instructor-guide. It also comes with evening entertainment and ski rental, breakfast and lunch.
For dinner, the Birkenhaus, (802) 297-2000, is the top-of-the-line restaurant at Stratton, and it's right on the mountain. The menu is changed daily, the dishes are European in style, and entrees include Wiener Schnitzel, with prices from $17.50 to $20.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Housing Finance;
Freddie Mac Plants Its Flag in New York

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A BROKER named Marlon Pilossoph on Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx likens himself to a weeder. "I weed out the people they should not sell to," he says.
The beneficiary of these gardening services is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, which built a formidable portfolio of multifamily loans in the 80's. This year it has sold 40 properties that it took back in foreclosure actions in New York City. The company says it has been finicky in choosing new owners. Mr. Pilossoph was the broker in 17 sales. 
 But Freddie Mac thinks of itself more as a planter than a weeder. Last June this national mortgage investor, with home offices in McLean, Va., moved its Northeast multifamily office from Crystal City, Va., to New York City, in a recognition of its long-term commitment to financing moderate-income or "affordable" rental housing in the city.
What began more than a year ago as a small office at 575 Lexington Avenue, at 56th Street, to handle problem loans has evolved into a permanent office that is laying the groundwork for the refinancing of so-called performing loans as well. H.L. Van Varick, former manager of the mortgage portfolio of the American Savings Bank, is the director of the office, which has a staff of 42.
The first task has been to "stabilize the portfolio," Mr. Van Varick said. Arrearages of more than two months are running at a rate of 9.08 percent, the company says, in a portfolio of 2,300 multifamily loans in New York City. The loans represent $2.2 billion in mortgage credit, probably the largest investment by any financial institution in the privately owned moderate-income housing stock of an American city.
But beyond stabilization the office is preparing for a second phase -- refinancing existing mortgages, which are just beginning to come due. Most of the loans have five-year maturities but 30-year amortization periods. The refinancings are expected to evolve next year into new methods of lending to moderate-income housing.
For example, the Community Preservation Corporation, a consortium of banks that lends for moderate-income rehabilitation in New York City, may be able to expand its activities by obtaining advance commmitments for "take-outs" on loans they originate, thereby replenishing funds for rehabilitation lending. The take-out loans become the building's long-term mortgage. Low-income housing rehabilitation may get a lift from these advance commitments as well.
Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation that was established by Congress in 1970 to provide a continuous flow of funds to primary mortgage lenders. It purchases loans from these lenders, called seller-sericers -- in multifamily finance they are usually mortgage-banking firms -- and packages them into marketable securities.
In 1991 alone it purchased $100 billion in home mortgage loans. In the multifamily field it reported last year owning 10,655 multifamily mortgages with a balance of about $10 billion.
Access to mortgage credit is essential to the long-term health of the housing stock and the quality of living conditions for its tenants. The presence of a major investor that wants to "preserve decent, affordable rental housing, consistent with sound business principles," as Freddie Mac's statement of principle puts it, is a plus for New York City's housing supply and its suppliers.
Many rental-property owners in the 80's found Freddie Mac to be the only source of mortgage financing available. Led on by a few seller-servicers and underwriting standards that often proved inappropriate in New York, some owners overindulged in credit. Some expected rents to rise at a rate that proved too optimistic. Others underestimated increases in operating costs or losses from uncollectible rents. Still others expected to be rescued by co-op conversions.
WHAT the Freddie Mac staff is now finding in property-by-property inspections, and what the owner-managers who are inheriting foreclosed buildings are reporting, provides a foretaste of the problems ahead for the housing stock. How city and state government respond is likely to determine whether the abandonment phenomenon of the 70's returns in the 90's.
"Everyone is focused on water and sewer charges," said Joni Brooks, manager of asset resolution in the New York office of Freddie Mac. "They have gone up two or three times from the original underwriting" -- a reference to the economic assumptions about operating expenses made when projects are financed.
Initial underwriting also assumed a rent-loss factor of 4 to 5 percent as a result of vacancies or collection shortfalls. In fact, the loss factor proved to be at least 10 percent in some buildings because of "back-ups" in landlord-tenant court, Ms. Brooks said.
"That has a dramatic impact on cash flow," she said.
Put another way, the failure of many judges in landlord-tenant court to collect and put in escrow tenants' rents during landlord-tenant disputes results in permanent income losses to many buildings. Ultimately this "plays out" in less income available for building operations.
Another major problem in building operations is keeping drug dealers out. To many housing managers, they are the greatest danger of all to housing preservation.
"Each loan is different," said Ms. Brooks, who calls her group at Freddie Mac a "swat team." "Though the building stock is similar on the surface, the outcome is different building by building."
OF the 40 properties sold by Freddie Mac this year, all but three or four went to private buyers for all cash. Three buildings in the Bronx were sold to housing affiliates of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a nonprofit housing operator.
The buyers tend to be experienced owner-managers who already have properties with Freddie Mac loans. In the Bronx, for example, The Realty Group at 825 East 233d Street, in which Joseph Gershenov and his cousin Joseph Yasgur are principals, bought the building at 735 Mace Avenue in the Allerton Avenue section for $2 million, including a $1.67 million Freddie Mac mortgage, or three and a half times the annual rent roll.
The rent roll includes about 25 apartments renting for $250 to $350 a month, Mr. Yasgur said. The prospect of eventual turnover and rerental at an affordable, but a market, rent provides the financial incentive to the owner.
"Freddie Mac saved the Bronx from ruin," said Mr. Gershenov. His company borrowed conservatively in the 80's on about 25 of the 70 buildings that its principals own, he said, and used the money in part to upgrade them.
Among those who are grateful that the building is out of receivership and in the hands of new owners is Roman Tokar, the 46-year-old superintendent, a mechanical engineer from Ukraine who emigrated to the United States four years ago.
"In one and a half months there have been so many changes -- only for the good," said Mr. Tokar, who was hired by the receiver and kept on by the new owner. He specified one: the computer that operates the oil burner has been repaired. Manual operation has ceased.
One major systems repair that typically was rarely done with Freddie Mac loans was plumbing replacement. An owner who believes in it strongly is Leonard Shindell, who owns 30 Bronx buildings and this year bought the 44-unit walk-up at 1165 Grand Avenue, north of Yankee Stadium, from Freddie Mac.
"If the plumbing is bad it's like a cancer," Mr. Shendell said. He is doing a $170,000 rehabilitation, financed by the Community Preservation Corporation, after buying the building for $450,000 in cash.
In Washington Heights, the Farkas Management Group, based in Forest Hills, Queens, came forward to buy the 31-unit building at 607 West 190th Street for $335,000 in cash, or $10,000 an apartment. The principal, Jeffrey Farkas, said the company owns 15 buildings with 700 apartments.
With a rent roll of $135,000 a year, the price was 2.4 times the annual rent, about the going rate for foreclosed walk-ups in low- to moderate-income areas of the city. But seven apartments rent for $150 to $225 a month, Mr. Farkas said, well below the market rent for vacancies, which is $625 a month for two bedrooms and $725 a month for three bedrooms.
"I'm 32 years old," Mr. Farkas said. "I was able to get a 15-year fixed-rate 11 percent private mortgage on the property. In 15 years I'll be 47 and I'll own the property free and clear."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Spokane, Wash.;
The Mid-80's Boom Arrives in Time for the Mid-90's

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

DATELINE: SPOKANE, WASH.

 BODY:
WATCHING the downtown core of this isolated city of the inland Northwest spring to life one recent misty morning was like being propelled back to the booming 80's. Cranes and backhoes were cranking out new buildings. Noticeably lacking were "For Sale" or "Space Available" signs.
The conversation of local business leaders as they sipped their morning coffee one recent day was about an article in The Spokesman-Review reporting that Class A office space, now about $18 a square foot, had become so scarce that anyone looking for more than 60,000 square feet might be totally out of luck. 
 Industrial space, at around $2.40 a square foot, was also in short supply, the article noted, and rents in both categories rose compared to what they were three years ago.
In addition, major new retail projects were coming on line barely fast enough to soak up the new money pouring into town from the West Coast and Canada. And hotels were so busy that some had withdrawn their discount programs. At least one, Cavanaugh's Inn on the Park, was in the midst of a $10 million expansion that will almost double its size, adding 136 bedrooms, 3 banquet rooms, conference space and a ballroom.
All of which underscored a growing awareness, both locally and among outsiders, that Spokane, a provincial city of 177,000 people and squat buildings covering 57 square miles, is joining other second-tier cities like Boise, Idaho; Sioux Falls, Iowa, and Omaha as the growth areas of the 1990's.
In Spokane the change is being greeted with a mixture of feelings. Oldtimers, especially those who went through a decade of scarce jobs and hard times, are delighted, although some worry that the boom will turn out to be, as one at the end of the 70's was, no more than a boomlet.
Those who see big profits in their future are also delighted. And there are people who feel that the new activity is but a thinly disguised Armageddon.
The most outspoken advocates for controlled growth are the newest arrivals.
To try to prevent overdevelopment and the deterioration of the quality of life that has been going on elsewhere, Spokane County is making long-range plans.
Sandwiched between the Rockies to the east and the Cascade Mountains to the west and further cut off by national forest wilderness all around, Spokane depended on the vagaries of its three indigenous industries -- logging, mining and farming -- and totally missed out on the prosperity of the 80's.
All three industries coincidentally collapsed during that boom decade, ushering in a period of despair made even rougher by the partying going on in the rest of the nation. Indeed, shabby storefronts and vacant shells still dot many of the peripheral commercial streets. And judging by their chunky, old-fashioned architectural styles, they haven't been improved in years.
But that is changing fast as pollution, overcrowding, traffic congestion, high land prices, the drug culture and violent crime drive people and businesses out of the urban sprawls of the West Coast to seemingly protected inland havens like Spokane.
Between 1981 and 1991, Spokane County's population went from 347,600 to 366,000; the city's population went from 171,200 to 178,500. For both, the bulk of that growth has been in the last few years.
The value of having this growth take place in the 1990's, as far as city leaders are concerned, is that the city has been spared, as other areas have not, backlogs of vacant office towers. Nor are there hordes of lenders riding into town eager to finance speculative office construction.
Developers are kept at bay by relatively low rents, which still preclude high returns, at least for now. So the only buildings that do go up are those that are built-to-suit, said Charles L. Dotson, Spokane's director of planning services.
A particular attraction of Spokane at this time, said Mr. Dotson, also appears to be its strong work ethic, derived from its long history as a place that attracted both pioneers and those with strong, old-fashioned religious views, both of which make for a stable and disciplined workforce.
OTHER attractions have included the abundant water supply, drawn from the adjacent lake region of northern Idaho (a boon for parched Californian companies), large tracts of available land at around $80,000 an acre, utility costs about 50 percent below those of Southern California, a streamlined building permit system that can produce approvals within weeks rather than months and a commitment by the public sector to foster rather than impede growth.
Other observers suggest the recent migrations have also resulted from the energy and commitment of Bob Cooper, the man who took over the city's Economic Development Council in 1987 and pledged to lift the area out of its economic quagmire in short order.
Sitting in his spacious office one recent morning behind a desk piled high with papers, Mr. Cooper checked off some of the results: a massive expansion of local community colleges geared to helping train local workers in needed skills for the new businesses; an influx in the last three years of dozens of high-tech companies, service companies in the medical fields and wholesale distribution centers; contacts with the new Hong Kong money flooding Western Canada less than 100 miles to the North.
The newcomers, he said, are taking space primarily along the plains west and east of the city. Among the most talked-about arrivals has been a division of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group from Seattle, which Mr. Cooper called "Our Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval."
K. Philip Kelly, the division's general manager, said the company had indeed been attracted by the availability of less costly land here. In 1988 it bought 120 acres of hay fields west of the city. It initially built 216,000 square feet of manufacturing and 22,000 square feet of office space on 35 of those acres for a total building cost of $23 million. Land acquisition costs were not divulged but company officials say they were about one tenth what they would have been in Seattle.
The goal was to hire 80 percent of the 475-person workforce locally. Even so, the prospect of escaping the decay of congested urban areas of the West Coast appealed to so many Seattle residents that 600 of them applied within days of the announced move. "A lot had grown up here and wanted to come back," said Mr. Kelly.
Nevertheless, the policy of hiring locally remained.
The move has been so successful, both in terms of added efficiency and cost-cutting, Mr. Kelly said, that an $11 million expansion is now under way. It will add 108,000 square feet and 100 more workers to the present complex.
In August, Hi-Rel Laboratories moved in. The 23-year-old family-owned business with 13 employees handles analytical testing of advanced electronic equipment. Barbara Devany, comptroller and partner, said its former location outside of Pasadena, Calif., had become untenable.
"All the new taxes and regulations were driving us out," she said. "You can't even breathe there any more."
Here, she said, the company was able to rent 7,200 square feet of single-level space barely one mile from downtown at a cost of $40,000 a year compared to $96,000 for the same amount in Pasadena. The lease also carries an option to buy the property at the end of two years for $400,000. This compares to $900,000 for a similar building in Hi-Rel's former location.
"We'll probably exercise that option," she added. "We have clean air. No traffic. A public school system our people can use. It looks like a good investment in a growing city."

HEADLINE: TIMES SQUARE;
A Sure Winner

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I should like to submit my own proposal for Times Square. Since the area is one of the world's great fantasy lands for grown-ups, I have never agreed with the concept of office buildings being the basis for its renewal and revitalization. Quite the contrary. It seems to me that office buildings, other than bringing in people on a daily basis, would inhibit the fun, which is what the theater district and Times Square are all about. 
 My idea is that the area should be the first in the state with legal casinos. Obviously, the casinos would also be hotels, housing restaurants and shops that would attract tourists to the city. And architecturally, casinos, with their neon and basic garishness, would fit perfectly in this adult playground.
Finally, the revenues that the casinos would generate, both in taxes and tourist spending, would be a godsend to the city's economy.

HEADLINE: Executives the Economy Left Behind

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN with JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
JOE COOPER hasn't sold his beloved Corvette yet. But nine months after he was laid off from his $46,000-a-year job as a computer network manager at a Citicorp mortgage-processing center in St. Louis, he no longer sounds like the cocky middle manager he used to be. He has blown through $17,000 in savings, and in the take-it-or-leave-it job market of the 1990's, he blew one good chance when he told a prospective employer that he wanted a company car.
Gloria Walsh was let go in 1990 after 23 years as an advertising promotions manager when British Airways trimmed its ranks in New York. The really hard part begins next month: her severance pay and company-provided health coverage run out. But after 60 job interviews, she is still the odd woman out in the game of executive musical chairs. "It's more difficult the higher you go," she said. It's also more tortuous. One company has called her in time and time again for follow-up interviews. It "is still trying to find the perfect, perfect, perfect person," she said. 
 Martin L. Brown climbed the ladder steadily in 25 years at Du Pont, ending up as a vice president for manufacturing in Korea. But the company made it clear that he would not be granted a transfer back to the United States soon, and offered him an early-retirement package. At the age of 50, he began sending out resumes, something he had not done since college. "I thought I knew about re-entering the job market," he said. But "it was a black hole."
It has been pink-slip time for the white-collar set for several years. Now, even those who used to believe that they'd always have good jobs are being forced to scramble and to scale back their expectations. For managers who ate their vegetables, went to college, stayed sober and phoned home, the sorry-but-times-have-changed reality of the 1990's is hard to swallow. Instead of being wooed by headhunters and tantalized by multiple offers of ever-more-impressive bonuses and benefits, they are poring over want ads and worrying about how long they can live off savings, not to mention whether they can put a turkey on the table.
It's no picnic for former colleagues who still have jobs, either -- often they are burdened with workloads that used to be parceled out among four or five people. But for those still on the job-hunting treadmill, "there's this awful feeling that the rules of the corporate relationship have changed and somebody forgot to tell them," said Gwen Krause, an independent outplacement consultant.
Some job-hunters have become so desperate that they are promoting themselves with the kind of chance-in-a-million publicity blitzes used to sell thigh-thinning exercise videos or Ginsu knives. "You should see the blisters on my hands," said Jackie Hasenstab, of Newport Beach, Calif., who spent much of the last few weeks stuffing and mailing more than 10,000 cover letters and resumes to potential employers, with help from her friends and family. For someone who recently lost her job as a vice president at a large resort company, the price was high: she spent roughly $3,000 on postage alone.
The numbers are the stuff of everyday headlines -- a thousand white-collar workers laid off here, 500 middle managers let go there. They are the casualties of what economists call downsizing and de-layering as corporate America adapts to its ultra-fast crash diet. Even the Postal Service is laying off 40,000 supervisors.
After selling the boat and letting the athletic-club membership lapse, they are scrounging for spare change, letting the car repairs go and wondering how many mortgage payments they can miss before the bank forecloses.
Worse, says Warren Boeker, a professor of management at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, they may never again bring home fat paychecks. In the 1970's, he said, 90 percent of laid-off white-collar workers soon found similar jobs. In the late 80's, only about 50 percent did. Now the figure is down to 25 percent.
That leaves white-collar workers with "a pervasive sense of betrayal that is different than what I heard in previous slow periods," said David Bruce Robbins, a psychiatrist and author. And there may be scars when the economy bounces back. Even if they land on their feet, white-collar workers may never look at their careers or the future in quite the same way again. "The wizard behind the curtain may not be all we thought he was," said Dr. Michael F. Aronoff, an associate professor of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital.
 
'Tarzan' Swings To a Flimsy Vine
 Richard Daenzer believes in what he calls the "Tarzan theory" of employment: "You don't let go of one vine until you have the next one in hand." You don't quit a $125,000-a-year real estate management job in New York in the 1980's and head for Houston. But he did anyway.
"I came here for a great opportunity to work with someone who owned 50 office buildings, beverage companies, had his own Lear jet, and was worth a couple of million dollars," said Mr. Daenzer, a 43-year-old commercial real estate manager, marveling at how much the times and his own expectations have changed. "Three years later, he went broke."
Since then, Mr. Daenzer has changed jobs three times -- more than many people in his parents' generation did in a lifetime -- with his income sometimes shrinking as low as $20,000. He has become something of a professional job-seeker, and from where he sits, the future holds more of the same. As he notes, there is more empty real estate in Houston than all the commercial space in downtown Philadelphia.
"It's not just any old recession," he said. "When you read that General Motors is going to lay off 20,000 white-collar workers, you think, How could they have that many to start with?"
The last time he lost a job, in 1991, he was a senior account executive with a real estate consulting firm. Between plant shutdowns and foreclosures, many of the firm's clients found themselves holding real estate they needed to unload but were bringing the work in-house to save money.
Mr. Daenzer polished his resume, plumbed his Rolodex for leads and answered want ads. Finally, he used more than $10,000 of savings and wrote to 7,000 banks and companies that might have unwanted real estate and be able to use his expertise.
The mass mailing yielded five decent leads, which worked out to roughly $2,000 apiece. The trouble was, they were all out-of-town companies. Hamstrung because his wife had filed for divorce shortly after he lost his job, he dropped out of the running rather than risk losing custody of his two sons, Zachary and Benjamin. Relocating "wouldn't have looked good," explained Mr. Daenzer.
The exhaustive search nonetheless gave him a feel for how tight the job market had become. So when a job finally came through in January, at the Houston office of Breunig Commercial, a Dallas-based real estate firm, he grabbed it. But he's still not out of the woods. The seven suburban buildings he is managing are part of a parcel being sold by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency overseeing the savings-and-loan bailout. Mr. Daenzer's boss has said that if the deal closes he will offer to transfer him to Dallas.
Chances are, though, Mr. Daenzer will be dusting off his resume. "I consider myself a survivor," he said.
 
Whooping It Up, Then Facing Reality
 It took Joe Cooper years to get to the point where he felt he was living the American dream. It took only a few months for the dream to unravel.
Citicorp Mortgage Inc. let him go in February, along with hundreds of others at its St. Louis mortgage-processing center. He whooped it up as if he had won the lottery. At first.
"I thought I was going to make money," said Mr. Cooper, a 34-year-old computer network manager who expected to be re-employed long before the six months of severance pay from his $46,000-a-year job ran out. "Even though the economy was slow, I honestly thought it wouldn't affect me much because I was so talented and in such a good field."
Nine months later, he no longer sounds so optimistic. His family has gone through $17,000 borrowed against the equity in their house, and he raised the $1,200 December house payment only by overdrawing his checking account. He started a lawn-care business and tried teaching at a community college, but the part-time paychecks only reduced his unemployment checks. He says he may have to dip into his retirement account to buy Christmas presents for his wife and two daughters.
His departure came in part because of the computer system he worked on for Citicorp.
The system let the bank respond to mortgage applicants in 15 minutes or less, but Citicorp made too many ill-advised loans. When the Government agencies that buy such loans responded by tightening their own credit requirements, Citicorp quietly shrank its mortgage operations and consolidated them in Weehawken, N.J.
Mr. Cooper had a hint of what was coming, but his colleagues didn't believe him. His boss said: "No way, Joe. I've got 120 people working for me, and they can't fire anyone without consulting me first."
The boss's pink slip arrived that week, as did Mr. Cooper's. But the early warning gave him time to refinance his mortgage at a lower rate and pay off the loans on his-and-her Chevrolet Corvettes. And when he got a call offering him insurance on his two credit cards that would pay off the minimum balances each month in the event of disability or involuntary job loss, he took it. The policy came from another Citicorp subsidiary.
Job leads have been scarce. Networking is practically out of the question. Many of his best friends are in similar straits -- four out of five, to be exact. A local group of Corvette aficionados who meet once a week over lunch now wryly call themselves the Unemployed Corvette Owners Association.
The one solid offer Mr. Cooper unearthed through the classifieds evaporated when he made what would be a modest demand in less demanding times: that the company lease a car for him. The cost was only $1,500 more a year than having him tool around in his gas-guzzling Corvette, he argued, and a less flashy car would sit better with the company's clientele. The company agreed with his reasoning, but retracted the offer.
On Thursday, after four interviews, Mr. Cooper started work at MCI Communications, working with clients in designing telecommunications systems. The position pays $51,000 a year plus an incentive bonus, but the personal triumph was bittersweet. One of two finalists for the job was a good friend. "He was sad but pleased, because he said I needed it more than he did," Mr. Cooper said.
 
Lost Sleep at Night, Inventing by Day
 Henry A. Williams lost his sales job at General Electric at a time when most employees his age are thinking gold watches, not pink slips.
In the 11 months since then, the 63-year-old Mr. Williams has economized: he and his wife, Josette, no longer dine out, and for this year's vacation they drove to Ohio for a prep school reunion. And he has lost a lot of sleep. Mr. Williams says he now wakes up early and ponders his options. Mrs. Williams, who keeps the books in the household, says, "I just wake up in a general panic."
G.E. offered him a new job after it eliminated his old one, but taking it would have meant moving, possibly to Louisville or Cincinnati. He said thanks, but no thanks. His severance package amounted to about four or five months' salary. "The timing wasn't too bad, except for the economy," he said. "It's not easy to sell things these days."
Still, Mr. Williams has stayed busy. He set up a company with the chief of police in Ridgefield, Conn., to sell an invention that increases drivers' awareness of traffic conditions at busy intersections. He has also been selling cedar homes part time, as well as medical equipment for handicapped people. But his take-home pay is roughly 25 percent of what it was at G.E. Mrs. Williams's salary as an administrative assistant at the Juran Institute in Wilton, Conn., raises their household income to roughly 50 percent of what it used to be.
He says he misses the camaraderie at G.E. -- he drops by his old office about once a month, and still gets his hair cut at the company barber shop. But he says he has no hard feelings toward G.E., where he held a variety of computer sales and consulting positions at offices in Fairfield and Bridgeport, Conn. "I made pretty good money at times," he says, recalling all-expenses-paid sales-award trips to Las Vegas and Puerto Rico.
After he was laid off, he initially took things easy. He spent the holidays last year with his three grown daughters. He jogged 5 to 10 miles three times a week and sang in two church choirs, the same as always. He discovered that he liked setting his own pace so much that he passed up two offers to work full time in industrial sales. "Someone would have to be willing to offer me a pretty big chunk of dough to tie myself down like that," he said.
 
 
DEAR I.B.M. (OR CURRENT OCCUPANT): I'D LIKE A JOB, PLEASE
 First there was junk mail. Then came junk phone calls. Now get ready for junk resumes. Borrowing a page from direct mailers, some job seekers are papering the country with their curriculums vitae -- not just dozens, but hundreds or even thousands. And some of those job-seekers turn to Wayne Starr for help.
Like Bill Clinton, another Yale law school graduate (of a slightly later generation), Mr. Starr is a merchant of hope, pitching his message and his services to the people left out in the economic cold. His message: many white-collar workers are too timid. His service: For $500 to $1,000, Mr. Starr and his company, the WSA Corporation of Shawnee, Kan., interview job-seekers, write their resumes and choose potential employers from a data base of 10 million names. Then, for $2 a set, including postage, the company prints resume, cover letter and envelope -- sometimes thousands of them.
"Usually, we're their last resort," said Mr. Starr, who said he receives 300 to 500 inquiries a week. "We send out an obscene number of letters . . . and it works."
Enormous effort camouflages just how impersonal the mailing really is. As Mr. Starr is quick to boast, some 30 college students, working part time, forge clients' signatures in blue ink on the cover letters. A machine attaches a 29-cent stamp to each envelope (no metered mail here). Then the packets are either returned to the client for mailing or driven to a place that doesn't have the postmark of the mall west of Kansas City where Mr. Starr's business is based.
How many resumes is enough? By Mr. Starr's reckoning, anywhere from 250 to 20,000. The higher the executive, the more it takes. "The truth is, there is still some good hiring going on," Mr. Starr said. "It just means the needles are smaller in the haystack."
WSA clients tend to fight shy of identifying themselves by name for fear that their new employers would frown. One lawyer who was making $400,000 a year before losing his job as chief operating officer of a utility paid roughly $40,000 for 19,700 packets -- more than any other client -- and found a job as the top legal gun for a Florida company. A 40-year-old woman who had worked as a manufacturing executive for Becton, Dickinson and Abbott Laboratories shipped 5,250 resumes, a more typical order. Response: 32 job offers and one invitation to a date.
Many people, including direct-marketing experts, remain skeptical about the service. Mr. Starr's sales materials indicate that his clients average one interview for every $1,482 they spend. Telling your spouse that you plan to wire several thousand dollars to a Kansas entrepreneur you've never met "makes for a quiet evening," said Martin L. Brown, an ex-Du Pont executive who found a job through Mr. Starr with the Henkel Corporation.
George Orme, a direct-marketing consultant, said, "The issue is, 'Does he prey on people who are desperate or does he help them?' "
Employers also have their doubts. "They're being taken advantage of," John M. Pepe, chief executive of the hydraulic-gear-pump company John S. Barnes, said of Mr. Starr's clients. Perhaps because his company is in Mr. Starr's data base, Mr. Pepe has seen a noticeable surge in resumes in the last six months.
Robert Carlson, president of Barton Industries in Shawnee, Okla., is also less than thrilled that his oil and gas supply company is in the data base. "I have never hired anyone whose resume was just sent in," he said.
Even Mr. Brown, a fan of Mr. Starr's, says he comes on "like a used-car salesman."
Mr. Starr, who is 53 and partial to walking shoeless around his office, said his 17-year-old business, with 50 employees, will handle some 750 executives this year and gross about $3 million, roughly $4,000 per client. Payment is due in full and upfront. "We won't issue the letters unless we get paid, and yes, that cuts off a lot of people because they can't afford us," he said. "But you'd be surprised by the creative ways people come up with the funds."

HEADLINE: All About/Contracting Out Drug Research;
Speeding New Drugs to Market

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
RACING to get their latest products approved, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly farming out much off the crucial testing on people that determines if a new drug is safe and effective. In doing so, the drug makers say they can get reliable results faster and cheaper, and free their own researchers to discover the next lucrative batch of heart pills.
The independent contract research laboratories say that, with the equivalent of standing armies of scientists and experienced administrators, they can shave a year or more off the costly process. Not only can that save millions of dollars, it can also quickly propel the new drug to the marketplace, where it can start earning its keep. 
 In the arcane world of getting a drug to market, the first years are spent in basic research; the middle ones in clinical trials conducted on humans. The final stage in a process that in the United States takes perhaps 12 years is getting the product approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Just about all drug makers send out some of the clinical work. They range from Merck & Company, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, which spent a total of $988 million on research last year, to smaller biotechnology companies like Biogen Inc. ($43 million on research).
"We do it all the time," said Max Wilhelm, worldwide research director of Ciba A.G., the big Swiss multinational parent of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation.
Dr. Lawrence E. Posner, senior vice president for medical affairs at Miles Inc., said the Pittsburgh-based unit of Bayer A.G. of Germany sent 20 percent to 25 percent of its clinical research to contract labs. Miles spent $237 million for health care research in 1991.
 
Controlling Overhead
Outsiders Handle One-Time Projects
 Some companies are reluctant to discuss how much they use the outsiders. Research projects are the crown jewels in a pharmaceutical company's reputation and there is always a risk in farming them out. But so far, there have been few incidents to shake the drug companies' confidence.
In any case, drug companies typically "outsource," meaning hire outsiders, when their own lab tables and computer files are overflowing.
"The busier the companies are, the more you are going to see outsourcing," said F. Richard Nichol, president of the Institute for Biological Research and Development in Irvine, Calif., an independent contractor owned by the Kuraya Corporation, a Tokyo-based drug wholesaler.
The contracts also help avert expensive surges in overhead costs for one-time projects involving the organizing, tracking and analyzing of the experiences of thousands of patients. "We don't want to staff up for peak demands," Dr. Posner said.
Using company scientists to the best advantage is also a concern. For instance, biotechnology companies "are often selling equity to raise capital to do basic research," said John H. Timoney, a senior vice president of Applied Bioscience International, a contract research company based in East Millstone, N.J. "They would be crazy to spend their capital on things like field research."
And European and Japanese companies are glad to hire Americans expert at speedily fulfilling F.D.A. requirements. Ciba-Geigy saved "significant time," Dr. Wilhelm said, by sending some of the clinical testing for Lotensin, a blood pressure drug, to Besselaar Associates, a contract research unit of Corning Inc. (The process was additionally smoothed because there were a half dozen similar drugs approved or in the pipeline.)
Even a 30-day jump in getting a drug to market can add $10 million to the profit-making potential over the life of a product with eventual sales of $200 million a year, Dr. David A. Kessler, F.D.A. Commissioner, said recently. He was testifying on a new Federal law that requires the drug companies to pay user fees to the F.D.A. to finance speedier handling of new drug applications.
 
'Time Is Money'
Contractors Offer The Needed Edge
 With pressure to restrain health care costs mounting, and with competition multiplying from lower-priced copies of drugs as patents expire, it would be hard to overstate the importance of saving time and money.
The companies have long justified soaring drug prices by pointing to their heavy research spending. American, European and Japanese prescription drug makers plowed at least $24 billion into research and development last year, about 14 percent of their worldwide sales.
Industry analysts estimate that $6 billion to $8 billion of that went for clinical testing. They said independent contract laboratories had about $1 billion of this work, and their combined sales are growing by at least 15 percent a year.
Contractors boast that they are often quicker off the mark than their customers. Rick Hawkins, a founder of Pharmaco, a research company acquired by Applied Bioscience last February, says pharmaceutical company research divisons "are like the Queen Mary, with two men standing on the bow, saying, 'Stop the boat.' We look at ourselves as the U-boat," he continued, "that can move in and out very quickly. We understand the time-is-money concept."
But Dr. W. John Powell Jr., Merck's worldwide clinical research chief, says some contract research organizations, or C.R.O.'s, can be pricey. After receiving approval on Proscar, a breakthrough prostate drug that the F.D.A. gave the nod to in record time, Merck asked for bids from a number of C.R.O.'s for the follow-up studies it often contracts out.
"Some wanted twice as much as the lower ones," Dr. Powell said. "They were looking for an enormous profit margin. One can dissect out the critical parts of the cost," he added, and still allow for a decent profit. Eventually, the contract went to Basselaar.
 
The Top Players
In a Little-Guy Industry, 3 Big Guys
 The contract industry has seen some consolidation. Eight American companies have about $300 million in sales, nearly one-third of the business, according to Dr. Jean-Pierre Tassignon, a drug development consultant based in Brussels who until recently was Besselaar's executive vice president for Europe.
Applied Bioscience, one of the three largest contractors, acquired Pharmaco for $101 million. Jerry Treppel, an analyst with Furman Selz in New York, said the parent company, traded over the counter, would have sales of $178 million this year, of which $47 million will be from Pharmaco.
Corning became one of the top three by acquiring Besselaar for $55 million in 1989 from Dr. G. Hein Besselaar, a scientist who had worked at the National Institutes of Health and at Merck. Corning, a $3 billion company, does not break out results for Besselaar, but industry executives estimate the unit's 1992 sales will exceed $75 million.
There are also at least half a dozen privately held independent contractors, chief among them the Parexel International Corporation, based in Waltham, Mass.
A special advantage boasted of by all of the big three is simultaneous testing in Europe and the United States. Josef von Rickenbach, chief executive of Parexel, said such a double-barreled approach on a breakthrough drug can take just eight years. And that, he added, represents a two-year savings.
 
 
 
THE CONTRACTORS' FAMILIAR FACES

SEVERAL hundred small clinical research laboratories have sprung up across the country in recent years.
"All you need in the beginning is a telephone, a fax machine, a computer and a filing cabinet," said Dr. John Urquhart, a California-based consultant. Dr. Urquhart used to be head of research at the Alza Corporation, a maker of patented drug "packaging" that controls the release of a drug into a patient's system.
"If you get work," Dr. Urquhart explained, "you can staff up with people who have experience with monitoring and so on."
Most of the small outfits were set up by people who learned the ropes working for major pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Johnson & Johnson but then were forced out onto the market in a wave of consolidations that, for example, saw SmithKline merge with Beecham and Bristol-Myers with Squibb.
"The mergers threw a lot of clinical researchers on the street,"said Dr. Urquhart. "A lot try to jump into contract research."
That's just fine with the drug companies, which naturally prefer to work with people they know and trust. With the frequent use of outside testing, "the reputation of the pharmaceutical company is somewhat dependent on that contract shop," said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, director of the University of Minnesota's Prime Institute of Pharmaceutical Management and Economics.
There was consternation in the industry last year when the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, a Dublin-based contract laboratory with 300 employees, declared bankruptcy. Dr. Jean-Pierre Tassignon, a Belgian drug development consultant, said that at least a dozen important projects were temporarily plunged into limbo. "Investigators in numerous hospitals were not being monitored," he said. "Adverse events were not transmitted."
Dr. Tassignon said most of the defunct institute's clients took charge of their own projects. But some switched to other contractors, mainly to the Besselaar unit of Corning Inc., which bought the institute's assets in Europe and Nashville.
The continuing faith in contractors reflects the common experience built up in similar backgrounds.
"They know what we want," said Dr. W. John Powell Jr., Merck's worldwide clinical research chief. "Their statistical methods tie into ours. It is very easy for us to approach organizations like that and get really quality data."

THE ECONOMY
 
Waiting for France 

There is Europe and there is France and the question now for Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, is whether the agreement she negotiated with the European Community last week includes them both. Under her prodding -- and Washington's threat of imposing a 200-percent duty on European white wine -- the community agreed to deep cuts on its subsidies of agricultural goods. The agreement sets the stage for the resumption of negotiations on world trade. But while the community as a whole favors the treaty, France -- Europe's largest agricultural producer -- may not go along. With parliamentary elections set for March, the French Government is sensitive to the concerns of its farmers. How France will react to the pact -- and how the community will react to France -- is still unclear. "At first sight of this accord, I cannot accept it," said Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's Agriculture Minister.
 
The Numbers Favor Clinton Plan
 
The number-crunching economists at the University of Michigan -- led by Saul Hymans -- had some good news for President-elect Clinton. They ran a simulation of his economic stimulus plan through their computers and concluded that if Mr. Clinton's package cleared Congress more or less intact, the economy would move onto higher ground. They said Mr. Clinton's plan would increase growth to 2.7 percent next year -- from about 2 percent this year -- and to 3.4 percent in 1994. That much growth, the economists said, would bring unemployment down to 6.5 percent in 1994 from its current rate of 7.4 percent. Best of all, they concluded that while the Clinton plan would increase the deficit initially, it would not be a budget buster. "Including the added revenue growth coming from the resulting gains in income and employment, the net effect on the fiscal 1994 budget will be essentially a wash," the report said.
 
Fewer Jobs, More Overtime
 
Output at the nation's factories advanced last month, but not by much. According to the Federal Reserve, industrial production inched up 0.3 percent in October after losing ground in four of the last five months. The employment picture was mixed, too. Though the nation's industrial companies laid off 56,000 workers last month, for those still employed, overtime actually grew. "The industrial sector still, at this stage, has to be considered feeble," said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "Gains of this size are not adequate to bring us employment gains in manufacturing," he said.

Freedom to Syndicate
 
Television reruns are a $5 billion business. Trouble is, the networks say, they have been prevented from owning the shows they air and the rights to the reruns by the Financial Interest and Syndication Rule, which the Federal Communications Commission adopted in 1970. For years the networks have been trying to get that rule overturned. Last year, the F.C.C. modified it slightly, but not enough to make the networks happy. Then Judge Richard A. Posner, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote an opinion for the three-member panel that overturned the F.C.C.'s modification and much of the syndication rule. That ruling paves the way for the networks to own and syndicate shows. Last week a group of TV producers and local broadcasters, which control reruns, cried foul. They filed a brief with the appellate court arguing that Judge Posner was not impartial. The group pointed out that Judge Posner, while a law professor in 1977, had written a brief for CBS favoring network ownership of shows. Though the court is likely to uphold Judge Posner's ruling since it was unanimous, it may preclude Judge Posner's involvement in any other hearings on the issue.

Take That Tariff Back, Please
 
Last year, OIS Optical Imaging Systems of Troy, Mich., told the Commerce Department it was being hurt by cheap imports of flat-panel computer displays made in Japan. The department slapped a 62.67 percent duty on the products. But American computer makers protested, saying domestic suppliers could not meet their demand. Some Japanese manufacturers shifted production abroad to avoid the tax. Last week, OIS told the Commerce Department to cancel the tax. OIS was now "on solid enough footing," said Charles C. Wilson, its chief financial officer. While the Commerce Department usually lifts an import tax if the complaining company says so, that may not happen now. Because of the duty, several American companies began developing flat-panel displays of their own, which they feel should be protected.

Greenspanspeak
 
Not wanting to spook the markets, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, prefers generalities to blunt talk. Those generalities reached new heights last week when he addressed the Tax Foundation in New York. Mr. Greenspan told the group that despite lower interest rates, robust growth has eluded the country because banks are reluctant to lend and borrowers are reluctant to borrow. That has taken much of the punch out of the economy, he said. So when will it end? The credit crunch "has shown no evidence of worsening in recent months and may finally be retreating," he said.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Trying to Save the KLM Deal
While KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has been attempting to merge with Northwest Airlines -- the deal received the backing of the Transportation Department last week -- Northwest has simply been trying to remain financially aloft. Northwest has been hurt by the recent fare wars in the airline industry, and has lost about $800 million since it was taken private in 1989. Worse, the carrier has already used up the last of its $600 million line of credit, prompting rumors that it could soon be forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. Tumbling into Chapter 11 could cause delays in its merger with KLM. But last week word leaked out that a syndicate of banks, led by Bankers Trust, was trying to patch together a new $300 million line of credit for the carrier. To secure the credit, KLM said it would kick in $50 million -- it invested $400 million in Northwest in 1989. The money "will allow Northwest to meet its near-term financial needs," KLM said in a statement.

Neo-Nazi Fallout
 
As Germany's economy slows down -- the German council of economic advisers forecasts no growth next year -- tensions continue to rise as neo-Nazis take to the streets. That prompted a series of anti-Nazi, anti-racist rallies attended by leading German politicians, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But the ugly side of Germany's economic downturn is likely to have its own economic costs. According to a survey conducted by Meeting News, a monthly trade publication, of 200 randomly selected travel and meeting planners from government, businesses and associations here, 39.5 percent said they "would not feel comfortable planning a meeting in Germany," said Malcolm Abrams, editor in chief. "You might see attendance at some events fall. We know meetings pulled out of Arizona -- including the Super Bowl -- for not recognizing Martin Luther King's birthday, and Miami lost business for snubbing Nelson Mandela."
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Art Un-Appreciation
 
Back in the 1980's, when Masters of the Universe roamed Wall Street and advertising moguls were desperate to go global, the art market soared. But since then, sales have fizzled. Last week, at Sotheby's in New York, 77 works were offered for sale -- but only 51 found new homes. And while the auction house estimated the works would go for a total of $31.5 million to $40 million, the proceeds from the auction came to just $21.3 million. The major seller was Charles Saatchi, the London advertising executive. Mr. Saatchi, whose Saatchi & Saatchi advertising agency lost $103.3 million last year, put works valued by Sotheby's at $17 million on the block. But while many of those works went for half the auction estimates, at least Mr. Saatchi had one big hit: Andy Warhol's 1962 silk screen "Marilyn X 100" fetched $3.7 million, just under the artist's record price of $4.07 million for "Shot Red Marilyn."

Elbowing In on European Deal
 
While the European Community and the United States squabble over trade, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is doing deals. Last week the Italian Navy said it would buy 13 AV-8B Harrier fighter jets at a cost of $392 million. Harrier is a British-engineered and produced jet, but McDonnell will get the job of overseeing how the planes are snapped together in Italy. British Aerospace and Italy's Alenia will serve as subcontractors.

Putting Cars First . . .
 
Nationsbank, the scrappy, acquisitive North Carolina banking company, said last week it had reached an agreement to buy almost all of Chrysler First, the consumer finance subsidiary of the Chrysler Financial Corporation. It will buy $4 billion of Chrysler First's loans and pay a $100 million premium. For Chrysler, which did not disclose its profit from the sale, the deal allows it to focus on cars and reduces its borrowing in the markets.

. . . And Putting G.M. First
 
Chrysler isn't the only car company trying to focus its financing operations. G.M.A.C., the financing subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, said it would no longer finance non-G.M. cars sold by G.M. dealers. About 2,000 G.M. dealers nationwide carry other name plates. Non-G.M. vehicles now account for about 10 percent of G.M.A.C.'s $60 billion in worldwide wholesale and retail financing. With G.M.'s commercial paper downgraded -- raising the prospect that it would cost G.M.A.C. more to borrow -- the nation's No. 1 car company wants to focus on its own name plates. "We're focusing our assets primarily on G.M. products," said John Rines, president of G.M.A.C.
 
As roadsters go, it was something else -- a sleek Italian body married to an American chassis, propelled by a red-blooded Detroit V-8. But sales of Cadillac's Allante never took off. And while it was pricey -- $62,000 -- the sleek Italian-American hybrid was also a little too plebeian for the price (it had a manual convertible top). Loss-plagued G.M. said it would stop making the Allante next year.

HEADLINE: At Work;
And Now the 'Sticky Floor'

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
THEY are the workers who dispense driver's licenses, take care of the mentally ill and keep the paperwork moving. Some of what they do is the most difficult or aggravating work around -- utterly essential jobs that twirl the wheels of state and local government, yet pay badly and provide little hope of a better future.
Many of these workers are women, and the glass ceiling that so frustrates their female professional counterparts is for most of them irrelevant, a realization that prompted researcher Catherine White Berheide to offer a more appropriate building part to serve as a metaphor for the occupational frustrations of women. Ms. Berheide, a sociologist of work at Skidmore College in upstate New York, proposes the "sticky floor" as an image to encapsulate the plight of hundreds of thousands of women trapped in low-wage, low-mobility jobs in state and local government. "There are barriers to women at the top, but that's not the only problem," she said. "We're overlooking the bulk of women." 
 Ms. Berheide, in research done for the Center for Women in Government at the Albany campus of the State University of New York and released earlier this month, reports that 55 percent of the three million or so women in state and local government jobs across the nation work in the lowest-paying employment categories. Only a quarter of all men -- and just a fifth of white men -- work in those categories.
The employees in question are paraprofessionals, like home health care aides and child support workers, and "administrative support" or clerical staff. Women of color occupy the lowest classifications in disproportionate numbers: 63 percent of Hispanic women working in local and state government hold lower-level jobs, while the number is 61 percent for African-American women and 57 percent for Native American women, figures that Ms. Berheide believes reveal the persistence of racial barriers, even at government agencies that have worked hard to eradicate them. The "sticky floor" includes a third, male-dominated category, service/ maintenance workers, in which men of color are overrepresented. Workers in the three lowest categories typically make less than $20,000, even when they've been on the job full time for as long as 10 years.
The numbers have improved since 1980, but mostly because of a drop in the relative number of low-paying jobs and not commensurately with attempts to reduce inequality. "If you think of the efforts since 1965 and the Civil Rights Act, it suggests the problem is more difficult and intractable than anyone thought," Ms. Berheide said. "Occupational segregation is very resilient. It responds to efforts to change it by reconstructing itself in a new way."
THAT is at least in part because of something anthropologists, as observers of human behavior, have known and tried to tell economists, mere students of markets, for years: "women's work" -- jobs typically filled by women -- is valued less and rewarded less because it is done by women, not primarily because of market forces or the law of supply and demand.
Ms. Berheide argues that much government work is seen as "women's work" in part because it taps skills that are thought of as female: the ability to handle difficult people or to work with children and the elderly. "We have sets of norms about the jobs and the people who can fill them," Ms. Berheide said. "Who is good at making angry people calm down? Women."
Yet "people skills" are not in job descriptions. "We don't recognize or compensate for the grief workers take from the public: angry citizens in line or on the phone," Ms. Berheide said. "They are relatively powerless to do what the citizen wants them to do."
Although Ms. Berheide's study is based on data collected from state and local governments by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she thinks it can be generalized to the Federal Government and to large corporations that have the same well-defined career paths and job classifications as government. She warns that the employee's point of entry into an organization sets a career trajectory. Only an employer willing to beat down structural barriers -- and there are some, especially in government -- is likely to provide upward mobility to employees who begin in the lowest categories. "It requires acknowledging the socio-emotional content of work," Ms. Berheide said. "We have to go outside of the way we've usually thought about these things."

Riding Into the Multimedia Digital Age

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
AS corporate vice president and general manager of the multimedia division, Lucie J. Fjeldstad is one of the highest-ranking women in the International Business Machines Corporation. Raised on a cattle ranch in California (which is still in the family), she now lives in Stamford, Conn., and rides herd over I.B.M.'s worldwide strategy for interactive multimedia and high-performance network computing.
Question: We're told we're entering the digital age. What does that mean? 
 Answer: The digital age is when all information gets translated into the same language of ones and zeroes, the language of the computer. There will be a new medium; you'll be able to mix text and graphics and audio and full-motion video to really get the information you need, wherever, whenever you need it.
Q: Is education the prime use?
A: We're now coming into the knowledge age. When my grandparents were growing up, what you learned, you learned for a lifetime. Now it lasts you about 27 nanoseconds. American businesses spend $45 billion a year on training and retraining, and that's just for the basic skills. So any way you can do it cheaper. . . .
Q: What technologies are needed?
A: You need a network infrastructure, a national data highway, which we believe will come on stream in the next two to four years, wired and wireless. You need switching and routing capability that allows you to send mixed media over the network at gigabit speeds, to be able to manage the quality and the guts of full-motion video, and to make it interactive. You also need a user interface, probably a combination of voice and touch.
Q: Thanks to cable TV, 60 million American households are now wired with coaxial cable. Can we use that for the network?
A: Yes. Five years ago, people thought that this would require rewiring America. We don't have to change the wire. You have to put some electronics on it, but you don't have to rewire. That's important.
Q: Five years from now, how will this technology change the way you do your job?
A: Well, I don't think I'd be stationed in Kenya yet. But I'd very much like to operate from the ranch. The short answer is that I don't think we know how we're going to operate. But I believe that we're heading toward a time when knowledge -- not brick and mortar, not guns -- is power. It's a journey, not an event. But we can get there.

Bubble, Bubble, Less Soil and Trouble

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. CALEM

 BODY:
What can a washing machine learn from a seltzer bottle? More, perhaps, than you might think.
While technology has rapidly remade so many products, washing machines have basically just kept spinning along the same old way. But the Sharp Corporation has a different idea. The Japanese company is selling a novel washing machine that uses scrubbing bubbles and an advanced computer to get clothes cleaner while economizing on water. 
 The bubble technology cleans by forcing bubbles from the bottom of the machine's bin up and around clothing in vertical and horizontal swirling motions. The horizontal swirls are generated by a computer-controlled pulsator on the bottom of the bin. In addition, the bin itself is smaller, with no holes along its sides and no central agitator. The design cuts water usage by 30 percent per wash cycle, says Sharp, which also asserts that the new washer gets clothes about 20 percent cleaner than with traditional machines. And it operates almost silently.
The machine has been available in Japan since March for about $800, roughly 20 percent more than what a traditional washer sells for there. It is Sharp's third machine to use the bubble-cleaning technology, which was introduced in August 1991.
In addition to the company's bubble-cleaning technology, the new washer can analyze the wash load in various ways, weighing the clothes, for example, to determine how much water and detergent is needed and how long the wash time should be.
Matsushita has also sold washing machines with such features for several years, and it says its washer can also detect the amount and type of dirt in laundry and automatically adjust the wash cycle accordingly.
Both companies now sell their machines only in Southeast Asia. Sharp holds patents on the bubble-cleaning technology in Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore, with patents pending in China, Korea and the Philippines, the company said.
Neither company would say when its machines might be brought to the United States, if ever.

For Three Whole Days, Everything That's New

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
PHOTO '92, the big photographic trade show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from Dec. 4 to 6, promises to be a crash course on what's happening in the kaleidoscopic photography world. The programs and displays cover topics ranging from economic changes in photography to digital imaging technology, from new products to copyright law.
For the serious photographer, careful planning is advised because more is offered than one can easily handle. The $25 three-day general-admission badge permits entrance into the four exhibition halls: Computer Graphics, Pro Lab, Presentation Products and Professional Photography. In all, more than 60 events and programs are planned for the show, which is being sponsored by the magazine Photo District News. T 
 There are additional fees for single courses and combinations of programs ranging from $65 to $465. They include these:
* "The Art of Photography and Computers with Master Photographers Ryszard Horowitz & Gregory Heisler." Mr. Horowitz and Mr. Heisler are among the most interesting photographers using computers today. They will lecture on the subject and show some of their pictures, describing how they were made.
* "Adventures in Location Lighting." Jon Falk will offer an expanded version of the popular crash course on multiple lighting that he teaches at seminars around the country. It is for photojournalists and photographers who shoot on the go. Mr. Falk is known for offering ingenious solutions for using equipment.
* "The On-Site, No-Prep People Picture." The opposite side of the Jon Falk concept presented by Ray Fisher, who tells how to solve problems with no special lighting, props or equipment. He will show you how to think on your feet and come back with smashing pictures.
* "Pricing and Negotiating Your Stock Photography," by Vince Streano. A nationally known photographer who stays on top of new photo business technology, copyright and law practices, Mr. Streano travels the world informing photographers about the changes in the technology and rules and helps formulate standards.
* "Color Vision: Color, Graphics and Travel Photography," by Joe Marvullo. Mr. Marvullo will offer an analysis of how to find outstanding color subject matter.
* "Lighting on Location: Making Something Out of Nothing," by Jim Karageorge. Fascinating explanation of how he adopted motion picture lighting techniques for use in still photography.
As usual, there will be new products at the show, from maufactureres like these: CANON will show the A2E camera, with automatic-eye focusing, for the first time in America.
SILK TWIN CAMERA PLATE will demonstrate a device that allows two cameras to be attached to a single tripod.
BRONCOLOR will introduce the HMI 575 lamps, continuous-source, cool-burning, daylight balanced sources with built-in meters that tell if the life of the lamp is fading.
MAMIYA will show its 6MF, a multiple format camera, in the United States for the first time. It can take panoramic, square or traditional format images.
FUJI will introduce an improved version of its Fujichrome 400 professional D color transparency film, which features improved red (warmer) rendition.
CALUMET will present the Zone VI 5 x 7 enlarger.
LOWEPRO will show a redesigned line of all-weather camera bags. The bags feature a built-in raincoat to protect equipment from a downpour.
THE RAPTURE GROUP will present the Toolbox, a high-tech selection of laser-and-sound-triggered modules for stopping action, like a diver hitting the water or a pin breaking a balloon. It is distributed by Foto Care.
Photo '92 will be open Dec. 4 and 5 from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and on Dec. 6 from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. A copy of a catalog that lists all lectures, workshops, seminars and special events is available from Photo/CMM, 200 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Conn. 06856-4990; or by calling (203) 852-0500; or by fax from (203) 838-3710.

Right Sandpaper Smooths the Way

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
VIRTUALLY all home-repair and improvement projects involving wood also involve smoothing it. But smoothing wood can be as much a question of choosing the right materials or tools as using the right technique.
Sandpaper probably comes to mind first as the material of choice. For use on broad flat areas, it often is the easiest way to achieve good results. When choosing sandpaper, consider the grade or relative coarseness, the type of abrasive and the density of particle coverage. 
 These are the most common grades, with their grit size and typical uses:
*Extra coarse, 24 to 36 grit, for removing thick paint or other heavy finish.
*Coarse, 40 to 60 grit, for removing large amounts of wood.
*Medium, 80 to 100 grit, for removing small amounts of wood.
*Fine, 120 to 180 grit, for final sanding before painting.
*Very fine, 220 to 360 grit, for sanding between coats of finish and for producing an exceptionally smooth surface on unfinished hardwood.
*Extra fine and super fine, 400 to 600 grit, for the smoothest possible surface between coats of clear finish on wood furniture.
Sandpaper coated with flint as an abrasive is usually the least expensive. It dulls rapidly, and because the particles are not uniform in size, it can seldom produce a surface smooth enough for staining or applying clear finish. But the low price of flint-coated paper makes that a good choice for removing paint, a task that quickly clogs, and therefore ruins, all types of sandpaper.
Garnet-coated sandpaper stays sharp longer than flint-coated and is also relatively inexpensive. Although its particle sizes are not as uniform as other abrasives, it is an economical choice for smoothing wood for painting.
Aluminum oxide and silicone carbide coatings are the best abrasives to use for obtaining the smoothest surfaces. Both outlast the other varieties and have extremely uniform particles.
Silicone-carbide paper is best for use with power sanders. Aluminum oxide, while longer lasting, dulls as it wears. Also, because of friction, it can create a glazed surface on power-sanded wood. Glazed wood looks shiny and smooth, but does not absorb stain evenly.
Silicone-carbide particles break when rubbed, creating new cutting edges. Therefore, the paper stays sharp until the coating wears completely away. Also, because the sharper particles generate less friction, the heat that develops is not enough to cause glazing.
The density of particles in a sandpaper's coating is described as either close or open. Sandpaper labeled close-coat has 30 percent more particles than open-coat and cuts faster. But close-coat sandpaper clogs more readily than open-coat. Although close-coat paper is suitable for most jobs and produces a smoother surface, open-coat is best for soft or resinous wood and removing finishes.
For smoothing the edges of wood, particularly after sawing, consider using a file instead of sandpaper. A flat or half-round smooth-cutting mill file, either single- or double-cut, is preferred. To avoid injury and to control the file, it should have a handle.
A single-cut file has one row of ridges along the blade and the same advantages and disadvantages as open-coat sandpaper. A double-cut file, which has a second row of ridges crossing the first at an angle, behaves like close-coat sandpaper.
To use a file, grasp both the handle and tip and push the tool away from you while sliding it across the surface. Make sure that the file rests flat on the surface, but angle the tool so that the handle is behind the area being smoothed and the tip is ahead of it.
Raise the file after each forward stroke. When the ridges clog, clean them with a file card or a brass-bristle brush. If the file is half-round in the cross-section, use the curved side for smoothing curved surfaces.
For the smoothest possible surface on hardwood and for removing paint or other finishes without sanding or resorting to paint remover, try a metal hand scraper. It is a piece of thin flexible steel, like a handsaw blade.
Although curved scrapers are available, the most common and easiest to use are rectangular, measuring about two and a half inches wide and six inches long.
The edges of a scraper are sharpened in a way that creates hook-shaped ridges, called burrs, along each side. To use the tool, hold the scraper at an angle to the wood and push or pull it so that the burr acts like a blade, slicing tissue-thin shavings.
A scraped surface is smoother than a sanded one and absorbs finish better. That is because the fibers are not shredded, as with sanding, nor do the pores become packed with dust and sanding particles.
Hand scrapers require frequent sharpening. That is done by first filing the edges square with the sides and then forming the burrs with a hardened steel rod called a burnisher.
To form a burr, place the scraper in a vise with the filed edge up. Lubricate the burnisher with oil and then hold it like a file across the edge of the scraper. Tilt the shaft of the burnisher down at an angle of about 5 to 10 degrees and slide the tool, while bearing down on it, along the scraper's edge five or six times until you can feel a burr on one side with the finger. Then tilt the scraper in the opposite direction and create a burr on the edge's other side.
Reburnish a scraper when it produces sawdust instead of shavings. When burnishing no longer forms a burr, resharpen the scraper from scratch.

With a New V8, Lincoln Introduces an All-New Mark VIII

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
If you are a manufacturer, New York is a good place to introduce a car. You can always find a backdrop that connects with your vehicle, as Dodge did last month when it trotted out its new Intrepid on the pier next to the carrier-cum-museum of the same name.
On Wednesday, it was Ford Motor Company's turn, and the introduction of the '93 Lincoln Mark VIII jammed traffic at 77th Street and Madison Avenue, which is the location of -- what else? -- the Hotel Mark. 
 That traffic, of course, is the downside of introducing a car in Manhattan, and the crowd of writers and photographers got to test Lincoln's five-passenger luxury coupe in the cut and thrust of East Side snarl. Not good.
But then, it should be said, there were those laps of Central Park, allowing impromptu tests of acceleration and braking, and affording the extra joy of scaring normally blase pedestrians. Much better.
Even if the clogged and potholed streets won't be the new Mark's main milieu across the country, the brief drive did show that Lincoln has come up with a quick and able competitor to the likes of Acura, BMW, Infiniti and Lexus and its traditional rival, Cadillac Eldorado.
Lincoln's advertising campaign, the biggest in the division's history, faces up to that competition by challenging buyers to "Drive Everything Else First," and one television commercial expresses the theme this way: "You have until Dec. 26 to test-drive every luxury coupe in the world. After that, there is no comparison."
As the ad indicates, the Mark will go on sale the day after Christmas, which is kind of a shame for those who like to give $36,640 coupes as gifts. But the date will also signal something of a new course for Detroit, which for the first time in a long time will be fielding both a Lincoln and a Cadillac that can compete with the best in the world.
Like Cadillac, which has put its 4.6-liter Northstar V8 into the Eldorado Touring Coupe and Seville STS, Ford has put a new 4.6-liter V8 into the Mark. The four-cam, 32-valve engine produces 280 horsepower, 15 less than the Northstar, and it drives the rear wheels through a new four-speed automatic transmission.
In traffic, the V8 is so quiet that it is hard to tell if it's running. But a heavy right foot produces a pleasant howl of power. The engine is the first all-aluminum V8 produced by Ford, and it does its part in making the new Mark 41 pounds lighter than last year's car, while adding 55 horsepower.
The engine resides under a weight-saving plastic hood that slopes to a gleaming urethane grille, one whose vertical bars look like cast metal, but also one that flexes easily, avoiding damage from minor bumps. The headlights flanking the grille are among the narrowest anywhere and they contribute to the clean look that extends from front to rear.
One slightly jarring note in all that is the vestigial bump on the trunk that is a nod to the "spare-tire" image of older Lincoln Continentals. The bump now looks nothing like a tire and might well have been eliminated from what is otherwise an exercise in slick sheet metal.
Inside the Mark (the hotel, not the car), Jack Telnack was holding forth on just such problems, talking about creating a fresh look while keeping the styling cues from the past. Telnack is Ford's chief of design, and he noted that the stylists were going for softer and more flowing shapes.
"We do have that slight indication of the Mark tire on the rear deck," he said. "But I think if we didn't put that on the car it would be like a Rolls-Royce running around without a Rolls-Royce grille."
The bump on the trunk, it turns out, acts as something of a spoiler and actually aids the aerodynamics. But the streamlining gets further help from technology. Whenever speed exceeds 55 miles an hour for more than 45 seconds, the suspension lowers the car by almost an inch, cutting wind resistance and fuel consumption.
With the new engine, economy is estimated at 18 miles per gallon, city, and 25, highway. Zero-to-60 acceleration takes 7.6 seconds, according to the company, and top speed is electronically limited to 130 m.p.h. Unlike previous incarnations and some of the competition, the '93 Mark will have no performance packages, and what you see is what you get. Mercifully gone, too, is the occasionally tacky "designer" series of Marks.
"Designer styling began with the Mark IV in 1975," Telnack said. "It was exemplified I guess by those oval opera windows, which is interesting because they were inspired by Raymond Loewy. He took the '40 and '41 Continentals and did a series of opera windows in the rear window pillars way back then. Of course, Loewy was also designing Owens cabin cruisers and he put portholes on everything. But he did it on those early cars, and I think it had some influence on us."
One area where a bit more of the designers' touch might be welcome to buyers is the interior, which seems a bit Spartan in a luxury car. To be sure, there is plenty of leather, but the sweep-around dash presents the driver and front passenger with a vista of vinyl.
There is no wood and little other relief from what appears to be relentless technology. "I think somebody described this as being straight out of 'Star Trek's' Enterprise," Telnack said. "However, we spent a considerable amount of time on ergonomics, as we are doing with all our cars, and I think it's one of our best."
The center console, with its sound system and information display, is indeed canted thoughtfully toward the driver, but gauges, switches and digital readouts abound. In this, as in its exterior styling, the Mark takes a distinctly different approach from the Eldorado, which is less aggressively "sporty."
Telnack said Cadillac's designers had gone for a traditional look with the Eldorado, and he is happy that they did. "They stuck with the formal roof line," he said. "But we've been more successful in the past when we didn't follow our competitors, when we went off on our own."
In terms of foreign competitors, he said, Lincoln attempted to cover all the bases: "We wanted to make sure that the buyer in America was happy, and we wanted to attract people who were buying European or Asian imports. I think we've done that, and I really believe there shouldn't be anything anymore that is just American or just European or just Asian. We're living in a global society, and I think this car feels very much at home on an autobahn in Germany or an arterial in Australia, or in the United States."
He added that the typical Mark VIII buyer will be 45 years old with a household income of $100,000. About 65 percent will be men, and 60 percent will be college graduates. And Ford is optimistic that sales will be better than those of the Mark VII, totaling perhaps 35,000 a year.
"I just took delivery on one myself," Telnack said. "It's black, all black. When it shows up in my parking spot, it'll drive the color and trim guys nuts."

HEADLINE: As the Steel and Iron Age Ends, Let's Turn to Lighter Materials

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Forty years ago I became concerned about the population explosion and environmental degradation because we in America subscribe to the notion that bigger is better and more is better. We continue on that course. The world population, then 2.2 billion, is now 5.8 billion and climbing.
As a result, we have more than 300 million automobiles and approximately 34 million trucks contaminating the air, and the water too, in their manufacture. If we use our heads we should understand we are coming to the end of the Steel and Iron Age, and the sooner we come to the age of composites, the better off we will be. The Voyager spacecraft, which circumnavigated the globe, should have taught us this lesson, but didn't. It was built with composite materials. 
 Composites are a combination of glass fibers, or boron fibers, depending on how light and strong we want the end product to be, bonded with a small amount of resin. This material would permit us to make an M-60 tank (60 for 60 tons) become an M-30 tank. It would cut the weight in half, cutting fuel consumption in half and the engine size in half.
This material could be used to build boxcars, flatbeds, tank cars and locomotives on the railroads. It would also apply to trucks, tractors and the transport used in the delivery of goods and people over the highways to whatever their destination.
And if we relaid the rails of the country's 40,000 miles of rail transit, we could employ every able-bodied person now unemployed.
The black gold of petroleum must be conserved for pharmaceuticals and fertilizers and not be wasted meeting the basic needs of the world's population. Our next President must keep these matters seriously in mind.

HEADLINE: Inefficient Soviet Economy Halted Cold War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The G.O.P. Won the Cold War? Ridiculous" (Op-Ed, Oct. 28), George Kennan argues that the Republicans cannot claim credit for ending the cold war. In "Credit Where It's Due for Cold War's End" (letter, Nov. 6), Prof. Richard Pipes asks why deny President Bush recognition for an "event that occurred on his watch." 
 Those who believe, like Mr. Pipes, that the United States and its allies were responsible for ending the cold war usually argue that our arms-race policies forced such a diversion of resources from the Soviet civilian economy that it went into an extended tailspin and had to sue for peace.
While there is an element of truth in this, it is not the real explanation. It fails to recognize that rising rates of military spending in authoritarian centrally planned economies need not lower rates of investment. Unlike the United States experience, Soviet rates of investment peaked at 32 percent to 33 percent in the late 1980's when military spending peaked. Despite the very high rate of investment, Soviet growth hit a trough of around 2 percent. Why?
Because the real causes of the continuously declining growth rate of the Soviet Union, of the poor quality of its products and of its many other deficiencies are to be found in central planning by direct controls. The Soviet economy was an economy run by bureaucrats without information provided by real market prices, without the incentives to be efficient enforced by market competition and without much incentive to develop and introduce new technology.
Recognition that Soviet planning was a failed system led Mikhail S. Gorbachev to introduce perestroika; along the road he also introduced glasnost and democratization, and by refusing to obstruct similar revolutions in Eastern Europe, effectively dissolved the Soviet bloc. These ended the cold war and earned Mr. Gorbachev the Nobel Peace Prize. The Republicans should learn not to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Mr. Gorbachev, with the extraordinary power at his disposal, could have lived out his life without reforms. He had great vision and courage, and one might wonder how such a person could have emerged from the pre-perestroika Soviet Union. Asked this question in an interview two or three years ago, George Kennan said, "It's a miracle, simply a miracle."

HEADLINE: Passaic Flood Tunnel: Some Questions

 BODY:
It's still going on! The Army Corps of Engineers is pushing another of its pork projects to destroy another part of our environment. This time it's a gigantic tunnel that puts floodwaters underground and shoots them out into Newark Bay ("Passaic Flood Tunnel: A Turning Point," Nov. 8).
Are we to ignore the fact that the floodwater is an integral part of three river ecosystems? And do we forget that the corps solutions to other of our problems, like the erosion at the beaches, haven't solved any problems but continue to blemish the environment? And what about all that money? 
 There's been $30 million admitted to in the studies. There's another estimated $2 billion to build this tunnel. Aren't we in a recession? Aren't people homeless and hungry because there's no money? Aren't we closing mental institutions and laying off health workers because there's no money? How come there's money for boondoggles but not for people?
Then we are told that the Federal Government will pay most of the bill, so New Jersey doesn't have to. What an insult! Don't all levels of government get their money from our taxes? Except for politicians, who would try to tell us that a different pocket in the same pair of pants is different money?
The estimate is that it'll take 10 years to build. Of course, that's also a corps estimate. Is that 10 years of patronage, padded accounts and sweetheart contracts? Is that 10 years of business as usual? And what if these estimates are wrong? What if it's $6 billion and 20 years?
What about maintenance after it's built? Who can maintain a 40-foot-wide, 20-mile-long tunnel hundreds of feet underground? Who repairs the environmental damage this lack of floodwater does to the river basin and to the water table?
Is all this to protect people who haven't figured out that if you live in a flood basin, you will get wet? Maybe it's time our elected politicians took a good look at the direction and purpose of the Army Corps of Engineers.

HEADLINE: Setting Record Straight On Affordable Housing

 BODY:
Frank Denniston [Letters to the Westchester Editor, Nov. 8] ought to do his homework before lashing out at my opposition to government-subsidized middle-income housing in Westchester County. It's easy to take a few words out of context, to mischaracterize another's opinion in as poor a light as possible and then to attack it.
Let me set the record straight. 
 I have never opposed helping our young, our elderly or our infirm find suitable housing at an "affordable" price. That's a straw issue.
I consistently have opposed government-subsidized middle-income housing. I do not believe government, particularly county government, belongs in the housing business, nor do I believe it is in our interest to give counties the power to override home rule.
Sure, you won't find anything affordable in Scarsdale, but most people start more modestly. Indeed, according to figures from the Westchester County Board of Realtors, during the third quarter of 1992, 32 percent of residential sales countywide were for less than $200,000, including 7 percent for less than $100,000. Just ask anyone trying to sell their co-op or condominium whether their price is affordable. Dozens of cooperatives, for example, are available in Mamaroneck for under $50,000, and many single-family homes in the northern areas of Westchester County are available for under $150,000.
Let's get the debate back on track. Our problem is not that housing prices in our most desirable communities are too high. Our problem is that we have lost thousands of jobs to the recession and to New York State's failure to keep its tax burden in line with the rest of the country.
Government can build all the so-called affordable housing it wants. But if we don't make this state and this county a more attractive place to do business, that subsidized housing will soon be competing with a lot more affordable housing as our residents flee this area for those states that are attracting our businesses and our jobs with their more rational tax structures and their more rational conceptions of what areas government ought to be staying out of.

The U.N. and the West Get a Little Tougher With Serbia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

 BODY:
A month ago motorists in Belgrade had to wait two days in line for gasoline. Now it's a matter of minutes. That, in short, is why the United Nations Security Council decided last week to crack down on violations of trade sanctions against Yugoslavia, and why the United States and Western Europe decided to enforce a naval blockade.
Whether such methods would have the desired political effect on the Serbs who lead Yugoslavia, and the forces they back in Bosnia, remained a question, however. Once last week, Serbs fired on French troops convoying supplies to a besieged town outside Sarajevo. The French fired back and got through unhurt. 
 The trade embargo, voted last May, has three aims -- to show that the world won't tolerate "ethnic cleansing" and the acquisition of territory by force; to encourage Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's hard-line nationalist President, to stop backing Bosnia's extremist Serbs, and to induce Serbs to vote Mr. Milosevic out of office in elections Dec. 20 if he remains defiant.
All three tasks seem difficult. Bosnia's Serbs, who hold 70 percent of the land in that former Yugoslav republic, have achieved their basic territorial aims, and President Milosevic has shown no sign of wishing to bring them to heel. Indeed, he is using sanctions to rally his people around him by proclaiming that they stand alone against an unfair world.
What might get rid of him and undermine the Serbian extremists, most Western diplomats in Yugoslavia believe, is to persuade Serbia's weak and divided opposition to unify and campaign effectively in the coming election. But this, too, seems a distant goal.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
For Vietnam, Settling the Past Could Be Good Business

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
A generation ago, the Vietnamese learned how American public opinion could help end a war that bullets and bombs and the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of lives seemed incapable of drawing to a close.
Now they are trying to apply that lesson in reviving a peacetime economy that remains among the most backward in Asia -- backward in no small part because of a 17-year-old trade embargo that is one of the last vestiges of the Vietnam war. 
 The Vietnamese want the embargo lifted. And this time, on the battlefield of public relations, Hanoi enjoys the support of former adversaries in the American Government and business establishment; many there think it is time to normalize relations. This time, Hanoi's leaders know, it is elements of the American public who must be persuaded.
The Vietnamese say their decision last month to open up war museums and military archives to inspection by the United States Government was entirely a humanitarian gesture intended to help the Defense Department determine what happened to 2,265 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina.
But as they met with a delegation of senators and Pentagon officials who traveled to Vietnam last week to discuss the search for the missing, Vietnamese leaders pressed hard for the Americans to urge President Bush to lift the trade embargo before he leaves the White House in January.
Vietnamese officials don't deny that they sometimes choreograph events with an American audience in mind.
The most poignant moment for the Senate delegation came at Hanoi's central military museum, as an aging Vietnamese army colonel, surrounded by American television cameras, turned over memorabilia taken from American soldiers during the war: prayer booklets, high school identification cards, family photographs, as well as the airman's helmet worn by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who spent five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
The colonel also gave the senators his wartime diary, which appeared to hold answers to the disappearance of four American soldiers in a central Vietnamese province in 1967. The diary says the soldiers were ambushed, their bodies hidden from rescue teams.
What has gone largely unmentioned in the excitement over the archival treasure trove is that the Vietnamese, after years of saying they were cooperating fully in the search for missing Americans, are making this material public only now.
 
Adventurer in the Archives
 Diplomats in Hanoi and American officials offer no single theory about why Hanoi took so long to open the archives and why the first of the artifacts were given months ago to an American adventurer, Ted Schweitzer, instead of to Defense Department investigators.
According to accounts from American officials, Mr. Schweitzer received permission from Hanoi's central war museum to go through its archives for material on a book on the war. Mr. Schweitzer came across thousands of black and white photographs of Americans captured or killed during the war. He turned the photos over to the Pentagon, apparently with the knowledge of at least some elements of the Vietnamese Army.
"Vietnam has a factionalized, bureaucratic Government," said an Asian diplomat, "I think one faction within the military wanted to hold on to this material while another faction wanted to get the photos out in time for President Bush to lift the embargo. They saw Schweitzer as a means of getting around official channels." Another theory says the Vietnamese just didn't realize the value of the photos until Mr. Schweitzer saw them.
Whatever the explanation, the Bush Administration, Congress and American business leaders seem eager to use Vietnam's full-access pledge to ease the American economic embargo imposed after South Vietnam fell in 1975. In a letter last week to President Le Duc Anh, President Bush hinted strongly that he would relax the embargo in exchange for continued cooperation.
Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and Vietnam veteran who is the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, said it would be counterproductive now to protest over Vietnam's long delay. "If we shut down our investigation because we get angry about what we didn't get in the past, we deny our families the answers they want," he said.
American investigators say they, too, have no desire to feud with the Vietnamese. "We're delighted with this new cooperation," said Lieut. Col. Jack Donovan, the senior Defense Department investigator now in Vietnam. "I'm too busy to be angry about the past."
The Vietnamese want to talk and, more important in Hanoi, they want to trade -- a desire shared by scores of American corporations that see Vietnam as the last great untapped business opportunity in Asia, a nation of 70 million people known for their industriousness and high educational standards, and whose labor is as cheap as any on the continent. The average household income in Vietnam is still less than $300 a year.
Boeing wants to sell jets to Vietnam. Citibank wants to do banking. Mobil Oil wants a chance to bid on tracts for offshore oil drilling. All have sent representatives to scout out future business. An end to the embargo would also permit the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to pour billions of dollars into basic service projects in a nation still largely without telephone service, reliable electricity and paved roads.
This month Japan said it would resume development aid to Vietnam. Business people from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and France have been investing in Vietnam for years. If the United States does not move quickly to establish diplomatic ties, American business leaders fear, they will lose the Vietnamese market forever, surrendering a country once thought so important to American interests that the United States went to war over it.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION;
Hi. Goodbye. This Takes 11 Weeks and $3.5 Million?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER four years in the splendid isolation of the Presidency, George Bush is finding the 11-week hiatus between his defeat and Bill Clinton's inauguration stripped of splendor, but still plenty isolated. Moody, fidgety, maybe a little bitter, he has fallen out of the hyperactive, quirky character that even critics found endearing. Instead, he steals unannounced from the White House for midnight visits to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; spends long stretches out of public view; proclaims that he is putting the Government on ice, in effect, until Bill Clinton takes over.
The President's moodiness is certainly understandable: just after losing a race he expected to win, he also saw his mother die of a stroke. But well before her illness, at a meeting on Tuesday that he had thought was private, he hinted at one source of his discontent. "I've concluded that the interregnum is too long, too ungenerous and too long," he said. "The gears are already beginning to shift, as they should," he added, and he is determined to transfer his power with grace. But he had a word for long goodbyes: "laborious." 
More visibly than many of his predecessors, the President suffers from what he characteristically described to Larry King early this month as "lame duckness." A uniquely American anemia, it afflicts every President who lives to see his authority and celebrity siphoned off by some smooth-cheeked naif who doesn't even own the nuclear-strike codes yet, for Pete's sake.
Still, Mr. Bush's perception that his case is worse than most is not so far-fetched. What he calls the interregnum, and everyone else has bureaucratized into the toneless noun "transition," is indeed laborious, and becoming more so. A mere post-election breather a generation ago, it now is vast, costly, labyrinthine, self-important, and rife with opportunities for back-stabbing.
It has become a sort of Presidency in utero, a cute little swelling in the belly of the system that now exceeds in size the Presidency itself.
This is a recent development. To prepare to succeed Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower simply dispatched the management consultant McKinsey & Company into the Government to find out for him what it did. John F. Kennedy essentially drew his transition advice from two men, Richard Neustadt and Clark Clifford, both of whom drew paychecks from the outside. By comparison, the last vanquished-to-victor handoff of the White House -- Ronald Reagan's takeover from Jimmy Carter 12 years ago -- had a Federally approved budget of $2 million, ran $1 million over that, and filled a Federal office building for two months with better than 1,000 Republican advisers, job-seekers and political groupies.
Mr. Clinton campaigned hard on a pledge to pare billions in wasteful spending and featherbed jobs from the Federal bureaucracy. His Congressionally authorized budget for the transition totals $3.5 million, but now his staff is saying they will, like Mr. Reagan, accept private donations to supplement that sum.
"It's grown along with the Presidency itself," said Theodore Lowi, a professor of government at Cornell University. "Once you get an institutional Presidency, which we've had since Truman, everything about it gets institutionalized, including the transition."
Is this really necessary? It depends. On one hand, most great democracies plug along famously without three-month hiatuses between leaders; two years ago, Britain's Margaret Thatcher was voted out of office and vacated 10 Downing Street in only four days. Helmut Kohl needed no more time to oust Helmut Schmidt and replace his Cabinet in Germany in 1983.
 
Transition Was Once in March
 Even American interregnums are briefer than they used to be. The Constitution, drafted when trips to Washington took weeks instead of hours, delayed Presidential swearings-in until March 4 and kept Congress out of session even longer, until December. The 20th Amendment changed that in 1933, after the endless wait for Franklin D. Roosevelt to succeed Herbert C. Hoover contributed to fiscal uncertainty and a bank panic.
On the other hand, Britain and Germany are parliamentary democracies, in which opposition lawmakers stand as shadow leaderships trained to step in quickly. Policies and personnel are ready, more or less, to be plugged in as required. Alone among major nations, the United States regenerates its leadership root and branch with every transfer of power, drawing largely from outside the Congress. As power has accreted to the Presidency, that has become an increasingly lengthy, messy and combative process, like it or not.
"Bush may think it's too long, but from Clinton's standpoint, it may not be long enough," said Carl M. Brauer, who has studied modern interregnums.
But many do not like it one bit. Mr. Neustadt, an adviser to Truman and Kennedy who is an emeritus professor of government at Harvard University, argued that an incoming President faces three signal challenges: to sketch the outlines of his programs and budget; to hire and indoctrinate the 50 to 100 people at the core of his Government, and to make the symbolic journey from campaigner to leader. None of them demands a huge, clanking transition apparatus, he said.
"Transition teams are nothing but large groups of ex-campaigners on the Federal payroll for a temporary period, wandering around Washington terrorizing civil servants," Mr. Neustadt said this week. "They all turn in reports to the people you've ultimately appointed to lead the departments, and those reports usually get filed in a wastebasket. And that's the end of that."
Mr. Neustadt feels a special responsibility for the process. Moved by the plight of a Kennedy aide who worked without pay and at substantial personal cost, he asked House Speaker Sam Rayburn to support legislation providing Federal funding for transitions. Unfortunately, he said, the bill passed.
"If there were no money, it wouldn't happen," he said. "And I'm sorry, but I'm responsible for it."
All but lost in the parade, meanwhile, is the inconvenient fact that someone else is still President, and will be until the succeeding Jan. 20. Every so often, an outgoing administration tries to make a little mischief: Mr. Carter, for example, used his waning hours to issue sheaves of "midnight regulations" for Democratic programs that Mr. Reagan promptly nullified. Some Presidents hide pet projects in their final budgets and defy newcomers to root them out. Mr. Truman, the father of smoothly integrated transitions, so opposed such skulduggery that he invited Eisenhower's fiscal experts to witness the preparation of his last budget.
As for Mr. Bush, he may be of two minds. He has publicly dedicated himself to relinquishing power "with style," using his remaining days in a non-partisan fashion to tie up loose ends. On Friday, he did that and capped his own tenure with a flourish, sealing a European trade agreement that may well hasten the realization of the only real vision of his re-election campaign: a new global economic order. On the other hand, Mr. Bush nearly saddled the Clinton Administration with a trade war over wine.
But Mr. Bush cannot dodge some highly partisan decisions, and indeed, he may relish making them. Atop that list is the question of whether to pardon major figures in the Iran-contra affair, a scandal with which Mr. Clinton bludgeoned the President in the campaign's last hours. Staff work on the pardons has reached high levels within the White House.
The President also is scheduled to decide within weeks whether to allow British Airways to buy a 44 per cent stake in a major American air carrier, USAir. He has taken no official position, but British Air's offer dovetails with his view of a global economic village, while it has aroused Mr. Clinton's more protectionist instincts.
Meanwhile, some of Mr. Bush's own aides are quietly discussing whether the White House should use other issues to rub a thumb in Mr. Clinton's eye, if only as a statement of principle. Especially tempting is a pending decision by the Environmental Protection Agency on the definition of protected wetlands.
Vice President Quayle wants one that eases development on millions of acres, and some Bush aides think this would be a fitting parting shot at Mr. Clinton and especially at his Vice President, Al Gore, an environmentalist. Their problem, and their boss's, is the anemic nature of interregnums: an outgoing President may still lead the world and control vast armies and billions of dollars, but the power has largely shifted to the new man.
"It's a question of whether to put our view down on paper so people will see the differences between us, or whether that would be viewed as grandstanding," one aide said. But the President, he said, "is not fighting to the last moment." Of Mr. Clinton, he added wearily: "He'll change it anyway."

 BODY:
In 1956, two 15-year-olds, Jimmy Merchant and Herman Santiago, doo-wopped their way to fame as members of the Teen-Agers, with the smash hit "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?"
What followed for them was 37 years of mostly singing the blues: Mr. Merchant is a New York cabdriver, and Mr. Santiago is unemployed. 
 But last week a Federal District Court jury in Manhattan decided that they were the true authors of the often-recorded song -- entitled to a share of millions in royalties.
The two said they were cheated by George Goldner, the producer of the record, who put his own name and that of the 13-year-old lead vocalist, Frankie Lymon, on the copyright. For years, they said, they were intimidated into silence.
Indeed, the jury ruled they are to share royalties dating back not the usual three years but all the way to 1969, the year of a death threat against them by a promoter who later acquired the copyright.

HEADLINE: FRANCE CRITICIZES FARM TRADE PACT AS 'UNACCEPTABLE'

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The French Prime Minister called a new farm trade agreement "unacceptable" today, warning that it posed a "grave threat" to French farmers but pointedly avoiding mention of a veto.
In a statement, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy noted that "difficult negotiations" lay ahead on the accord concluded on Friday by the European Community and the United States, but he left the door open to compromise. 
 Community officials have expressed relief that, so far, France has not threatened to exercise this right of veto in the name of "national interest." If France were to do so, the move would provoke a far deeper crisis in its relations with Germany and other major nations in the community.
European diplomatic efforts were also being made to resolve currency problems. [After hours of talks, European Community central bankers and finance officials agreed in Brussels early Sunday to devalue two of the weaker currencies, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, by 6 percent to maintain the system of semi-fixed exchange rates. Page 14.]
 
France Leaves Itself an Option
 Prime Minister Beregevoy chose to refer to the agricultural accord as a draft, stressing that while the community's executive agency, the European Commission, was authorized to negotiate on trade matters, the 12 Governments would have the last word. And he hinted at the sort of concessions that might make the accord acceptable to France.
Mr. Beregovoy's carefully worded statement was a stark illustration of the French dilemma. The country is caught between provoking an angry and potentially violent backlash from its million farmers and standing in the way of an agreement considered essential to priming Western Europe for economic recovery.
"We are dealing with the defense of France's interests, our agriculture, our economy, our rural way of life," Mr. Beregovoy said, adding that "the result of this negotiation will affect us for a long time."
After the agreement was announced in Brussels and Washington, French farmers immediately began mobilizing against it. But the deal was welcomed in every European capital except Paris as the key to unlocking long-stalled talks on global trade liberalization.
France stands to lose more than most countries from such an accord. Export revenue would be threatened, and officials fear a revolt by the farmers, who in the past have expressed their dismay by paralyzing traffic, dumping produce and pelting officials with eggs and vegetables.
Most telling, perhaps, is the deep connection between France's national identity and its rural heritage. France clung to an agriculture way of life longer than many other industrial countries. As the population ages, tens of thousands of farms are closing each year, but the affection for the countryside has not diminished with the shrinking number of farms.
At the heart of the French position is its reluctance to further cut farm subsidies, price supports and cultivated acreage after France accepted one round of concessions in May.
Calling the farm trade pact unacceptable today, Mr. Beregovoy confirmed the position stated on Friday night by his Agriculture Minister. Looking ahead to a Parliament debate on Wednesday, he also called for "national cohesion" regarding the dispute.
"We agreed to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy," Mr. Beregovoy said of the concessions France made when the policy was overhauled. "That reform is the limit of what we accept."
Put differently, France believes that any farm trade agreement with the United States must conform with the community's new policy.
 
Makes No Sense to French
 "We have good sense on our side," Mr. Beregovoy said today. "Europe cannot reform its common agricultural policy in May only to dismantle it in November."
Friday's agreement requiring the community to cut back the volume of its agricultural exports by 21 percent, he said, "is not compatible" with the Common Agricultural Policy. France has now asked the European Commission to prepare a report comparing the new pact with the community's agricultural policy.
The commission's president, Jacques Delors, said today that he expected "a battle of figures" when the commission meets on Wednesday to study the details of the agreement thrashed out by its agricultural negotiator, Ray MacSharry, and its external affairs spokesman, Frans Andriessen.
Mr. Delors, a Frenchman who in the past has been criticized for seeming to defend French interests rmore than those of all Europeans, nonetheless sought to reassure French farmers today that the community's negotiators "managed to wring important concessions from the Americans."
Britain's Agriculture Minister, John Gummer, also argued that the agreement was more favorable to Europe than France had expected. "I think, on mature reflection, the French Foreign Minister will feel that, although this is not exactly what he would like, it certainly does go a very long way to meet the requirements," he said.
Political experts here said that the French authorities, in the next political stage, will be in the position of having to establish that the farm deal with the United States and the community's own policy are not contradictory.
To cover itself and not risk being voted out of office, the Government seems certain to take a tough stance during Wednesday's legislative debate. Yet in the end, the experts say, its objective will be to demonstrate to the rest of the European Community that France is united.
That would, in turn, strengthen the Government's hand in negotiations on the meaning of the farm accord with Washington and the Common Agricultural Policy. And, the experts say, that could pave the way for the community to grant additional concessions to French farmers. To press its European partners, Paris may try to use the farmers' planned demonstrations as a bargaining tool.

HEADLINE: Clinton Treading Cautiously As Trade Talks Move Ahead

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton is holding off on embracing the agreement on farm subsidies between the United States and Europe that was announced on Friday, recognizing that the broad and complex world trade talks are fraught with political dangers for him.
The farm subsidies compromise, unless it is vetoed by France, is expected to allow global trade talks involving 108 nations to move forward quickly, seeking to reduce trade barriers in a broad range of goods and services, including banking and telecommunications. 
 In Little Rock today, Mr. Clinton was asked about the agreement and replied, "I haven't reviewed it. I've got to look at it." Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, added today in an interview, "He's encouraged by the progress" in the farm subsidies agreement. "He just wants to be sure about the details."
She said Mr. Clinton would take the same cautious approach that he took to the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, carefully reviewing the text of the agreement before deciding whether to endorse it.
The farm compromise, if it holds, will certainly allow Mr. Clinton to breathe a lot easier when he takes office by averting a trade war that could send world trade and stock prices tumbling. The breakthrough would also bring to the forefront other issues on which Mr. Clinton is likely to face considerable pressure from Capitol Hill as well as from groups that supported him, including textile and steel workers and the Hollywood film industry.
"The agricultural breakthrough is good, and the Bush Administration deserves credit for having achieved that," the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, said Friday night. "But I'm worried that now that we've spent a lot of capital to get that, the Europeans will demand a lot of changes on other provisions in the trade talks that will be to our great disadvantage."
In the coming weeks, the Bush Administration will be negotiating such sensitive issues as ending restrictions on apparel imports, reducing Europe's restrictions on broadcast of American films on television and responding to Europe's demands that Washington weaken its antidumping laws. The talks are being held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which oversees world trade.
If the agreement is not completed by Jan. 20, Mr. Clinton's team would take over these difficult negotiations. It is a matter of debate whether it would be a good thing for the President-elect if the trade talks are completed before he takes office.
If Mr. Bush oversees completion of the talks, and Congress is dissatisfied with the agreement, President Bush and not President Clinton will take most of the heat. On the other hand, if Mr. Clinton is dissatisfied with some provisions, he could push for additional changes, as he did with the North American Free Trade Agreement. But with so many more nations involved, change would not be easy.
 
Some Change Can Be Difficult
 Many trade experts in Washington predict that Mr. Clinton will be compelled to embrace whatever pact the Bush Administration might negotiate, even if he has reservations about several parts of it. To reject an accord negotiated by his predecessor would no doubt lead to harsh criticism from American allies and other countries, as well as to complaints domestically that Mr. Clinton was a protectionist and not a free trader.
"The talks have been going on for six years, and we would like to see them resolved," Ms. Myers said.
Although President Bush sometimes acts as if his Administration has closed shop, the trade talks may well become a highly charged issue for him over the next few weeks, as his Administration strains to finish the talks by Jan. 20.
Democrats in Congress are already warning that they do not want to see the Administration rush an agreement so Mr. Bush can boast of it as another accomplishment.
"We want an agreement -- a good agreement," said Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has often criticized the Administration on trade. "We want something that isn't a rush to the finish line, but something that can stand up for decades hence."
Bush Administration trade negotiators, led by the trade representative, Carla A. Hills, say they hope to have a basic agreement on all issues in the world trade talks by mid-January. After that, they say, it will take several more weeks to work out hundreds of details.
The Administration still hopes to meet the March 3 "fast track" deadline for notifying Congress of a completed accord. Under fast-track rules, Congress must vote on the agreement without being able to amend it. The fast-track concept is intended to prevent the 535 members of Congress from picking apart bit by bit agreements with foreign governments that have been painstakingly negotiated.
 
Accords Don't Always Help
 "I frankly hope the Bush Administration isn't going to cap its four-year term with an agreement for the sake of an agreement," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. "I also hope it's not trying to reach an agreement which it knows will represent a lot of problems which will then be dumped into the lap of the new President and Congress. I hope that's not part of the Administration's calculus."
For their part, Administration officials say they have done Mr. Clinton a major favor. "Getting this off of the President-elect's plate so he does not have to deal with it is a major benefit to him and the people with him," Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan said in an interview.
If there was no agreement heading off a trade war, Mr. Clinton might have entered office facing poisoned relations with the European Community, and immense political pressures to resolve the crisis.
The farm subsidies agreement "is about the nicest present that Bush can leave Clinton," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, a trade and international economics specialist in the Carter and Reagan Administrations. "I don't think Clinton wanted to inherit a complicated and acrimonious trade negotiation. This paves the way toward a much more open global trading system in which competitive American firms will have opportunities to expand."
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he favored taking a tougher approach with countries that engage in unfair trade practices, like exporting products at unfairly low prices, a practice known as dumping.
As a result, he may be unhappy with the current draft text in the trade talks, which would limit the ability of American companies to bring antidumping cases. With the talks starting to focus on areas other than farm subsidies, the American steel industry and the steelworkers union are expected to increase their lobbying against this provision.
Textile companies and unions are also increasing their protests about a proposal in the draft that would, over 10 years, eliminate an arrangement in which the industrial nations restrict apparel imports from poor nations. The American textile industry wants the phase-out to take at least 15 years.
The filmmaking industry also took a higher profile on trade this week. In a letter to Mrs. Hills, the trade negotiator, top Hollywood executives voiced fears that after getting Europe to make concessions on farm subsidies, the Administration might not push as hard to end Europe's quotas on how many American movies and television programs can be broadcast on television.
 
A Lot of Wild Cards
 "I assume that people concerned about these areas will step up the pressure if they see a quick agreement coming," John J. Ziolkowski, trade and foreign policy adviser to Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader, said. "If there is no agreement by Jan. 20, then Clinton will face all these pressures."
Although a final trade agreement appears to be at least several months away, members of Congress predict that it will probably pass the Senate and the House. But they say they cannot be sure because there are more than 100 new members of the House and because very few members follow trade issues closely.
Mr. Clinton might face an uncomfortable situation in which he has to defend a pact inherited from President Bush against criticisms from his fellow Democrats, who generally take a harder line on trade than the Republicans. Many want the Administration to push harder to reduce trade barriers that face American banks, telecommunications services and manufactured goods.
"I think the President-elect wants a trade agreement," Mr. Gephardt said. "I want one. But it can't come at the expensive of giving up too much in areas important to our standard of living, like manufacturing, high technology and financial services."

HEADLINE: The Burdens of Being Overweight: Mistreatment and Misconceptions

SERIES: Fat in America/First of three articles.

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Aleta Walker never had any friends during her childhood and adolescence in Hannibal, Mo. Instead, she was ridiculed and bullied every day. When she walked down the halls at school, boys would flatten themselves against the lockers and cry, "Wide load!" But the worst was lunchtime, she said.
"Every day there was this production of watching me eat lunch," Ms. Walker said. She tried to avoid going to the school cafeteria. "I would hide out in the bathroom. I would hide out behind the gym by the baseball diamond. I would hide in the library." 
 One day, schoolmates started throwing food at her as she sat at a table at lunch. Plates of spaghetti splashed onto her face, and the long greasy strands dripped onto her clothes. "Everyone was laughing and pointing. They were making pig noises. I just sat there," she said.
 
Surrounded by Abuse
 Ms. Walker is fat. And, like most fat people, she has been dogged by ridicule and abuse throughout her life. She has felt discrimination on the job. She is constantly subjected to rude remarks and ugly noises, like pig grunts or moos, when she goes out, and she has had a hard time making friends.
Despite the consistent findings by obesity researchers that most people actually have little control over their body weight, researchers find and fat people confirm that society continues to deride fat people for their condition.
Studies have found that fat people are less likely to be admitted to elite colleges, are less likely to be hired for a job, make less money when they are hired, and are less likely to be promoted. One study found that businessmen sacrifice $1,000 in salary for every pound they are overweight. Fat people tell researchers that they are accosted on the street by strangers who admonish them to lose weight. Often, their own children are ashamed of them. Studies have shown that even many doctors find fat people disgusting, and some refuse to treat them.
 
They'd Rather Be Blind
 In a recent study of formerly fat people who had lost weight after intestinal bypass surgery, researchers at the University of Florida reported that virtually all said they would rather be blind or deaf or have a leg amputated than be fat again.
"Overweight people have a condition that is unacceptable in our society," said Dr. Kelly Brownell, an obesity researcher at Yale University School of Medicine. And, he added, unlike the blind or the deaf, fat people are told that they could be thin if they really wanted to. "It's kind of a double punishment," Dr. Brownell said.
Dr. Albert Stunkard, an obesity researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed. "There's that implicit assumption that you really could lose weight if you settled down and stopped being such a fat slob," he said.
Fat people are the last group that it is acceptable to discriminate against blatantly, said Dr. Esther Rothblum, a psychologist at the University of Vermont who studies the social consequences of being fat. Sally E. Smith, the executive director of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, an advocacy group in Sacramento, Calif., said Michigan is the only state that prohibits discrimination against fat people. Ms. Smith added that fat people have sued employers and sometimes won on the basis of discrimination against the handicapped but not on the basis of discrimination against the obese.
 
Desperate Fight Against Weight
 An estimated 25 to 30 percent of Americans are obese, defined as 25 percent or more above their ideal weight. Most have tried and tried again to reduce. Often the fatter they are, the more desperately they tried.
Ms. Walker, who is 36 years old, went on her first diet when she was 12. An osteopath prescribed amphetamines and 500 calories a day. In the intervening years, she has tried virtually every weight loss program that has come along -- the Cambridge Diet, the rice diet, the Dr. Atkins Diet, Weight Watchers, Optifast (twice). But every time she would gain back the weight she so painfully lost. "I currently weigh about 300 pounds," she said.
In April, Ms. Walker and other fat people were, in a sense, vindicated by the findings of experts at a conference called by the National Institutes of Health. The group looked at data on success rates of weight loss programs and concluded that diets, including expensive commercial diet plans, have an abysmal success rate in long term, with virtually all dieters regaining the weight they had lost. The panel wrote, "There is increasing physiological, biochemical, and genetic evidence that overweight is not a simple disorder of willpower, as is sometimes implied, but is a complex disorder of energy metabolism."
But these findings are hardly new, obesity researchers said. For example, Dr. Jules Hirsch and Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel of Rockefeller University discovered years ago that when obese people lose weight, they often have symptoms of chronic starvation -- they feel cold all the time, are always hungry, and are obsessed with food. Women stop menstruating. The formerly obese feel an overwhelming compulsion to eat until they are fat again. Those few who do manage to to keep the weight off usually do so by making it a career to stay thin. They become Weight Watchers lecturers, for example, and fanatically monitor every bite of food that passes their lips.
 
Refusing to Accept Fat
 Dr. Susan C. Wooley, director of the eating disorders clinic at the University of Cincinnati, said that it is one thing to say that most dieters fail to lose weight and keep it off and another to really accept, emotionally, that fat people cannot help it. Scientists themselves are as guilty as the rest of society, Dr. Wooley said.
"It has been clear in the scientific community that diets fail, yet scientists have been extremely reluctant to let go of diet programs," she said. "Why should we expect the general population to be any quicker than scientists in releasing prejudice?"
Scores of research studies have documented the staggering social and emotional cost of being fat. And fat people, with their achingly sad stories, confirm what the cold statistics say.
One hint of the daily agony of being fat came in a survey by Dr. Rothblum and her colleagues of 367 women and 78 men who were members of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. A third of the men and about a fifth of the women in the study were not fat. The rest were at least 20 percent above their ideal weight. Dr. Rothblum found that the fatter the respondents were, the more likely they were to report that they suffered discrimination and abuse because of their weight.
More than 40 percent of the fat men and 60 percent of the fat women said they had not been hired for a job because of their weight. More than 30 percent of the fat people said they had been denied promotions or raises because of their weight. One person wrote, "I was told by upper management that I would never be promoted until I lost weight and the union took management's side."
 
Linking Poverty and Obesity
 The survey seems to explain why it is that fat women, in particular, so often are poor, Dr. Rothblum said. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 29.2 percent of women with incomes below $10,000 a year are obese, while 12.7 percent of those with incomes above $50,000 a year are obese. Dr. Rothblum argues that fatness leads to poverty, rather than the reverse.
Dr. Rothblum said fat women are less likely than thinner women to be hired and if they are hired they are less likely to be promoted. Although there is also discrimination against fat men, positions where women predominate, like flight attendants, waitresses, receptionists and secretaries, are also jobs that place a premium on being "attractive, meaning thin," Dr. Rothblum said.
Further, she said, fat women are much more likely than their thinner sisters to marry men lower on the social or economic ladder. And since a tendency to be fat is inherited, their children, born to a lower social class, would be likely to stay there.
But Dr. Stunkard is not ready to discard the idea that being poor increases your chances of being fat. Though a tendency to be obese is inherited, he said, "you have to have the environment to bring it out." Apart from differences in diet, he said, there are looser sanctions in lower social classes against being fat.
 
Scorned and Snubbed
 Dr. Rothblum's survey also showed the social consequences of being fat. Ninety percent of the fat men and women said that friends or relatives had ridiculed them or made nasty comments to them about their weight and three quarters of them said they had been laughed at or derided by fellow employees. One of the survey participants wrote, "While attending a lecture in college, a professor stopped speaking in the middle of a sentence and said, 'When are you going to lose weight? You are really fat.' There were over 100 people in the class."
A quarter of the fat men and 16 percent of the fat women reported being hit or threatened because of their weight. A third said they had been derided by health professionals and a quarter said they had been refused treatment because they were fat.
Dr. Colleen Rand, an obesity researcher at the University of Florida, has similar findings. She studied 50 obese women and 7 men who had intestinal bypass surgery and subsequently lost an average of 100 pounds each. Before surgery, the patients reported overwhelming embarrassment about their appearance and said they faced constant prejudice and discrimination. For example, 77 percent said that their children had asked them not to attend school functions.
In another study, Dr. Rand asked 47 formerly fat men and women whether they would rather be obese again or have some other disability. Every one of the 47 people said they would rather be deaf or have dyslexia, diabetes, bad acne or heart disease than be obese again. Ninety-one percent said they would rather have a leg amputated. Eighty-nine percent would rather be blind. One patient said: "When you're blind, people want to help you. No one wants to help you when you're fat."
Dr. Rand cautioned that her study group consisted of people who had gone to the extreme length of having surgery to become thin, so they might have suffered more from obesity than others. But fat people's stories offer testimony to the observation that life is a constant struggle for the overweight.
"We elicit an extreme emotional reaction from people," said Ms. Smith, the director of the fat acceptance group.
 
Constant Stares
 Julia House, a 39-year-old office manager in Mesa, Ariz., said she cannot go grocery shopping without facing the stares of other shoppers who want to see what she puts in her shopping cart. And when she eats in a restaurant, other diners cannot resist peering at her to see what and how much she is eating.

Pamela Hollowich of Los Angeles said one of her most humiliating moments came when she tried to board an airplane. Ms. Hollowich, who weighs 350 pounds, was waiting to board when an attendant "pulled me out of the line in front of all the other passengers and said I had to buy two tickets. It was humiliating. It was degrading," she said. But she ended up buying the extra ticket. Later, she sued the airline. Her suit is in litigation.
Lynn Meletiche, a 48-year-old nurse who is chairwoman of the health committee for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, said she often helps fat people whose doctors disparage them. One woman, she said, was told she had cervical cancer. But her doctor refused to operate on her unless she lost 100 pounds, even though the added risk of surgery was overwhelmed by the risk of living with cervical cancer. She found another doctor who did the operation, Ms. Meletiche said.
The abuse is "overwhelming," said Laura Eljaiek, a 35-year-old temporary office worker in New York. "It affects you every day. It's hard to go out there feeling good about yourself."
But Ms. Eljaiek, like more and more many fat people, has decided not to be passive in the face of blatant insults.
The other day, she said, she was getting off a bus when a man behind her said, "You could use some Slim Fast." Ms. Eljaiek whirled around to face him. "You," she shot back, "could use some manners."

HEADLINE: U.S. Mine Inspectors Charge Interference By Agency Director

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUNLAP, Tenn.

 BODY:
Federal mining inspectors here and in five other states say the head of the agency that oversees the $20 billion coal industry has repeatedly interceded on behalf of coal companies to thwart enforcement of the law regulating strip mining.
The inspectors, who head regional offices of the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement, said in interviews that the director, Harry M. Snyder, had ordered them to end investigations of violations, reduce fines, eliminate penalties, divert prosecutions and prevent inspections. Such intervention, they said, has also made them reluctant to enforce the law aggressively. 
 The inspectors as well as several ranking officials in the Office of Surface Mining said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. knew of Mr. Snyder's actions and, by not interfering, in effect sanctioned them. The employees question the propriety of Mr. Snyder's interference and, in some cases, the legality of what has occurred.
 
'Development," Not Regulation
 Mr. Lujan has been a staunch advocate of eliminating restrictions on developing the nation's coal, mineral, oil and timber resources. He indicated as much in September, when he traveled to Norton, Va., for a speech to coal industry executives and at a news conference later, when he discussed what he expected from the strip mining agency and other Interior Department divisions. He was quoted at the time as saying: "We don't want to be a regulatory agency. We want to be a development agency on our national lands."
Mr. Lujan would not respond directly to repeated requests for comment on the inspectors' assertions. Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Mr. Lujan, said the Interior Secretary was carrying out the Bush Administration's overall goals. "The Secretary is briefed on major actions which occur in the department," said Mr. Goldstein. "He does not micromanage the way the bureaus are run. He could have been aware that there were disputes involving these companies, but he did not give directions as to how these disputes should be resolved."
Mr. Snyder, who has directed the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement since 1989, said the attacks on his leadership were undeserved and came from employees jockeying for position in the Clinton Administration. "What's the point of this exercise?" he asked in an interview. "I'll be out of here in a few weeks. The whole thing makes me sick."
 
Seeking Clinton's Attention
 The inspectors said they chose to make their accusations public to draw the attention of President-elect Bill Clinton to a pollution problem that they say can be eliminated if they are allowed to enforce the strip mining law.
The law, adopted in 1977, sets tough standards for operating strip mines and protecting streams from erosion and drainage from the strip mines. It sets up stringent requirements on how coal companies fill in the mines after their work is completed. And it sets standards on what land can be mined and what land cannot.
"The strip mining law was one of the most important environmental laws ever passed by this country," said Willis L. Gainer, 44 years old, a career employee who is branch chief in the Office of Surface Mining field office in Knoxville, Tenn. "But under Reagan and Bush we never had the support from Washington that we needed to be a strong regulatory agency. It's gotten worse in the last year. Maybe that will change in the Clinton Administration."
To some extent, the inspectors' decision to talk about the mining office's internal workings reflects the tensions that have built up over the last 12 years between political appointees and career employees in all the Government's environmental agencies.
 
A Role in Bush Strategy
 The tensions have been especially acute in the Office of Surface Mining, mainly because the office played a central role in President Bush's campaign strategy to increase jobs in rural areas by accelerating the development of mineral resources.
This policy was developed by Mr. Lujan, and he began to execute it in July 1991, by proposing that more than 40 million acres of park, national forest and private lands be opened to strip mining by coal companies, a plan blocked by Congress. Last January, Mr. Lujan joined with the coal industry in a lawsuit in a Federal appeals court aimed at dismantling a computer system that was the surface mining office's chief weapon in enforcing the strip-mining law. It is still pending. And in March, Mr. Lujan proposed a rule, since put into effect, to weaken the public's long-standing right to block strip mining on Federal land.
Mr. Snyder, for his part, interceded on behalf of coal companies to prevent his agency's regional offices from enforcing the strip mining law, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, the mining inspectors said.
In one case, Arch Minerals, owned in part by Ashland Oil Inc., Kentucky's largest corporation, had been cited and fined $22,500 by the state for mining too close to a reservoir near Rollins, in southern Wyoming.
Guy Padgett, the director of the Casper field office, sent two inspectors to determine if the violation was serious enough to warrant an order to shut down the mine. But the company heard about the impending inspection, called Mr. Snyder and after the agents arrived, company executives told them to check with their office before taking any action, Mr. Padgett said.
As the agents awaited further instructions, Mr. Padgett called Mr. Snyder in Washington. "He told me that on the basis of discussion he had already had with the company, he did not believe an imminent harm existed and no action should be taken," Mr. Padgett said in an interview. "I protested to the director that I felt that was my decision to make."
But he said he obeyed Mr. Snyder's order.
Mr. Snyder said in the interview that his action on behalf of Arch Minerals was a normal part of his job. "It was a paperwork violation and somebody wanted to make trouble for somebody else," he said. "I intervened. Does the title director indicate anything?"
Here, on the ridges overlooking the Sequatchie Valley 125 miles southwest of Knoxville, Tenn., it is easy to find streams the color of dried blood, the result of iron seeping from operating and abandoned strip mines. Moreover, the water is so acidic from sulfur, manganese, aluminum and other heavy metals seeping from the mines that fish cannot survive and stream banks are scoured clean of plants.
"The animals won't drink it; not even the dog will drink out of it," Raymond Brown, a retired 63-year-old mechanic, said as he walked along the edge of Smith Creek, which runs behind his home in Brayton, east of here.
In Kentucky, 90,000 of the 100,000 acres of abandoned mines that awaited cleanup before 1977 have still not been reclaimed, according to state figures.
 
'It's Gotten Worse'
 A study earlier this year of 12 mines in Tennessee by Save Our Cumberland Mountains, an environmental group in Lake City, Tenn., found that eight were causing severe water pollution in violation of the strip-mining law.
"Back in the late 1970's, when the law was first put into effect, I can remember a period when Federal inspectors in the field did what the law required," said Maureen O'Connell, the director of Save Our Cumberland Mountains. "In the last 12 years, this agency has done everything possible to foil its purposes and it's gotten worse in the last year or two."
Federal inspectors said coal operators had learned that regional offices could be bypassed by appealing for help directly to Washington. That is what has occurred at the Skyline Coal Company strip mine near Dunlap, 40 miles northwest of Chattanooga.
Here at Tennessee's largest strip mine, a huge shovel heaves aside tons of rock and earth to lay bare a seam of black coal. But mixed with the discarded material are deposits of sulfur and iron, manganese and aluminum that with moisture form a red acid brew that finds its way into streams and destroys fish and plant life for miles downstream. The Federal strip mining law was meant to eradicate it, but countless mountain streams in the mining regions of West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee have been polluted in this way.
Last July, after the streams around the Skyline mine turned red, Federal inspectors from Office of Surface Mining's Knoxville office ordered the mine closed until the company came up with a plan to stop the pollution. The stop-work order, one of the strongest penalties available to Federal officials, followed more than two years of effort by the Knoxville office to compel Skyline to deal with the problem.
Under the strip-mining law, when a stop-work order is issued the company must either eliminate the problem or seek temporary relief from a Federal judge before resuming operation. Such relief can be granted, though, only if the company can prove that continuing to mine will not harm the environment.
But three days after the stop-work order was issued, say mine inspectors here, Skyline was back in business without having taken either step. Federal officials in Knoxville were directed by their superiors in Washington to lift the order, an action that meant Skyline and its 60 employees could continue mining more than 1,400 tons of coal, valued at more than $38,000, a day.
 
Questions on Agreement
 The mechanism used to lift the stop-work order was a one-of-a kind agreement prepared by lawyers for the Government and and Skyline and which they named "interim temporary relief." Experts on strip-mining law in and out of the Government said there was no such thing as "interim temporary relief" either in the Federal strip mining law or its regulations.
"Let's put it this way," said George C. Miller, the director of the Knoxville office. "I have serious questions about its legality."
Mr. Snyder said in an interview that he had nothing to do with the effort to help Skyline resume mining. "I didn't even know about it," he said. "If they tell you otherwise, I challenge them to prove it."
But Kevin Feeney, a spokesman for Skyline's parent company, Amax Coal Industries of Indianapolis, the nation's third largest coal company, said the company had alerted Mr. Snyder of its troubles in Tennessee through the National Coal Association, the industry's Washington-based lobbying group.
And Mr. Snyder's chief of staff, Tom Williams, said in an interview that he was in the room last summer when James Hemphill, one of the Interior Department's top lawyers (who died of a heart attack in September) discussed the Skyline case with Mr. Snyder and asked for guidance. "Hemphill called Harry," said Mr. Williams. "He asked Harry about specifics about Skyline. Harry told Jim to do what's right."

HEADLINE: A Familiar Tone in Race To Lead South Korea

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 21

 BODY:
The campaign officially began today for the dissident who went mainstream, the dissident who remains on the outside and the tycoon turned politician in what is shaping up as a heated presidential race and a test of democracy.
To the victor will go the task of reviving South Korea's push to become an industrial powerhouse and, perhaps, of presiding over a reunification with North Korea. 
 The election, set for Dec. 18, is the second presidential vote since South Korea shook off military rule in 1987, but to some analysts, this vote represents the first truly democratic transfer of power.
 
Moving Away From Military
 The winner in 1987, Roh Tae Woo, had been a general and a close associate of his predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, the military ruler. This time, none of the candidates has a military background.
The race is expected to be a close battle between two of the candidates: Kim Young Sam, 65, the moderate candidate of the majority Democratic Liberal Party, and Kim Dae Jung, 67, a firebrand who heads the opposition Democratic Party.
Polls have shown Kim Young Sam to be slightly ahead, with at least 30 percent of respondents undecided.
A third candidate, Chung Ju Yung of the United People's Party, a wealthy industrialist, is often likened to Ross Perot. Mr. Chung, 77, who founded the huge Hyundai conglomerate, is considered to have little chance of winning, but attracts voters fed up with professional politicians and could influence the outcome by taking votes from the frontrunners. There are several minor candidates as well.
Mr. Roh will not be running because the Constitution limits candidates to one five-year term.
Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung were both longtime opponents of the military rule. But, unable to put aside personal rivalries, they both ran as opposition candidates in 1987, splitting the vote and allowing Mr. Roh to win.
In 1990, Kim Young Sam merged his party with that of President Roh, creating the Democratic Liberal Party and positioning himself to become the mainstream candidate.
 
Campaign Season Opens
 The official 28-day campaign period began with candidate registration on Friday. Today the three major candidates held their first outdoor rallies in cities near Seoul, attracting thousands of cheering and chanting supporters.
Besides featuring a billionaire businessman, the Korean race is similar to the recent American one in that the economy and other domestic concerns are the main issues.
Indeed, President Roh is sometimes compared to George Bush. Critics say he made major foreign policy achievements, such as establishing relations with China and the Soviet Union, while neglecting domestic issues.
The concentration on the economy might be surprising in that South Korea's is growing at an enviable rate of 6 percent a year and its unemployment rate is low.
Still, the growth rate is lower than the 10 percent that used to be common, a trade surplus has turned into a trade deficit and inflation has been at 10 percent until this year, when it moderated somewhat. Those problems, combined with a feeling that the traditional work ethic is ebbing, has set off a period of hand-wringing.
"Korea, once touted as a role model of the newly industrializing countries, is on the verge of downfall due to economic stagnation, rampant corruption and the collapse of traditional value and authority," Kim Young Sam said at a press conference on Friday, according to a translation by The Korea Times. "Excessive spending, extravagance and decadence now sweep our society, and people are gripped in frustration and defeatism."
 
Vague or Repetitive
 All three candidates have economic policies that are either vague or similar, with linchpins like stimulating small business and gradually deregulating the financial system.
Indeed, observers say, it is hard to clearly separate the candidates along policy lines. The candidates all favor a continued United States military presence, but all also want to see reunification with North Korea.
"People are voting not for issues but for the personalities," said Yang Sung Chul, a professor of political science at Kyunghee University. Voters also pay extraordinary attention here to where a candidate is from, he said.
As the majority party's candidate, Kim Young Sam tends to appeal to those who want stability. He has had trouble, however, holding his merged party together, and many politicians have left to support Mr. Chung or other candidates.
Kim Dae Jung has more appeal to those who want change. He stresses upholding personal liberties and supports public funding of elections to limit the influence of business on politics. He accuses his rival of selling out to the ruling party.
Almost as important to Korea as the question of who will win the race is whether the election will be honest.
The concern is not with fraud on election day but with the tactics candidates use to influence voters beforehand.
Already, prosecutors have charged about 150 people, some from every party, with violating election laws by campaigning before the official period or by giving voters money or gifts.
 
Mystery Over Disappearance
 To allay fears that the current administration would use its power to influence the election in favor of Kim Young Sam, President Roh resigned from the ruling party in September and appointed a neutral Cabinet. But that has not completely eliminated suspicions on the part of opposition candidates.
Among the events that have tended to keep suspicions inflamed is the temporary disappearance of Kim Bok Dong, a member of the National Assembly and the brother-in-law of President Roh. He was on his way to his hometown of Taegu on Tuesday to announce his departure from the Democratic Liberal Party when plainclothes police officers, acting on a presidential order, stopped Mr. Kim's car, took him out and whisked him back to Seoul, where he was not seen in public for several days.
There followed a press release, purportedly from Mr. Kim, although it was later challenged as a fake his aides, saying that the legislator had changed his mind and would stay with the majority party.
Opposition politicians accused Mr. Roh of meddling in the election by kidnapping Mr. Kim to prevent his defection. The Administration maintained it was merely a family affair.
Late this week, in an effort to quell the controversy, the majority party accepted Mr. Kim's resignation. He joined Mr. Chung's party.

HEADLINE: The Transition: Political Memo;
New Tune for Clinton: Sounds of Compromise

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
As if trading in the saxophone of the election season for a cello, Bill Clinton seems to be modulating the direct and even brassy oratory of his campaign into a Presidential tune.
As a candidate, Mr. Clinton's task was to distinguish himself as sharply as possible from President Bush. Listening to him this week on his first trip to Washington as President-elect, it was clear that as President, his aim will be to prevent conflict abroad and build consensus at home so he can concentrate on the economy. 
 After meeting with Congressional leaders he played down his campaign demand that Congress slash the size of its staff and that he be given new powers to veto spending, which Congress complains would diminish its authority. He offered to negotiate on his plan to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military in the face of opposition from Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And after a session on foreign policy in the Oval Office with Mr. Bush, he sounded a less aggressive note about getting tough with China.
John Brummett, editor of The Arkansas Times Magazine, said Mr. Clinton seems to be adapting his style in the Governor's Mansion for the Oval Office.
"He does have a tendency to promise as a candidate and then once elected, suddenly become very realistic," Mr. Brummett said. "It is bravado versus realism, and it is a pretty clear pattern we have seen before. It is just the difference between getting elected and governing."
 
Room for Compromise
 This style has its obvious risks: it could simply reinforce Mr. Clinton's image as a politician who has a tendency to dance around sensitive issues to get the support of all sides. But it could also allow him to stake out a far-reaching position while leaving room for a compromise down the road.
During the campaign, for instance, Mr. Clinton lacerated President Bush for "coddling" the "tyrants" in Beijing and promised he would never do that. On Thursday, when he had to speak about China as President-elect instead of Presidential wannabe, Mr. Clinton chose his words carefully. He repeated his support for human rights, but gave Mr. Bush credit for making progress with Beijing when he got "tough" on the Chinese and said he did not want to "isolate" China, the very formulation Mr. Bush has often used.
Mr. Clinton may have been signaling that he took too absolute a position in this area as he was fighting to get elected and is now using the grace period of his transition to retreat a bit. The last thing he wants during his first days in office, after all, is a fight with China or with Congress over his China policy.
In a similar manner, and perhaps for a similar purpose, Mr. Clinton has lowered his voice about Congress cutting Congressional staffs and cutting middle-class taxes. He is on the record for both, but can push them loudly or quietly depending on what tradeoffs he needs later.
 
Feeling His New Role
 Beyond political calculations, there may be something unconscious going on. The American public is watching as Mr. Clinton absorbs the weighty reality of the office he is about to inherit. When he arrived to meet Mr. Bush at the White House this week, he seemed intent on striking a Presidential stance, rather than giving in to the natural instinct to crane his neck and look around at his new house.
Mr. Clinton spent almost two hours with President Bush in the Oval Office on Thursday. According to a Clinton aide, Mr. Bush gave the President-elect a tour of each problem spot in the world. Mr. Clinton then asked Mr. Bush how he would respond if events spun out of control in each area. It may have been no accident that after this conversation, Mr. Clinton found a softer voice on China.
Similarly, Mr. Clinton began his transition period with a strong statement of his intent to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military. As Democrats in Congress and generals in the Pentagon protested, Mr. Clinton backed off just a bit, saying he still intended to carry out his campaign promise on the issue, but was prepared to discuss it and find common ground. Last week, Mr. Clinton met with General Powell and said wryly that the nation's highest-ranking uniformed officer did not hold back on any subject.
 
A One-Man Polling Operation
 In both cases, Mr. Clinton seems to have been displaying one of his particular managerial traits. Clinton aides during the campaign often complained about his democratic style of decision-making -- how he would ask the opinion of everyone from his top strategists to the flight attendant on his campaign aircraft before making up his mind.
Mr. Brummett said, "Sometimes he is just too prone to agree with the last person he talked with."
Several years ago in Arkansas, the Arkansas legislature was considering a bill granting tax credits for private donations to Arkansas's badly underfinanced colleges and universities. Mr. Clinton was torn between wanting to support higher education and not wanting to drain his budget of tax revenues.
The bill was passed and he had five days to decide whether to veto it. He agonized for five days, consulting with all sides, and on the evening of the fifth day he finally decided to veto the bill, stamping on it in big black letters: "DISAPPROVED."
A Clinton aide was sent over to file the veto with the House clerk and slipped it under the door of her office. Mr. Clinton then and telephoned Arkansas college presidents to explain what he had done. Instead, they persuaded him to change his mind.
So the Governor summoned a state trooper in his security detail and asked him to go back to the clerk's office and retrieve the vetoed bill. The trooper could see through the locked glass door that the bill was lying on the floor. He took a coat hanger, slipped it under the door and slid the bill out. He brought it back to Governor Clinton, who simply crossed out a few letters and sent it back as "APPROVED."
"The most unnerving thing about Clinton," said a long-time friend, "is knowing when he's made a decision. He'll look you in the eye to get your advice and for that moment, it seems like you're the only person in the world whose opinion he cares about. And then a second later, he'll turn to the waiter here and ask him his opinion."

HEADLINE: Kaysone Phomvihan, Communist Who Ruled Laos, Is Dead at 71

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
President Kaysone Phomvihan of Laos, the longtime guerrilla who led the Communist takeover of his nation in 1975 and ruled as its dictator ever since, died yesterday, the Laotian state radio announced. He was 71 years old.
He died of an unspecified illness, said the broadcasts from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. The announcement was monitored in London and Bangkok. 
 The reports gave no indication about a successor to Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan, who led both the Government and the Communist Party. He had been reported ill for some time.
Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan's death could mean a period of uncertainty for Laos, one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, especially considering his long domination of the country and his role as its nationalist hero.
 
Gave Up Post of Premier
 Last year, under a new Constitution, he gave up the Prime Minister's post to assume the new post of President and remained the party's Secretary General. Gen. Khamtay Siphandon became the Prime Minister, but it is uncertain whether he will succeed Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan.
A spokesman at the Laotian mission to the United Nations said it had just received word of the announcement and therefore had no immediate comment. The State Department said it would have no comment until Monday.
The death of Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan -- a man with Vietnamese links by birth, marriage, language, education and politics -- also raises the issue of what direction Laos will move in its politics, economy and foreign relations.
It shares a long eastern border with Communist Vietnam, which until 1987 stationed tens of thousands of troops in Laos. But Laos also has growing commerce along its equally lengthy western border with Thailand, which has thriving capitalism, a more open society and ties to the West.
To the north sits China. Historically wary of its giant neighbor, Laos relied on the Soviet Union as its prime benefactor until it collapsed. Since then, Laos has been friendlier to China, the world's last major Communist nation. But Laos is also reaching out to Japan, Asia's democratic and capitalist power, and has even courted its old Western foes, France and the United States.
The short, stocky Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan was one of the last of Indochina's old-guard revolutionary leaders from the generation of his Vietnamese comrade, the late Ho Chi Minh.
Credited as both a brilliant political theoretician and a crafty military chief, Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan for years led the rebel struggle from secret mountain caves.
 
Royal Dynasty Falls
 His Pathet Lao forces survived formidable opposition, including carpet bombing by the United States, before eventually toppling the 600-year-old Laotian dynasty in 1975.
Under his leadership, however, Laos remained among the poorest and least developed of countries. The small landlocked nation and its four million people were largely isolated from the outside world. Once known as the the Land of a Million Elephants, Laos had few exports other than timber, hydroelectric power and illicit opium and heroin.
But in the late 1980's, Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan's Government sharply altered the country's ideology. Its controlled economy finally resorted to privatized farming and commerce. Looking abroad, Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan actively sought foreign aid and trade.
Reconciling with old foes, he traveled to France and Japan in 1989, his first trip to non-Communist counties other than Thailand. He also won an $8.7 million grant from the United States for roads, dams, communications, farming, health care and education.
The changes were forced by a combination of continuing stagnation in the local economy, the collapse of international Marxism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the longtime backer of Laotian Communism.
Laos's official slogan changed from "socialism" to "prosperity" and the hammer-and-sickle disappeared from the national emblem, replaced by a Buddhist shrine.
Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan's explanation was that Laos was too undeveloped to begin socialism.
 
One-Party Rule Persists
 Despite those changes, political authoritarianism remained. "Our Laotian party does not yet see any need for establishing other political parties," Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan said in 1990.
Born in the southern panhandle province of Savanakhet, Mr. Phomvihan was the son of a Lao peasant mother and a father who was a Vietnamese civil servant for French colonialists.
Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan ( pronounced guy-sohn POHM-vee-hahn) said he became radicalized at the age of 16. Explaining his credo of liberation from outside forces, he once said Laotians "prefer to live a miserable life as masters of their own country than to live a happy life enslaved by foreigners."
While studying law in Hanoi, Vietnam, he was recruited by Ho Chi Minh.
The young student demonstrated against both Japanese World War II occupation and French colonial domination of Southeast Asia. In later years, he jousted politically with China and fought against United States forces, accusing them of imperialist intentions. When France's control of Indochina ended at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, an internal and international struggle for control of Laos ensued.
 
Always the Top Leader
 With Vietnamese training and support, he began organizing rebels in Laos in the 1940's. By the mid-1950's, when he was in his 30's, he became the Defense Minister and Commander in Chief of the Pathet Lao forces and chief of the Laotian Communist Party. As alliances and names of organizations constantly shifted, he held a variety of titles but was always considered the movement's top leader.
Although he was fluent in Thai, Shan, French, English and Vietnamese as well as his native Lao, he was reticent, even secretive. He was not seen in public from 1958 until he took power in 1975. Even then, when a reporter asked if he had a wife, the evasive answer was "Do you?" After that introductory appearance, he disappeared from view again for more than a year.
Mr. Kaysone Phomvihan was married, according to the International Who's Who, which identifies his wife as Thongvin, a Vietnamese. But little else is known about his private life. His secrecy and tight security were not merely personal idiosyncracies. He survived at least three assassination attempts.

HEADLINE: Brazilians Fret Over New Chief's Slow Start

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Almost two months after Brazil's Congress impeached President Fernando Collor de Mello, politicians and the press are expressing concern that his successor is failing to take charge.
Vice President Itamar Franco assumed the powers of the presidency after Mr. Collor was impeached on Oct. 2, and it appears inevitable that Mr. Collor will be convicted in the impeachment trial scheduled to conclude in the Brazilian Senate by Dec. 22, allowing Mr. Franco to serve out the remainder of Mr. Collor's term. 
 But Mr. Franco has made no effort to harness the extraordinary unity with which the Chamber of Deputies voted to oust Mr. Collor. Criticized for not making a single policy speech since assuming presidential powers, he holed up in his hometown last week to care for his ailing mother. On Friday he left on his first overseas trip, to Senegal.
Mr. Franco has promised to reduce his nation's chronic inflation by selling money-losing state companies. But on Thursday he personally suspended the auction of one state company.
"Itamar is sending confusing signals, and signals are important in Brazil," said Roberto Campos, a conservative member of the Chamber of Deputies. "He is a 1950's populist nationalist who is lost in the 1990's."
From the left, Luis Ignacio (Lula) da Silva, president of the Workers Party, charged on Friday that Mr. Franco had proved to be "very vulnerable, vague and very slow."
"I think Itamar's ambiguity could make him very quickly lose the prestige and trust society has deposited in him," Mr. da Silva said.
If Brazilians vote to adopt a parliamentary system in a plebiscite next April, the nation could have a Prime Minister as early as one year from now. Otherwise, the nation will have to wait until the October 1994 presidential elections.
But it is unclear whether Brazilian society will withstand even one more year of ineffective government. In the two and a half years of Mr. Collor's presidency, Brazil's real per capita income dropped by 7 percent. In Sao Paulo, the nation's economic heartland, unemployment doubled to 15.5 percent, or 1.5 million people.
With prices rising about 1,000 percent a year, Brazil is now Latin America's only nation with annual inflation over two digits. "Brazil is at the edge of hyperinflation," warned Norman Gall, an American economist in Sao Paulo. "The situation is far more dangerous than people assume it to be."
Mr. Franco's economic ministers vow to reduce Brazil's inflationary deficit gradually by improving tax collection and by selling state companies.
"We expect that Congress will approve most of the tax reform by the end of December," Planning Minister Paulo Haddad said on Friday, referring to a tax package intended to raise $16 billion by creating new taxes and improving the collection of old taxes. "We are going to sell 12 state companies by March."
The 61-year-old Mr. Franco, who served 16 years in the Senate before becoming Vice President in 1990, describes his Government as "pre-parliamentary" and argues that Congress is responsible for his success or failure.
Mr. Franco, who does not belong to any political party, presides over a Cabinet stitched together with representatives from seven center-left parties. Almost one-third of his Cabinet comes from Congress, but his slow start seems to be eroding his political capital there.
"Itamar is enjoying a period of political grace that will only last until the Senate verdict on Collor," said Jarbas Passarinho, a conservative senator who once was Mr. Collor's congressional liaison.
Mr. Franco's post-impeachment honeymoon with Brazil's press is already ending. Noting Mr. Franco's habit of contradicting his own ministers and his reluctance to assert leadership forcefully, Jornal do Brasil recently wrote, "He seems like an American at a carnival ball."
"He doesn't know the tune," continued the Rio newspaper. "He doesn't understand the lyrics, he doesn't have rhythm, he doesn't know how to dance, and he came without a costume."

HEADLINE: The Transition: Political Memo;
Tiff Over Governor's 'Christian' Remark Underscores Fault Line in G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
Despite the sudden skirmish over whether the Republican Party thinks the nation is "Christian" or "Judeo-Christian," this has been a peaceful post-defeat post-mortem, as such things go.
The argument identified unstable political fault lines, potentials for deep, angry divisions. But now most Republicans blame their defeat not on ideological excesses or inadequacies but on a poor economy and a poor campaign by President Bush. 
 Those scapegoats do not arouse the sort of fury that Republicans vented at conservatives after the 1976 election, complaining that they had loafed through the campaign, or that Democrats felt for unenthusiastic liberals in 1980 or too-enthusiastic liberals in 1972.
Indeed, because Mr. Bush has given so many years of his life to his party, there is not even the personal rancor toward him that Democrats directed toward a relative outsider, Michael S. Dukakis, when he lost an election they thought they could win in 1988.
 
The Fordice Flap
 Even so, the short-lived dispute spurred by Gov. Kirk Fordice's demographic and historical concepts is instructive about the state of the Republican Party. When the Mississippian told other Republican Governors in Fontana, Wis., on Tuesday that it was a "simple fact of life" that the United States was a "Christian nation," he stepped into a political minefield.
He was promptly rebuked. First, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, who has experience that Mr. Fordice lacks in national politics, said Republicans needed to realize it was the "Judeo-Christian heritage" that established the nation's values.
After Mr. Fordice responded tartly that he would have said that if he had meant that, various Jewish organizations and moderate Republicans got angry. So Richard N. Bond, the departing chairman of the Republican National Committee, organized a statement, joined in by his potential successors, to insist on "Judeo-Christian." That is the term used in the party platform, and Mr. Fordice swallowed it, apologizing Friday to Mississippians whom he might have offended.
At one level, the argument deals with how badly the Republicans look to Jewish voters, who this year gave Mr. Bush only 12 percent of their votes, one percentage point more than he got from blacks.
Obviously, there is a potential for significant gains among a chunk of the electorate that matters a lot in several states. Mr. Bush drew 35 percent of Jewish votes in 1988, when his party's convention did not focus on "Christian values" the way the 1992 meeting did.
 
Questions of Openness
 But even more important to Republican operatives is their fear of seeming biased to other voters, who may be generally friendly to the party's ideas but uncomfortable with thinking of themselves as part of a bigoted institution.
And though his name hardly came up in Wisconsin, this dispute was part of a larger Republican concern about the Rev. Pat Robertson and his evangelical followers. Lots of Republicans worry that even though the Robertson forces energize new supporters, the cost of identifying the party with them may repel even more voters and make the party seem fatally narrow-minded.
And while the Christian Coalition, Mr. Robertson's organization, is pleased with hundreds of victories it recorded this year in legislative, councilmanic and school and library board elections across the country, regular Republicans are not. Not only do they often disagree with coalition candidates on issues, they often find that the Christian right's candidates win Republican primaries in light turnouts but then lose to Democrats where more moderate candidates might have won.
As one consultant who refused to be quoted by name put it, many party officials fear Mr. Robertson's influence. "If we limit our party to evangelicals, to people who live straight lives and to people who are pro-life," he said, "we're looking at a steady 33 percent" and steady losses.
Above all, the skirmish was a reminder of the potential for division within the party and a distraction from the economic messages that not only unify Republicans but also win elections.
 
Fears of a Distraction
 Retiring Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a leading conservative and anti-abortion voice in the party, says it is typical of Republicans, after disappointments at the polls, to worry about the religious right. "It seems to be the first thing we focus on to explain any defeats," he said.
Mr. Weber argued that while the party had made a mistake in allowing the Republican convention in Houston to present a "narrow, theocratic message," its bigger failure was not campaigning with unifying themes on economic issues and foreign policy. And he said that if voters think a party's real concern is off the economy and on issues like abortion or homosexuals, that party loses.
That sense of the right's issues as a fatal distraction for Republicans can be found across the party's ideological range. Nancy Sinnott Dwight, a moderate consultant in Connecticut who once ran the National Republican Congressional Committee, said she wanted her party to stop fighting about abortion and similar issues. To attract more voters, she said, Republicans "need to be concerned about what they're concerned about: jobs, domestic issues, education."
There are moderates whose view of the religious right's influence, past and future, is much more severe.
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon said the effort to woo the right over issues like abortion and an equal rights amendment had cost Republicans the chance to become the nation's majority party. He said that the convention tone was of "crabbed, mean-spirited narrowness" and that Republicans should instead understand, quoting Judge Learned Hand, that "the true spirit of liberty is that spirit that's not sure it's right."
John Deardourff, a Republican consultant, said appealing to evangelicals might win some offices in Southern states, as it plainly did in Georgia this year, when Republicans added three House seats. But, he said, "with this perception of the party as far to the right as it is, it's impossible to win major states."
 
The Robertson Factor
 To many Republicans, Mr. Robertson is the center of their problems at both local and national levels. He did poorly when he sought the party's Presidential nomination in 1988. But his followers won control of several state parties last spring and summer, and then dominated the 1992 Republican platform deliberations.
Eddie Mahe, a consultant who was an early advocate of party efforts to enlist evangelical Christian support, argued that Republicans were worrying too much, that it had basically been Mr. Bush and not their party that had been repudiated. And if party members had any cause to fret, he said, they were complaining about the wrong Pat.
Mr. Robertson, he contended, was neither racist nor isolationist, but the really damaging speech at the Republican convention was instead that of Patrick J. Buchanan, with his talk of a "holy war."
These concerns are important because they show both what Republicans might fight about and what they are, so far, restraining themselves about.
It will be hard to maintain that restraint. Abortion is likely to become a significant part of the race to succeed Mr. Bond. The Christian Coalition is bound to worry more and more traditional Republicans. And in California, a critically important state, the odds are that some conservatives will mount a primary challenge against Gov. Pete Wilson in 1994, accusing him of insufficient doctrinal purity.
 
A Wealth of Candidates
 All of these developments are likely to distract the party from concentrating on a clear economic message of less government and lower taxes.
And they will all come before the 1996 Presidential campaign. Even now, it is possible to identify a serious Republican problem, the odd curse of too many strong candidates.
A strong field could produce a prolonged contest. That usually leads to defeat, as emotions harden and arguments narrow, sometimes to the point where the ordinary voter wonders why grown men and women would argue about such questions.
In particular, says Professor Marty Wattenberg of the University of California at Irvine, Republicans have to fear having candidates who can raise enough money to survive early defeats. He calls them "Timex candidates, who take a licking and keep on ticking."

HEADLINE: Ripples of a Pathologist's Misconduct In Graves and Courts of West Texas

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 21

 BODY:
he prairie graveyards of West Texas are giving mute testimony to the misdeeds of a circuit-riding pathologist who left a trail of faked autopsies, botched blood samples and missing organs from the Panhandle to the Rio Grande.
According to defense lawyers' estimates, as many as 20 capital murder cases and dozens of other prosecutions will be appealed because of accusations that crucial evidence was ghoulishly or criminally mishandled in autopsies performed by the pathologist, Dr. Ralph R. Erdmann, who worked as a contract medical examiner in more than 40 rural Texas counties since the early 1980's. 
 As evidence of Dr. Erdmann's malfeasance piles up, a fracas has broken out over defense lawyers' accusations that prosecutors sanctioned his practices to win cases and are now trying to cover it up.
On Sept. 21 Dr. Erdmann, 65 years old, pleaded no contest to seven felony counts involving falsified autopsies in Lubbock, Hockley and Dickens counties. Under plea agreements he was sentenced to 10 years of probation and 200 hours of community service and was ordered to pay two counties nearly $17,000 in restitution for autopsy fees and costs of exhumations, medical re-examinations and reburials.
Dr. Erdmann, who surrendered his medical license in August, after his indictment, still faces criminal investigations, lawsuits and demands for testimony in many other cases.
"The botched autopsies he's been indicted on so far are just a small sample," said Tommy Turner, the special prosecutor in a Lubbock court of inquiry that investigated Dr. Erdmann last summer.
 
'This Guy Was a Liar'
 Mr. Turner said a fairly quick and narrow examination of Dr. Erdmann's work turned up evidence of about 100 faked autopsies.
"We started digging up bodies," Mr. Turner said, "and when we were seven for seven we decided that in the interests of judicial economy we didn't have to go further to prove that this guy was a liar."
Don Hurley, a Lubbock lawyer who is appealing a murder case in which he said Dr. Erdmann falsified a toxicology report, said, "I believe as I believe that the sun will come up tomorrow that there was a conspiracy between the prosecution and Erdmann to say whatever was necessary to get a conviction, and I don't have any doubt that there is a cover-up now."
 
Prosecutors Deny Guilt
 Prosecutors have angrily denied such accusations. Even though the Randall County District Attorney, Randy Sherrod, said, "I wouldn't use Erdmann again, ever, based on what I know now," he insisted, "I never saw an autopsy by Erdmann that was not correct on the basis of other evidence."
Repeated attempts over four days to reach Dr. Erdmann at his home in Lubbock were unsuccessful.
When a person dies during a crime or under questionable circumstances, law-enforcement authorities routinely order an autopsy by a medical specialist. In criminal cases an autopsy is often presented as evidence by the prosecution and the examiner is called to testify as an expert witness.
In many cities the autopsies are performed by medical examiners or coroners who are full-time government employees, but jurisdictions in rural areas contract with pathologists for such services. Lubbock County paid Dr. Erdmann more than $140,000 a year under such a contract, and he collected as much as $600 per autopsy elsewhere.
Dr. Erdmann, who claimed to have a medical degree from a university in his home country of Mexico, performed as many as 400 autopsies a year in West Texas. His practice consisted basically of his contract work doing autopsies, and, all the while he worked in close collaboration with many prosecutors and police officials, some of whom are now prominent in politics.
Defense lawyers say their suspicions of falsified autopsies and a cover-up have been heightened by the way law-enforcement authorities reacted to the initial accusations against Dr. Erdmann.
Prosecutors in Lubbock learned on Feb. 14 that the doctor was about to be indicted in a neighboring county, said Steve Holmes, chief administrator of the Lubbock District Attorney's office, but they did not open their own investigation into his activities in their own county until April 3. County officials explained that they had had no complaints of criminal wrongdoing by him in their jurisdiction, but defense lawyers dispute that.
 
Talk of 'Fantasies'
 In a review of criminal cases involving Dr. Erdmann's autopsies, independent pathologists concurred with Dr. Erdmann's findings every time, Mr. Holmes said. But he could not say how many cases had been reviewed.
"There are clear indications," Mr. Turner said, "that a number of people in law enforcement considered him weird and questioned his competence because he regularly messed up evidence and he did strange things like handing people organs to hold. But no one blew the whistle."
Dr. Erdmann's dealings with the authorities were not within the scope of the special inquiry last summer, but the prosecutor, Mr. Turner, said, "From what I learned about the man, it seemed Erdmann had fantasies aggrandizing his role in law enforcement to the point that he may have shaded things to follow along with the police theory of a case."
As an example, Mr. Turner noted the case of Craig Newman, which led to the indictment of Dr. Erdmann last February.
When Dr. Erdmann arrived to perform an autopsy of Mr. Newman, a 41-year-old Levelland man found dead in his home, Mr. Turner said, a police officer made a casual remark speculating that drugs were involved. When the autopsy later stated that Mr. Newman died of a cocaine overdose, his family was incensed, insisting he never used drugs.
Then, one family member noted that the autopsy listed the spleen as ane internal organ that had been examined and weighed, although Mr. Newman's spleen had been removed years earlier.
Mr. Newman's body was exhumed, but no autopsy incision marks were found on it. Another autopsy was then performed and showed that Mr. Newman had died of a heart attack.
 
New Turn for a Trial
 District Attorney Sherrod, who used Dr. Erdmann in dozens of criminal cases in his Panhandle county over many years, described the doctor as "a weird kook" and acknowledged that Dr. Erdmann exaggerated his qualifications, for example by falsely claiming to be an expert on ballistics. As a trial witness "he'd confuse left with right," Mr. Sherrod said, "and say 'up' when he meant 'down' because he wouldn't prepare for trials."
In the past weeks, defense lawyers have transformed a seemingly straightforward murder being prosecuted by Mr. Sherrod in Canyon into a test case for the accusations that Dr. Erdmann's incompetence was tolerated or even abetted by prosecutors and the police.
In the Canyon case, Douglas Palmer, 19, is charged with capital murder in the beating death of an elderly man during a botched burglary. His lawyers argue that Mr. Palmer should not be on trial for capital murder because he never intended to kill the man. But the facts of the case have almost been forgotten as the pretrial hearing has become a battleground over Dr. Erdmann, whose autopsy supported the prosecution's case.
Mr. Sherrod has opened grand jury proceedings against Dr. Erdmann for falsifying tissue samples in the Palmer case, but he insists the findings of the autopsy of Mr. Palmer's victim are correct.
Two lawyers nationally known for their work in fighting death penalty cases, Millard Farmer of Atlanta and Steven Losch of New York, joined Mr. Palmer's defense team and have used the pre-trial hearing to explore Dr. Erdmann's career, issuing subpoenas to more than 50 law-enforcement officials to testify about their relations with him.
That has sparked a storm of motions, charges and counter-charges that is still going on.
So far, two police officers have testified in support of the charges of prosecutorial misconduct. Both have since been indicted for perjury, one for his testimony on Dr. Erdmann and the other in an unrelated case.
Last month, Mr. Farmer was indicted on a charge of tampering with a witness -- in this case threatening Dr. Erdmann to get favorable testimony out of him.
Defense lawyers say all of the indictments are a vindictive effort to derail the investigation of Dr. Erdmann's relations with law enforcement. Prosecutors argue, however, that they are defending the legal system from maliciously overeager lawyers.
All of this has simply excited the defense bar's appetite for appealing almost any case that Dr. Erdmann touched.
"The state is either going to have to make great deals with prisoners or it's going to have to be digging up a whole lot of bodies," said Rod Hobson Jr., president of the Lubbock Criminal Defense Lawyers Association."

HEADLINE: The Transition: Reporter's Notebook;
Shaping Nation From Little Rock Cafe

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 21

 BODY:
Anyone who doubts that a power dinner could be held in this riverside capital about 1,100 miles from the Potomac should have been at Cafe Saint Moritz on Friday evening.
Barely noticed in a dimly lighted dining room as they shared a modest bottle of Clos du Bois chardonnay were two of the most influential figures on President-elect Bill Clinton's team working to assemble a new government: Warren M. Christopher, director of the transition, and Eli Segal, the chief financial officer. 
 After Mr. Christopher finished the blackfish and Mr. Segal had the chicken and linguine, they paid the tab (embarrassingly small by Washington standards, $39.61), and slipped out as quietly as they came, leaving no clues as to who might be named the Secretary of Anything. Flies on the Little Rock walls never had it so good.
Such is life in and around the transition these days: decisions are being made, but the power is so closely held that even most people on the transition staff are buzzing with uninformed speculation as to what those decisions are.
Historians call it the gradual transfer of power. Perhaps more precisely, Bruce Reed, the transition's deputy for domestic policy, calls it "the adjustment from the campaign to reality."
 
How to Address the Boss

It is a time of awkward limbo for Mr. Clinton and his advisers, let alone the country itself. Mr. Clinton may not be a candidate anymore, but he is not the President quite yet either. In fact, he is still Governor. So everyone who is part of the Government-in-wait here seems to be having a hard time figuring out just how to behave.
Betsey Wright, a longtime aide to Mr. Clinton who is director of public outreach for the transition, is even struggling over how to refer to her boss. "I called him Bill but now I realize I need to change that," she said. "I don't know if you're supposed to refer to him as 'the President' or what. Right now, I just say 'he.' "
Ms. Wright is not alone. Reporters who have covered Mr. Clinton for months are now finding themselves tossing in a respectful "sir" as they question him at news conferences.
As they wander about this town, only one thing sets the powers-to-be apart from the wannabes: handwritten name tags that identify them as members of the transition. The stickers are less official looking even than the ones aides wore during the campaign, but they allow staff members to glide past the tight security on the fourth and fifth floors of the Atkins building here, the antiseptic home of the transition office.
The few outsiders who are allowed entry can immediately spot a big change from the campaign: the same people who for nearly a year never dared put on a tie or a dress are now outfitted like stockbrokers.
"People look different and they act a little different," said Jeff Eller, a press aide in the transition. "It's a nice time to talk and dream. What happens is another matter."
Though many staff members are nervous about what jobs they will get in the new Administration, or whether they will get any job at all, there is a perceptible calmness to the transition that is far different from the chaotic atmosphere of the campaign.
One transition official said the best way to describe the difference is to compare Mr. Christopher, a sober-minded, dark-suited elder statesman of the party, with James Carville, the campaign's fidgety chief strategist who favored T-shirts, jeans and outbursts. "Imagine the difference," he said, "between having a wild Cajun being your boss and Warren Christopher."
 
From Campaign to Reality
 Perhaps the biggest adjustment for Mr. Clinton is that every word he utters, every move he publicly makes, takes on unfathomed new significance, particularly since there is a vacuum of real news out of the transition. Why else would the First Kitty To Be, Socks, have made it onto the front page of newspapers across America?
Today, Clinton watchers here were wondering why the next Chief Executive played golf on a dreary drizzling day (he lost two balls in the fog). What does that portend for how he will use his leisure time? Will Mr. Clinton follow President Bush's lead and play aerobic golf, rushing from hole to hole?
Mr. Clinton stirred the most controversy since the election in a seemingly offhand comment to a reporter about protecting homosexuals in the military, something he had pledged to do many times during the campaign. His remark set off a firestorm that shows no sign of subsiding. One Clinton adviser likened the issue to the Clinton draft controversy during the campaign: it just will not go away.
"We learned from that that anything the President-elect says is news, even if it isn't new," Mr. Reed said. "Every action is no longer conditional. We're no longer in the business of managing expectations; we have to bring about results."
After holding hundreds of news conferences as a candidate, Mr. Clinton's first one as President-elect was scrutinized for both style and substance, as if he had never spoken to reporters before. It is as if he did not mean what he said when he was a mere candidate.
As important to people as what Mr. Clinton says is what he does not say. After he fielded questions during a news conference about Haiti and Korea, the transition office's switchboard lit up with calls from people representing other nationalities: Why didn't the next President mention them?
When Mr. Clinton addressed campaign finance legislation but did not specifically mention curbing the use of so-called "soft money" by the political parties, that left some interest groups buzzing. And whenever Mr. Clinton neglects to mention a middle-class tax cut as part of his economic package, that sets off another round of speculation.
The President-elect's advisers are also hanging on his every public utterance. Grousing that all the deals are being cut at "The Mansion" and that their access to Mr. Clinton has been limited of late, many aides are seeking other sources of guidance on drafting legislative proposals.
To that end, probably the most popular reading among the transition staff is "Putting People First," the compendium of campaign promises by Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore. And several aides said they were relieved at the President-elect's first post-election news conference when he reeled off his initial priorities.
Transition officials said they are well aware how even their comments carry new weight. "We sat and talked about it -- how life was going to be very different," Mr. Eller said. Choosing his words carefully, he went on, "What you say can have an impact on the economy of a foreign country or the stock market."
 
Dissension in the Ranks
 It was bound to happen sooner or later, even as Clinton aides are still giddy over victory: rumblings of dissension in the ranks.
While no one dares register a complaint for the record, several Clinton aides admit that they were not altogether pleased that at a time when populous symbols could not be more important, Mr. Clinton attended a Washington dinner hosted by Pamela Harriman, probably the most elite of the elite Democratic fund raisers.
Asked about the dinner, several Clinton aides rolled their eyes, and some did not even try to defend their boss. Seeking to put the best face on the dinner, one aide said he could only hope that the dinner was not a sign of things to come.
"I wouldn't want official Washington to be lulled into a false sense of security," he said. "Anyone who thinks that Bill Clinton is going to be co-opted is pretty naive." But the aide was not confident enough to be quoted by name on the matter.

HEADLINE: Once-Soviet Jews Again Find Their Way to Israel

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 21

 BODY:
After hitting a low point last spring, immigration from former Soviet territory to Israel has gained new life, bolstered by a spurt of arrivals from troubled regions and the predominantly Muslim states of Central Asia.
The numbers are far from what they were two years ago, when the present wave of immigration reached a peak and 15,000 to 20,000 arrivals a month were routine. 
 But since spring, and then gathering momentum after the advent of a Labor-led Government in mid-July, each monthly immigrant total from the former Soviet Union has been higher than that of the previous month.
In May, there were 3,361 newcomers, the lowest figure since this wave got rolling in 1989. It climbed to 6,832 in October, and Israeli officials say it should end up at least that high in November, remaining consistently in the monthly range of 8,000 to 10,000 through 1993.
 
100,000 a Year
 The projections translate into 100,000 or so new arrivals a year. If these forecasts hold up, the raw figures will continue to be unusually high by historical standards and, for this country of five million, would be the equivalent of five million immigrants to the United States. Actual legal immigration to the United States was 1.8 million in 1991, the latest year for which official figures are available, and the number of illegal immigrants is unknown.
As in the past, most of the immigrants are Russian and Ukrainian Jews. But a rising number -- about 2,900 in October, more than 40 percent of the total -- come from strife-torn areas like Georgia and Tajikistan or from basically tranquil Islamic republics where nationalism and religious fundamentalism have made inroads.
It is thus far not so much a problem of rampant anti-Semitism and violence, although there have been incidents like graveyard desecrations, said Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental body that oversees immigration to Israel. Rather, he said, it is a historical fear that aggressive anti-Semitism will not lag far behind if wobbly post-Communist structures tumble.
"We have many signs of growing anti-Semitic sentiments being expressed both in the Asian and European parts of the former Soviet Union," Mr. Dinitz said in an interview.
 
Burden and Blessing
 The Russians, as the newcomers are generally called here regardless of their origin, are both a burden and a blessing for more established Israelis -- a burden because tending to them is expensive, a blessing because heavy immigration is the only way that the country's Jewish majority has avoided losing ground to a faster-growing Muslim minority.
About 400,000 immigrants have arrived from former Soviet territory since the start of 1989, accounting now for 10 percent of the Jewish population and, when combined with earlier Russian arrivals, forming the largest single group by area of origin.
Given the large percentage of scientists, musicians and physicians among the new arrivals, they are widely viewed here as raw material for a future cultural flourishing. But Israel has not been able to generate enough work for all the arriving violinists and engineers.
It was in part because of the high unemployment rate here -- over 10 percent for all Israelis and over 30 percent for new immigrants -- that tens of thousands of Russians holding exit visas decided earlier this year that they were better off staying put for a while.
 
Two Factors Cited
 Mr. Dinitz and his agency's chief of immigration, Uri Gordon, say Labor's rise to power last summer may help explain why the monthly arrival totals have started to climb back up again -- that and the Bush Administration's decision to reward the new Government with $10 billion in United States loan guarantees to stimulate the economy.
"The expectations of this Government, in the peace process and other areas, are very high," said Mr. Gordon.
But Mr. Dinitz, a leading Labor Party figure, acknowledges that Government promises still exist largely on paper and that hoped-for economic breakthroughs have yet to occur. A more likely reason for the increased immigration, he says, is a worsening situation in Russia and other states, including rumors of possible coups and concern about the firmness of President Boris N. Yeltsin's grip on power.
Once arrived, many newcomers say work is their main worry. Housing, once a serious problem, is no longer a dominant issue, although thousands of Russians still live in shabby apartments and cheek-to-jowl trailers in Beersheva and Ashdod.
 
Businesses Started
 Nor is the situation entirely bleak even in regard to jobs and business opportunities. Yuri Shtern, who is in charge of immigrant issues for the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce, says Russians have begun between 2,000 and 4,000 new businesses in the last two years, each employing an average of three workers, usually fellow Russians. As for unemployment, it is most conspicuous among older people and the most recent arrivals. The Finance Ministry says that after two years here, 90 percent of the men and 85 percent of the women have found work.
But immigrants say the figures are misleading because at least two-thirds who are working have failed to find jobs in their professions, especially the nearly 10,000 physicians among them.
Alex Berkowitz, 29 years old, was a veterinarian in Ukraine. After a year and a half in this country, he makes car windows on a kibbutz near Jerusalem. "I want to work in my field, but there's nothing for me in it here," he said. "You need pull and a lot of luck."
It is the same for Marina Buger, 40, who came from Moscow last year and could not find a job as a construction engineer. She is a cleaning woman now.
"Israelis ask us how we are, and now we say, 'O.K., O.K.," Mrs. Buger said. "But it isn't O.K. They tell us to have patience, that it will be all right. But they don't understand that there is no time for patience."
 
Employment Is Paramount
 For Russians, employment means almost everything, says Dr. Jacob Schultz, a psychiatrist who directs psychological services for the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, an advocacy group for immigrants.
"Work was one of the greatest values in the Soviet Union," he said. "How else could a Jew prove his worth? Suddenly, here, in their own country, they lose it, and so they lose a major part of their identity. There is a feeling of helplessness."
Thus far, Dr. Schultz and others say, the unhappiness has been mostly internalized. The number of recent arrivals who have given up on Israel and moved elsewhere is low -- below 5 percent, according to Mr. Dinitz.
Now and then, there is a news report about aberrant behavior, like the Russian father who killed his daughter. More than a few Russian women have become prostitutes.
 
'Depression Is Inside'
 But these extreme forms of trouble are the exceptions. "The depression is inside," said Mussya Greis, an economist with the Zionist Forum.
Israeli officials insist that they are well aware of the need for swift action. One idea, Mr. Dinitz says, is to encourage increased immigration by teen-agers, and he says his agency has identified 10,000 youngsters in the former Soviet Union whose parents are ready to let them come here while they themselves stay behind.
Teen-agers can be expensive because they require schooling and shelter, Mr. Dinitz said. But among other benefits, they relieve the immediate burden of providing jobs.
"When they will finally enter the work force," he said, "they will be full-fledged Israelis, trained here and speaking the language. In the long run, that may be the best kind of immigration for us."

HEADLINE: 2 Top Iraqis to Ask U.N. Again to End Economic Sanctions

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Iraq's Foreign Minister, Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, plan to appeal to the Security Council on Monday that it end the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Western diplomats said today.
But the diplomats said the officials would probably be rebuffed. 
 In a letter to the president of the Security Council released today, Mr. Sahhaf said his Government "firmly believes that it has fully discharged the substantive obligations" imposed by the Council for lifting the sanctions. "It is incumbent on the Council," he said, "to begin to lift the embargo and all the exceptional measures imposed on Iraq."
Among those measures was the demand that Iraq accept and assist United Nations specialists in dismantling its remaining weapons of mass destruction and the means for producing them. Almost two years later, United Nations weapons specialists contend that Iraq continues to thwart their efforts to find and destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and conventional long-range missiles, and the programs that develop them.
Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the United Nations commission in charge of effort, said last week that Iraq continued to ignore requests for a list of foreign suppliers of expertise and materiel for its nuclear program.
Mr. Ekeus and Hans Blix, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, are also scheduled to address the Security Council on Monday.
United Nations officials have also complained frequently about Iraq's lack of cooperation in efforts to bring humanitarian aid to the Kurds in northern Iraq and to the Shiite Muslims in the south.
Although the Security Council regularly reviews Iraq's compliance with the cease-fire, diplomats here suggested that this particular visit by two high-level Iraqis was timed to attract the attention of the new Democratic Administration in Washington. They noted that before leaving Baghdad, Mr. Aziz told the Iraqi news agency that the Security Council had acted against Iraq "under the pressure of the Bush Administration" and that he hoped the situation would improve after President-elect Bill Clinton takes office.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Will Impose Longer Factory Shifts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Nov. 21

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said Friday that it would begin scheduling its factory workers to 10- and 12-hour shifts on an involuntary basis.
The move, putting many employees on workweeks of three or four days, whether or not they prefer it, imposes the last batch of terms in a contract offer that had caused an unsuccessful 163-day strike. 
 Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, defeated the strike in April by threatening to hire replacement workers. It then immediately began operating under some terms of the rejected contract. Its latest changes will also increase employee pensions and alter the nature of the company's profit-sharing program. They take effect on Dec. 1.
"We need to move ahead with business," Gerald Flaherty, the company's president, said Friday in announcing the changes.
Officials of the United Automobile Workers, which waged the strike that was brought to its knees last spring, said the scheduling of longer, involuntary shifts was "further evidence of top management's blatant antiworker, union-busting agenda."
Caterpillar, based here in Peoria has long wanted the flexibility to schedule factory workers to four 10-hour days a week or three 12-hour days. The company will now have that flexibility in plants where production schedules demand round-the-clock operation.
And, in a departure from the terms of the company's old contract with the U.A.W., there will be no premium pay for employees who are scheduled to work on weekends or holidays. "But overtime will be paid for extra hours worked," said Jerry Brust, Caterpillar's labor relations director.
The U.A.W.'s international secretary-treasurer, Bill Casstevens, responded to the changes by issuing a statement that said the involuntary flexible schedules would disrupt workers' lives and take away "long-established economic rights to overtime pay" for weekend and holiday work.
"Caterpillar has turned into a many-legged monster that keeps dropping shoes that trample workers," the statement said.
The end of the union's strike came last spring through an accord worked out with Federal mediators. Under its provisions, the union agreed to send its members back to work, and the company, although saying it would impose the terms of its contract proposal, agreed to continue bargaining with the U.A.W. for a new pact. Those negotiations have reached a stalemate, however, and no new talks are scheduled.
The contract provisions put into effect by the company in April included higher wages, a six-year moratorium on plant closings and improved pensions. The new changes will again increase pensions, in 1993 and in each of the following two years. They will also scrap the company's old profit-sharing arrangement, so that a given worker's bonus will be tied to the performance of the worker's profit center, or division, and not to the performance of the company as a whole.
Charles Harris, an industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company in New York, said Caterpillar was now working directly with employees and making the U.A.W. "irrelevant" to the bargaining process.
"The U.A.W. is in the dust," Mr. Harris said. "The U.A.W. has lost control. They're out of it. How do they get back in? Only if people violently disagree with what Caterpillar has put into place."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Badillo Is Considering His 4th Mayoral Race

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
Politics isn't baseball, which may be why, after three strikes since 1969, Herman Badillo says he expects to decide for certain early next year whether to take a fourth swing at the mayoralty of New York.
"Increasingly, a substantial group of people say they will raise money for a campaign because they're concerned about the city going downhill -- especially in terms of jobs," said Mr. Badillo, the former Housing Commissioner, Bronx Borough President, Congressman and Deputy Mayor to Edward I. Koch. 
 "Nobody at City Hall will insist on tough standards," said the 63-year-old ("but I still run marathons") elder statesman of Hispanic politicians. "With Andy Stein, there's nothing forceful. Rudy Giuliani is forceful, but in the wrong way. I can say to a black or Puerto Rican, 'You're doing something wrong,' and nobody's going to call me a racist."
Mr. Badillo figures he would draw enough votes in a Democratic primary to force Mayor David N. Dinkins into a runoff -- and then Mr. Badillo would inherit enough of Council President Andrew J. Stein's support among Jewish voters to win.
"It's plausible," said Mr. Koch, who added that if Mr. Badillo runs he will support him. What about their bitter feud that led to Mr. Badillo's resigning as Mr. Koch's deputy? "He thought he was the mayor," Mr. Koch said. "Now he can be."
 
Revving Up for '93
 It is nearly a year before the next gubernatorial election in New Jersey and six weeks before any candidate can officially enter the race, but by all indications the political camps have already begun trying to outflank the other.
Cary Edwards, a Republican and former State Attorney General, opened the maneuvering last week, with a mass mailing of videotapes that featured him promoting his ideas on state government. The 20,000 tapes went to executives, campaign contributors and every elected Republican official in the state.
"I hope you will take a few minutes to watch this tape," said an accompanying letter. "If you like what you hear, please join this effort to bring new ideas and new solutions to state government."
In a countermove, one of Mr. Edwards's likely challengers for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Christine Todd Whitman, announced the formation of a political committee "for the purpose of raising funds to cover the expenses associated with my exploration of running for governor in 1993."
"Though I have not yet made a final decision to become a candidate, the expenses of supporting a staff and exploratory activities necessitates creating this new committee, which will be known as People for Whitman '93," said Ms. Whitman, who came within two percentage points of defeating Senator Bill Bradley in 1990.
Ms. Whitman also announced that she had hired Edward J. Rollins, the political strategist who managed Ronald Reagan's 1984 Presidential campaign, as a consultant.
Mr. Rollins's counterpart in Gov. Jim Florio's campaign is expected to be James Carville, who most recently served as the senior campaign strategist for President-elect Bill Clinton and who for the last year has been an adviser to the Democratic State Committee.
Governor Florio, a Democrat, is expected to run for a second term in 1994, even though he has not announced his intentions.
Ms. Whitman has also hired Hazel F. Gluck, a former State Assemblywoman and Transportation Commissioner with a reputation as one of the toughest campaigners in New Jersey, to manage her day-to-day campaign and to head her exploratory committee.
Although Ms. Whitman has not made a final decision on whether to run, the Democratic State Committee took a pre-emptive strike as though she was a declared gubernatorial candidate, focusing on her choice of Ms. Gluck as an adviser.
"Whitman is trying to make people believe she is an outsider because that is a popular thing to be this year," said the Democratic State Chairman, Raymond J. Lesniak. "In reality, she is the ultimate insider."
 
Take the Bus, Maybe?
 Cash-strapped New Jersey may have to depend on automobile tire retreads to help pull itself out of a budget hole.
The Assembly last week approved and sent to the Senate for a vote a bill that would require the state to purchase retread or remanufactured tires for its fleet of motor vehicles. And like most issues in Trenton, the debate and the vote was heavily partisan.
"I think we're asking for a lot of trouble to save a few bucks," said Assemblyman Thomas Dunn, a Democrat from Elizabeth.
But the bill's Republican sponsors, Assemblyman Robert C. Shinn Jr. of Hainesport and Maureen Ogden of Millburn, defended the idea as not only safe but economically and environmentally sound as well.
"This legislation makes good environmental sense as well as good budget sense," said Mrs. Ogden, who heads the Assembly Environmental Committee. "This legislation will create a market demand for tires that would otherwise become part of the waste stream, contributing to the state's environmental and solid waste problems."
Officials said they have not figured how much money retreads would save.
Some states require retread or remanufactured tires for government-owned heavy trucks. But if the retread bill is approved by the Senate and signed by Gov. Jim Florio, New Jersey would be the only state in the nation to make such purchases required by law for state-owned passenger vehicles, said Robert A. Stuart, a spokesman for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, which has lobbied for the bill.
The legislation would affect about 7,300 vehicles, but not the cars of the governor and other senior government officials whose vehicles are state-owned but not a part of the fleet.
 
Audit Limbo
 For eight months, legislators in Hartford have been wrangling over two of the sweetest jobs in Connecticut government: the co-auditors of public accounts. The auditors, one Democrat, one Republican, are paid up to $94,000 a year to act as watchdogs over how well state agencies function, and the last two auditors liked the work so much they stayed at their posts for 25 years until their retirements this year.
One major wrinkle has been that under state law, members of the General Assembly cannot even be nominated. But with the passing of the Nov. 3 elections, every Representative and Senator who was elected -- even incumbents -- are now in limbo between being elected and being officially seated.
And last week, one of the jobs fell into that breach. The Democratic legislators' caucus announced that State Senator Kevin P. Johnston, a Democrat from Putnam, and an 18-year veteran in the Legislature, was the party's choice for one job. He will resign his Senate seat so that a special election can be held in time for the start of the legislative session on Jan. 6.
The Republicans, some of whom have sniffed that the Democrats were not respecting the spirit of the law in choosing someone from the Legislature, declined to name their choice, and said they would wait until January to do so.

HEADLINE: A Few More Harsh Words for the Payroll Tax

 BODY:
In "The Payroll Tax Is Getting Out of Hand" (Viewpoints, Nov. 8), Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, discussed shortcomings in the Social Security system. Basically, he wrote, F.I.C.A. taxes earmarked primarily for Social Security and Medicare have become a large burden on working people. The payments are not only a hidden tax, he argued, but a very regressive one. Mr. Ornstein's criticism drew a heavy response from readers. Some of their thoughts and suggestions follow.
 
Pity Poor F.D.R.
To the Editor: 
 Mr. Ornstein is looking at the wrong end of the problem. Better to drop the tail of the beast and face the issue head on.
When the original Social Security law was being drafted, serious consideration was given to requiring employers to pay the entire tax.
President Roosevelt wisely insisted that employees contribute, implying that each worker had a stake in the plan that would be impossible to take away. I think F.D.R. would be appalled at the monster created by Social Security bureaucrats with the obeisance of Congress.
As Mr. Ornstein points out, the whole system will collapse in 25 or 30 years, breaking Mr. Roosevelt's compact with the people and ultimately dividing the country while destroying our freedom.
The program is and always has been a transfer payment wherein workers contribute a portion of their pay to provide benefits to other qualified citizens. The program is not, cannot and never will be funded like annuities.
The maximum benefit should be frozen until the minimum benefit equals the current maximum. The covered salary should be reduced to, say, $50,000 and also frozen until the benefit is level. Furthermore, all of the benefits should be subject to tax when a recipient's income from all other sources is, say, $75,000. All tax revenues realized from benefits should be credited to the Social Security fund. Because liabilities will be reduced -- gradually but significantly -- funding requirements could also be reduced, cutting the payroll tax from the current 15 percent to 12 percent, or even 8 percent.
Ultimately, the entire Social Security entitlement should be taxed away when income from all other sources is, say, $250,000. It is insanity to take money from people who are contributing to our economy and give it to people who don't need it.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Releasing Veterans: Not Just for Economy

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
In 1976, Charlie Finley tried to sell some of his best players to other teams, but Bowie Kuhn, then the commissioner, wouldn't let him, saying the Oakland Athletics' owner was liquidating the team. Sixteen years later, teams are trading some of their best players, some admittedly because the players make too much money.
Is this practice questionable? By shedding star players, are these teams saying they don't care if they win? Should someone step in? 
 "You can't make that judgement until you see what the ultimate makeup of the team is," Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association, said when those questions were posed to him. "Teams go in cycles. There's always a trade or two or three where people wonder what's going on, but it's too early to tell."
Two recent examples of what appear to be fire sales have been the San Diego Padres' trade of Tony Fernandez to the Mets and the Pittsburgh Pirates' trade of Jose Lind to the Kansas City Royals.
 
Lind's Successor Ready
 Joe McIlvaine, the Padres' general manager, has acknowledged that he has instructions to reduce the payroll, and he made the best trade he could for the team's talented shortstop. Ted Simmons, the Pirates' general manager, provided an eloquent explanation for his move with Lind.
Simmons acknowledged that salary arbitration for Lind was one of the factors he considered, but other, equally important elements of the makeup of the Pirates dictated the move. It has nothing to do with a disregard for winning, he added.
"I don't feel that way at all," Simmons said, "because if I didn't have Carlos Garcia, if I didn't have Kevin Young, if I didn't have Albert Martin as young major-league ready, top-notch talent to replace these people, I couldn't do this. This actually is the second year in row for Garcia. He was ready last year. We have to make room for these people."
Simmons compared the Pirates' current circumstances to a time five years ago when they traded Johnny Ray to make room for Lind at second base. "Now, five years later, Carlos Garcia is ready," Simmons said. "He has to get on the field. We're not blowing it out because of money."
Garcia, a 25-year-old shortstop, had the best season of his six-year minor league career. Playing for Class AAA Buffalo, he batted .303, hit 13 home runs, drove in 70 runs and had 21 stolen bases. He will get a chance to play second next season.
Young, 23, will have a chance to win the third base job. Martin, who will be 25 tomorrow, is expected to succeed Barry Bonds in left field.
 
Even Odds on Drabek
 "You've spent $6 million to get these three kids here by developing them through the minors," Simmons said. "You have to make the decision, are they ready or not?"
Rumors have circulated that the Pirates also plan to trade shortstop Jay Bell, but Simmons denied that he has such plans.
"Everybody wants Bell and Garcia," he said. "If I do Bell, it's got to be bowl-me-over time. If I can't sign Bonds and Drabek and I've traded Lind and then if I trade Bell, how am I going to explain that to this town? If you're interested in Bell, you'll have to make it bigger than life."
Simmons said his chance of signing Bonds, on a scale of 1 to 10, was zero. Doug Drabek, he said, is a 5. "I'm hoping it's a five," he added. "I may find out it's a 2."
Last May, the Pirates offered Drabek $20 million for four years, basically meeting his asking price, Simmons said. "He changed his mind, and I understand why," the former catcher added. "I realize how compelling free agency is."
Besides trading Lind last week, Simmons jettisoned five players from this year's team by releasing them -- relief pitchers Bob Patterson, Roger Mason and Vicente Palacios, and outfielders Cecil Espy and Gary Varsho.
Explaining his reason for the wholesale moves, the general manager said: "People think the expansion draft is over. We're halfway through it. Everybody was focusing on the 15-man list. What people are missing is there's a 40-man list."
Clubs had to submit their 40-man major league rosters by midnight Friday. National League clubs had to be particularly careful about the players they left off the 40 because a one-time rule for the two expansion teams will be in effect for the draft of minor league players in two weeks.
The Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies will be permitted to draft players from N.L. clubs (at $50,000 each) and, contrary to the regular rule, send them to the minor leagues any time next year without offering them back to the team they had been with.
Each team can select two players in the draft itself, then pick an additional six players each (no more than one from a team) in the 24 hours after the draft. A club could conceivably lose more than one player.
In compiling the roster, General Manager Al Harazin of the Mets said: "You had to be mindful of the fact they had these additional rights. You have to be more conscious of how you shape your list. If you were wavering on a player, you'd err on the side of protecting somebody."
One deterrent to drafting a player under the regular rule is that he must be kept in the majors the entire following season or else be offered back to his former team. The Marlins and the Rockies won't be so restricted.
"Chico Lind is as much related to that as it is to salary arbitration eligibility as it is to Carlos Garcia," Simmons explained. "They're inseparable. All National League teams were going through this. I wanted the expansion draft over so I could begin to think in the tangible or literal context as opposed to nine months of the hypothetical. I knew you'd have only three days to do it."
He released veterans, Simmons said, "not because they were bad players, but I couldn't afford the roster spots. We couldn't afford to risk them and lose a kid."
Roster sizes could change between now and the Dec. 7 draft with trades or signing of free agents, but as of now, Florida has four open spots and Colorado two.
 
The Walt Weiss Mystery
 One of the more curious developments of last week's expansion draft was the trade between Florida and Oakland that sent shortstop Walt Weiss to the Marlins and catcher Eric Helfand back to the Athletics hours after the Marlins drafted Helfand from the A's.
Explaining the trade and its derivation, Sandy Alderson, the Oakland general manager, said it began with the difficult decision of whether the team would protect Weiss from the draft. "We wound up protecting him for a possible role next year and because he was more valuable than giving him up in the draft," Alderson said. "We felt we could sneak through a couple of prospects in the first round."
Alderson also said: "The night before the draft, it became clear we were going to lose someone we valued. We talked with the Marlins about the possibility of trading Weiss for someone they would draft from us in the first round that we would identify. In addition we would like another player they would pick in the third round."
"The whole thing was contingent on the player we identified being taken in the first round," the general manager said. "Had Colorado taken someone else before Florida had had the opportunity, the whole thing would have been off."
Helfand, a 23-year-old catcher, was the player the Athletics wanted the Marlins to draft. The Marlins had planned to take a different Oakland player, but with their ninth pick in the first round they selected Helfand.
"By doing that," Alderson said, "we were able to protect an additional five players without losing one," meaning Helfand and the four players (including two other catchers) the Athletics pulled back after the first round.
Why didn't they just leave Weiss unprotected? "He might not have been the player taken," Alderson said.
 
Ultimate Bonus Baby
 Otis Nixon of Atlanta wound up earning the largest amount in bonuses this year, receiving $2.05 million for being on the Braves' roster at six specified dates during the year. His contract was structured that way because of his drug suspension last year. Other top earners in bonuses were Rick Sutcliffe of Baltimore, $1.2 million ($1.1 million for number of games started, $100,000 for being comeback player of the year); Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles, $1 million (for starts), and Doug Jones of Houston, $1 million ($450,000 for number of games, $350,000 for roster time, $100,000 for being comeback player of the year, $75,000 for second place in the Rolaid relief standings, $25,000 for making the All-Star Game).
With all of the post-season bonuses determined, the major league average salary, based on figures compiled by The New York Times, wound up at $1,014,213, a 19.5 percent increase over last year's $848,499.

HEADLINE: NOV. 15-21: Referendum Defeat;
Panama's Leader Loses The Expectations Game

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
Panama's economy is growing rapidly and its people are better off than those in most of Latin America. So how to explain the Government's embarrassing defeat in a constitutional referendum last Sunday? In part it reflects a tradition in which Latin Americans expect presidents to be involved in solving everybody's problems, or at least to talk passionately about them.
With the United States perceived as the father of the laissez-faire presidency of Guillermo Endara, the new Administration in Washington can't ignore his weakened status without seeming to avoid the responsibility tacitly assumed with the 1989 American invasion. 
 Before that, Panamanians were being beaten in the streets in their heroic effort to end 21 years of military rule. Mr. Endara, victorious in the May 1989 elections but prevented from taking office by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was installed by the United States when it invaded on Dec. 20, 1989. General Noriega was taken to Florida and tried and convicted on drug-trafficking charges.
One of the constitutional amendments put before the voters would have prohibited the rebuilding of a Panamanian military force. But it and 57 other reforms were rejected by a 2-to-1 margin in a vote seen as an expression of dissatisfaction with Mr. Endara.
Aside from a serious crime problem, Panama has adjusted smoothly to an open, democratic society, but the populist military regimes had conditioned Panamanians to the idea that there is a payoff for supporting a government. Today, most people expect more spoils than they are getting from democracy, and are not impressed by the argument of President Endara and his supporters that individual liberty means they have to create their own economic opportunities.

HEADLINE: Inefficient Soviet Economy Halted Cold War;
The Costs at Home

 BODY:
To the Editor:
George F. Kennan (Op-Ed., Oct. 28), one of the major architects of containment, writes with insight of the cold war: "Nobody -- no country, no party, no person -- 'won' the cold war. It was a long and costly political rivalry, fueled on both sides by unreal and exaggerated estimates of the intentions and strength of the other party. It greatly overstrained the economic resources of both countries, leaving both, by the end of the 1980's, confronted with heavy financial, social and, in the case of the Russians, political problems." 
 We are left with "sober re-examination," a doleful price to pay. It seems now one innocent casualty of that war was Alger Hiss. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, chairman of the Russian military intelligence archives, declared the allegations against Mr. Hiss "completely groundless."
Unreconstructed cold warriors in this country are unconvinced. According to Mr. Hiss, Whittaker Chambers, his accuser, was a "psychopath" and Richard Nixon, his political prosecutor, an "opportunistic politician." Their careers catapulted, while his plummeted. Chambers, who died in 1961, was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan, and Mr. Nixon was President between 1969 and 1974.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of American lives and reputations were ruined as a result of the cold war. Everybody else lost in the witchhunt hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
More important, the whole rancid affair caused an American generation to develop grotesque, indelible images of a twisted drama based on a hysteria about some alien ideology called Communism invading their country. Such cold war hysteria only fueled a "mistake" later in Vietnam.
Most of us are puzzled by the rapid demise of the Eastern European bloc. We are left unprepared for the unanswerable questions about the future. A generation in limbo and fear, many of us lost trust in our politicians. Some even felt robbed of their innocent youth to judge for themselves the meanings of hostile beliefs such as socialism.

HEADLINE: Inefficient Soviet Economy Halted Cold War;
U-2 Saved the Peace

 BODY:
To the Editor:
George F. Kennan, in asserting that the U-2 represented the militarization of United States cold war policy (Op-Ed, Oct. 28), ignores that in the late 1950's hard intelligence developed from U-2 flights over the Soviet Union tended to discourage an acceleration of the arms race. U-2 photographs contradicted fears of a bomber and missile gap and convinced American policy makers that the United States enjoyed strategic superiority over the Soviet Union. 
 Thirty years ago, U-2 intelligence warned the Kennedy Administration that the Soviets were building a strategic missile base in Cuba, with far more missiles than even a nuclear tripwire against invasion entailed. Through the use of this evidence, the United States was able to muster international condemnation of Soviet actions and bought the time to respond prudently. Evidence of the missiles' operational status, derived from U-2 photographs and confirmed by other intelligence, convinced the President not to risk an air strike on the island, an option recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Thus a crisis that might well have resulted in a hot war in the 1960's was resolved peacefully: the opposite of what one would have expected with Mr. Kennan's thesis about the effect of the U-2 on United States-Soviet relations.

HEADLINE: Inefficient Soviet Economy Halted Cold War;
What Khrushchev Did

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I heartily agree with George F. Kennan (Op-Ed, Oct. 28) that "nobody -- no country, no party, no person -- 'won' the cold war," I nevertheless take exception to his revisionist assertion that Nikita S. Khrushchev "offered the greatest hope for international political liberalization and relaxation of international tensions" and that "downing of the U-2, more than anything else, put an end to this hope . . . humiliated Khrushchev and discredited his relatively moderate policies." 
 In 1955 at the Geneva summit, President Eisenhower offered the Soviets an open skies proposal to help overcome the problems engendered by reciprocal fears. This would have brought the relaxation in tensions Mr. Kennan states Khrushchev sought. But the Soviets rebuffed the idea.
Worse, under Khrushchev's leadership, the Soviets engineered a program of strategic deception, designed to exaggerate Soviet nuclear strength: the infamous long-range bomber fly-over that portrayed the Soviets as having twice as many strategic bombers as they did; Khrushchev's false proclamation in 1956 that his country had operational intercontinental ballistic missile capability, which propelled the idea of an impending missile gap; his bluffed threat to use nuclear-tip missiles against Israel, France and Britain during the Suez crisis of 1956; his assertion in 1960 that ballistic missiles had made other forms of warfare obsolete, and his attempt to deploy missiles secretly to Cuba in 1962.
The U-2's overflew the Soviet Union more than four years before the Soviets found means and opportunity to down a plane in 1960. Surely, Khrushchev and his Politburo were not surprised. The incident hardly discredited Khrushchev's "moderate" policies; they weren't moderate. Indeed, Khrushchev seized on the event to embarrass Eisenhower and scuttle the Paris summit meeting that Khrushchev's Berlin threats caused to be convened.

HEADLINE: The House Inflation Built

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
Receiving my renewal notice for a Yankees partial season-ticket package, I found that the Yankees are putting an additional squeeze on their fans. Ticket prices have been raised from $14.50 a year ago to $16 for 1993, a $3.50 increase since over 1991. 
 Being able to afford a few games matters greatly to some of baseball's most ardent supporters. Baseball shouldn't be only for the elite, who sparsely fill the corporate boxes. It belongs to the most loyal fans in the right-center field bleachers where a ticket for a seat on a plank now costs $6.50.
I'm not asking Yankee management to feed the world, just to stabilize ticket prices at 1992 rates. In this, the 70th anniversary season of the House that Ruth Built, Yankee Stadium seats should remain affordable for the loyal fans who cheer in good seasons and bad.

Southwestern Bell's Move: Gloom and Glee

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, TEX.

 BODY:
Two months ago Southwestern Bell Corporation sent spirits flying in San Antonio, spread dejection in the St. Louis area and demonstrated again Mexico's importance to the economy of the Southwest.
The mixed reaction came on the heels of an announcement by Edward E. Whitacre Jr., its chairman, that the $9.3 billion communications giant, which has had a long presence in St. Louis, would move its corporate headquarters and 500 jobs to San Antonio. 
 The decision to move to this city of 955,000 residents was based in large part on San Antonio's close ties with Mexico, where Southwestern Bell has a major investment in the Mexican telephone company.
Mr. Whitacre said the move would also put the company in the midst of its largest customer base. Texas accounts for almost 60 percent of Southwestern Bell's 12 million access lines in a five-state area that embraces Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas. By the year 2000 the company expects 70 percent of its business to be in Texas.
News of the relocation -- the largest corporate move in San Antonio's history -- has electrified this city's real estate and business communities. Southwestern Bell already has leased a nearly empty downtown office building and the influx of so many home buyers is expected to jump-start the city's long-depressed residential market. The Texas Department of Commerce estimates that the move will have an overall economic impact in Texas of more than $140 million a year.
Mayor Nelson W. Wolff called the news of the relocation the most significant economic development for the city since the opening of the University of Texas Health Science Center in 1968. Southwestern Bell is the 29th-largest company in the nation, according to Forbes Magazine.
"This sends a strong signal to other companies doing business or interested in doing business with Mexico that San Antonio is the place to be," Mayor Wolff said.
San Antonio was chosen over three other Texas cities, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin, primarily because it is 150 miles from the Mexican border -- closer than the others -- and because of its cultural and historic ties with its southern neighbor.
Known as the Alamo City for its downtown fort besieged and finally overrun by Mexican forces in 1836, it has become a major tourist attraction in recent years. The two-and-a-half-mile Riverwalk winding through downtown on the San Antonio River has a profusion of shops and outdoor restaurants, many of whose customers arrive by barge.
Much of the bilingual city's architecture and many of its shops and restaurants have a distinct Mexican flavor.
Southwestern Bell, along with two partners, Grupo Carso of Mexico and France Telecom, bought controlling interest in Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's telephone system, in 1990. The consortium plans to spend billions rebuilding the telephone system over the next few years.
Southwestern Bell's 10 percent equity interest in Telmex, bought at a cost of $953 million, already has nearly tripled in value as a result of rises in stock prices, said Julia Kearney, a corporate spokeswoman.
The relocation will begin in December with senior management and continue through April as office space in the company's new headquarters is readied. Ms. Kearney said most of the 500 jobs would be filled by employees transferring from St. Louis. The corporation will pay their moving costs, interim living expenses and closing costs. It also will buy any home in St. Louis that a transferred employee is unable to sell within 60 days, she said.
The new headquarters will be in a 13-story building overlooking the San Antonio River. Bell has leased 250,000 square feet of the 273,000-square-foot structure, which has had only a handful of tenants since its completion in 1985. Most of the space was left unfinished.
International Bank of Commerce of Laredo, Tex., bought the high-rise and an adjacent five-story building for $7.5 million from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the day before the relocation announcement on Sept. 29. Within 72 hours of the sale, the bank signed a lease with Bell and the occupancy of the complex, renamed I.B.C. Centre, shot from 27 percent to 100 percent.
The lease has had a significant impact on the downtown office market, said Robert W. Hunt, president of Trinity Asset Management, which negotiated the lease for the bank. Half of the available inventory of class A space was taken off the market in one transaction and the occupancy rate of downtown Class A space increased from 74 percent to 87 percent, he said. Class A space downtown totals 1.9 million square feet.
Mr. Hunt predicted that by the end of the second quarter of 1993 occupancy of prime downtown office space would increase to more than 90 percent as companies serving Bell moved downtown and expanded. "Then we'll see a modest increase in rental rates from their current level of $12.75 per square foot a year," he said.
The downtown area is also expected to benefit from the opening of stores and restaurants aimed at attracting business from the new Bell employees, Mr. Hunt said.
Residential real estate agents say the prospect of hundreds of home buyers coming into a market that has more than a year's supply of homes for sale has generated considerable activity. They say they expect Bell employees to buy houses for $125,000 to $300,000.
But Ms. Kearney cautioned against the possible perception that most of the Bell employees transferring from St. Louis would be highly paid executives looking for expensive homes. In fact, she said, only 5 percent are senior management. Most workers will be support staff, many of whom will be renters or first-time home buyers.
In St. Louis, news of the headquarters relocation has cast a pall, even though more than 10,000 Bell employees will remain in the area. The loss of 500 jobs is a blow to the city, which already has been hard hit by major layoffs at other large firms.
Since 1990, McDonnell Douglas has laid off more than 5,000 workers in the St. Louis area because of cutbacks in the defense industry, and thousands of other jobs have been lost at Chrysler, Trans World Airlines, General Dynamics, Citicorp and I.B.M.
The move will empty out one-fourth of Southwestern Bell's million-square-foot headquarters building in downtown St. Louis. The corporation moved into the $120 million One Bell Centre in 1985. The 42-story tower is part of a complex of four buildings totaling 2 million square feet of office space owned by Bell. But, according to Ms. Kearney, the vacant space in One Bell Centre will be filled by Bell employees now scattered throughout 330,000 square feet of downtown office space leased from outside landlords.
R.A. Herrington, senior vice president of CB Commercial Real Estate Group in St. Louis, said that despite a 21.5 percent office vacancy rate downtown, the space Bell will vacate was not of major concern right now.
"There certainly is a feeling of lost prestige in losing a corporate headquarters, but we're more concerned that other divisions of Southwestern Bell will relocate to Texas down the line as leases here expire," Mr. Herrington said. Bell currently occupies 19 percent of the 11.4 million square feet of Class A office space in downtown St. Louis and 5 percent of the 19 million square feet of suburban Class A space, he said.
Sonny Brockman, president of the St. Louis Association of Realtors, said the relocation would not have a dramatic impact on the residential market because the houses to be sold were spread out across the metropolitan area, varied greatly in price and would come on the market over a five-month period, not all at once.
"Nevertheless, we really hate to see them leave," she said.

HEADLINE: Off-Price Stores: Retailing Impetus

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
IT looked as if the store might have been giving something away. The parking lot was so jammed that cars waited outside for spots. Inside, the lines of shoppers at each cash register seemed endless, and the store hummed with activity.
Recession? Slow economy? Not reflected in the activity at some recent store arrivals on Long Island. 
 The crunch was not for a blowout sale, but for a recent opening at T.J. Maxx, a scene repeated at the Price Club, two of the many off-price companies changing the face of retail shopping on Long Island.
The concept of off-price shopping -- selling brand names at 20 to 60 percent less than department and specialty stores -- is taking the Island by storm, as evidenced by the crowds spilling out of stores like Syms, Marshalls, the Home Depot and T.J. Maxx; membership clubs like B. J.'s and the Price Club, and the Island's first outlet mall, which opened this year in Bellport.
Off-price shopping is the only activity keeping the Island's economy alive, said the Suffolk County Planning Director, Arthur Kunz.
With a poor economy and consumers' reluctance to spend, Mr. Kunz said, the time is right for off-price stores.
By off-price, Mr. Kunz was including a growing number of value-oriented membership clubs, warehouse-style stores that sell in large quantities at discount prices.
Price Clubs have been doing very well in high-income areas and draw from middle-class as well as affluent neighborhoods, a spokeswoman for the company, Debbie Greenhill, said. The opening of a Price Club in Westbury last month drew such large crowds that extra police officers were hired to direct traffic.
In the last six months a majority of construction applications on the Island have been for off-price retailers.
The sole applications for traditional retail stores, Mr. Kunz said, have been for an A.&S. store that opened last month at Roosevelt Field, replacing an Alexander's department store, and for a Bloomingdale's in the Walt Whitman Mall, which has experienced delays by the Town of Huntington.
Four construction proposals are pending in Suffolk for warehouse-type stores. In Westbury, on the site of the former Roosevelt Raceway, plans are being made for a 32-acre shopping plaza to include two membership clubs new to Long Island, Sam's Warehouse and Costco.
Shopping trends seem to move in cycles, Mr. Kunz said. In the 50's and 60's discount stores like Korvettes and the Times Square Stores succeeded by catering to young families on the Island, he said. But that disappeared in the 70's and 80's, when consumers looked for better quality and turned to department stores and boutiques.
"The 90's marks the next phase in shopping trends," he added. "With harder economic times, the public wants better goods at off prices. Shopping patterns are changing, and there is more appreciation for discount. This is a trend that's here to stay."
One of the first off-price retailers on the Island was Syms, which opened alongside the Long Island Expressway in 1974. Syms used the phrase "off price" in an advertising campaign, a spokesman for the company, David Bernard, said.
"Shopping off price became so popular that we outgrew our first store in Roslyn and two years ago moved to a much larger space in Westbury," Mr. Bernard said. "The trick is to sell brand names, so the customer can compare. He can see that the regular retail price of the same item at Syms would be 40 to 60 percent higher elsewhere."
After Syms, the first Marshalls opened, in Stony Brook in 1978. There are now 17 Marshalls clothing stores on the Island. The newest opened in Melville in August 1991. A spokeswoman for the company, Hannah Hosom, said Marshalls was successful because consumers had become more educated and looked for good quality at a value.
 
Fewer Family Run Businesses
 Despite the sales-tax revenues generated by the successes of off-price retailers, the Island's economy has felt losses as well as gains, Mr. Kunz said.
"Basically it's a wash," he explained. "While these stores are doing very well, we're losing other retail establishments that can't compete in these kinds of markets. Home Depot has driven out a number of other businesses. Blockbuster Video has put smaller video stores out of business. Ikea has done the same to smaller furniture stores. With the shift to high-volume low-priced shopping, small family run operations will be far less a part of our future."
For downtown shopping, that will mean a growing emphasis on service, Mr. Kunz said, adding: "Changing shopping trends won't put downtowns out of business. Shoppers will still need local drugstores, dry cleaning, restaurants and beauty parlors. The local hardware store will still be important for service, but for bigger purchases the homeowner would be more likely to go to Home Depot."
The economic outlook for the small retailer, said Steve Greenberg, president of the Greenberg Group in Hewlett, is more favorable. The group is a real-estate adviser company to national retailers. Mr. Greenberg said that although it was more difficult for the smaller retailer to compete, there was still room for the small specialty store.
"We're seeing a segmentation in retail," he said. "There are the big-box large retailers, and there are the niche specialists, who will compete by being aggressive and being very good at one little thing. There's not a lot left in the middle. A downtown hardware store may not carry the volume or offer the prices of a Home Depot, but if it can become a specialist in one thing, paint, for example, it has an edge. A small 3,000-square-foot bookstore would have trouble competing with one of 30,000 square feet. But if the small bookstore owner knows his customers by name, as well as their preferences in books, he, too, can compete in today's market."
 
Jaguars and Mercedes at Price Club
 Mr. Greenberg added that although there was still a market for boutiques, a majority of consumers wanted two features, convenience and good prices. "They want to be able to pull up to one store and do all their shopping," he said. "Even the most affluent shoppers are finding it chic to be price sensitive and shop off price, as evidenced by the Jaguars and Mercedes in the parking lots of Price Clubs and other off-price stores."
The membership clubs include a B. J.'s in East Farmingdale and the Price Clubs, in Smithtown, Copiague and Westbury. To shop in a Price Club, customers have to be willing to shop in an unglamorous warehouse environment, Ms. Greenhill said, adding that customers were looking more for value than for status.
T.J. Maxx, a newer off-price addition to the Island, has opened nine stores in the last year. The first two, in Islandia and Oceanside, opened in the fall of 1991, followed by five on the same day last May. The two newest, in Selden and Carle Place, opened two weeks ago.
"The buzzwords for the 90's are off-price, bargains and value," a spokeswoman for the company, Sandy Keating, said. "For T.J. Maxx, coming later to the Island was an advantage, because consumers had a few years to get used to the off-price concept, to understand that they don't have to go to department stores and pay their prices to get value and quality, and to get ready for us.
"There's nothing hidden. Designer labels are not cut out. Consumers can see that the merchandise is the same that would be found in department and specialty stores."
 
Private and Brand Labels
 The difference between off-price and discount stores, Ms. Keating said, is in the relative value of the merchandise that each type of store carries. "For example," she said, "a private-label blouse selling at a discount store for $12.99 was manufactured to sell at that price. At T.J. Maxx a brand-name or designer blouse selling for $12.99 was manufactured to sell at about $24."
Off-price retailers buy in large volume, often obtaining better prices by buying at the end of one season and selling the merchandise the next and building less glamorous stores with lower overhead, Ms. Keating said.
Other successful retailers also known for their wide selections and good values are chains like the Gap, the Limited and the Pottery Barn, which are usually in shopping malls. Their success has been enhanced by the demise of many department stores, once the foundation of retailing.
As trends are changing for shoppers, the customer base is changing for vendors. Harmon Stein, president of Excel Cutlery of Garden City, an importer of fine tabletop merchandise, said that over the last few years the number of department stores had dropped 30 to 40 percent and that many of those that had not closed had merged. Vendors who formerly sold primarily to department stores are increasingly selling to off-price retailers and membership clubs, he said, which increases the quality of the merchandise in those outlets.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Energy Policy;
CLINTON TO REVAMP ENERGY DEPT. ROLE

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton is prepared to give the Department of Energy a dominant role in his efforts to marry the goals of creating jobs, making industry more efficient and reducing environmental damage, transition advisers say.
Those working on the plans say they reflect Mr. Clinton's desire to transform a bureaucracy largely ignored for most of the Reagan-Bush years into an aggressive player in integrating environmental goals into economic policy. 
 The blueprint being put together by industry executives as well as staff members close to Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore conforms with the promises Mr. Clinton made during the campaign. He said he wanted to wean the nation from its reliance on coal and oil by converting to cleaner, less costly alternatives like natural gas, using tax incentives and research money to encourage development of renewable resources and expanding the American role in the global market for pollution control equipment and services.
The longer-term goal is to revitalize industry and make the United States more competitive with Japanese and German manufacturers, whose energy efficiency gives them far lower production costs.
Staff members close to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore said that to signal the new direction they had identified several actions the President-elect could take immediately by executive order or policy change. Among the proposed actions are these:
*Converting hundreds of thousands of Federal vehicles to compressed natural gas, which burns more cleanly than gasoline and is less expensive. President Bush issued such an order, but it covers only a fraction of the vehicles in the fleets operated by the Postal Service, the military and other Federal agencies.
*Accelerating a long-delayed program requiring more efficient energy use in buildings and appliances. Besides encouraging the development of new technology, this would save money as well as fuel, especially for the Federal Government, the advisers say. They added that it would showcase new techniques and provide a market for them.
*Shifting the Government's research priorities to conservation technologies and renewable resources like wind, sun and water. The department's research program now favors development of nuclear energy and coal.
* Making available to private industry the new technologies the department is developing in its $5.5-billion-a-year program to clean up the environmental damage from nuclear weapons plants across the country.
The planning underscores the potential influence of Mr. Gore, one of whose main interests is the environment, as a guiding force behind the new approach. One important figure on the environment-economy transition team is Kathleen McGinty, a 29-year-old lawyer from Philadelphia who became Mr. Gore's chief environmental specialist when she joined his Senate staff in 1989.
"There is no question that Governor Clinton is prepared to make the Department of Energy an integral component of our long-term economic strategy," said George Stephanopoulos, the director of communications for the transition. "He has not made any final decision on personnel or specific policies. These are options prepared by his staff, and he is reviewing them."
The advisers on the transition team said Senator Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado, the chairman of the Senate Energy subcommittee on conservation, who did not seek re-election, and Thomas F. McLarty 3d, chairman and chief executive of Arkla Inc., a natural gas utility in Little Rock and one of four board members of Mr. Clinton's transition, head the short list of candidates under consideration by Mr. Clinton for Energy Secretary. Mr. Wirth is also under consideration to be as Secretary of the Interior, the advisers said.
Both agencies have been lumped together with several others in the transition planning in an effort to integrate the economic, environmental and natural-resource issues they encompass. Others in the group are the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce.
Mr. McLarty went to kindergarten with the President-elect in Hope, Ark., and has been a close friend ever since. He is well regarded in the industry, and Mr. Clinton touted him as a possible energy secretary during campaign swings through Texas when he discussed energy policy with oil and gas industry executives. Mr. McLarty did not respond to messages left with the transition staff and his company.
Mr. Wirth is also well versed on the considerable environmental problems that plague the Energy Department's nuclear weapons industry, which includes the Rocky Flats plutonium plant near Denver. Mr. Wirth was in Europe last week on vacation and could not be reached. Friends in Congress and in Colorado said he was reluctant to talk about his plans but might be interested in becoming Energy Secretary given Mr. Clinton's desire to make the Energy Department central to his economic and environmental policy.
"From Day 1, you'll see an Energy Department moving very aggressively, and the reason is that a new direction makes sense for jobs, for the economy, for our balance of trade and for a cleaner environment," said Bill Burton, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., who coordinated the Clinton-Gore campaign's strategy on energy issues. "An energy policy based on cheap foreign oil is shameful, and it will change."
Mr. Clinton himself signaled the change in a news conference 10 days ago. "I have read, at least in my history books, that some Cabinet appointments are considered major and others are considered minor," he said. "I don't know how you would consider the Departments of Commerce and Energy in that regard, but from the kind of economic policy I have laid out, and the things that I think we have to do to change this country economically, those are very major appointments."
Among other candidates on the list for Energy Secretary, the advisers said, are Gov. David Walters of Oklahoma, a national co-chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign; Garry Mauro, the Texas Land Commissioner and chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign in Texas; Michael L. Beatty, executive vice president and general counsel of the Coastal Corporation in Houston who was an important fund-raiser for Mr. Clinton, and Daniel H. Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Massachusetts and a research associate at Harvard University who won a Pulitzer Prize this year for his history of the oil industry, titled "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power."
The Department of Energy was established in 1977 to help solve the problem of America's dependence on imported oil, but it has been a largely forgotten bureaucracy.
In the late 1980's, for reasons that neither President Reagan nor President Bush anticipated, the department became the focus of attention for its mismanagement of the Government's nuclear production plants, laboratories and testing grounds. The end of cold war has produced new opportunities for reordering the department's mission while at the same time advancing Mr. Clinton's agenda for jobs, new technologies, and environmental protection.
Ms. McGinty is helping to select teams to interview officials in the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior and the other domestic environmental agencies beginning early next month. That research is intended to help the incoming Cabinet members and their deputies understand which policy decisions made by the Bush and Reagan Administrations should be kept or rejected.
Requiring Federal vehicles to convert to natural gas is one of an array of measures that Mr. Clinton is preparing as an attempt to strengthen energy production and exploration in this country. The American industry lost 500,000 jobs during the 1980's, more than the auto and steel industries combined, the Department of Commerce has reported.
Industry executives said roughly 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, all of it domestically produced, is used each year in the United States, and each increase of a trillion cubic feet in production could result in 50,000 to 70,000 additional jobs. It is not known how many jobs might be lost in the coal and oil refining industries, which would suffer declines in sales as use of natural gas increased.
The acceleration of the long-delayed program to raise the energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances would both conserve fuel and save money, especially for the Federal Government, which spends $4 billion annually to heat and cool its buildings, said James Wolf, executive director of the Alliance to Save Energy, a research group in Washington.
"The highest priority for new technology is to develop a market," said Mr. Wolf, who helped to write a blueprint for energy policy that was requested by Mr. Clinton's energy advisers. "The new Administration has the opportunity to make Government buildings showcases for new energy technology."
Mr. Clinton's advisers also said the President-elect wanted an aggressive Energy Secretary who would use the office to change energy research priorities. Of the $3 billion that the Department plans to spend this fiscal year on civilian research and development programs, $1.3 billion is set aside for the development of coal and nuclear energy. Just $212 million is devoted to inventing new machines to take advantage of wind, sun, water, and other renewable energy sources, while $310 million is to be spent of energy conservation measures.
"A different philosophy will be exercised in the Clinton Administration," said Christopher Flavin, vice president for research at the Worldwatch Institute in Washington. "It will look more like the European industrial strategy where governments work with different industries and accelerate the commercialization of technologies."
The department's research budget, particularly the program for developing new methods of restoring land contaminated by toxic materials, is spurring the American industrial sector for new pollution control equipment and services. Michael Silverstein, an environmental economist from Philadelphia, said the American share of the $50 billion international market for such equipment and services is $6 billion a year and growing.
"The salient point, one that is just as important as the technology, is how much political capital Clinton and Gore are willing to invest to make America one of the dominant players in the international environmental cleanup market," Mr. Silverstein said.

HEADLINE: As H.I.V. Patients Stay at Work, Problems, and Solutions, Emerge

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Jason Worth, a Housing Court judge in Brooklyn who is infected with H.I.V., comes to work only one day a week because of fatigue and because he wants to avoid the risk of exposure to diseases like tuberculosis from the dozens of people who come through his courtroom every day.
But the 42-year-old judge recently asked state court officials to allow him to use a telephone equipped with a television screen so he could handle settlement conferences from home. Working, he says, is as crucial to staying alive as any precaution he can take to protect his health. 
 "I believe that in order to survive one has to have goals," he said. "My goal is to be a judge with my medical condition."
As more people live longer and stay healthier because of advances in the treatment of the AIDS virus, many, like Judge Worth, are trying to hold on to jobs. Some work despite symptoms of illness because they have no choice -- they need the income or the health-insurance benefits. But many others work as long as they can for the vitality, camaraderie and sense of self-worth a job can provide.
What these workers are finding in the work place varies greatly. Some companies have issued policies stating that AIDS will be treated like any other life-threatening disease and have accommodated employees with H.I.V. with flexible work schedules and other measures. At other companies, the response is to dismiss the worker, although most states have laws prohibiting dismissing employees simply because they have AIDS.
 
Illness Often Hidden
 As a result, many people with H.I.V. believe they must hide their infection if they want to work. Many worry about being discriminated against or written off and losing, if not their jobs, at least promotions. Many do not disclose their condition until they really must, such as when they have to explain frequent absences.
Some show up for work even while sick. Others do not file claims for H.I.V.-related treatments to hide their condition from employees or out of fear of being dropped from health plans.
"I don't want to feel ostracized on the job," said a 49-year-old clothing salesman in Manhattan who has kept his status secret for four years.
He tells fellow employees he is taking vitamins when he takes AIDS medication, and he uses his lunch hour for doctor's appointments.
"I don't want to be deprived of duties or responsibilities until the time I have to relinquish them," he said.
AIDS is a personal issue shrouded in secrecy even for some advocates for people with H.I.V. Thomas B. Stoddard, 44, former executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a public-interest law firm that handles H.I.V.-related litigation, said he revealed his H.I.V. status to only three close assistants. He kept his staff in the dark even when he decided to leave last January because he found his job too draining.
"I didn't want to be a victim," he said. "I would have been treated differently."
For their part, employers who encounter a worker with H.I.V. for the first time usually grapple with questions like: Will customers be driven away? Will insurance rates go up? Will the worker's productivity suffer? How will others in the work place react? Can the privacy of the worker be maintained?
There may also be technical questions. In Judge Worth's case, for instance, court officials are now weighing whether the telephone arrangement he is proposing would satisfy the legal rights of litigants to be physically present before the court.
On a more personal level, AIDS can redefine working relationships in painful ways. Gary E. Banas, director for administration for the northeastern district of the Federal Comptroller of the Currency in New York City, said he was torn between compassion and professional duty when he dealt with two subordinates in the advanced stages of the disease.
Mr. Banas reassigned both workers to lesser duties when their performances declined. One of the workers objected. Mr. Banas said the man, who has since died, was a supervisor and staff morale had sunk as co-workers needed to cover for him.
But realizing that he had to put the agency first was not an easy choice, Mr. Banas said.
"I had a lot of sleepless nights over it," said the 44-year-old manager. "I was able to deal with it because I recognized that I had other employees I was responsible for."
 
Conditions Are Changing
 Business groups say that most private or public employers have not prepared for the fears, risks and disruptions AIDS can cause, but that is changing. One reason is a new Federal law to be phased in through 1994, the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against disabled workers, including people disabled by AIDS, and will require employers with more than 15 workers to make "reasonable accommodations" for them.
Another reason is that AIDS mostly affects the working-age population: 76 percent of the 242,146 AIDS cases reported as of last September in the United States were in the 25-to-44 age group.
Fear of transmission is still a worry for co-workers even this far into the AIDS epidemic, employers say. In settings where most Americans work, like offices, some reactions indicate a lack of basic knowledge about how infection with the virus occurs.
"Can I catch AIDS from the telephone? Can I catch it from the bathroom?" said Celia Ussak, director of personnel for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. "They still ask those questions."
Next year, Ms. Ussak said, Metro-North plans to start a companywide AIDS-education program. Other companies have offered or required similar training for employees, business groups say.
 
Employers Respond
 In addition, many employers have already responded to the needs and impairments of infected workers.
A marketing-project manager with Pacific Bell in San Francisco said he revealed his H.I.V. infection to his company four years ago when fatigue and other symptoms forced him to take time off for hospitalizations. He said the company offered not only flexible hours -- he works at home one day a week -- but support groups where he could meet with other H.I.V.-positive employees.
The 43-year-old manager said that several times over the years he has had to explain to a new boss that he has H.I.V.
Two bosses cried, he said. But in recent years, he said, the exchanges have acquired the semblance of normalcy.
"They're used to it," he said. "There are a lot of employees with the condition."
Judging from complaints to civil-rights watchdogs and AIDS organizations, however, workers with H.I.V. sometimes are simply dismissed. In New York State, allegations of employment-related discrimination accounted for 90 of 161 complaints filed by people with H.I.V. with New York City's Human Rights Commission and the State Division of Human Rights last year.
One man appealed to the state agency last November when a supermarket in Rockland County laid him off from his job as a baker. A few months earlier, he said, he had confided to a co-worker that he had tested positive for H.I.V.
He said he did not suspect discrimination until another co-worker asked him one day if it was true he had AIDS.
"It clicked," the 34-year-old man, who has no symptoms of illness, said. "I knew right then that everybody knew."
He settled the case for $7,500 and now works as a cook for a food-service company that knows about his infection, he said.
 
Benefits Costs Cited
 But civil-rights groups say that, increasingly, employment-related discrimination against people with H.I.V. is based not on fear but on cost. Business leaders say some companies have faced higher health-insurance premiums or have had policies canceled because of H.I.V.-related claims by their employees.
Mark Scherzer, a health-benefits consultant in New York City, said he knew of at least five recent instances in New York and New Jersey in which self-insured union health plans have capped benefits for people with H.I.V. at $5,000, $25,000 or, in one case, $100,000. In a similar case in Texas, a self-insured plan capped an employee's benefits after he began filing claims for treatment of AIDS-related conditions. The United States Supreme Court refused this month to hear an appeal of lower court decisions upholding the cap.
Such efforts often stem from a perception that AIDS is more expensive than other types of major illnesses, but health economists say there is no evidence that this is the case.
New treatments and improved survival have undoubtedly raised costs, experts say. Officials from Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest private payer of AIDS claims in the country, say the average lifetime cost of a person with H.I.V. has risen to about $200,000 today from $60,000 in 1986.
But at the same time, others note, preventive drugs have cut down on hospitalizations.
"Some of our employees on these drugs are doing better than some people who have cancer or severe heart conditions," said Carl Pope, benefits director for Time Inc., which has about 6,000 employees.
Whether to work or to devote time to other endeavors is an overriding question for people with H.I.V., according to psychotherapists and other professionals who work with this population. Many, they say, ponder questions like whether job pressures could be harmful to their health or whether they could set realistic career goals.
 
Special Problems for Women
 The burden is often heavier for women, many of whom are less well paid than men and have children they must support.
"You stress yourself more out," said a 35-year-old sales clerk from the Bronx who is the mother of a 13-year-old boy. "You have to worry about a baby sitter. If my skin breaks out, I can't say some things around him. I have to be careful I don't make him nervous about my condition."
Women are also more likely to keep their infection secret because they feel they would be judged more harshly than men, counselors say.
But for many people with AIDS, work can also become a means to prove that they can still lead productive lives. It also offers solace, and an escape.
"I don't think I could stay home and just worry about the virus," the sales clerk said.

HEADLINE: Haitians See a Renewal of Hope With Clinton

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PETIT-GOAVE, Haiti, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Although President-elect Bill Clinton has carefully qualified his campaign promises of more generous treatment of Haitian refugees, warning that he is not throwing the doors open to mass immigration, his victory has been greeted here with such enthusiasm that many Haitians are preparing renewed attempts to reach the United States.
In conversations with dozens of people along the Caribbean coastline, Haitians spoke with giddy conviction that Mr. Clinton's Administration would either quickly restore democracy and set things right in their poor and broken country, or welcome them with open arms when they set out in small boats to reach American shores. 
 In bays and coves along the coast, boat builders, anticipating a heavy demand, are readying the wooden hulls that some freely admit are being built to carry Haitians away from their country.
"Nov. 3 and Jan. 20," said Luc Salomon, an unemployed 34-year-old father of four, reciting like many others the dates of Mr. Clinton's victory and inauguration. "As far as I am concerned, after the good Lord comes Bill Clinton, and as soon as Bill Clinton is sworn in, you'll see me go."
Others in a crowd that had gathered in the shade of a small seaside house said they would wait, briefly, to see if Mr. Clinton restored their elected president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was violently overthrown by soldiers 14 months ago. But failing that, nearly all of them, including a handful who had already been twice returned by Coast Guard cutters, said they would try to flee.
"It's both repression and poverty that makes us want to leave," said Fleury Prophete, a 22-year-old who, like most in this slumbering port town, has been left idle by an economy that scarcely functioned even before a hemisphere-wide embargo was imposed on Haiti soon after the coup.
"If there's no work in this country, I have to get out," said Mr. Prophete. "Since the morning I haven't eaten. Look at the waste we have to wade through every day. We don't have a government that cares about us. All they know how to do is beat and torture people."
In the last year, nearly 40,000 Haitians have scraped together their life savings, often selling their land or homes, to secure passage aboard the rickety boats setting out for the United States. After months behind barbed-wire fences in a sweltering tent city at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, or quick interceptions by the Coast Guard, more than 70 percent have been returned to Haiti. The other 30 percent have been admitted to the United States while their asylum applications are reviewed.
Last May, after the Pentagon warned that Guantanamo had been stretched beyond capacity, President Bush authorized the summary repatriation of Haitians without an asylum hearing. Advocates for the refugees say such hearings are guaranteed by national and international laws that were intended to distinguish between those fleeing political repression, who have a right to asylum, and economic refugees, who have no such right.
Although the legality of Mr. Bush's order is being challenged before the Supreme Court, its effectiveness in stopping the refugee wave is uncontested. Since May, the number of boat people setting out to sea has gone from a rush to a trickle.
 
A Warning From Clinton
 During the Presidential campaign and since, Mr. Clinton has expressed disapproval of the Bush Administration's policy. But after aerial surveillance by the Coast Guard found hundreds of boats being readied on Haitian shores after his election, Mr. Clinton warned, "It would be unwise for anybody to think that I am going to articulate a policy that would promote mass migration."
In a news conference in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Clinton promised to spell out that policy clearly before his inauguration, saying, "This is about giving Haitians a chance to make a case that they should be granted asylum in this country temporarily until we see a democratically elected government restored to Haiti."
Although hundreds, perhaps thousands of Haitians have been killed since the September 1991 coup against Father Aristide, diplomats say that most Haitians cannot demonstrate the reasonable fear of being singled out for attack that is required to qualify for political asylum under American law. But Haiti's poverty, its proximity to the United States and the presence there of large numbers of Haitians make the hemisphere's richest country a powerful magnet for the people of the poorest.
 
Seeking Regional Help
 After expressions of alarm in Florida over the prospect of a renewed wave of Haitians, which State Department officials said could easily number in the tens of thousands, aides to Mr. Clinton have said that refugees would probably not be screened in the United States. Instead, they said, Washington would seek to persuade another country to harbor the refugees during their screening.
Failing that, Mr. Clinton's aides said, screening of refugees would take place aboard United States ships or at Guantanamo.
United States diplomats noted that repeated attempts by the Bush Administration failed to persuade any other country to receive large numbers of Haitians. Diplomats also said that the Guantanamo base's capacity is 12,500 refugees, and they add that the base would be unable to handle a much larges number. Naval vessels, they said, are unsuitable for harboring refugees for more than brief periods.
Because of constraints like these, many have concluded that Mr. Clinton's best option would be to increase pressure on Haiti's military leadership to accept Father Aristide's return to office.
 
The Logic for Aristide
 "There is a sort of inexorable logic here that unless you return Aristide, there will never be civil liberties in the country, meaning many of those who try to reach the United States will continue to have a plausible argument that they are political refugees," said Robert White, a former United States diplomat. He visited Haiti this week with a group of Democratic Party figures led by Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York City. "If Aristide comes back, however, the United States could say that all of these people are economic refugees."
Advocates for the refugees also say that Mr. Clinton should concentrate on settling Haiti's political crisis while urging the United Nations and other countries to play a larger role in handling the refugees.
"There are a number of things the United States still hasn't tried yet," said William G. O'Neill, deputy director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, "from freezing the assets of individuals already identified as supporters of the coup, and urging places like France and Canada to do likewise, to unilaterally revoking the visas of these people. These are things which could be done right away, which would send a very different signal about the resolve of the United States to restore democracy, and would give some hope again to Haitians that we are serious about change."

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Although Trade Is Trickier, 'More Is Better' Is Still True

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
The end of the trade spat with Europe, if France can be persuaded to go along, is certainly good news for Americans who prefer to drink real Chablis with their oysters or who export soybeans. But in an era in which everything from cars to cheese already seems to come from another country, does the apparent breakthrough in negotiations on a grand world trade deal really matter?
The answer, say most, if not quite all, economists, is a resounding yes. International trade has been a great engine of prosperity for the last century and shows every promise of remaining one in the next. And while the gains from trade have become far trickier to analyze than the old textbooks make them out to be, the basic logic -- more is better -- has not changed. 
 In fact, say the experts, the likely alternative to moving forward is regressing to a world in which politicians rather than markets have the last word on what people buy and sell.
 
Losers, as Well as Winners
 The gospel according to Econ 101 says free trade makes each party to a transaction better off because it allows each to specialize in what it does best. All the bananas Americans eat could probably be grown in Florida, but it is only common sense -- and cheaper -- to buy them from Costa Rica, and let the Costa Ricans spend the revenues on imported computers.
What the gospel sometimes brushes by is that trade creates losers as well as winners. If some hapless farmer actually planted a banana plantation in Florida he would not look forward to competing with fruit that practically jumps off the trees in Central America.
Generally, trade hurts those who must compete against resources, human and physical, that are relatively abundant abroad. For the United States, that largely means unskilled workers in manufacturing. Thus, while the overall gains from opening ports to all those cheap clothes and shoes and electronics from abroad have been enormous, apparel workers in Manhattan are less enthusiastic than, say, aeronautical engineers at the Boeing factory in Seattle.
For the first few decades after World War II, America dominated world trade policy and its exporters had the biggest say in what the country demanded from its trade partners. Hence the organization created to negotiate trade rules, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was used as a tool to open markets in the industrialized countries and keep them open. Tariffs, which historically served to protect home markets, are no longer a major impediment to trade in most manufactured goods.
But since the early 1970's the economics of trade have been changing, and the geopolitics have followed. It is no longer clear which country or even which companies have a natural edge in producing which goods. Intangible factors like technological savvy and organizational skills seem to matter more than where the cheapest labor or materials are. So, too, do "non-tariff barriers," -- rules as subtle as health regulations and red tape at the dock -- that are often written by governments with an eye to favoring the home team.
This has weakened the old coalitions of exporters in the industrialized countries, who stood as one against protectionist interests. Economists have also muddied the waters by theorizing that countries might be better off protecting some home markets, like those needed to give local manufacturers a foothold in new products.
And while these theories are too clever by half -- the most prominent new theorist, Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, acknowledges that, as a practical matter, protection hardly ever pays -- the theoretical challenge to the old orthodoxy has bolstered the case of interest groups fighting to protect their turf.
That dismays most economists, even many who agree that the simple, century-old concept of gains through international specialization is no longer much consequence. Trade, they argue, is more important than ever.
 
Non-Tariff Barriers a Target
 First, it sustains competition that forces innovation: Hardly anyone, after all, believes that Chrysler and Ford would be producing excellent cars today if Toyota and Honda were not breathing down their necks.
Second, it speeds the diffusion of technology. With the potential for technological breakthroughs anywhere from Finland to Israel to South Korea, open global markets are more than ever the ticket to rapid progress.
It was in this context that the latest GATT negotiations, began in 1986 in Uruguay. The basic idea was to clean up old business, notably trade in agriculture, and get on with the job of writing ironclad rules for new business before protectionist coalitions grew too powerful to be stopped.
One urgent target was all those pesky non-tariff barriers, particularly those that affected trade in services like banking, insurance and construction. Another was protection of intellectual property, everything from patents on new drugs to copyrights on rock music.
In the late 1980's there was widespread optimism that a deal would soon be struck. The industrialized countries would get access to markets for services and legal protection on patents and copyrights, granting in return a phase-out of restrictions on trade in agriculture and apparel.
But the talks bogged down badly on what may be the least important issue on the agenda: grain. The European Community now protects its woefully inefficient farmers at the expense of Americans, Australians and Argentines, not to mention its own consumers and taxpayers. But efforts to phase out the protection as part of the Uruguay Round of negotiations have been complicated by the internal politics of the Community. With the grand issue of European currency integration teetering in the balance, Community leaders were reluctant to shove a grain deal down the throats of French farmers, who are both noisy and politically active.
Under the compromise announced Friday, the United States will settle for far less than the rapid demise of agricultural subsidies that it hoped to get. And other issues could still keep negotiators very busy for a while longer. As Jeffrey Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington puts it, European farm subsidies were "the glue, not the guts, of a much bigger package."
 
Deal Within Months
 Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist and senior adviser to the GATT staff, predicts a broad world trade deal within months. And while it will not come anywhere near meeting the ambitious goals set in the mid-1980's, Mr. Bhagwati thinks it will make a big difference.
Perhaps most important, a world deal will sustain the momentum toward free trade that has clearly been slowing for two decades. Every country will presumably get something from the agreement. And Mr. Bhagwati's expectation is that it will thus give every country a stronger incentive to follow the letter and spirit of GATT rules that it doesn't like.

HEADLINE: Fujimori Winning Both Peruvian Votes, Counts Show

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 22

 BODY:
A survey of voters leaving polling places today showed strong backing for President Alberto K. Fujimori's candidates for a Congress that will rewrite the Peruvian Constitution.
Early and unofficial vote tallies also indicated that Mr. Fujimori had won a legislative majority. 
 The voting, seven months after Mr. Fujimori seized near-dictatorial powers by disbanding Congress and the courts and suspending the Constitution, apparently consolidated his control over government. He had said that he would interpret a victory today as a ringing endorsement of the steps he took on April 5.
Analysts said that despite the refusal by several large parties to take part in what they called illegal elections, a victory would give the administration a new measure of legitimacy with foreign governments, which have been highly critical of Mr. Fujimori's seizure of power.
 
Full Tally to Come
 Official results are expected on Monday.
"I voted for the Chinese," said Pedro Rosales, a retiree in Lima, using a nickname that supporters give Mr. Fujimori, whose parents were, in fact, Japanese. "He's the only politician who has done anything in this country for years. The others just promise to get rid of corruption and terrorism, but do nothing."
Guerrilla organizations had threatened to disrupt the elections. But Peruvians turned out in large numbers, and guerrilla violence was minor.
Around Lima, rebels set off several small bombs and threw sticks of dynamite near polling stations. Two people reportedly suffered minor injuries. No deaths were reported.
 
Polls Well Guarded
 The army and national police posted 100,000 troops around the country to guard polling stations. During the day, 250 observers from the Organization of American States were at voting centers around the country, trying to detect fraud or other irregularities.
According to an unofficial vote tally tonight by the Apoyo group, the coalition slate made up of two pro-Fujimori parties had won 38.3 percent of all ballots, which it said would give them 44 of the 80 seats in Congress. But two smaller polling organizations had said earlier that Mr. Fujimori narrowly failed to win a majority of seats.
Of the 17 other parties running, the closest, according to the Apoyo count, was the Popular Christian Party, with 8 percent. Apoyo found that 22.7 percent of voters left their ballots blank or voided them.
In Villa el Salvador, one of the largest shantytowns and a place where the far-leftist Shining Path rebels have a strong presence, thousands of residents walked the sandy streets to a voting station in a rundown school. Many of those willing to express an opinion said they had supported Mr. Fujimori.
In the fashionable sector of La Molina, the setting was different. Mercedes-Benzes, Volvos and Nissan sports cars were parked outside the immaculately clean Newton School. Sentiment there, too, was in Mr. Fujimori's favor.
"My husband and son voted for Fujimori," said Pilar Portero. "But I didn't. Still, the thinking here is that we need a strong hand."
Voting is mandatory. Failure to vote can lead to a $17 fine, a large sum for a worker who earns the minimum wage of $45 a month.
 
Economic Thicket
 For Peru, organizing an election in which 11 million were expected to vote was a logistical nightmare. Many polling places opened late. At the National Stadium in downtown Lima, many voting tables had not been set up by 1:30 P.M., even though the polls officially opened at 8 A.M.
And while Mr. Fujimori can say he won a mandate, there were some who doubted that he could live up to his promises to improve their bleak economic state.
In Villa el Salvador, a group of women complained that they could not feed their children and that a Government program to provide food and milk had been shut down.
And Alejandro Medrano, a 32-year-old painter, who said he had invalidated his ballot in protest, declared: "This Congress is a fraud of Fujimori. As long as we don't have a redistribution of wealth, this Congress will not be able to solve any of our problems of poverty, unemployment and hunger."

HEADLINE: Refugee Burden Is Impoverishing Croatian Hosts

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Faced with enormous economic problems and an influx of Bosnian refugees, people from across this former Yugoslav republic are looking with resentment and bewilderment on a world they see as too slow to send help and too quick to slam its doors shut.
"The kindest thing you can say is that this is hypocritical," said Croatia's Vice President, Mate Granic. 
 The republic's 4.5 million or so people are now host to 627,000 registered displaced persons, including 333,000 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of them Muslims, according to United Nations statistics. The Zagreb Government estimates that more than 100,000 unregistered Bosnian refugees also live in Croatia.
 
Appeal to Take Even More
 This month and last, international relief agencies urged Croatia to open its borders to thousands of new refugees driven from Sarajevo and and from Bosnian towns. At the same time, Britain refused entry visas to 180 Bosnian refugees for whom a private British charity had already arranged housing with families.
About 1,500 Bosnian men released from Serbian prisons and camps also remain in a squalid, "temporary" shelter in the Croatian town of Karlovac because Western Governments are reluctant to accept them. Thousands more prisoners and internees are stuck in the Serbian camps.
"It is as if 40 million Mexicans picked up and fled to the United States," said Michael Keats, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb.
But despite the refugees' problems, Croatians say they face adversity themselves. "I am sorry for these people, but they are a burden," said a 70-year-old Croatian housewife from Zagreb, whose $23 monthly pension and welfare check does not cover her food costs, much less housing and utilities. "We are ourselves in great difficulty."
 
Severely Shrinking Economy
 Unable to make ends meet, many of Croatia's people, who include Croats and Serbs as well as ethnic Hungarians, Albanians and Italians, have simply stopped paying their rent and electrical bills.
Croatia's total economy has slipped from about $13.5 billion in 1990 to $7.5 billion this year, Mr. Granic said. He estimated that the cost of maintaining the displaced persons and refugees exceeds $50 million a month.
Croatia finds 25 percent of its territory, including critical road and rail links, controlled by rebel Serbs and 37 percent of its production facilities either in Serbian-occupied lands or in ruins. Some here complain that the war with Serbia last year and the flood of Bosnian refugees this year have damaged this country more than United Nations economic sanctions have damaged Serbia and Montenegro, the truncated Yugoslav federation.
"My God, this is devilish," said a man who gave his name only as Matija, a 78-year-old retired postal worker.
"When Tito was alive we weren't given the freedom to talk," he said, referring to postwar Yugoslavia's longtime leader. "But at least people had something to eat. To hell with this kind of freedom."
 
Idle Hands, Devil's Playthings
 In Zagreb, hard-pressed pensioners line up at night to buy cheap black bread before prices go up. Growing numbers of prostitutes haunt dark side streets. And idle young men and women, who have little prospect of finding employment anytime soon, linger for hours in cafes, nursing espressos.
"I am psychologically lost," said Tomislav Provic, an electrician who fled from the city of Vukovar when it fell to the Serbs a year ago and now lives in a Zagreb hotel. "We cannot get permanent jobs because we lack residency cards, and we can't even apply for residency cards."
In addition to the 633,000 displaced persons and refugees, Croatia's Government must support 267,000 jobless, 120,000 police and military personnel, 800,000 pensioners and 150,000 others on some kind of welfare, according to Government statistics.
So far the Government has paid its bills only by printing unbacked currency. Consequently, the monthly inflation rate has increased from 15 percent in July to 40 percent in November, Government statistics and estimates say.
"We are just below the designated level of hyperinflation," said Ante - Cicin-Sajn, a financial expert. "That's when money becomes practically unusable."
"It is incredible that Croatia has held out so long without social unrest," Mr. Cicin-Sajn said, adding that despite the hardship the country has maintained payments on its $3.5 billion hard-currency foreign debt.
Croatia estimates that it has received $1.5 billion in aid, including assistance from Croatian emigres, international organizations and foreign governments since the war began here in July 1991.
"This has helped us maintain stability," Vice President Granic said.
"But Croatia needs help now to deal with the refugees and displaced persons," he said, estimating that the Government requires about $50 million just to house the refugees.
The Government, he said, may soon be unable to pay to keep the refugees in hotels and private homes. In any event, it desperately needs to free up the hotel rooms they occupy, especially along the Adriatic coast, to have a chance of earning desperately needed hard currency from the 1993 tourist season.
"People here will soon be unable to provide the refugees housing," he said. "They will put them out, and this will create an uncontrolled movement."

Social Season for Bears: Not in the Kitchen, Please

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHURCHILL, Manitoba

 BODY:
November is polar bear season in Churchill, a town of 800 on the gray and rocky western shores of Hudson Bay. One of the town's busiest men is Laury Brouzes, keeper of the bear jail.
"My job is to protect people from bears and bears from people," he said early one recent morning while inspecting traps around the dump where the now ravenous bears, the largest nonaquatic carnivores on earth, prowl. 
 The traps are not designed to injure but to intercept bears headed for town and trouble, like the 700-pound male that broke into the home of Lorraine Allen at Spruce Ridge the other day as she was baking cupcakes.
The bear forced entry by ripping screens from the bathroom window, then lumbered into the kitchen as Mrs. Allen retreated, calling for help. Her husband, Dan, rushed over with his rifle and killed the bear with one shot as it hovered over the kitchen table, eating cupcakes.
 
A Trip by Helicopter
 A happier fate awaits those in the traps of Mr. Brouzes. After a month or two in the jail, depending on the space available in the 20-pen Quonset hut, they are released on a first-in-first-out basis.
Sedated, they are transported four at a time in nets dangling from a helicopter 50 miles back into the pristine wilderness along the North Knife and Seal Rivers.
Although they are not technically an endangered species, polar bears are protected by law. Indian and Eskimo groups are permitted to kill a certain number of bears a year; others may kill bears only in self-defense.
Situated near denning areas where bears give birth, Churchill calls itself the polar bear capital of the world. It is one of the rare places where the normally aloof, seal-eating polar bears have significant contact with people.
 
Tourists by the Thousands
 That contact has increased lately as thousands of tourists pour into Churchill to see the bears in their natural habitat.
"I saw about 15 today, including a mother and cub play-fighting and running around, and it was wonderful," said a New Yorker named Irene Greenberg, who manages a veterinary hospital in the Bayside section of Queens.
While conflicts are inevitable as people inhabit and visit places that polar bears call home, Churchill is doing all it can to keep such conflicts to a minimum, both for safety and economic reasons.
To Doug Webber, the town's two-term Mayor, there is no question Churchill needs the bears.
"To the run of the mill resident, bears are a pest," said the Mayor, who owns hunting and fishing lodges and offers flying tours with money-back guarantees if his guests fail to see polar bears. "But because of tourism, people also realize bears are a cash crop and don't want to do anything to harm them."
Since the mid-1980's, three local entrepreneurs have had licenses to carry tourists in "tundra buggies," big-wheeled buses, to observe the bears in their natural state.
Such tourism, with the spinoff in T-shirts and other souvenir purchases, motel bookings, restaurant meals and employment as guides and drivers, now represents about 30 percent of the town's economic activity, which was severely affected in the early postwar years by the shutdown of a big military base and later a rocket testing installation.
The threatened closing of the port of Churchill, which in the short three-month shipping season sends Manitoba and Saskatchewan grain to Europe, would be another heavy blow.
Cape Churchill, about 30 miles east of town, is the staging point for the bears' winter feed. Forced off the Hudson Bay ice by the spring melt and thus denied their staple food, the bears now have eaten little for months. Their body weight is down by a third.
"By instinct, they know that cold weather means freeze-up time, and they'll soon be able to get out on the ice again and gorge on seals," said Dr. Charles Jonkel, a bear biologist at the University of Montana, who since the mid-1960's has been coming here to study Ursus maritimus, as the polar bear is classified.
Bears choose Cape Churchill, he said, because fresh water flowing from the mouth of the Churchill River, site of the town, freezes first. The prevailing winds push that ice toward the cape.
 
Bears Give No Warning
 "Polar Bear Alert," signs warn. "Don't Walk In This Area." If you must, you are urged to peer cautiously around corners and always look behind. "Polar bears that hunt and kill do not give warning," writes Lance Olsen, a reporter for Bear News.
Anyone sighting suspicious-looking shapes is urged to dial 675-BEAR, the hot line that sends Mr. Brouzes or one of his five Manitoba Department of Natural Resources deputies out with a rifle that shoots tranquilizing pellets. The comatose animal is then hauled off to jail.
In 1984 on Kelsey Street, Churchill's street, a polar bear killed and partly ate a man. Since then there have been at least three maulings, though none of the victims have been tourists. Several days ago, a bear ate a dog.
Eugenia Talbott, an artist who works here and in Mayhew, Miss., looked up from a polar bear she had sketched to comment: "I'm not walking so much now. The bears are hungry."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The President-Elect;
Easing Friction, Clinton Meets With Jackson

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 22

 BODY:
In what may be a first step to patch things up after a year of mutual distrust, the Rev. Jesse Jackson offered more praise for President-elect Bill Clinton today than he ever did during the campaign.
Sitting side by side in a front pew at the church where Mr. Jackson came to preach a guest sermon, the two men chatted like comfortable old friends, and in the sermon Mr. Jackson welcomed Mr. Clinton's victory as one of "inclusion over exclusion." 
 The pair went on to a private breakfast at the Governor's Mansion, a big change from the Presidential campaign, when Mr. Jackson once had to corner Mr. Clinton in a men's room to get his attention.
But behind the wide smiles were signs that the two strong-willed politicians had still not reached a full accommodation.
 
'Looking for Improvement'
 In his remarks at St. Theresa's Catholic Church here, Mr. Jackson gently put Mr. Clinton on notice that he was counting on him to come through with programs for the traditional Democratic core constituency of poor and working class people.
"We have had 12 years of bad days, so we're looking for improvement," Mr. Jackson said. Referring to the first days of the new Administration, he went on, "We cannot just sit back and watch what is going to happen in the White House during the first 100 and not deal with what is going to happen in my house and your house for the same 100."
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Jackson, who gave Mr. Clinton only a lukewarm endorsement on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, applauded the President-elect's stands on jobs, health care, urban blight and statehood for the District of Columbia, which Mr. Jackson represents in dealings with the Senate.
But Mr. Jackson also tempered his praise, suggesting that any Democrat could have defeated President Bush given the political and economic climate this year, and he patted himself on the back for registering new Democratic voters.
In addition, Mr. Jackson made clear that he wanted to be invited to a meeting on economic policy that is expected to take place next month. "I hope that those of us who represent different dimensions of interests will be part of such a summit meeting," he said.
Clinton aides said they were still compiling the guest list.
It seemed obvious by what Mr. Clinton did not do that he was not fully embracing Mr. Jackson. He did not appear at the news conference, and blurted only a few words of support when questioned by reporters.
"He was terrific," Mr. Clinton said after the service. "It was a great service. He gave a great sermon."
The President-elect later attended a service at his own church, Immanuel Baptist.
It was not lost on Mr. Clinton's aides that Mr. Jackson has made a career of being in the right place at the right time to get attention. They said Mr. Clinton was meeting Mr. Jackson out of courtesy because the civil rights leader had made plans to preach here and wanted to get together.
"Clinton was here and certainly available to meet with him," said Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, adding that they discussed a variety of legislative issues. "It was a very amicable first meeting since the election."
As he did during the campaign, Mr. Clinton appeared today to be trying to strike a delicate balance in his relations with Mr. Jackson: To maintain support of moderates who are wary of Mr. Jackson, he has sought to publicly keep his distance from him; but mindful that he cannot offend Mr. Jackson and risk losing his support among blacks, Mr. Clinton has sought privately to keep open a dialogue with him.
"Many other black leaders are going to come to the fore in the Clinton Administration," said a top Clinton aide speaking on the condition that he not be identified. "Jesse will have to learn to share the attention."
But by meeting with Mr. Jackson at the mansion for 30 minutes, Mr. Clinton demonstrated that he believed that, as he assembles his Administration, he needs to signal that he is willing to at least hear Mr. Jackson out.
Mr. Jackson, too, was not eager to revisit his feuds with the man who will be President: There was the time that Mr. Clinton said Mr. Jackson was "back-stabbing" him after he was told, incorrectly, that Mr. Jackson was endorsing Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa in the Democratic primaries.
 
'All Behind Us'
 Then there was Mr. Clinton's rebuff of Sister Souljah, a rap performer, at a meeting of Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. Mr. Jackson later accused the Governor of a "Machiavellian maneuver."
And Mr. Jackson was one of the few Democrats who publicly criticized Mr. Clinton's selection of Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as his running mate, saying the party needed a more diverse ticket.
"I don't want to talk about that," Mr. Jackson said in an interview. "That's all behind us."
So in the church appearance with Mr. Clinton at St. Theresa's, and at a later sermon at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, Mr. Jackson preached conciliation in words that could apply to him and the incoming President.
"Within a short period," he said, "we are moving from division and disgrace to unity, coalition and amazing grace. Moving from bitter to better without bloodshed, a testament to the greatness of America."
As he talked today about how the country could grow its way out of the deficit, Mr. Jackson at times seemed to have borrowed lines from Mr. Clinton. At other times, Mr. Jackson sounded like it was he who was heading for the White House. "The transition is now taking place," he said, "and, of course, we will hit the ground running in January."

HEADLINE: TRADE TUG-OF-WAR;
The Breakthrough Was the Result of a Gamble and a Last-Minute Idea

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Friday's breakthrough in a six-year trans-Atlantic stalemate on farm subsidies was the result of a daring gamble by the United States last month and a last-minute idea by the European Community, participants in the talks said in extensive interviews over the last three days.
Shuttling by the supersonic Concorde, jumbo jets and limousines to a succession of posh hotels and luxurious guest houses in Brussels, Chicago and Washington, trade negotiators from the two sides hammered out in the space of less than six weeks a comprehensive deal solving all their major disputes over agriculture. 
 If French opposition to the deal is overcome, the agreement is likely to allow the conclusion of broad world trade talks, which in turn would provide a powerful spur to the stagnant world economy.
After discussing 12 very different solutions in the last year, the two sides finally returned to an American proposal first introduced on the morning of Oct. 13 at the European Community's headquarters in Brussels. Only two changes, one thought up late Thursday afternoon by European officials, altered the broad framework of the American plan.
The American plan was both strategic and cosmetic.
Strategically, it severed the Gordian knot of international farm trade by dealing with virtually every question at the same time, including some issues that had festered since the Johnson Administration -- at a high cost to American economic and foreign policy interests.
The cosmetics came in the fig leaf the American proposal offered the Europeans. The United States abandoned its most visible demand in farm trade policy: that the European Community commit to reduce the tonnage of its subsidized grain exports by 24 percent over six years.
 
 
More Rigid Method Used for Calculation
 In its place, Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan and Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, called for only a 22 percent reduction -- but calculated by a new, more rigid method that made the 22 percent equivalent to a 24 percent cut under the previous system. The final compromise last week used the new method with a 21 percent cut.
To sweeten the offer, the United States made two concessions on Europe's subsidized production on soybeans and other oilseeds. The seeds are used in protein-rich animal feed, cooking oil and paint.
The change in the appearance, though not the substance, of the American position, gave the 12-nation European Community a politically palatable way to claim victory while retreating.
Here is how the compromise on Friday seems to have been reached:
* Mr. Madigan and Mrs. Hills met on Oct. 11, 12 and 13 with Frans Andriessen, the community's External Relations Commissioner, and Ray MacSharry, the community's Agriculture Commissioner, in Brussels, and an agreement was nearly reached, based on the United States proposal.
* When American and European aides met again in Brussels on Oct. 19, 20, and 21, the deal fell apart, as community negotiators made new demands under pressure from the French Government. France is by far Europe's leading food producer and exporter, and French farmers are highly organized politically.
* Mr. Madigan and Mr. MacSharry met in Chicago on Nov. 1, 2 and 3 and failed to find a common ground. The Americans were eager for a deal before Election Day, lest a Bush defeat erode their credibility, but could not win European support for their proposals.
* The top trade officials met again last Wednesday and Thursday at Blair House, the White House's sumptuous residence for visiting dignitaries, and revived the original plan from a month earlier, making two changes. The Europeans flew home, consulted with colleagues and cinched the deal by phone on Friday morning.
The meetings themselves involved hours of poring over production and trade statistics, inevitably punctuated with jibes about food. At Blair House last Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Madigan complained repeatedly when Mrs. Hills's office served a dinner of consomme, egg-salad finger sandwiches and sweets.
"We've just been treated to an evening repast by U.S.T.R. -- now we're going to get something to eat," said Mr. Madigan, a high school football player who played offensive and defensive line in central Illinois, as he stepped into his limousine after the meeting. "U.S.T.R. is a very low-budget operation."
 
Stickiest Issue In the Negotiations
 Farm subsidies had been the stickiest issue since the current round of 108-nation world trade talks began six years ago in Uruguay, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based group that administers world trade. And until the farm issues were resolved, there was little hope of proceeding on other fronts, from telecommunications to shipping to manufactured products. The aim is to have freer trade in virtually all goods and services.
When American officials began arriving in Brussels on Sunday morning, Oct. 11, they were optimistic that a deal on agriculture might finally be struck.
The most implacable foe of compromise, the French Government, had survived a national referendum on European economic integration three weeks earlier and did not face another national vote until parliamentary elections in March. And the near-collapse of the European Monetary System at the end of September had left European countries, especially Germany, convinced that a trade deal was needed to stimulate their faltering economies.
Mrs. Hills and her senior deputy, Julius Katz, quickly reached common ground with their counterparts on banking, insurance and other long-standing disputes.
But when Mr. Madigan arrived that evening for talks on farm subsidies, the impasse reasserted itself.
European officials are confronted with a larger percentage of their population who are farmers than in the United States. As in Japan, they have an emotional reluctance to let markets rule their agriculture, and an emotional attachment to food self-sufficiency, because of memories of widespread hunger during and after World War II.
The Europeans had steadfastly resisted American efforts to reduce subsidies, even though subsidies inflate European farm production, artificially depress European demand for American exports and result in huge and inefficient European exports that take markets away from American farmers.
Because the rest of the talks had progressed well, the two sides had already drafted a joint communique proclaiming success. (That same communique, with a revised paragraph on agriculture and an extra sentence on production of soybeans and other oilseeds, was finally issued last Friday, an American official said.)
Mr. Madigan and Mrs. Hills had been insisting that the United States would accept nothing less than a 24 percent cut over six years in European subsidized grain exports, because European officials had mentioned this figure in November of last year before later refusing to accept it.
In desperation, the American officials agreed to propose a seemingly lower percentage -- the so-called clean 22 -- along with a new method of calculating how much should be cut each year. In specifying stricter levels for each year, the new method operates like annually compounded interest at a bank, and the end result over the six years would be as deep a cut as the 24 percent.
The American team put the new offer on the table, and headed for the airport Tuesday morning.
 
Tactic Was Gamble With Political Risks
 Coming less than a month before Election Day, the tactic was a gamble, with political risks. By going below 24 percent, the Administration might be accused of sacrificing American economic interests for the sake of political gain. Two lower-level American officials even said privately in late October that they were appalled by the decision to go below 24 percent.
They feared that the Europeans would insist that the United States had lowered its offer to 22 percent but would not accept the new method of calculation that went with it.
The Europeans' initial response to the American offer was favorable. But a week later, when aides from both sides met in Brussels, the Europeans were intransigent.
The virtual collapse of the talks in Brussels on Oct. 19 and 20 appears to have had its roots in a meeting of heads of government of the European Community's 12 member nations in Birmingham, England, on Oct. 16. President Francois Mitterrand of France criticized the American plan then as going beyond the community's overhaul last May of it so-called Common Agricultural Policy. And Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister John Major of Britain were unable to override Mr. Mitterrand's objections.
On Oct. 22, C. Joseph O'Mara, the Agriculture Department's chief staff negotiator and resident statistical guru, flew home from Brussels in disgust. His community counterparts had insisted that they could not go above 18 percent under the old system of calculation.
That evening, Mr. Katz, Mr. Madigan, Mrs. Hills, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy White House chief of staff, gathered at the White House and decided the time had come to threaten a trade war.
They assembled a list of $300 million of annual imports from the European Community, including white wine, rapeseed oil and wheat gluten used in animal feed (much of Europe's white wine comes from Burgundy, the home of France's Agriculture Minister). And they decided to announce a 200 percent punitive tax on these goods after the Presidential election if a settlement could not be reached.
The decision to delay the tax until after the election was made for two reasons, American officials said. They thought the Europeans would ignore any earlier move as election-year politics. They also thought the action would not help or hurt them on Election Day. Indeed, a report of the American shift to 22 percent from 24 percent appeared in print on Oct. 29, and did not become a campaign issue. The change was hard to explain and was lost in the heat of the final days before the election.
Under pressure from Prime Minister Major of Britain, President Bush agreed to another round of talks in Chicago, on Nov. 1-3, right before the Presidential election. Nervous about being accused of hatching a last-minute deal, the Agriculture Department tried to keep the location of the talks -- the Mayfair Hotel -- a secret. When that failed, Mr. Madigan insisted on standing so far apart from Mr. MacSharry at a brief news conference that television crews could not capture them in the same image.
Mr. Madigan and Mr. MacSharry explored new ways to strike an oilseeds deal, including the use of tonnage limits instead of acreage limits. But the talks collapsed late on Nov. 3, partly because Jacques Delors, the President of the European Community, called Mr. MacSharry and objected to the tonnage limits as inconsistent with the community's May 21 position on cuts .
On the flight home, Mr. MacSharry wrote Mr. Delors, furiously resigning as the community's farm negotiator. In Washington, Mrs. Hills announced on Nov. 5 that the United States would start collecting the 200 percent import taxes on Dec. 5.
The American announcement led to a series of angry meetings in European capitals, as Britain and the Netherlands strong-armed France into allowing the negotiations to resume, in Washington on Nov. 18-19.
Mr. MacSharry agreed to return and was given a free hand. Talks were set for Blair House, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. On Wednesday evening, European officials said they wanted to go back to the formula offered in Brussels on Oct. 13.
Two changes were made on Thursday, each an American concession. Having taken the gamble of the clean 22 and survived, the Americans pulled back to 21 percent on the tonnage of grain exports the Europeans could subsidize. The Europeans then made a last-minute proposal: they asked to be able to plant an additional small quantity of oilseeds that could be used for paint production and other industrial uses, using land taken out of general oilseed production. Mr. Madigan and Mrs. Hills agreed. .
The Blair House deal also accepted the community's decision, on May 21, to reduce its oilseed acreage next year by 15 percent, provided the community agreed to a permanent 10 percent reduction and agreed to binding arbitration if either figure were exceeded. Late Thursday night, American farm lobbyists grudgingly agreed to go along.
 
Word Received Of Deal's Approval
 Friday morning, Mr. Madigan climbed out of bed at his home in Falls Church, Va., picked up the phone and called Mr. MacSharry, who assured him the deal had passed muster at the community's headquarters in Brussels.
Mr. Madigan began trying to disguise the American accomplishment to make it easier for European leaders to promote the deal at home.
Asked then whether the change in method made the 21 percent actually equal to 23 percent, Mr. Madigan was guarded. "If somebody else wants to make that observation they can, but I'm not going to say that."

HEADLINE: Yankee Ingenuity Wins Out in PC's

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Fujitsu Ltd. would seem in an ideal position to become a dominant player in the booming portable computing market. The world's fifth-largest chip maker, Fujitsu is adept at precisely what the Japanese microelectronics companies are supposed to be best at: miniaturizing each new generation of computer parts and packaging it elegantly for the consumer market.
But at the vast Comdex/Fall trade show in Las Vegas, Nev., last week, Fujitsu had very little new to offer in the way of portable computers. And the same was true for other Japanese computer makers. Indeed, in a startling reversal of the technology trend in recent years, the action in mobile computing was all American. 
 From EO Computer's notebook cellular telephone and a range of hand-held wireless communicators by Motorola, to Apple Computer's new Duo notebook computers, the American computer industry demonstrated that any fears the Japanese would inevitably control personal computing -- as they do the manufacture of televisions, video cameras and much of the rest of consumer electronics -- are not coming to pass.
 
Setting the Standards
 "The United States computer manufacturers have re-invented themselves and are holding on to the most desirable market in the world," said Steven P. Jobs, a co-founder of Apple who is now chairman of Next Computer Inc.
From the mid-1980's until last year American computer makers lived under increasing pressure from their Japanese rivals. And many industry analysts believed American companies were vulnerable because the Japanese microelectronics companies controlled the supply of an increasingly large percentage of a personal computer's basic components.
In a widely read 1989 article in the Harvard Business Review, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles H. Ferguson, argued that given the pervasiveness of standardized components, Japan's economic organization and manufacturing prowess would give it an unbeatable advantage unless the United States responded by organizing its own alliances between the corporate world and government.
But while the Japanese continue to dominate the supply of flat-panel display screens used in portable computers and also have a leading position in producing computer memory chips, many other vital components -- like microprocessors and hard disks -- are still dominated by American companies.
And American companies, primarily the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest software company, and Apple Computer, have been very successful in retaining leadership by setting standards adopted by large segments of the industry.
 
The American Advantage
 Even Mr. Ferguson and other former prophets of doom have changed their tunes. In a new book, "Computer Wars," written with Charles R. Morris, the authors say that setting standards provides a mechanism that will permit American companies to maintain global leadership.
"System design is run by the Americans while the components are made by the Japanese," he said. "Five years ago the pessimist school, including me, thought that it was an unstable situation and, in the end, the tale would wag the dog. I'm considerably more optimistic now."
Unlike television sets and other consumer electronics, in which standards are adopted and then change only slowly, computer technology refuses to stand still. What is more, American computer makers have increasingly grown expert in thumping the Japanese in those areas where they are weakest -- developing products in relatively short cycles, redesigning an entire product line in 6 to 12 months. Certainly, Japanese makers have been able to beat American competitors to market. But in areas requiring constant technical innovation, like computing, they have not done so well.
 
The Importance of Risk
 Consider Apple Computer. A year ago it had no market share in notebook computers. Now it is the world's largest notebook maker.
"Suddenly the Japanese have become more conservative, and they're not taking risks," said Alain Rossman, a former Apple executive who is now president of EO Computer, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that makes a combination cellular phone and pen-based computer that weighs two pounds.
"Today, winning comes from speed-based competition," he said. "The Japanese are quick when everything is specified, but in innovation and path-seeking they're slower."
Toshiba, which dominated the United States notebook market until three years ago, is the best example of the Japanese failure to innovate quickly enough. Toshiba's share has fallen from more than 20 percent in 1989 to less than 15 percent now.
"The Americans have woken up to the fact that quick product turns are something you have to be able to do or you die," said George Fisher, chairman of Motorola Inc. "We have convinced ourselves that we can compete head to head with the Japanese in cost, quality, size and low power consumption if we put our heads to it."
 
Winners in Marketing
 The Japanese computer companies have also been outmarketed by their America competitors. Low-cost, service-oriented mail-order companies like Dell Computer, Zeos International and Gateway 2000 have clearly caught the Japanese flat-footed.
"A lot of the innovation in the personal computer market has been in how you sell your products, and that has passed the Japanese by," said William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft.
Japanese executives acknowledge that they have taken a beating in the marketing wars in the United States.
"Just making products smaller and lighter won't make them a success," said Takuma Yamamoto, Fujitsu's chairman. He said Japanese computer makers needed to imitate I.B.M.'s strategy in Japan, where it created a subsidiary that is almost a Japanese company.
"For Japanese companies to be successful in the United States market they must employ talented Americans," he said.
But before the Japanese can refocus their attention on the United States, they may have to secure their home ground, where American companies have been making inroads in the last year.
The Compaq Computer Corporation recently cut personal computer prices in Japan, presenting the market leader, the NEC Corporation, with a dilemma. Does it respond with price cuts that reduce its profit margins, hoping to maintain its market share? Or does it try to hold the line?
NEC, whose proprietary computer design is not I.B.M.-compatible, has about 57 percent of the Japanese market, with 6.5 million of its machines in use. But besides price-cutting by rivals, NEC is facing competition from I.B.M.-compatible machines that are able to run the enormously popular Windows software made by Microsoft, which does not come in an NEC version.

HEADLINE: TRADE TUG-OF-WAR;
France Asks Other Nations To Rally Round Its Position

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Recalling pointedly that France has often helped other European nations out of tight spots, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy today urged European Community governments to close ranks around France in its opposition to a new farm trade agreement between the community and the United States.
But he also for the first time acknowledged that, as a last resort, France might use its right of veto over the accord negotiated by members of the community's executive commission on behalf of the 12-nation bloc. 
 Still, in an interview on a state-owned television channel, Mr. Beregovoy tried to reduce the drama in the crisis, noting that the agreement still needed the approval of all community governments and brushing aside the suggestion that France was isolated.
"France needs Europe, but Europe also needs France," Mr. Beregovoy said, adding that France had never let down its partners and now asked for their understanding.
 
Welcomed in Western Europe
 He noted that, when called on, France had shown solidarity with its partners, backing London in a lengthy budget dispute with the community, Bonn in its request for special treatment for former Eastern Europe and Southern Europe in its bid for extra development funds from the community.
The farm products agreement concluded Friday has been welcomed throughout Western Europe as an important step toward completing long-stalled global trade liberalization talks taking place under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But the French Government, finding itself under intense pressure from a powerful farming lobby that enjoys the support of key opposition political parties, has rejected the accord, arguing that it will damage French and European farming and grant unfair advantage to American producers.
"No country can dictate its laws to the world," the French Prime Minister said, in an apparent allusion to Washington's threat to impose punitive sanctions on $300 million worth of European exports if the farm trade negotiations failed.
Mr. Beregovoy, whose Government faces crucial parliamentary elections next March, said he hoped that the National Assembly would give full backing to France's position on the farm dispute when it debated the issue Wednesday.
"It is good that the country rally to the cause," he said.
 
Taking the Case to the Council
 With this support, he said, France would take its case to other governments at the next meeting of the community's Council of Ministers. He said that it was not yet clear whether this was a case in which the council could act only unanimously and that, if this was so, the question of a formal veto need not arise.
"But, in the end, if there is no other way of expressing France's opposition," he said, "then this veto will clearly have to come from France."
For that, a specific text would have to be presented to the Council of Ministers by the community's executive commission, which will debate the problem in Brussels on Wednesday.
The French leader said French farmers could also expect the support of farmers in other European countries, but he urged them in their planned demonstrations against the agreement this week to avoid excesses and preserve their "sang-froid."
"The anger of the farmers can be understood, but it is in their interest to refrain from improper actions," he stressed, adding his own personal regret that an American flag was burned in one demonstration by farmers last week.
This weekend, farmers in Amiens and Lille specifically selected McDonald's outlets, as symbols of American economic power, for protests. In a statement tonight, the McDonald's Corporation said it understood the farmers' desire to defend their interests but noted that all the produce eaten in McDonald's restaurants in France was purchased in France -- meat from Orleans, potatoes from Lille and salad ingredients from the southwest.

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
Helping Remake Manhattan Through a Mastery of the Arcane

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Samuel H. Lindenbaum, both renowned and derided for his talent at steering real-estate developments through New York City's Byzantine regulatory mazes, has been busy. As Donald J. Trump's lawyer, he negotiated through most of last weekend with the City Council to get its approval for Mr. Trump's giant Upper West Side development.
His hope is that the deal he is helping fashion will pass the relevant City Council committees today and tomorrow. If all goes well, he expects final approval by Dec. 17. "I'm wondering whether I'm going to get post-partum blues," he said of a project he has now shepherded for years. 
 Not likely. The man known to friend and foe as Sandy is too busy. In recent months, he has negotiated a deal to keep the Mercantile Exchange from moving to New Jersey; put together a package that will lead to several former Alexander's department stores being opened under new ownership, and received city approval for Sony's proposal to cut back on open public space in the building it recently purchased from A.T.&T. in return for adding heating, air-conditioning and other public amenities.
Also on his plate is a renovation of New York Hospital, involving the addition of some one million square feet, and a possible two-million-square-foot development in the Wall Street area which he won't discuss. In the works, he volunteers, are "two or three discrete residential developments with 200 to 300 units each."
 
Challenges of the 90's
 All this comes while a fifth of the city's office space is vacant, and building of all kinds has become nearly dormant. Does this mean the development industry is lurching awake?
"Maybe it's a blip, who knows?" Mr. Lindenbaum said. "I don't think so. Remember, I'm at the beginning of the process."
Mr. Lindenbaum's arcane expertise in subjects like zoning is reflected by the two enormous books on his desk: they contain all of New York City's zoning ordinances, which he claims to know better than anybody.
His mastery of its contents is suggested by the view from his windows at the corner of Madison Avenue and 56th Street. He counts nine skyscrapers to which he was midwife. His function was to make sure they conform to land-use law, and, if necessary, to find ways around the strictest interpretation of the law.
"Sandy knows zoning best," agreed Sylvia Deutsch, former chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, "He knows all the ins and outs."
"He's about the best zoning lawyer around," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation who has negotiated with Mr. Lindenbaum on the Mercantile Exchange and other matters. "He's fair, straightforward and knows what government is thinking."
Not everyone celebrates what Mr. Lindenbaum does for a living.
A top official in city government who insisted on anonymity says people like Mr. Lindenbaum are "counterproductive," because they reduce direct contact between businesses and City Hall by imposing themselves as expensive middlemen. "They make government seem more mysterious and inaccessible," he said.
For his part, Mr. Lindenbaum rejects the label fixer, sort of. "If it's broken, I can fix it," he declared. "Does that make me a fixer?"
This is not a shy man. One of the first things one notices about him is his truly enormous gold ring, custom made by Tiffany's. He uses the word arrogant to describe himself.
He has homes on Fifth Avenue and in the Hamptons, and does not need undue prompting to divulge the fact that he owns a Picasso or two. Though soft-spoken and personable, there is something just a little grandiose about his style.
"I represent the last of the gunslingers," he boasted. "Very tough guys."
He also knows the right people, but both he and these right people swear this is not the only reason he wins.
 
Help Along the Way
 Still, it must be stated that he was born with contacts of which others can only dream. Harvard College and Harvard Law School were followed by a stint with a Wall Street firm where Mr. Lindenbaum fell in love with the gray-flannel suit atmosphere. But when his father left his job with an insurance company to hang up a shingle on Brooklyn's Court Street, the younger Mr. Lindenbaum immediately agreed to join him. "He'd sacrificed so much for me," the son explained.
The father, Abraham (Bunny) Lindenbaum, served on the Planning Commission briefly, until he was banished in 1961 for soliciting campaign funds from developers. This experience so embittered the younger Mr. Lindenbaum, just out of law school, that he says he vowed never to be involved in government.
Though he loved Brooklyn and the Crown Heights neighborhood where he grew up, he himself moved to Manhattan and quickly built up a clientele consisting almost entirely of developers there. His office became a table at the Regency Hotel.
His father, whose first client as a private lawyer was Mr. Trump's father, Fred, rejected his pleas that he move to Manhattan and end this strange arrangement. So the son decided to strike out on his own.
Despite his growing reputation and the contacts he had built up through his father, the job hunt was not as easy as he had foreseen. "A lot of them considered what I did a little bit declasse," he allowed.
But the blue-chip firm of Rosenman & Colin turned out to be eager to get him. He says he struck a deal that quickly led to him becoming the firm's biggest moneymaker. But he found he had no interest in managing the firm, much less in its expansion plans to California and elsewhere.
Accordingly, in 1982, he negotiated a new arrangement that gave him more independence, and the chance to take a piece of developer's deals.
His fees, which he refuses to disclose, became contingent upon the value he added to a building, usually by helping devise a compromise to make the project bigger. "Many of the guys I've represented, we didn't even talk about fees until the job is done," he said.
That casualness has changed in the last year, as the slowdown in building reduced the business of his 10-person group.
But Mr. Lindenbaum is optimistic about the future, saying the present high office vacancy rate may soon evaporate. He still says he will turn down any case he does not have a better than 50-50 chance of winning. And he claims his job is to find compromises that will help everybody, rather than slide one by the authorities.
"If anybody ever said, 'Can I get away with this?' I'd show them the door," he insisted.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rising Dollar Brings a Challenge

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar's sharp jump against European currencies in the last two months is making times difficult for managers of international bond portfolios.
Nicholas Sargen, the chief investment officer for Prudential's Global Fixed Income Investment Advisers, has to review regularly the moves he has made to protect his funds from the eroding force of a rising dollar, which can quickly wipe out the capital gains from even a shrewdly invested foreign bond portfolio. 
 Theresa A. Havell, director of fixed income securities at Neuberger & Berman, wonders if she is facing a double whammy: a rising dollar and the end of the European bond market's rally. "That is what I worry about the most," she said.
 
Worry for Managers
 A rising dollar worries American fund managers investing abroad because it can sharply eat into their profits or aggravate their losses. When the dollar rises, foreign investments lose value because as they are translated back into dollars, it takes more foreign currency to buy the same number of dollars.
What portfolio managers can do to lessen their concerns -- and their potential losses -- is to hedge against the rising dollar. They do this with various trading strategies, the simplest being to buy dollars at current prices for delivery in the future.
But for some managers, like Mrs. Havell, this is easier to do than for others, like Mr. Sargen, whose trading strategies are restricted by the requirements of his funds.
The dollar sank to 1.3892 marks per dollar in intra-day trading on Sept. 1, its lowest level against the German mark since the mark was created in 1948. The dollar has since risen more than 15 percent, closing at 1.6055 marks on Friday in New York.
 
2 Forces at Work
 There are two forces pushing the dollar higher. One is the shrinkage of the huge gap between European and American short-term interest rates. That gap was well over 6 percentage points before it began to narrow in September when Germany and other European countries started to cut interest rates.
The actual narrowing of this gap by more than a percentage point -- and, more important, the expectation that it will shrink much further -- makes the dollar and dollar-denominated investments more attractive to investors and speculators.
The second force pushing the dollar higher is the decline of economic growth in Europe while the American economy is beginning to recover, albeit slowly.
Michael Rosenberg, the manager of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch, said the decline in interest rates in Europe was the real power behind the dollar's move higher, which means that even if the American economic recovery was sluggish for some time, the dollar could move higher still.
 
Devaluations a Factor
 A devaluation of the Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta by 6 percent early yesterday may also help to lift the dollar a little. This was the second devaluation of currencies in the European Monetary System since a September crisis led to the withdrawal from the system of the British pound and Italian lira. The latest move is likely to put even more pressure on Germany to cut interest rates, analysts said.
Because of the rising dollar, Mrs. Havell of Neuberger is hedging most of her investments in Europe. She does this by buying a bond future contract, instead of an actual cash bond. Bond future contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell bonds at a set price at a certain time in the future, are traded in London.
The advantage of this is that a manager has to put up only 3 percent -- the margin -- of the total value of the contracts purchased. This means that only 3 percent of the manager's dollar investment is exposed to direct currency risk, as long as the bond futures do not drop sharply in value.
In the case of British bonds, however, Mrs. Havell has taken off her hedge. She did this, she said, because the dollar had already risen more against the pound than against most other European currencies since Britain pulled out of the European Monetary System on Sept. 16. Since then, the dollar is up 23 percent against the pound. And the dollar is up 32 percent since it hit its recent low against the pound of 0.50 pounds to the dollar on Sept. 8. On Friday, the dollar finished at 0.66 pounds.
Fiona Biggs, the portfolio manager for Dreyfus Strategic World Investing, has taken the same approach with the hedging of the German bonds in the fund. And she went one step further, by hedging the 3 percent back into dollars to protect her from even this small currency risk.
But Mr. Sargen is in a more difficult position. His funds' requirements do not allow him to hedge like Mrs. Havell and Ms. Biggs, because he cannot buy futures on margin. He has to buy the underlying German, British, French or other European bond at the full cost. This means his currency risk is the full value of his investment. While $1 million of bond futures entails a currency risk of $30,000, Mr. Sargen's risk is $1 million.
Because of this, his desire to hedge is limited by the cost of insurance against currency fluctuations. Right now the annual price of this insurance, which is based on interest-rate differentials, can be about 6 percent a year. His view on the dollar is also holding him back. And one of the standards against which he is measured -- a benchmark fund allocated according to the size of bond markets around the world -- never assumes that hedging is used.
So as of now, Mr. Sargen has hedged only 50 to 60 percent of his foreign bond exposure in Europe. But even with this limited hedging, if the dollar rises he will outperform the benchmark fund he is rated against.
 
Upward Trend?
 Yet he said he was more and more convinced that the dollar was on a solid upward trend, though he is not 100 percent sure.
"If you had a stronger-than-expected German economic number and a weaker U.S. figure," he said, "that is the set of expectations that could take the dollar back to 1.50" against the German mark.
And since there has already been one big fall of the dollar in this current rally, which took it from 1.51 marks on Sept. 16 down to 1.4090 marks on Oct. 2, Mr. Sargen has to worry.

HEADLINE: Welfare Can't Be Reformed in a Social Vacuum;
Support, Don't Punish

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Campuses Buck Clinton on Welfare" (The Week in Review, Oct. 25) reports on a national social work teach-in, in which more than 200 schools in more than 40 states organized activities to inform themselves and their communities about "welfare" and efforts to "reform" the program for single mothers and their children, and to let the next President know that social workers want more supportive, rather than more punitive, policies for women and children on welfare. But your headline misses the point of our protest: the negative impact on women, children and families of 12 years of social program cuts by Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
Unfortunately, most of your article chastises social workers for liberalism and alleged political naivete. An example of lack of political savvy is a placard that read, "Willie Horton was an abused/neglected child." The sign did not, as you seem to think, call social workers to rally around Willie Horton. Rather, it pointed up that people end troubled and in prison for complicated reasons, often beyond their own control.
The reference to Willie Horton also made the point that welfare-bashing is the new race card in electoral politics. Since Richard M. Nixon's Southern strategy, Republicans have courted white working- and middle-class Democrats by pandering to racial fears. The welfare mother thus replaces Willie Horton, affirmative action and busing as the Republican code word in racial politics. The Democratic Party platform statement that "welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life," is a more subtle play of the same tensions.
Your second example of social work's lack of political savvy is that our view of social deprivation differs from that of most Americans. Social workers should be congratulated for using their knowledge of people, poverty and society to risk correcting decades of conservative policy analysis and prescriptions that rely on stereotypes, victim blaming and unsubstantiated myths about the behavior of welfare mothers.
No firm evidence exists to link Aid to Families with Dependent Children to the work, marriage and child-bearing decisions of women on welfare. Cutting this program, which accounted for but 1 percent of the Federal budget in 1991, would do nothing to reduce the deficit, end the recession or pay the savings and loan bail-out.
But a reduction in the already below-poverty A.F.D.C. benefit would deepen the enormous hardship faced by mothers on welfare and lead to greater costs in the future as poverty wreaks havoc with the lives of their children.

HEADLINE: Quality and Low Cost of Medical Care Lure Americans to Mexican Doctors

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Americans living near the Mexican border are now routinely crossing to Mexico for medical care rather than pay higher prices for similar care and identical drugs in the United States.
While doctors and public health officials in the area have been aware of the phenomenon for some time, a new large random sampling of Mexican doctors along the border from Texas to California found that Americans now account for a quarter of their patients. 
 The cost of a visit to a doctor can be so much lower over the border that in some cases it is less than the 20 percent most Americans must pay under most health insurance plans.
For the report commissioned by Families U.S.A., a Washington advocacy group for health-care issues, the polling organization Belden & Russonello of Washington surveyed 242 doctors in Mexico and 318 Americans who go to Mexico for health care. The price of seven common drugs was compared in five pharmacies in California and five in Mexicali, Mexico. The study also included similar drug price comparisons along the Arizona and Texas borders.
Sixty-one percent of the patients said their chief reason for going to Mexico was price; 20 percent said they went chiefly because they liked the personal attention they received from Mexican doctors and clinics.
But 80 percent of the patients said they would prefer to go to doctors in the United States if the cost was lower or the style of practice more personal.
About 90 percent said they felt the care they had received in Mexico had been good or excellent. About 80 percent rated the care they had received in the United States as good or excellent. A few more rated the care excellent in the United States than in Mexico care, but, in addition, more people rated the care poor in the United States than in Mexico.
 
'Disgrace at the Border'
 Associations of farmers in the border region say that a much larger number of their workers now want to go to Mexico for health care. Since American medical plans do not pay the costs of doctor visits in Mexico or other foreign countries except in emergencies, the farmers have adopted health plans for their workers that use no American doctors and cost about one-fifth of similar plans using doctors in the United States. While many of those covered in the farmers' growers associations are recent immigrants, many other people who go to Mexico for medical care are long-term residents of the United States.
Ronald Pollack, the director of Families U.S.A. who in recent months has been an adviser to President-elect Bill Clinton, said on Friday of his group's new study: "The hemorrhage at the Mexican border is a symptom of the fundamental sickness in the American health-care system. What greater embarrassment could we have than the spectacle of tens of thousands of Americans leaving our country to get affordable health care?
"If you want to know why comprehensive health reform is certain to pass in 1993, this disgrace at the border gives you part of the answer."
Brenda Laukaitis, a spokeswoman in Washington for the American Medical Association, said there were significant doubts about the study. "A survey of 242 doctors is not a scientific study by any stretch of the imagination," she said. "We have access problems in the U.S., but to conclude that Americans are heading south in any significant numbers is ludicrous. This survey is a poor attempt to bash the American health-care system."
One of those seeking medical care in Mexico is Rosa Parra, who lives in El Centro, Calif., only a 20-minute drive from Mexico. Mrs. Parra, manager of the shoe department at a Walmart store, and her husband, who works in the produce section of a supermarket, have three children.
"Our health insurance makes me pay for all of the first doctor visit with each illness and then 20 percent of every visit after that for the same illness," Mrs. Parra said. "I can't afford it. It's sometimes cheaper to see a doctor in Mexico, and get the medication as well, than it is to pay even 20 percent of the doctor's fee in the U.S."
 
'The Same Treatment'
 She added, "I like going over there, because I think they do better; they seem to care about you more."
In El Paso, James Steagall, 28 years old, works as a salesman for Computerland, a group of retail computer stores. He and his wife, Maria, have two children, 8 months and 3 years old. Family coverage for a health insurance policy in the United States would cost about $100 a month for each dependent. On top of that Mr. Steagall would have to pay a $250 deductible before the plan would pay any doctor bills.
In Mexico, he said, "we get the same treatment and the identical drugs, with the same labels on them for less than a third of the price."
Mrs. Steagall was pregnant when her husband took his current job, and so she was counted as having a pre-existing condition for which the insurance company would not pay. She needed a Caesarean section, and Mr. Steagall was told it would cost $6,000 to $7,000. At a small private clinic in Mexico, he said, the same operation and a stay in the hospital cost $2,200.
The Families U.S.A. report said: "We think of the American health-care system as the best in the world and one that attracts foreigners. Escalating health-care costs in the United States are undermining the ability of this country to provide its residents with the health-care services they need. The ironic outcome is that while thousands of Mexicans come to the United States in search of economic opportunity, many Americans seek affordable health care in Mexico."
The survey showed that 99 percent of the Mexican doctors interviewed see patients from the United States, and the doctors reported that about a quarter of all their patients lived in the United States.
The Mexican doctors charge an average of $25 a visit, though 40 percent charge less than $20, the doctors reported. In contrast, American doctors charge two-and-one-half to three times that amount for an office visit.
The report also compared drug prices for seven common drugs in the United States and Mexico and found that, on average, the same drugs cost about three times as much in the United States.
Zantac, for example, an ulcer medication made by Glaxo, cost an average $92.31 in five California pharmacies, while it cost $21.91 in five pharmacies in Mexicali. In all 15 Mexican pharmacies were surveyed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexicali and Nogales and 15 United States pharmacies in Arizona, California and Texas.
The survey shows the same trend that emerged in a report released earlier this fall by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, in which drug prices in the United States and Canada were compared. The agency did a detailed comparison of prices that American companies charged drug wholesalers for 121 drugs.
It found that the median price per bottle was 43 percent higher in the United States. Ninety-eight of the drugs were priced higher in the United States, while only 23 percent were lower. Isordil, from Wyeth-Ayerst International, cost 967 percent more in the United States, and Ativan, also made by Wyeth, cost 702 percent more.
The G.A.O. said it could find no reason why the drug companies charged more in the United States, other than that was what the market would bear. The Canadian health-care system is designed so that drug prices are negotiated by the provincial governments, which get a better price.
Steeply rising American health-care costs have prompted growers associations in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas to offer new forms of health insurance coverage for workers.
For example, the Western Growers Association, whose members grow and ship 90 percent of the vegetables in Arizona and California, began offering workers a plan this year under which they could go to Mexico and obtain all their health care, including doctors, laboratory tests, surgery, dentistry or obstetrics, for $2.50 a visit, paid by the worker. The worker's employer pays $39 a month under the plan. While many of those covered live very near the border, the plan will cover initial emergency care in the United States.
A comparable program using doctors and clinics in the United States would cost the employer $200 a month and the employee at least 20 percent of the cost of each visit to a doctor plus medication, said Raymond Navarette, who deals with doctors and clinics for the growers group's insurance fund, the Western Growers Insurance Trust.
He said the number of workers going to Mexico for care, under a variety of their insurance plans, had increased 17 percent in the last two years, to a total of more than 18,000 workers.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart yesterday showing differences in average prices for some common drugs in California and Mexico rendered one name incorrectly. The drug is Ceclor, not Cector. The chart also misstated some prices and one quantity. Mevacor costs an average of $57.62 in California and Xanax costs $54.08; Tagamet costs $19.16 in Mexico. The correct quantity for Zantac was 60 150-milligram tablets.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Multicultural Ad Agency Aims to Join Mainstream

BYLINE: By KAREN STABINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22

 BODY:
It sounds like a high-concept situation comedy -- an advertising agency run by a black entrepreneur, an Asian journalist and a Colombian would-be opera singer. Lots of jokes based on idiomatic misunderstandings, like the partner who declares "right off" when he agrees with someone. Endless opportunities for trouble with clients, like the time the printer dropped a line of type from a transit billboard for Pacific Bell and then pasted the Chinese characters back on upside down.
But J. Melvin Muse, chairman of Muse Cordero Chen Inc. here, is dead serious. Mr. Muse, known as Jo, David Chen and Mavis Cordero founded what he calls a "multicultural, ethnically diverse" agency six years ago, and in that time have lifted their billings to $25 million from less than $2 million. Their half-dozen clients include Nike Inc. and the American Honda Motor Company.
 
Going Mainstream
 Now, Muse Cordero Chen is ready to go mainstream, and one look at the arithmetic of ethnic diversity explains why: Nike and Honda account for almost 75 percent of the agency's billings. In contrast, Rubin Postaer and Associates of Santa Monica bills $127.6 million for its work for Honda, while Nike spends an estimated $223.3 million on advertising. Its general account is handled by Weiden & Kennedy of Portland. 
 As the singer Paul Simon has observed, one man's ceiling is another man's floor. Although ethnic spending has held steady in the midst of a recession, it's a tiny part of the whole.
"There's a reluctance," Mr. Muse said, with a rueful grin, "to cut budgets that are already so low." And ethnic advertising is in danger of disappearing as a separate discipline. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Quaker Oats have shut ethnic marketing groups, not because they don't care about minority-group consumers but because those buyers are a growing part of the general market.
So Muse Cordero Chen wants to cross over. In the last two months, the agency has pitched two mainstream accounts, losing both times. But it recently was named one of five finalists, from an original field of 10 agencies, that on Dec. 7 will pitch the $7 million Smith's Food and Drug Centers account.
 
A 'Natural Progression'
 Mr. Muse considers the move a "natural progression" in a society that is increasingly more diverse. Sixty percent of the population of Los Angeles is made up of minority-group members; by the year 2000, almost a third of this country's population will be black, Asian or Hispanic.
"Nobody argues the Spanish influence on Los Angeles," he said. "And after 20 years with an Afro-American mayor, nobody can argue that influence. And don't forget the Asian component. The culture is shifting. And by understanding Los Angeles we naturally can grow to handle larger accounts."
Juliet Erickson, president of the Los Angeles office of Rogen Inc., a consulting firm, thinks Muse Cordero Chen has a chance to break through because what it really does is single out consumers, a skill that can be exploited on a larger scale.
"All the intellectual capital they've built up is that they segment, target and streamline messages," she said. "That's what they're known for, where they're ahead of the game. And whether it's Mexicans, Japanese or toothpaste buyers is irrelevant."
 
Culture as 'Gripping Dynamic'
 Ms. Erickson believes that consumer-goods companies may have to shift their emphasis from managing brands to managing consumers, to keep up with expanding ethnic markets. "Mainstream is such an old-fashioned idea," she said. Mr. Muse agrees. "Culture is as gripping a dynamic as economics," he said. "Maybe even more so."
Mr. Muse said the reactions from the ad community to his new goal ranged from concern about whether the agency could survive the transition to worry about a potential new competitor. Mr. Muse bristles at the suggestion, however well intentioned, that going after mainstream accounts will hurt his ethnic business. He wonders whether people would ask that question of, say, D'arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, "which just got the Afro-American portion of the American Express card? Did anyone ask if they were going to lose Sea World because of it? You want ethnic, we do ethnic. You want something else, we do that."
Until now Muse Cordero Chen has won most of its accounts through what Muse calls "strategic alliances," associations with agencies that eventually led to a chunk of budget being allocated for ethnic advertising. The agency says it is not yet very good at a traditional pitch.
 
No Words Minced
 "We stunk up the room," was Mr. Muse's curt appraisal of the agency's performance at a recent Family Bargain Centers pitch. He credits staff changes and several rehearsal sessions with an improved performance in the preliminary round of the Smith's Food and Drug effort.
At the same time, the agency recently persuaded Nike that it could reach a broader audience.
One print ad encourages black youngsters to pursue a variety of goals, warning, "Life preys on one-dimensional players." The ad ran in Ebony, Black Enterprise and several other magazines. Scott Bedbury, Nike's director of advertising, said the company wasso sure the ad would have a general appeal that it was revising its spring media plan and hoped to run the ad in Sports Illustrated.
"Where the country is heading is toward more culturally intelligent communications," he said. "You have to find ways to bring along a lot of people at one time. It's not a melting pot. It's a mixed salad. And you have to appreciate all the distinct elements."

HEADLINE: Lessons Across Six Decades As Clinton Tries to Make Jobs

SERIES: Finding What Works -- First article of a series: Federal Job Programs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Eager to put his own stamp on economic policy, President-elect Bill Clinton promises to do what every President since Franklin D. Roosevelt has done: come up with a new program to create jobs.
After President Bush took a largely passive attitude toward creating jobs -- and paid a heavy price for the sluggish economy on Nov. 3 -- Mr. Clinton has made it clear that he plans to be more aggressive. 
 Hoping to do far better than the one million jobs created under Mr. Bush, just 16,000 in private business and industry, the President-elect has said he intends to use tax credits and increased public spending on roads, airports and high-speed trains. He also promises to provide more job training and cut taxes for the middle class.
 
Judgments From the Past
 History shows that such efforts can create jobs. But they can also lead to fraud and inefficiency, and they are sometimes put in place when they are no longer needed. The record from six decades of Federal programs to create jobs leads to several conclusions.
Public works programs are a powerful tool to create jobs while also improving the nation's transportation network and competitiveness. Better highways, railroads and airports make the transportation of goods and people faster and cheaper.
One problem, however, is it sometimes takes so long to establish these programs that by the time they are put into place, the economic slump they were intended to reverse has already ended. Still, according to one study, every $1 billion spent on public works produces 25,000 construction jobs and 15,000 spillover jobs for concrete producers, tractor manufacturers, restaurants and other businesses.
Cuts in personal income taxes do in fact give the economy a quick consumer-led boost that can create tens of thousands of jobs, but they are less effective than public works at making the economy more efficient because the money gained from tax cuts does not go toward job-producing projects, like highway building.
In addition, tax cuts spur the domestic economy less today than they did decades ago because consumers now spend a large percentage of their tax-cut windfalls on imported goods like Sony televisions.
Tax credits for business investment are perhaps the quickest way to give the economy a shove forward. They also encourage investments in new equipment that raise productivity. Some economists predict that if Mr. Clinton introduces a 10 percent investment-tax credit in 1993, it will create about 400,000 jobs next year at the cost of an estimated $3.5 billion in lost tax revenue.
Because of the huge Federal budget deficit, tax cuts and public works spending are less powerful engines than in decades past because by increasing the deficit these programs help drive up long-term interest rates. And that works against the desired effect by hurting housing construction and business investment.
This principle also held true in years past, but with the Federal deficit now at record levels, the negative effects are greater than before.
Still, even with the problems, it is generally agreed that the only sure way the Federal Government can create jobs quickly is to increase the Federal deficit, either by cutting taxes or increasing spending. If a President expands public works spending by $1 billion, while at the same time cutting $1 billion in spending from other programs, the total number of jobs may not increase. After all, some jobs are certain to be lost as a result of the cuts.
 
$20 Billion for Roads
 At present, the biggest Federal job program is highway construction. It began four decades ago and was expanded greatly by last year's transportation legislation. This year the program will spend $20 billion, creating 800,000 jobs across the nation.
In New Jersey, for instance, the program has put 20,000 people to work this year, completing Interstate highways, resurfacing highways, painting bridges and building new interchanges. Indeed, at just one job site in Northern New Jersey, in and around Wanaque, the highway financing has put 1,200 people to work, building one of the final stretches of Interstate 287, a six-lane, 20-mile leg with a cost of $700 million.
Speaking about the construction industry, Thomas M. Downs, New Jersey's Commissioner of Transportation, said, "I'm not saying that public-works investment is a silver bullet, but it is helping reduce unemployment in the sector with the highest unemployment."
Liberals tend to favor such government building programs because they generally help the poor and unemployed while also addressing pressing needs, like renovating subway lines. The programs also reduce income inequality and provide on-the-job training for the unskilled.
"These programs are a success in the sense that they add to the number of jobs and have a fairly good record of not being make-work, but of getting productive things done," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But many conservatives dislike the programs, saying they bloat budget deficits and bureaucracies. They argue that the best economic stimulus is tax cuts, which allow consumers and companies to spend more, thus providing a boost to the economy.
Despite the continuing debate over Federal job-creation programs, Mr. Clinton plans to embrace a variety of them. As he does, he is likely to draw on lessons learned since the 1930's.
 
The New Deal
Deficit Spending, Money in Pockets
 President Roosevelt took office in 1933 in a time of searing despair, when one in four Americans was out of work. Desperate for a solution, he embraced the then-novel ideas of John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, and recommended increasing deficit spending to put money in people's pockets.
Soon the New Deal demonstrated for all time that government could fight a slump by putting millions of people to work. It also demonstrated that most people like living on welfare far less than holding jobs.
In 1933, Roosevelt created the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, which gave states money for relief payments and for creating jobs. Two years later, he set up the biggest New Deal program, the Works Progress Administration, later the Work Projects Administration, and within months it had employed three million Americans.
Although there were plenty of make-work projects in the New Deal's early days -- historians recall workers raking leaves from one side of the street to the other -- eventually the program improved. W.P.A. workers helped build and upgrade 2,500 hospitals, 5,900 schools, 13,000 playgrounds and 651,000 miles of roads, among other projects.
"With time, the kinds of work that was done and the efficiency with which it was done increased considerably," said Barbara Blumberg, a historian at Pace University.
Largely because of New Deal programs, the unemployment rate fell from 25 percent in 1933 to 14 percent four years later. But Roosevelt was worried about runaway deficits. So in 1937 he reduced spending on these programs, only to see the jobless rate jump back to 19 percent in 1938.
"Mr. Roosevelt was never fully committed to spending enough money to stimulate the economy sufficiently," said Eli Ginzberg, who began teaching economics at Columbia University during the Depression. "The nation didn't really recover fully until it mobilized for war."
The jobless rate was 14.5 percent in 1940, seven years after Roosevelt took office. Only after the war machine began running flat out did unemployment fall, to 4.7 percent in 1942 and 1.9 percent in 1943.
Still, the New Deal showed for the first time how effectively government programs could reduce unemployment. And with that lesson, future Presidents did not hesitate to try their own approaches.
 
Kennedy's Tax Cuts
Stirring Economy, Spurring Debate
 John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon partly because of the 1960 recession. In circumstances strikingly similar to those facing Mr. Clinton, he took office when the unemployment rate was near 7 percent.
He tried a new approach to get the economy moving: Boldly defying criticisms that he would unwisely push up the budget deficit, Kennedy was the first President to use investment-tax credits and major income-tax cuts. He showed that these tools could work.
Still, the tax credits for business investment have generated decades of debate. Some economists contend that the credits wrongly favored some types of investment, like equipment, over others, like factory buildings.
Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers was loath to recommend deficit spending and urged him to adopt the tax credit for corporate investments. In 1962, Congress approved the White House's proposal to give a 7 percent tax credit on equipment purchases.
"The investment tax credit looked like a good way to get a lot of bang for the buck," recalled James Tobin, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale University and a member of Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers.
There certainly was a bang; corporate investment in durable equipment doubled from 1962 to 1964, and employment jumped by 2.5 million.
But the President wanted to do more, hoping to reduce the jobless rate from 5.5 percent to 4 percent. So in 1963 he called for cutting income taxes as well.
Congress did not pass those cuts until 1964, after Kennedy had been assassinated. They reduced the range of personal income tax rates to 16 percent to 77 percent, down from 22 percent to 91 percent. Economic growth rose by 5.6 percent in both 1964 and 1965, and the jobless rate fell to 4 percent in 1965, causing Administration officials to congratulate themselves once again.
The Kennedy tax cuts inspired President Ronald Reagan's economic advisers, who pointed out that after the tax cuts, the Government's revenue actually increased, thanks to faster economic growth. But most economists say the main reasons tax revenue rose were inflation and and the way it pushed people into higher tax brackets.
Looking back today, some economists say Kennedy's advisers may be receiving too much credit. They say the effects of the Federal Reserve's low interest rates were overlooked at that time.
And now the wisdom of investment-tax credits is being called into question. Prof. Dale Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard University, believes they improperly skew investment toward certain areas, like machinery, and borrow from the future by moving up to today investments that would more properly have been made tomorrow.
"The Kennedy investment-tax credits did a lot of good in the early 1960's and a lot of harm at the end of the 60's," he said. When the tax credits were suspended in 1966, corporate investment slipped badly.
 
Carter's Programs
Help for Jobless, But With Catches
 When Jimmy Carter took office in 1977, he had two big economic worries: high unemployment lingering from the 1974-75 recession and severe unemployment among young blacks in cities and the rural South.
He attacked both these problems by vastly expanding the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, CETA, a Federal jobs program that was established in 1973. He doubled its size to cover 725,000 people and directed its focus to the hiring and training of the hard-core unemployed.
His efforts showed that government could provide training and valuable work experience for these generally neglected Americans. The employment act also showed that public service programs usually do more than public works spending to provide jobs for these hard-core urban unemployed. Under CETA, many people were hired as City Hall secretaries or park maintenance workers for example.
Had the same sums been spent on gleaming public works projects like highways or high-speed trains, these people would probably not have been hired because they lacked the skills and membership in the unions that often controlled the hiring.
But the act underlined the difficulties of rapidly doubling the size of a government jobs program. It was marred by accusations of fraud, nepotism and inefficiency. For example, city halls hired receptionists who sat in rooms where the phone never rang.
"CETA was a flop," argues William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, a Washington research group, and a member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. "It created jobs in the government sector where the work was of no particular value."
Some economists cite CETA, as well as an accompanying public works program, as the foremost examples of jobs programs that came too late, after economic growth had picked up. They say the Carter programs helped produce the economic overheating and double-digit inflation of the late 1970's. But Carter Administration officials say the huge increases in the prices of oil from Arab nations in 1979 caused the high inflation, not CETA.
Although Mr. Carter's Secretary of Labor, Ray Marshall, admits CETA was unwieldy and occasionally inefficient, he praised the program for helping young blacks.
"Thanks to this program, black male employment increased for the first time in the 1970's," he said in an interview.
 
Reagan's Tax Cuts
Boom Is Sparked As Debt Deepens
 President Reagan stormed into office with a mandate to cut taxes, saying this would unleash American enterprise and spur economic growth. In his first months as President, he muscled Congress into passing the largest tax cut in history, a measure that reduced taxes by $280 billion over three years and included a 20 percent cut in personal income taxes as well as a corporate income tax reduction.
Although the Federal Reserve's high interest rates pushed the nation into a deep recession soon after the tax cuts were enacted, the extra money the cuts put in people's pockets helped pave the way for an economic rebound once interest rates fell.
"The tax cuts played an important role in the long expansion that started in late 1982," argues Murray Weidenbaum, Mr. Reagan's first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
 
Which Perspective Is Right?
 A decade later, it is hard to find a dispassionate analysis of the Reagan tax cuts. Indeed, economists and politicians are still locked in a sharp ideological debate. Conservatives argue that the cuts lifted the economy by encouraging companies to invest more and people to work harder. In their view, the cuts helped produce 17 million new jobs in Mr. Reagan's two terms.
But Democratic economists heartily disagree. They note that the Reagan tax cuts did not, as promised, generate enough growth and tax revenue to prevent the deficit from ballooning.
And they say the main reason revenue did not increase as much as taxes were cut, as had happened under President Kennedy, was that the Reagan tax cuts were so much deeper.
These Democratic economists also assert that the tax cuts merely stimulated the economy in the old Keynesian way: generating growth by increasing the Government's deficit.
The truth probably lies somewhere in between. The tax cuts did stimulate consumers to buy more and businesses to invest more. Still, investment increased less than had been predicted and remained weak, compared with both Japan and Germany.
As for the 17 million new jobs created in the Reagan years, Democratic economists argue that they were created mainly because so many baby boomers entered the labor force and so many wives found jobs to supplement their husbands' stagnating incomes.
Whatever the effect of the Reagan tax cuts in the early 80's, most economists agree they have undercut growth late in the last decade and in the early 1990's. By the late 80's the cuts, combined with stepped-up military spending, had created annual deficits of close to $200 billion, leading to high long-term interest rates that dampen business investment and home building.
"Yes, they helped move the economy up" in the early 80's, said Charles L. Schultze, chairman of President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers. "But they did that with far too much consumption and far too little investment needed to prepare America for the future."
With its focus on increasing investment, the program that President-elect Clinton has outlined is in many ways a reaction to the perceived shortcomings of the Reagan tax cuts.
By calling for investment-tax credits, investment in public works and carefully monitored job training at the same time, Mr. Clinton hopes to improve on the job creation experiences of all the Presidents since Roosevelt.

HEADLINE: FRENCH NOW AGREE THEY LACK A VETO OVER FARMING PACT

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 23

 BODY:
France acknowledged today that it had no legal authority to veto a farm trade agreement between the European Community and the United States, but insisted it did have the right to block community acceptance of a broader global trade agreement.
The fear of a French veto had hung over the farm agreement reached Friday after Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson, and then Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, called the compromise unacceptable. While neither official referred to a veto, the harsh remarks were interpreted by some trade officials and many journalists as a threat of such action. 
 Mr. Beregovoy then said, in a television interview on Sunday, that "as a very last resort" France would examine its veto options.
 
Veto Is Limited
 But today Government officials detailed the technicalities of the approval process, acknowledging that Paris could veto only a formal legal instrument presented by the community's executive commission -- and that this was not the case with the farm compromise reached with Washington.
Rather, France, like all other members of the European Community, would have the authority to block the community's acceptance of the broad trade accord that 108 countries have been trying to negotiate since 1986.
But political and trade experts here do not believe France would dare stand alone against so many nations, rejecting an accord that is expected to stimulate world trade and economic growth, and along the way helping nonfarming sectors of the French economy. Indeed, the European Community is unlikely to agree to any final pact without France's assurance that it will go along.
France's bitter opposition to the farm compromise is based on its belief that its farmers are being asked to make sacrifices beyond those the community agreed to in May, when it overhauled its common agricultural policy. Any agreement with the United States, it insists, must be compatible with this reform.
The community's 17-member executive commission is to meet Wednesday in Brussels to study the agreement, but most experts believe it will reject the French argument by concluding that the deal conforms with last spring's reform of the common agricultural policy. This ruling would in turn permit resumption of the broader talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Until today, the public impression formed by news coverage of the last few days was that France had a veto option in the Council of Ministers, the community's most powerful institution, which comprises the foreign ministers of the 12 member states.
Each nation has the right to veto on the ground of vital national interest a formal proposal from the European Commission. While it has rarely been exercised, this right of veto became the subject of much discussion among Government officials after the compromise was reached on Friday.
 
Weekend of Study
 But after a weekend of closer study of the somewhat arcane details of the trade compromise and the community's procedures of governance, government officials in France and other community states agreed today that the veto could not be used against the disputed farm trade agreement, because the deal would not be presented to the Council of Ministers as a formal proposal.
In their comments today, French officials stressed their commitment to the broad agreement being negotiated under the GATT auspices. French officials have noted that agriculture is only one part of a future pact that would also liberalize trade in services, telecommunications and textiles and establish new rules governing intellectual property.
After being held up for months by the disagreement over farm subsidies, the GATT talks are officially scheduled to resume on Thursday in Geneva, although informal meetings of trade officials began there today. Negotiators and officials in many Western capitals are optimistic that an agreement might be reached before the end of the year.
In Washington, a senior American official said it was conceivable that the basic text of a world trade agreement could be reached by the end of December. But he cautioned that detailed timetables would still have to be worked out next year for each country's tariff reductions for thousands of different products.
But whatever its willingness to work toward a broad trade settlement, France still has the problem of finding a face-saving device that will enable it to accept a GATT accord without further enraging its one million farmers -- all in the run-up to parliamentary elections in March.
Looking for a strong political mandate for further negotiations at the European Community, the Socialist Government of President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Beregovoy hopes to win endorsement of this position when the National Assembly debates the farm trade agreement on Wednesday.
With no apparent interest in threatening the GATT talks, Prime Minister Beregovoy has appealed for the "solidarity" and "understanding" of other community countries, asking them to acknowledge France's "particular situation" as Europe's largest food producer and exporter.
This "particular situation" will be all too apparent on Wednesday, when tens of thousands of angry farmers converge on Paris to coincide with the National Assembly debate on the farm trade agreement. Already they have organized anti-American protests outside McDonald's restaurants and a Coca-Cola bottling plant.
 
Could Gain Advantages
 French Government officials said that in order to be able to appease the country's farmers and present the farm trade pact as compatible with the community's common agricultural policy France might have to extract new -- still undefined -- farming concessions from its partners.
On the other hand, France has until now focused its attention overwhelmingly on the agricultural dispute. The Government should soon be able to point out the advantages that a possible GATT accord will bring to the French economy as a whole. Already, in fact, some officials have reminded the farmers that many French businessmen support an early GATT agreement.
France is the world's second-largest exporter of services, after the United States, and stands to benefit from a pact that would extend free-trade rules to services for the first time.

HEADLINE: Delay in Hanoi Ties Is Sought

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
As the United States and Vietnam take tentative steps toward ending their 17-year diplomatic and economic separation, groups of veterans and relatives of military personnel missing in Southeast Asia have begun a battle to delay the reconciliation.
For the moment, their target is Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. 
 Mr. Kerry just completed a five-day trip to Southeast Asia, where he praised the Vietnamese for their cooperation in helping to determine what happened to the 2,265 Americans whose fate during the Vietnam War has never been determined.
 
Suggests Easing of Embargo
 In response to what he considers unprecedented Vietnamese cooperation, Mr. Kerry said at a news conference today that the United States should show its good will by easing its trade embargo against Vietnam.
But fearful that photographs of Vietnamese officials' turning over helmets, wallets, diaries and other personal effects to Mr. Kerry will lead to an impression of Vietnamese compliance and a rush to normalize ties, a group of advocates have tried to discredit him.
Leaders of these organizations today accused Mr. Kerry, who served in Vietnam, of coaching witnesses who appeared before his committee in an effort to discredit satellite photographs these advocates say prove that Americans are still being held in Laos.
"The Vietnam veterans and family members feel we have been betrayed by Senator John Kerry," said Thomas Burch, leader of the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition.
The allegations are not new -- and have been denied by Mr. Kerry -- and the groups making them are considered by some in the P.O.W.-M.I.A. movement to be more on the fringe. But that does not mean other more mainstream groups do not view with alarm Mr. Kerry's actions and reports that the Administration may move to build closer relations with Vietnam.
Last week, Roger A. Munson, national commander of the American Legion, wrote to Mr. Bush to urge him to "hold the line" on favorable actions toward Vietnam. Legion officers say that although the Vietnamese have released thousands of photographs and other artifacts and allowed committee aides to interview some soldiers who fought in the war, the increased cooperation has only led to possible identification of a handful of servicemen.
Without the threat of the continued trade embargo prodding them, Legion officials say, the Vietnamese will have no incentive to continue to cooperate.
"We feel lifting the trade embargo is going to far," said John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion. "It's the only leverage we have to resolve the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin to Keep Military Budget At Same Level

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 23

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told his top military leaders today that he would keep the total military budget at last year's level, but would increase spending on arms and equipment 10 percent.
That plan presumably offered a measure of reassurance to the armed forces, which have been disoriented and demoralized by the collapse of the Soviet Union and a radical drop in military spending. But Mr. Yeltsin also assailed the officers for moving far too slowly in reorganizing and reducing the vast Soviet military machine, and he demanded that they crack down on arms pilferage and corruption. 
 Mr. Yeltsin was flanked at the meeting of the Collegium of the Defense Ministry, the council of senior commanders, by Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, an air force general; Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, Speaker of Parliament, and Cabinet members.
 
2 U.S. Senators Entice Ukraine
 The unusual show of unity among political leaders more usually mired in power struggles was obviously intended to demonstrate to the military men that the entire civilian leadership was firmly behind Mr. Yeltsin.
Also in connection with the military, two American senators who have been inquiring into compliance with strategic-arms agreements said they had offered incentives to Ukraine to ratify the Start treaty and begin transferring its strategic missiles to Russia.
Senators Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said at a news conference that while they were in Kiev last weekend they assured the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, that his country would receive $100 million to $150 million of the $800 million appropriated in the so-called Nunn-Lugar amendment to assist former Soviet republics with disarmament.
The four former republics with strategic missiles -- Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- all agreed last summer to abide by the Start agreement. The Soviet Union signed the agreement shortly before its collapse.
The pact calls for a one-third cut in strategic arsenals. But in recent weeks Ukraine has been threatening to hold on to its 176 nuclear missiles, unless it receives what it deems adequate compensation and security guarantees.
 
An Offer of U.S. Guarantees
 Mr. Nunn and Mr. Lugar sought to satisfy Kiev's demands, offering to seek American guarantees of Ukrainian security and outlining plans to buy enriched uranium from the dismantled weapons over the next 20 years for up to $5 billion. But Mr. Nunn said they had also warned Ukraine that its economic cooperation with the West "depended on keeping commitments."
Western diplomats expect Mr. Kravchuk to present Start to Parliament for ratification in two months.
Addressing the Defense Ministry, Mr. Yeltsin gave no specific financing levels, which in any event would be meaningless, given the high level of inflation. The meeting was closed, and the reports over Tass and the evening news program on television gave no indication of officers' reactions.
Although maintaining spending levels may seem generous, the officers are likely to have mixed reactions. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union a year ago, the military has been carved up among various republics and has lost all but a fraction of the enormous privileges it enjoyed in the highly militarized Soviet state. Spending on arms and equipment has dropped 70 percent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Returns to the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Ga., Nov. 23

 BODY:
In an apparently welcome distraction from the rigors of creating a new government, President-elect Bill Clinton returned to the campaign trail today to stump for Senator Wyche Fowler Jr. on the eve of a bitter runoff election.
After three weeks of security briefings and juggling names of Cabinet appointees, Mr. Clinton appeared to enjoy reprising his familiar role as campaigner. At his first stop, in Macon, he even picked up a saxophone and joined the Central High School Sugar Bear Band in the pop tune "Hey, Baby." 
 In a sign that Mr. Clinton will probably never cease campaigning, at each of the two stops he lingered long after most people had gone, as if he were still trying to win over every last voter. The music of Fleetwood Mac, plainly more his style than Mr. Fowler's, blared in the background. And in another familiar refrain, Mr. Clinton attacked the evils of "trickle-down economics."
 
Striking a Victory Pose
 Absent, though, were the hoarse voice, the attacks on President Bush and the relentless round-the-clock schedule of Mr. Clinton's own campaign. The pace of this first post-election campaign swing was decidedly more Presidential: one rally in Macon, one in Albany, then back home to Little Rock, Ark., by dinnertime.
Their hands clasped in a victory pose, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Fowler presented themselves as outsiders at both stops, declaring that together they would work to break the political stalemate in the nation's capital.
"We stood for ending politics as usual in Washington," Mr. Clinton told the crowd in Albany. "For breaking the gridlock, for breaking the stranglehold of the special interests, for ending the dominance of negative politics. That's what Wyche Fowler stands for. That's why I want him to be elected tomorrow. So we can do those things you elected me to do."
While Mr. Clinton seemed in his element today as he was surrounded by red, white and blue bunting and marching bands, his advisers had disagreed over whether he should risk political capital on Mr. Fowler's race, particularly since the Senator did little to campaign for the Democratic ticket. But as he readies his legislative package, Mr. Clinton dearly wants to keep Mr. Fowler's seat to stave off Republican attempts to thwart his proposals, so it was decided that the possible political benefits outweighed the drawbacks.
Republicans have also pulled out the stops here, sending Barbara Bush, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and just about every big name save Mr. Bush to make a pitch for the challenger, Paul D. Coverdell, who received 48 percent of the vote on Nov. 3, one percentage point less than Mr. Fowler. Since a third candidate prevented either from winning more than 50 percent, Georgia's election law called for a runoff between the two top candidates.
Each camp has said that the outcome will hinge on the turnout on Tuesday, with Mr. Fowler concerned that his core Democratic base will not be as eager to return to the polls as Mr. Coverdell's Republican supporters.
If elected to a second term, Mr. Fowler pledged that he would be at Mr. Clinton's "side whenever he needs me," adding, "We share with him the hopes for our country and our people."
While he stood stiffly behind Mr. Clinton as the incoming Chief Executive spoke at both events, Mr. Fowler was clearly buoyed by the attention. "I could not be even more grateful, or more humble," he told the crowd in Macon, "by the fact that Bill Clinton came to Georgia in my behalf today. I want to say to him standing by my side, that there are better things for him to be doing today."
 
Clinton to Visit Reagan
 Except for a passing remark by Mr. Clinton that "two thinking people will always disagree," there was no mention that the two Democrats have parted ways on issues like the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, which Mr. Fowler voted for.
Today was Mr. Clinton's last scheduled trip beyond Little Rock until the day after Thanksgiving, when he plans to spend the holiday weekend at the Southern California retreat of his friends, the television producers Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. In an effort to shed his partisanship, Mr. Clinton, in his first stop in Century City in Los Angeles on Friday, will call on former President Ronald Reagan.
"We asked for the meeting," said Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary. "Clinton thought that it would be interesting. He believes there's a lot to be learned from someone who sat in that chair."
Mr. Clinton could not leave here before making yet another concession to his instincts as a candidate. As his motorcade wended through a rundown, predominantly black neighborhood, Mr. Clinton dived out of his limousine, shook hands with residents and caused quite a commotion.

HEADLINE: Kohl Silently Avoiding a Conflict With Mitterrand on Trade Accord

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 23

 BODY:
With French opposition to the agricultural compromise reached by Europe and the United States threatening to split the European Community, one key voice has been conspicuously silent, that of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
Mr. Kohl has chosen not to weigh in publicly, though he authorized his Government spokesman last week to issue a ringing endorsement of the agreements between community and American negotiators on reducing European subsidies to grain and oilseed farmers. Today his trade and agriculture ministers publicly supported it with equally unmistakable enthusiasm, leaving no one in any real doubt about where the Chancellor stood. 
 The German strategy, if that is what Mr. Kohl's silence represents, is apparently to hope that President Francois Mitterrand of France will settle for some kind of additional compensation by the European Community to French farmers and then endorse the accord.
If Germany ended up having to pay a few billion marks toward such compensation, some of its officials say, it would be worth it, because a global trade accord could do more than anything else to avert a worldwide recession. Germany last year exported $576 billion of goods and services, more than any other country but the United States.
 
Economy Needs 'Impulse'
 "Especially in the present critical phase, the world economy and the German economy as well urgently need a positive impulse," Dieter Vogel, the German Government spokesman, said after the agreement was announced on Friday. "The German Government therefore welcomes the agreement achieved between the E.C. Commission and the United States."
French officials acknowledged today that they do not hold veto power over the farm compromise, only over a broader world trade agreement that 108 nations are trying to negotiate now that the farm impasse has been broken. And they are unlikely to do that, with so much at stake -- a pact that is expected to stimulate world trade and economic growth and benefit the service industry and other non-farming sectors of France.
But with strong opposition from French farmers and with his Socialist Party facing almost certain defeat in legislative elections in March, Mr. Mitterrand he has been careful not to box himself in.
German officials say Mr. Kohl has not spoken with Mr. Mitterrand about trade issues since the European Community summit meeting in Birmingham, England, more than five weeks ago.
 
Appeals to Kohl
 Mr. Kohl's community partners, and American officials as well, have often called upon the Chancellor to use his personal and political leverage with Mr. Mitterrand to urge him to find a way to leave with a farm compromise. But the Chancellor has consistently chosen not to do so, perhaps so as not to force Mr. Mitterrand's back to the wall.
Mr. Kohl's silence allows the fundamental disagreement between French and German domestic political interests to be played out at lower levels in the bureaucracy, and enables him to wait out the crisis and avoid permanent damage to the French-German relationship, German officials say.
It is a risky gamble to expect Mr. Mitterrand to put European interests ahead of his party's political survival -- not the kind of gamble Mr. Kohl has ever rushed into, either.
The German Industry and Trade Council, the leading industrial lobby, called on the Government today to use "all its political weight" to bring about French concessions, because the whole of world trade was at stake.
But the Chancellor likes to keep his options open. For the moment, he does not have to choose between the French-German axis that props up the European Community and the wider interests of world trade, and he clearly hopes he will never have to.
Already at Birmingham on Oct. 16, Germany was ready to accept an agreement with the United States on oilseeds that did not include subsequent American concessions now in the draft accord.
"The agreement that has been sketched out does not suit France," Mr. Mitterrand said then. Mr. Kohl was low key, commenting, "All I can say is that the President of France, like me, voted to continue the negotiations."
Before the negotiations broke down, one German official said: "We'd be glad to sign an agreement now. We know we'll never get a better one."
 
Crucial for Mitterrand
 Explaining why the Germans felt they could not put the muscle on the French, this official said, "Mr. Mitterrand has made it clear that this is a vital question of political survival for him."
Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, also spoke with understanding about the French predicament. Eighty percent of France's farmers, Mr. Kinkel said, had voted in September against a referendum on the treaty on European political and monetary union signed in Maastricht, the Netherlands, a year ago.
The French farmers were already angry about the concessions made to American desires to reduce European agricultural subsidies on exports, Mr. Kinkel said, and Mr. Mitterrand could hardly be eager to provoke them further.
European unity has already been severely shaken this year by economic strains and by second thoughts in Denmark and Britain about the Maastricht treaty, which will not go into effect as originally scheduled on Jan. 1 because they will not have ratified it by then.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
American Express Sets A 1-2 Punch

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
ONLY a month after unexpectedly turning its agency lineup upside-down, the American Express Company is aggressively intensifying advertising for its charge cards as its agency, Ogilvy & Mather New York, delivers to consumers and retailers a sharply competitive one-two punch.
One punch comes from the first major endorsement by the comedian Jerry Seinfeld, star of the eponymous sitcom on NBC. In commercials that began running Saturday in seven large markets, including Los Angeles and New York, Mr. Seinfeld, in his characteristic edgy persona as a commentator on life's irksome annoyances, mocks rival credit cards, like Visa, issued by banks. 
 In one of the spots, which run through the crucial Christmas shopping season, he spouts a series of puns to a goldfish about "drowning in debt," a situation he attributes to "banks charging up to 19 percent interest on our credit cards." In another, he urges a man shopping in a haberdashery to "stick with the American Express card -- no interest, no revolving debt."
The other punch comes from a television campaign celebrating service establishments that accept American Express cards, which is being expanded into radio and print. Those advertisements, featuring proprietors of businesses like Toys "R" Us and the Union Square Cafe, are intended to burnish the card's image as a prestigious product.
"I think we've got a pretty good balance now," Aldo Papone, senior adviser to American Express in New York, said yesterday. In both cases, he added, the strategy was to use "a credible third-party source" to promote the cards, whether a restaurateur like Harry Cipriani or a comedian like Mr. Seinfeld.
Yet Spencer Nilson, publisher of an influential credit-card industry newsletter, questions the first punch.
Attacking bank cards is "a losing proposition, a really dumb idea," he said in a telephone interview from Santa Monica, Calif., where he publishes The Nilson Report. "They are off on the wrong foot again."
Though Visa has successfully belittled American Express in a long-running campaign by BBDO New York, Mr. Nilson objected to any retaliation. Data indicate that the one-third of Americans paying high interest rates on bank charges cards "could care less" about the cost, he said, while almost another one-third pay interest rates below 16 percent.
Rather, Mr. Nilson said, the "only avenue" American Express can successfully pursue "is to treat itself as something special."
"While prestige is nowhere as important as it used to be," he added, "it still appeals to a segment of the population."
Mr. Nilson also dislikes the use of Mr. Seinfeld as "a spokesman for a prestige card, because he doesn't have that image," he said, adding," He's a comic."
But Rochelle Lazarus, president at Ogilvy New York, said that Mr. Seinfeld's forte at "observing the absurdity going on around him" made him "a terrific choice."
"I don't think American Express could stand up and say 'Isn't this ridiculous?' " she added. "But he can."
American Express cards in force in America fell by 1.4 million, to about 24.6 million, from the third quarter of last year through this year's third quarter, according to Nilson Report figures -- the first such decline since the card was introduced. (By comparison, Visa had 146.1 million American cards in force and Mastercard 94.4 million.)
That was believed to be a primary reason why American Express last month unexpectedly dismissed Chiat/Day in New York, which it had hired only 11 months earlier to supplant Ogilvy New York, its agency since 1963, in handling the most prestigious portion of its $60 million charge-card account.
While Chiat/Day worked on a new campaign to improve the card's image, Ogilvy New York retained more mundane responsibilities like the service-establishment account, then shrewdly rebuilt ties to the client by pouring resources into that campaign. Though initially a test limited to three cities, American Express was pleased enough with results to expand it nationally, dismiss Chiat/ Day and discontinue Chiat/Day's campaign.
The Chiat/Day work, which presented American Express cards as oversized icons, somewhat incongruously bashed banks' cards while simultaneously trying to polish the American Express image; now those two messages are being delivered equally but separately.
If the wry, iconoclastic Mr. Seinfeld seems an unlikely endorser, it should be noted that his colleague in angst-ridden urban humor, the comedian Richard Lewis, pitches Boku citrus drinks in commercials that were created by Noble & Associates in Chicago.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New 2-Year U.S. Notes Sell Well

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market received a lift yesterday from a successful Treasury auction of two-year notes, but prices were still down and yields up for the day.
Trading was very thin in the beginning of this holiday week. The market will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving Day, and the Public Securities Association has recommended that trading end at 1 P.M. on Wednesday and Friday. 
 "We're really in a state of gridlock," said Matthew Alexy, government-trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation. "Information gridlock and market gridlock."
 
Report on Deficit
 While there was little news yesterday, a report by the Treasury that the Federal budget deficit in October, at $48.9 billion, was higher than many analysts had expected did not help.
In trading in the secondary market for outstanding issues, the price of the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was down 5/32 to yield 7.54 percent, up from 7.52 percent Friday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. Earlier in the day, the price of the bond was off 8/32 .
Prices were also off for Treasury notes, and the discount rates on Treasury bills rose. In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market, the five-year note that will be auctioned today was trading at a yield of 6.10 percent, up from 6.08 percent on Friday.
 
Comparing Yields
 That the auction of $15 billion in 4.625 percent two-year notes went well could be seen by comparing the note's yield in the pre-auction market and the high yield in the auction, which was held at noon.
Just before noon, the pre-auction yield was 4.74 percent. The high yield in the auction was 4.72 percent, and the median yield bid was 4.70 percent. These lower auction yields showed there was more demand for the two-year note than dealers had expected.
In addition, by late afternoon, the yield was down to 4.68 percent, a drop of 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the high yield at the auction. Traders said some dealers probably underestimated the demand, did not get any two-year notes in the auction and had to buy them afterward in the open market.
 
Foreign Bonds
 The renewed tensions in currency markets took their toll on European bond markets yesterday.
In some markets, traders and investors were disappointed that the two currency realignments over the weekend -- the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo by 6 percent -- did not lead to a cut in interest rates by the German Bundesbank. In other markets, investors decided that interest rates would not be able to fall further soon because the reduction might weaken currency values.
In France, there is concern that the devaluations in Spain and Portugal will prompt a renewed attack on the French franc. The franc withstood a rush of selling during the September currency crisis that led to the withdrawal of the Italian lira and the British pound from the European Monetary System. Traders said that foreign investors were selling French bonds because of this new uncertainty.
Investors also seemed to be worried because of France's opposition to the European trade agreement reached Friday with the United States on oilseed subsidies. The opposition of the French Government to the pact is leaving it in a more isolated position in Europe and could make the franc appear more vulnerable, traders said.
In French trading, the 10-year bond future for December delivery was down 0.68 point, to 111.02. In another measure of pressure in the bond market, the spread between the yield on the French 8.25 percent 10-year bond due in 2002 and the German bond due in 2002 rose to 87 basis points, from 72 basis points on Friday.
In Germany, bond prices rose early on hopes that the devaluations would lead to a further cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank. But by later in the day, that hope was given up and bonds ended unchanged.
The 10-year German bond was at 99.78 in late trading to yield 7.29 percent, the same as on Friday. But in earlier trading, the price of the bond was up to 99.90.
In London, traders said that investors were slowly coming to the realization that interest rates in Britain would not fall as fast as had been hoped. Since September, the British minimum lending rate has dropped to 7 percent from 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Nations Chide U.S. for Low Taxes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Exasperated with the failure of the United States to reduce its budget deficit, an organization representing 24 industrial nations said today in an unusually blunt report that the American Government must consider increasing taxes. It suggested a 25-cent-a-gallon increase in the tax on gasoline and a 5 percent national sales tax.
The report, issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the Federal deficit of nearly $300 billion threatened to push up interest rates around the world as well as undermine the American Government's plans to increase investment. 
 "Solutions to the U.S. budget situation are readily found," the organization said, adopting an almost scolding tone. "What is required is the will to implement them."
One economist who worked on the report said in an interview, "We have been delivering this message for many years, and we're becoming a bit fed up."
Without referring specifically to President-elect Bill Clinton or any of his plans, the organization said the Government should not increase deficit spending to lift the sagging economy even though it expects economic growth to pick up only modestly next year. Mr. Clinton's advisers say they do not rule out using increased deficit spending to spur the economy if it remains weak in January. They believethat it might be more important to concentrate on accelerating growth before reducing the deficit.
But in its annual review of the American economy, the organization said, "There is no scope for any fiscal stimulus without compromising all pretense of controlling the Federal budget deficit in the near future."
The O.E.C.D. is a Paris-based group of 24 wealthy nations, including the United States, Japan and most Western European nations. Officials involved in writing the report said it expressed a majority view.
Richard Myers, a Treasury Department spokesman, said that the economy was starting to turn around and that the Bush Administration had made every effort to block legislation that would have ill effects on the deficit. Administration officials told the O.E.C.D. that they had ruled out new taxes and were trying to reduce the deficit through spending cuts.
The report forecast that the United States economy would grow by a modest 2.3 percent next year, up slightly from the 2 percent expected for this year and hardly enough to cut unemployment. The report said that the jobless rate would be 7.5 percent at the end of next year, up from 7.4 percent at present, as greater optimism causes many more people to begin looking for jobs.
The report said the budget deficit was a major factor behind the slow growth in living standards in the United States. It asserted that the Government used far too much money for current consumption, like Medicare, that would be better used in investments to build a more productive, more efficient nation.
"The most direct contribution government policy can make to insure future living standards is to address the persistent problem of the Federal budget deficit," the report said.
 
Biggest Deficit
 The report said that Federal, state and local taxes in the United States represented a lower share of gross domestic product than in all of the 23 other industrial nations except Turkey. America's budget deficit is the largest in absolute terms and one of the largest as a percentage of gross domestic product.
According to the report, if the United States increases investment while the deficit remains high, it will have to borrow increasingly from abroad. Economists say America's demand for foreign capital pushes up interest rates worldwide and eats up investment money badly needed by the third world and former Soviet bloc.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Europe's Monetary System Is Staring at Another Crisis

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Europe's monetary system looked more shaky than ever today as governments and central banks battled to head off another full-fledged currency crisis.
Spain, Ireland and Norway all raised interest rates today to bolster their currencies, and Denmark said it would raise rates if necessary. There was even some pressure on currencies generally considered strong. The Bank of France, for example, felt compelled to intervene in the markets to support the franc. 
 The European Community sought to ease the strains in the system on Sunday by devaluing the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo. But the continuing vulnerability today of a number of currencies and the defensive measures adopted by central banks illustrated the skittishness that is gripping the currency markets.
The European nations also received confirmation today that they should not look for relief anytime soon from high German interest rates. German officials said they had explicitly rejected calls over the weekend for a realignment of currencies to be accompanied by a rate cut by the Bundesbank.
Germany "will not allow pressure to be brought on Germany to cut interest rates in connection with the realignment," Horst Kohler, the German finance secretary, told reporters in Brussels.
The prospect of turmoil among the European currencies touched off considerable buying of the dollar again today among investors who viewed the United States currency as a safe haven. After surging early in the day against the German mark, the dollar eased somewhat and closed in London at 1.6015 marks, down from 1.6100 marks at the opening but up from 1.5930 marks at the close on Friday.
Economists said that if currency speculators forced additional devaluations or pushed more nations out of the monetary system altogether, it would badly undermine whatever credibility the system had left.
The monetary system, which was designed as a precursor to European monetary union and which only a few months ago was a centerpiece of European cooperation, was first battered by waves of speculative selling in September. Britain and Italy, unable to defend the values of their currencies, were forced at that time to withdraw entirely from the system of semi-fixed exchange rates.
The latest upheaval in the markets could hasten the end of the system, economists said.
Although none of the currencies fell drastically today, analysts said that pressure from speculators would probably continue and that the weapons available to central banks to fight back would be limited. Most European nations are facing economic slowdowns or recessions, restricting their ability to raise interest rates.
"The history of fixed exchange rate systems is that they give way under the pressure of prolonged recessions," said David Morrison, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in London.
Central banks can seek to support their currencies by buying them on the open market, but September's crisis showed just how quickly foreign exchange reserves can be exhausted in the face of huge speculative capital flows.
As part of its agreement to devalue the peseta on Sunday by 6 percent, Spain also dropped restrictions on the ability of speculators to move funds in and out of the country.
 But having dropped the capital controls, Spain immediately raised a key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 13.75 percent, to support the currency.

Dollar Mixed; Gold Off
By The Associated Press
The dollar settled mixed yesterday in lackluster trading on world currency markets.
Trading was light, with Japanese markets closed for a holiday. The dollar advanced in Europe, but gave up those gains when trading shifted to the United States.
Meanwhile, gold prices settled mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $334.40 a troy ounce, off 80 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped $1 an ounce, to a late bid price of $334.25.
In New York yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.5970 German marks, down from 1.6050. Earlier in Europe, the dollar had risen to 1.6025 German marks from 1.5970.
In New York, the dollar settled at 124.05 yen, down from 124.35 yen on Friday. In London, the dollar closed at 124.15 yen, down from 124.35 yen late Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5185, from $1.5220 late Friday. But in New York it cost $1.5220 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.5120.

HEADLINE: Roy Acuff, 89, Singer, Dies; The King of Country Music

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Roy Acuff, the singer and fiddler who was known to millions of Grand Ole Opry listeners as the King of Country Music, died yesterday at Baptist Hospital in Nashville. He was 89 years old.
He died of congestive heart failure, a hospital statement said. 
 Mr. Acuff, in his six decades as an entertainer, became known for his virtuosity on the yo-yo, his collection of handpainted ties and his ability to balance a fiddle bow on his nose. But he was first and last a "hillbilly music" traditionalist.
He performed his best-known songs, "Wabash Cannonball," "The Great Speckled Bird" and "The Precious Jewel," with an acoustic string band and sang in the white-gospel tenor style he had learned while listening to Baptist services performed by his father in the mountains of Tennessee.
 
Co-Founder of a Company
 The climb of Mr. Acuff, particularly after he joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, also coincided with country's shift from string-band and vocal-harmony music to a style dominated by solo singers with bands.
"I like to think I was the first person to bring voice to the Opry," Mr. Acuff once said. "I was one of the first fellows who reared back and hit a microphone with a strong voice."
Mr. Acuff was a power in the country-music business; the character played by Henry Gibson in Robert Altman's film "Nashville," Haven Hamilton, was said to have been modeled in part on Mr. Acuff's career. He was the host on weekly Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, and he founded the Acuff-Rose Publishing Company, the world's leading country-music publisher, with the songwriter Fred Rose in 1942.
Roy Claxton Acuff was born Sept. 15, 1903, in Maynardsville, Tenn., 24 miles east of Knoxville in the Great Smoky Mountains. His father, Neill, was a farmer, lawyer, preacher and amateur fiddle player, and Roy began singing in church. The family moved to Knoxville, where Roy became a star athlete in high school and played semiprofessional baseball and basketball after graduation. He eventually tried out for the New York Yankees.
 
Skillet Lickers to Crackerjacks
 But in 1929, Mr. Acuff suffered a series of sunstrokes and gave up his athletic career. He spent much of the next two years indoors, listening to the music of Fiddlin' John Carson and Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers and practicing on a fiddle his mother had given him. Mr. Acuff joined Doc Hauer's Medicine Show in the spring of 1932, and after a season hawking Moc-a-Tan elixir he left to form his own group, the Tennessee Crackerjacks.
As their popularity grew, Mr. Acuff's group renamed itself the Crazy Tennesseeans. They made their first recordings, including "The Great Speckled Bird," in 1936. Their Grand Ole Opry debut in 1938 generated bagfuls of listener mail, and Mr. Acuff was invited to appear regularly provided the band changed its name to something more decorous. As Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys, they began to reach a national audience.
Mr. Acuff scored his biggest hits as the 30's ended, including "Wabash Cannonball," featuring a train-whistle imitation Mr. Acuff had perfected while working as a call boy on the Lousville & Nashville Railroad; "Wreck on the Highway"; "Night Train to Memphis," and "Pins and Needles."
 
Defeated for Governor
 He was given a starring spot on the coast-to-coast Saturday night Opry broadcasts on NBC radio, and during the 40's he acted in nine films for Republic Studios, including the 1940 "Grand Ole Opry." During World War II, Mr. Acuff toured the world to entertain the troops, further expanding the country audience. He was one of the first country musicians to appear on television.
In 1943, Gov. Prentice Cooper of Tennessee declared that country music was "disgracing the state"; Mr. Acuff was entered as a protest candidate in both the Democratic and Republican gubernatorial primaries of 1944 but chose not to run. Four years later, however, he became the Republican candidate for Governor, with a platform based on the Golden Rule and the Ten Commandments.
"If they don't work in the Capitol, then I don't want to be Governor," he said. He was defeated 2 to 1.
Through the 50's, Mr. Acuff recorded for Okeh, Columbia, Decca, M-G-M, Capitol and finally Hickory Records, which he and Mr. Rose owned. He also continued to be the host of Grand Ole Opry broadcasts and to tour extensively. By 1962, when Mr. Acuff became the first living member elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame, he had sold more than 25 million records.
 
Gave Nixon Yo-Yo
 In 1965, Mr. Acuff suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident. Although he stayed with the Opry, he cut back his touring schedule and spent more time working on a country-music museum and instrument collection, which is now at Opryland U.S.A. During the Vietnam War he again entertained troops overseas.
Despite his distaste for hippies, Mr. Acuff joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band for its 1972 tribute to mountain music, "Will the Circle Be Unbroken." In 1973, Mr. Acuff became the oldest performer to have a record on the popularity charts, with "Back in the Country." When the Opry moved from downtown Nashville to more modern quarters in Opryland in 1974, Mr. Acuff was the host of the opening-night ceremonies and presented President Richard M. Nixon with a souvenir yo-yo.
Mr. Acuff recorded less frequently through the 70's, although Elektra Records rereleased some of his Hickory Recordings late in the decade and Columbia Records released "Historic Edition," a collection of his hits, in 1985. Despite failing eyesight and hearing, he continued to perform at the Opry nearly every weekend.
In 1990, Mr. Acuff and other Opry stars went to Houston to entertain President Bush and other dignitaries at an economic summit meeting.
He received many awards during his lifetime. In December 1991, Mr. Acuff was honored during a televised ceremony at the Kennedy Center in Washington for his contribution to the performing arts. Among his other honors were the National Medal of Art in July 1991 and a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987 from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization that presents the Grammy awards.
Mr. Acuff's wife, Mildred, died in 1981. He is survived by a son, Roy Neill Acuff.

HEADLINE: Ethicists Struggle to Judge the 'Value' of Life

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
LOIS HOYT, who has liver and colon cancer, has decided that enough is enough. She told her doctor that she does not want any operations or chemotherapy or radiation treatments, even though they could prolong her life. Her doctor, she said, agreed. "He just said, 'Don't do anything too hastily,' " Mrs. Hoyt said.
But the 75-year-old Mrs. Hoyt, whose health care is paid for by Medicare, had a choice to accept or refuse treatment. In refusing, she said, she expects to savor her remaining time and die in her four-poster bed in her Manhattan apartment. 
 Health-care experts, however, say that the era when doctors offer most insured patients the most expensive, aggressive treatments is fast coming to an end. Rationing is looming, they say. And, bowing to the inevitable, economists are seizing upon a scale that many say is the best available to rank treatments.
The scale is called quality-adjusted life years, or QALY's (pronounced QUAL-eez). It measures the all but unmeasurable, the true value of treatments in terms of not just prolonged life but quality of life.
Although no one thinks QALY's are the perfect measurement, economists and ethicists say it, or something very much like it, will almost certainly be used soon to rank treatments in the United States.
Health planners in Toronto, Australia and New Zealand are already using QALY's to develop lists ranking health-care services, said Dr. Robert Kaplan, a researcher at the University of California in San Diego.
 
A Way to Ration
 QALY's provide answers to questions like, If money is limited, is it a better value to pay for a hip replacement, a coronary artery bypass operation or a kidney transplant?
"I think we definitely will go this way for the simple reason that we must ration health care," said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a health-care economist at Princeton University.
Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, agreed. "QALY's are inevitable," he said.
Even some experts who do not think that QALY's need to be used on all problems agree that they are the best method if the goal is to rank a large number of medical treatments.
For example, Dr. David Eddy, a professor of health policy and management at Duke University and an adviser to Kaiser Permanente of Southern California, said that for most of the practical problems that he encounters, measures that are more natural to patients and doctors, like chance of death or return to work, are more suitable. But, he said, to make a ranking of dozens of treatments, "QALY's are probably the best single measure we have right now," and good enough for planning.
 
Critics of Measure
 But QALY's also have their fierce opponents who argue that they are unjust and offensive, even if inevitable. They reject outright the idea of ranking treatments for medical rationing and they object to the QALY method, which relies on healthy people to determine the quality of life of those who are disabled or ill.
QALY's were invented in 1972 by the late Dr. James Bush of the University of California in San Diego, but until recently, they mostly languished as an esoteric academic construct. Now, however, they are being revived by health-care experts who are consultants to states, health insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. These experts say they see QALY's as a promising solution to what looks like a looming, intractable problem. With health-care costs soaring and with growing demands for more access by more people to health care, economists and policy planners say the nation has to find ways to decide which treatments will be paid for and which are not worth their costs.
 
Putting a Value on Life
 To measure the value of a treatment, a QALY calculation asks how long the person will live after having the treatment, and then multiplies each year of life after treatment by its quality. The value of a year of life is weighted from zero to one, with zero as death and one, perfect health with no disability. If a person lives for 10 years with a minor disability, measuring 0.8 on the QALY scale, the years are discounted to the equivalent of eight non-disabled years.
With this formula, investigators have determined the cost per QALY of treatments like corrective surgery for a teen-ager with scoliosis ($3,929) as compared with four years of peritoneal kidney dialysis ($20,151).
Implicit in the QALY ratings are subjective judgments about what a year of life is worth with various degrees of discomfort or disability. To make those assessments, researchers interviewed healthy people, asking them how they would value a year of life confined to bed, say, or one in which they were fully mobile but in constant pain.
The actual process of asking people to make these decisions involves asking them to imagine a hypothetical game of chance, Dr. Reinhardt said. They would be asked to imagine that you could either take a gamble that would lead to perfect health or instant death. Or they could have, with absolute certainty, a particular status that falls short of perfect health.
Then they are asked at what odds they would be indifferent to accepting or rejecting a gamble that might lead to death as opposed to hypothetical health. For example, if the chance of death was 30 percent, some might risk that rather than be unable to walk for the rest of your life.
"It's stunning mathematics," Dr. Reinhardt said.
 
Problems in Oregon
 The thought of using QALY's in the United States, however, raises the specter of a plan devised in Oregon, which ranked treatments in order to determine which would and which would not be paid for by Medicaid. The Department of Health and Human Services said Oregon's plan was illegal because it discriminated against the disabled. But some experts say they do not expect that a rating according to QALY's would run into that problem.
"It's very difficult to imagine the use of QALY's being illegal," Dr. Eddy said. QALY's give points for improving the quality of life, which would tilt some QALY points toward the disabled, whose quality of life is rated lower. "There's nothing inherent in QALY's that discriminates against people with disabilities," Dr. Eddy said. He added that "the use of QALY's would assign a priority to preventing and treating disabilities."
Dr. Paul Menzel, an ethicist and expert on health care at Pacific Lutheran College in Takoma, Wash., noted that QALY's give lower scores to treatments for the disabled that extend their lives but do not alter their disabilities. Their acceptability, he said, depends on how the disabled view what he calls "the QALY bargain." He explained that it is "the bargain that disabled people themselves are willing to make."
"If they agree that QALY's treat them fairly because they give them a leg up on enhancement of the quality of their lives, even though they give them a leg down on treatments that merely extend their lives, then the method's clean," he said
 
Qualms About the System
 But even supporters of QALY's said they had some qualms about the rating system. Dr. Reinhardt wonders who should be doing the quality-of-life ratings. People who are healthy are more likely to assign a low score to a life of disabilty than are the disabled. "We all talk bravely -- 'I'd rather be dead than be in a wheelchair' -- but if you ask people in a wheelchair, they'll give you a very different answer," he said.
Dr. Caplan, who generally supports the notion of QALY's, said that at the heart of these objections is the feeling that QULAY's "leave no room for the sanctity" of life. "There is no way we will not rank people very low if they have severe disabilities or are in comas or are severely retarded," he said. Yet, he said, "Some will say that life is still valuable even if you are severely disabled and in pain."
These supporters, however, said they still thought QALY's were the best measurement available. But others, using many of the same arguments, reject QALY's out of hand.
 
Who Should Judge?
 Dr. John La Puma, a medical doctor and ethicist at Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Ill., said having the healthy assess the quality of life of the sick was an insurmountable drawback. "It's really only patients themselves who can tell you what their quality of life is," he said.
Dr. La Puma said he had no alternative to suggest, but added that he did not think society had to provide a rationing scheme. He said that if doctors asked patients what they wanted and abided by patients' wishes, many expensive, not always effective, interventions would be avoided.
"My guess is that we would find that patients want more personal care that is less highly technical," he said. And that, he added, could do away with some of the pressure for grand ranking schemes to be used in rationing.
Most experts, however, expect some sort of ranking system to be adopted. Dr. Reinhardt explained that the nation's health-care crisis was real and getting worse. "We are looking at 18 percent of the G.N.P. for health care by the year 2000 and 40 million uninsured," he said. "Clearly, at some point, we're going to have to withhold some things that might be valued by somebody."
Mrs. Hoyt agreed. She said she made her own crude QALY judgment recently when she chose to go to Montana for a visit rather than have a colon operation. "This is quality of life, which I wouldn't have had lying in bed at Sloan-Kettering," she said.

Chart: "The Cost of a Better Quality of Life"
 
Calculating quality-adjusted life years . . .
 
A 60-year old person with severe arthritis expects to live 20 more years. However, these years will be spent in such pain and disability that each year is valued at only half a year of normal health. So the quality-adjusted life expectancy (calculated at 50 percent of 20 years) is only 10 years. But after a hip replacement, the person attains a quality of life equivalent to 90 percent of normal health. So eight QALY's, or quality-adjusted life years, (calculated at 90 percent minus 50 percent times 20 years) have theoretically been gained.
 
 
. . . and the cost of attaining them.*
 
Procedure: Pacemaker implantation for atrioventricular heart block
Extra cost per QALY: $994
 
Procedure: Hip replacement
Extra cost per QALY: 1,065

HEADLINE: After Kinship and Marriage, Anthropology Discovers Love

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
IF, as Stendhal said, "Love is like a fever," then that fever infects all peoples, anthropologists say.
Some influential Western social historians have argued that romance was a product of European medieval culture that spread only recently to other cultures. They dismissed romantic tales from other cultures as representing the behavior of just the elites. Under the sway of this view, Western anthropologists did not even look for romantic love among the peoples they studied. But they are now beginning to think that romantic love is universal and is a rogue legacy of humanity's shared evolutionary past. 
 The fact that it does not loom large in anthropology, they say, reflects the efforts most societies have made to quash the unruly inclination. In many countries, they suspect, what appears to be romance newly in bloom is rather the flowering of instincts that were always there, but held in check by tradition and custom.
Romantic ardor has long been at odds with social institutions that knit peoples together in an orderly fashion: romantic choices rarely match the "proper" mates a family would select. In that light, falling in love has been seen by many peoples throughout the world as a dangerous and subversive -- though undeniably alluring -- act, one warned against in folk tale and legend.
"For decades anthropologists and other scholars have assumed romantic love was unique to the modern West," said Dr. Leonard Plotnicav, an anthropologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and editor of the journal Ethnology. "Anthropologists came across it in their field work, but they rarely mentioned it because it wasn't supposed to happen."
Romantic love is a new focus for anthropologists; next month there will be the first scientific session on the anthropology of romance at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in San Francisco.
Anthropologists distinguish between romantic passion and plain lust, as well as other kinds of love, like that between companions or parents and children. By "romantic love," anthropologists mean an intense attraction and longing to be with the loved one.
"Why has something so central to our culture been so ignored by anthropology?" asked Dr. William Jankowiak, an anthropologist at the University of Nevada, who is organizing the session.
The reason, in the view of Dr. Jankowiak and others, is a scholarly bias throughout the social sciences that viewed romantic love as a luxury in human life, one that could be indulged only by people in Westernized cultures or among the educated elites of other societies. For example it was assumed in societies where life is hard that romantic love has less chance to blossom, because higher economic standards and more leisure time create more opportunity for dalliance. That also contributed to the belief that romance was for the ruling class, not the peasants.
But, said Dr. Jankowiak, "There is romantic love in cultures around the world." Last year Dr. Jankowiak, with Dr. Edward Fischer, an anthropologist at Tulane University, published in Ethnology the first cross-cultural study, systematically comparing romantic love in many cultures.
In the survey of ethnographies from 166 cultures, they found what they considered clear evidence that romantic love was known in 147 of them -- 89 percent. And in the other 19 cultures, Dr. Jankowiak said, the absence of conclusive evidence seemed due more to anthropologists' oversight than to a lack of romance.
 
What's the Evidence?
 The survey demanded a careful reading of the records, since anthropologists often paid no systematic attention to whether the people they studied had romantic involvements, or failed to distinguish between lust and love.
Some of the evidence came from tales about lovers, or folklore that offered love potions or other advice on making someone fall in love.
Another source was accounts by informants to anthropologists. For example, Nisa, a Kung woman among the Bushmen of the Kalahari, made a clear distinction between the affection she felt for her husband, and that she felt for her lovers, which was "passionate and exciting," though fleeting. Of these extramarital affairs, she said: "When two people come together their hearts are on fire and their passion is very great. After a while, the fire cools and that's how it stays."
Much of the evidence for romantic love came from cautionary tales. For example, a famous story in China during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) was that of The Jade Goddess. Similar in its description of romantic love to the European tale of Tristan and Isolde, it recounts how a young man falls in love with a woman who has been committed by her family to marry someone else, but who returns his love. The couple elope, but end in desperate straits and finally return home, in disgrace.
 
A Question of Chemistry
 Indeed, from the Kama Sutra to the poems of Sappho, tales of romance are found in ancient literatures throughout the world, though largely ignored by anthropologists and Western social historians. This is one clue that romance is a universal human trait, Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, contends in "Anatomy of Love," published this month by W.W. Norton.
"The brain chemistry for romantic love evolved along with pair bonding four or five million years ago, when our species started to forage, stand on two legs, and carry food back to a safe place to eat," said Dr. Fisher. "Mothers could not do all that and carry an infant in their arms without help from a partner. That led to a major change in reproductive strategy -- infatuation and attachment, the ingredients of romantic love."
Dr. Fisher added, "With the evolution of pair bonding came body chemistry that initiates and sustains bonding." She proposes that because there is a biochemical system that regulates romantic feelings, the capacity for romance is universal.
Still, given cultures may channel romantic feelings in different ways. Romantic love, Dr. Jankowiak said, may be muted or repressed by cultural mores such as marriages arranged by families while the betrothed are still children.
"The proportion of members of a community who experience romantic love may well depend on that culture's social organization," Dr. Jankowiak said.
 
Three's the Charm
 In an editorial note to the cross-cultural survey of romantic love, Dr. Plotnicav wrote that, in retrospect, it was an oversight to ignore the topic in his own field work. "I wish I had thought of looking at this 30 years ago in Nigeria," he said. "But it wasn't part of our tool kit."
The traditional pattern of marriage among the people Dr. Plotnicav studied was for a man to ask his relatives to find him a wife. But, if they could afford the expense, men there could have more than one wife -- allowing romance to enter the picture.
"It's often the third wife who is married for romantic reasons," said Dr. Plotnicav. "I remember one man who told me he first saw his third wife walking through the market and, as he put it, 'she took my life away.' He was passionately in love, and pursued her until she married him."
While finding that romantic love appears to be a human universal, Dr. Jankowiak allows that it is still an alien idea in many cultures that such infatuation has anything to do with the choice of a spouse.
"What's new in many cultures is the idea that romantic love should be the reason to marry someone," said Dr. Jankowiak. "Some cultures see being in love as a state to be pitied. One tribe in the mountains of Iran ridicules people who marry for love."
 
First Marriage, Then Love
 Of course, even in arranged marriages, partners may grow to feel romantic love for each other. For example, among villagers in the Kangra valley of northern India, "people's romantic longings and yearnings ideally would become focused on the person they're matched with by their families," said Dr. Kirin Narayan, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin.
But that has begun to change, Dr. Narayan is finding, under the influence of popular songs and movies. "In these villages the elders are worried that the younger men and women are getting a different idea of romantic love, one where you choose a partner yourself," said Dr. Narayan. "There are starting to be elopements, which are absolutely scandalous."
The same trend toward love matches, rather than arranged marriages, is being noted by anthropologists in many other cultures. Among aborigines in Australia's Outback, for example, marriages had for centuries been arranged when children were very young.
That pattern was disrupted earlier in this century by missionaries, who urged that marriage not occur until children reached adolescence. Dr. Victoria Burbank, an anthropologist at the University of California at Davis, said that in pre-missionary days, the average age of a girl at marriage was always before menarche, sometimes as young as 9 years. Today the average age at marriage is 17; girls are more independent by the time their parents try to arrange a marriage for them.
 
Pregnancy as an Excuse
 "More and more adolescent girls are breaking away from arranged marriages," said Dr. Burbank. "They prefer to go off into the bush for a 'date' with someone they like, get pregnant, and use that pregnancy to get parental approval for the match."
Even so, parents sometimes are adamant that the young people should not get married. They prefer, instead, that the girls follow the traditional pattern of having their mothers choose a husband for them.
"Traditionally among these people, you can't choose just any son-in-law," said Dr. Burbank. "Ideally, the mother wants to find a boy who is her maternal grandmother's brother's son, a pattern that insures partners are in the proper kin group."
Dr. Burbank added: "These groups have critical ritual functions. A marriage based on romantic love, which ignores what's a proper partner, undermines the system of kinship, ritual, and obligation."
Nevertheless, the rules for marriage are weakening. "In the grandmothers' generation, all marriages were arranged. Romantic love had no place, though there were a few stories of a young man and woman in love running off together. But in the group I studied, in only one recent case did the girl marry the man selected for her. All the rest are love matches."
A similar pattern is going on in the village in northern Morocco studied by Dr. Susan Davis, an anthropologist and consultant in Haverford, Penn. "When I first went there in 1965, marriage was a strictly utilitarian economic arrangement," she said. "Your parents arranged your marriage."
 
Then Came Television
 But with the arrival of television and cinema in the village, bringing Egyptian soap operas and American movies, ideas of romance spread. "It's still taboo for a girl to say to her parents, 'I love a certain boy and want to marry him,' " said Dr. Davis. "But what's new is that a girl now expects to have a veto over the mate her parents propose, and that her parents will eventually approve of someone she likes."
In all these cultures the trend toward "love marriages" is lamented by older generations, who see it as a threat to traditional values. Dr. Jankowiak said: "If you follow a private impulse, you'll abandon your loyalties and obligations. Love matches create a new unit that disregards the economic and social goals of your family of origin."
That deep fear of romance, said Dr. Jankowiak, explains the near-universality of Romeo-and-Juliet-type tales, where couples who fall in love despite the objections of their families end tragically, rather than happily ever after.
"The moral of these cautionary tales is that romantic love is the enemy of the extended family and social stability," said Dr. Jankowiak. "But as romantic marriage becomes more common in a given culture, the old, traditional bonds weaken, though they may emerge in new forms to accommodate the change."

HEADLINE: Cheapest Protection of Nature May Lie In Taxes, Not Laws

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
COULD the exploding cost of environmental protection, widely seen as part of America's productivity problem, become part of the solution?
A new generation of environmental researchers, as comfortable with the theories of Adam Smith as they are with those of Darwin or Mendel, thinks taxes that penalize polluters could make the economy fitter and leaner, even as it makes the environment cleaner. Their case is outlined in a report from the World Resources Institute, by no coincidence released last week to gain maximum attention from the nascent Clinton Administration. 
 The institute could hardly have picked a more propitious moment to advance "green taxes" as the cure to ailments ranging from global warming to traffic congestion to the scarcity of places to dump garbage. President-elect Clinton is likely to be attracted by environmental strategies that minimize the cost to consumers while yielding tens of billions of dollars in revenue. So, too, are recession-battered state and local governments, which are under the gun to sustain services and improve the quality of life without raising income, property or sales taxes.
Even conservatives, who worry that more government revenue will mean more government, soften at the prospect. After all, notes William Niskanen, the head of the Cato Institute, "it's better to tax 'bads' than to tax goods."
The idea of green taxes has been kicking around university seminars since it was proposed in the 1920's by the English economist Arthur Pigou. He warned that prices determined by competitive markets would not reflect the full cost of making goods if some of those costs were not borne by producers. If, for example, smoke from a steel mill fouled the paint on nearby houses, steel would sell at a price below the true cost to society.
Pigou argued that the problem could be remedied by imposing a tax equal to this "externality." Once polluters were charged for their mess, they would have incentives to raise prices and reduce production, or shift to less polluting technologies. Either way, producers (and thus consumers) would pay the full cost to society.
What works on a blackboard, however, may not work as well in practice. Externalities are often hard to measure (how much damage did that car horn cause by waking the baby in Apt. 2C?). And they can be even harder to assess (just jot down the license plate number and have the city mail out a bill . . .). That explains, in part, why the political impulse is to regulate away externalities rather than to ask offenders to internalize the cost -- and why horn-blowing is usually illegal in cities, except in emergencies.
More important, pollution is rarely viewed as simply a sin that can be erased by the payment of the secular equivalent of an indulgence. If it is bad enough to worry about, the reasoning goes, it can hardly be made socially acceptable by offsetting it with fees. Indeed, hardly anything makes traditional environmentalists madder than the idea that businesses should be allowed to pay to pollute.
It should not be surprising, then, that America's sweeping environmental laws governing air, water, solid waste and wildlife preservation leave little room for market-based environmentalism. Standards are generally set according to what is deemed safe, aesthetic and technologically feasible. And they are enforced with civil and criminal sanctions intended to deter, not to offer the polluter a chance to pay and play.
 
Why the Sudden Enthusiasm?
 Why, then, the born-again enthusiasm for environmental regulation that puts a price tag on pollution? One reason, argues Paul Portney, an economist at Resources for the Future, a Washington research group, is that scientists are growing more sophisticated about the implicit trade-offs between cost and risk in modern life. It is surely worth a few thousand dollars to save a child from lead poisoning or to prevent a case of lung cancer from radon gas. But just as it doesn't pay to reduce highway deaths by lowering the speed limit to 25 m.p.h., it may not be worth billions of dollars to prevent every possible death from, say, airborne toxic chemicals.
Another reason, suggests Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute, is that the enormous costs of "command and control" environmental regulation are beginning to hit home. A study published in March 1992 issue of Environment Magazine estimated the current cost at $120 billion a year. And by almost everyone's reckoning, the number is bound to grow far more rapidly than the economy for decades to come.
The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandates the outlay of billions of dollars annually to curb acid rain, brighten urban skies and wipe out emissions of toxic industrial gases. Tens of billions have already been spent on the clean-up of toxic waste, and the process has hardly begun. Note, too, that candidate Clinton pledged to roll back carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 -- a promise that may force spectacularly expensive shifts in industrial technology and in the mix of fuels consumed.
 
More Bang for the Buck
 While environmental goals may eventually be scaled back to meet cost concerns, there will surely also be pressure on government to get more bang for an environmental buck. And that is where Robert Repetto, the chief economist of the World Resources Institute, thinks green taxes fit in.
Take the big enchilada of environmental challenges, the limitation of carbon emissions to slow or stop global warming. Environmental strategy-as-usual would require a bureaucratic redesign of energy use, dictating which fossil fuels could be burned in what industrial processes, subsidizing non-fossil energy sources like windmills and setting efficiency standards for everything from cars to power plants.
The environmental economists' alternative is to charge fees that discourage carbon emissions, raising the prices of fuels according to their carbon content. This is obviously easier in administrative terms: the taxes could be collected from producers and importers. And however tough the goal, the carbon tax route is likely to be less of a drag on the economy because carbon emitters themselves are in the best position to calculate the least-cost fix.
 
Traffic Congestion
 Or consider what Mr. Niskanen of the CATO Institute calls the "biggest externality of modern life," traffic congestion. America (and the rest of the world, save Singapore) rations scarce space on roads at rush hour the way the Soviet Union used to ration sausage: with lines. The World Resources Institute report notes that the technology now exists for charging vehicles according to their location and to the time of day. And it cites estimates that by the year 1999 fees ranging from a penny to 36 cents a mile could induce enough drivers to stay off the road at rush hour to save some $21 billion annually in time, fuel and accidents.
Not everyone, though, is convinced that green taxes are unalloyed virtue. Lynn Scarlett, director of research for the libertarian Reason Foundation in Los Angeles, argues that they could prove to be "a fast train in the wrong direction" -- a seductively efficient means for achieving goals that may not be worth achieving. That argument hardly applies to traffic congestion, where the waste in time and fuel is obvious. But it certainly raises questions on global warming, where scientists are still arguing about the likely consequences of carbon emissions.
Those who are sure they know which direction the train should be heading still worry about how far it should go: a green tax, after all, is no better than the estimate of the "externality" it is meant to offset. And all too often, says Dale Jorgensen, an economist at Harvard, "the practical problems of estimation are enormous." Once again, global warming illustrates the problem.
 
Some Cost Estimates
 William Nordhaus, the Yale economist whose article in the Nov. 20, 1992, issue of Science is probably the most sophisticated integration of the climatology and economics of global warming ever attempted, estimates that the optimal carbon tax would start at about $5 a ton and gradually rise to $20. But he also estimates that the tax required to meet Mr. Clinton's campaign promise would exceed $200 a ton by the middle of the next century, with a cumulative cost of $5 trillion in lost economic output.
Another concern is who pays. James Poterba, an economist at M.I.T., found that a carbon tax is likely to take a relatively bigger bite out of the living standards of the poor. By the same token, taxes on traffic or household garbage or pollutants from auto exhausts could also prove regressive. But Mr. Repetto counters that a disproportionate share of the benefits of a cleaner environment are likely to go to those smaller incomes. "Only poor people," he points out, "live near landfills and busy highways." And in any case, revenues could be recycled in ways that offset the maldistribution.
While there may be some muddle over the incidence or appropriate magnitude of green taxes, it is no mystery why politicians are attracted to them. Like any other taxes, green taxes would meet certain resistance from groups and regions most adversely affected. Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, notes that a carbon tax would add roughly four cents to the price of coal for every penny it added to the price of oil or natural gas. And judging from past donnybrooks over curbing sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants, the coal lobby in Congress would not go gentle into that dark night.
 
Taxes or Regulation?
 But unlike most taxes, green taxes can be sold as user fees that advance environmental goals that would otherwise have to be met with direct regulation -- regulation that could prove far more costly to consumers. Commuters might initially be furious about paying an extra $5 to get to work. But their anger might quickly dissipate if the commuting time were cut in half, or if the congestion fees were presented as the alternative to mandatory car-pooling.
What's more, green taxes could prove to be terrific cash cows. The World Resources Institute estimates that congestion fees set at efficient levels could have generated a whopping $98 billion for states and localities in 1989. A relatively modest $30-a-ton national carbon tax (about 10 cents per gallon of gasoline) would bring home $35 billion.
How one views this potential flood of revenue depends on what one expects would be done with the dollars. The World Resources Institute sees green taxes as substitutes for income taxes that undermine incentives to work and save, and could thus increase measured output as well as cleaning the environment. That also seems to be the thrust of Mr. Clinton's thinking: His campaign pamphlet on the economy called for "revenue-neutral market incentives" to "penalize polluters and energy wasters." And Paul A. Volcker, who is rumored in line for Secretary of the Treasury, offers a variation on the same theme. In a television interview in June he called for a carbon tax as the least offensive tax for closing the budget deficit.
But Mr. Hahn, a former adviser to President Bush on environmental economics, worries that it could presage an unwanted growth in government. When he left the White House, he left behind a memo on the revenue potential of green taxes -- a memo he titled "Pandora's Box."

GRAPHIC: Photo: "A Traffic Jam of Potential Polluters"
 
From 1970 to 1989, the total number of miles traveled by car increased by 90 percent and vehicle registrations increased by more than 70 percent. But urban road capacity increased by less than 4 percent. Some economists advocate charging road-space consumers more during peak travel times, as phone calls and electricity cost more in periods of peak use. The technology exists to monitor road use with electronic devices in cars and sensors in the road. (pg. C1); Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute is a leading proponent of "green taxes." (World Resources Institute) (pg. C8)
 
Chart: "Taxing Drivers to Cut Traffic"
 
Advocates of a "green tax" on traffic say it would unclog stopped-up roads and produce revenue.
 
Potential impact: At 1,661,724 million vehicle miles traveled annually, a toll of 0 to 21 cents on each mile could reduce that by 7 percent, to 1,545,952 million miles.
 
Other benefits: By 1999 the fee could cut peak-hour delays, for added savings of about $8.1 billion annually. Even higher tolls, reflecting the social cost and delays caused by accidents, could save as much as $21.3 billion annually.

Chart/Diagram: "Taxing Carbon: Why, How and Whom"
 
Some economists say that making fossil fuels more expensive would alter, the use of capital, energy and other economic resources and help meet emission goals set to prevent global warming. In essence, they believe it would put a price tag on pollution, shifting energy use to less-taxed and less-polluting fuels. Such a tax would be somewhat regressive, falling more heavily on those in lower income groups. Some retooling would be needed to counter this problem, but defenders say the poor would also benefit disproportionately from a smaller pollution burden.

HEADLINE: You Can't Push a Button for New Miracle Cures;
What Puzzles Scientists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Perhaps the only topic that puzzles biomedical scientists more than the mysteries of the human body is how best to spend our national research dollars. Despite the complicated nature of this problem, you lambaste researchers for failing to offer revolutionary solutions in response to a recent call by Bernadine Healy, National Institutes of Health director, and suggest scientists don't care about the health of the public and cannot be trusted to direct the future of scientific fund granting (Week in Review, Nov. 1). Serious solutions require a more rigorous analysis.
Consider the immensity of the task: In fiscal year 1991 the N.I.H. received 15,111 independent grant proposals, awarding 4,190 of them a total of $812,845,349. No single individual within the agency is in charge of handing out all that money; rather, it is awarded through the deliberation of more than 100 peer review teams, each of which considers the proposals in only a small field. 
 Meanwhile, in the face of our data explosion, in which hundreds of papers on a single protein may be published within one month, scientists must accumulate very specialized knowledge. Understandably, they often feel most excited about the work to which they are dedicated. They can speak with authority about the benefits to society that could come from their own fields, while the knowledge gap between fields is enough to make estimates of another field's worth more than difficult.
Thus it comes as no surprise that when scientists are asked to solve the monetary distribution problem they claim not to know what to do about it or they respond with expert advice on why their own fields are important.
This is not to say that researchers could not contribute to the question of spending N.I.H. funds. The peer review of grants has been the starting point for high-quality science, providing enough time to evaluate projects rigorously. Decisions about long-term targets for research dollars should deserve no less consideration.
It would be unrealistic to argue that scientists are above economic self-interest. They are, after all, not the white-coated mythical figures of television commercials, but mothers and fathers with children in college, mortgages and, like other taxpayers, they need their jobs. Nonetheless, to deserve your label "more visionary and altruistic than the population as a whole," it should not be necessary to fire oneself.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Knapp Communications Is for Sale

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The owner of Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit, two visually stylish magazines that cater to affluent readers, was put up for sale today.
Industry sources speculated that the two magazines would sell for about $150 million to $200 million. The magazines' parent company, Knapp Communications Inc., is privately held. Company officials declined to disclose Knapp's net income, but did say that both magazines earn operating profits. Knapp, based in Los Angeles, had revenue of $90 million in the year that ended last Jan. 31. 
 Even though both magazines have suffered declines in advertising, particularly in the last two years, industry analysts expect Knapp Communications will receive numerous offers. Probable bidders include Hearst, Conde Nast and Times Mirror, publishers of other consumer magazines, which can presumably achieve efficiencies of scale that Knapp cannot.
Architectural Digest had a circulation of 647,000 and had 1,211 pages of advertising in the year that ended Jan. 31. For the same year, Bon Appetit's circulation was 1.3 million and the magazine had 950 ad pages.
Both magazines' ad pages are expected to reach a low point this year, according to a knowledgeable industry source, who declined to be named, after peaking in 1990 at Architectural Digest and 1989 at Bon Appetit. The high-end magazines have been particularly hard hit by the recession.
Cleon T. Knapp, 55 years old, the founding chairman of Knapp, said in a statement, "I would like to devote my energies to new challenges and personal interests."
Mr. Knapp's publishing career started in 1964 when he purchased Architectural Digest from his grandfather's estate for $65,000. He had spent summers working for the then twice-a-year trade directory and the family publishing company, but had little management experience before buying the magazine.
Architectural Digest is known for sumptuous photography and for featuring articles written by such widely known authors as John Updike and M. F. K. Fisher.
With profits from Architectural Digest, Mr. Knapp bought Bon Appetit from the Pillsbury Company for $85,000 in 1974. It was transformed from a low-budget recipe magazine with a paid circulation of 250,000 into the monthly cooking bible of would-be gourmets.

HEADLINE: New Challenge for States: Making, Not Taking, Jobs

SERIES: Finding What Works: State Job Programs -- Second article of a series

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
In state capitals across the nation, just as in Washington, government leaders are casting about for approaches, new and old, to reinvigorate their economies. And the key to that, wherever it is tried, is creating jobs.
For decades, most states have taken the easy, politically expedient approach. They have offered lucrative tax incentives, a proven technique that lures businesses away from neighboring states, enabling politicians to put hundreds or thousands of their constituents to work before the next elections. 
 Among the states relying on this approach even today are Arkansas, the home state of President-elect Bill Clinton, and Kentucky, which has perhaps the most generous such program.
 
To Meet Competition
 But here in Utah, as in a handful of other states, officials are trying new methods. Utah is looking to its own people for creative ideas that can be turned into marketable inventions. When one emerges, the state helps to turn it into a business venture, creating home-grown enterprises that sell new high-tech products.
Economic development experts say that if the nation is to remain competitive internationally, Washington cannot rely only on large-scale Federal public works projects and tax incentives to create jobs. They say the Government should also encourage the creation of innovative businesses, as Utah does. Even though most of these start quite small, such new companies, with patented, cutting-edge products, hold the greatest potential to keep the nation competitive.
One such enterprise may have been born at a meeting of scientists, engineers, venture capitalists and marketing specialists who had been brought together here this month by Utah economic development officials.
Dr. Paul Savello, a professor at Utah State University, told the group that in five years, "there will be no more whole milk for sale in grocery stores."
He explained: "People are concerned about the fat, and in 15 or 20 years people are going to want to move away from 2 percent milk, too. But the problem is, they just don't like the taste and the appearance of skim milk. It's watery."
"It looks blue," an investor, Lee Smith, interjected with a dismissive laugh.
"Well," Dr. Savello went on, "we have firmly developed a way to make skim milk indistinguishable from 2 percent milk in blind taste tests. We don't add anything; it's still regular skim milk. All we're doing is manipulating the protein structure."
That caught everyone's attention, and the investors immediately peppered Dr. Savello with questions about marketing, distribution, costs. He didn't have many answers. "I'm just a scientist," he said, almost as an apology. But he did say, "the cost of the process is probably under one-tenth of a penny per gallon."
With that, a businessman, Jim Dreyfous, exclaimed, "This could be the Nutrasweet of milk!" And within a week Dr. Savello had heard from several eager suitors, venture capitalists and others eager to join forces with him to start a company, build the equipment, hire employees and begin licensing the technology to local dairies nationwide.
"We're really excited about this," Rick Sherle, an Utah entrepreneur who was a breakfast guest, said later. "We're putting together a business plan."
Down the street, at Utah's economic development department a few days later, Michael Alder, head of the state's job creation office, was smiling. He is the one who organized the breakfast. And now, Mr. Alder said, "it looks like the skim milk is taking off."
Mr. Alder's office had helped finance Dr. Savello's research; over the last two years the state had given him almost $200,000. Dr. Savello and Dr. Ault are just two of several dozen scientists and engineers at Utah's universities who have been given $16.5 million for research in the last six years, grants that have been matched 10 to 1 by the Federal Government, foundations and private companies.
The state money is awarded with the clear instruction that it must be used to produce cutting-edge commercial products. Economic development experts say this program is among the nation's most innovative projects for creating jobs. About two-dozen other states offer aid to inventors in universities, said Walter Plosila, an economic development official in Maryland who was hired to evaluate Utah's program last year. "But very few of them are oriented to moving the inventions into industry," he said.
Now with Dr. Savello's work, once again Utah appeared ready to create jobs in an innovative field, jobs that might never have been created without the state government's help.
 
A Mistake
'I Did Overdo It,' Clinton Admits
 Among economists, social scientists and others, state economic development programs are generally held in low regard. Most do not create jobs. Usually they simply shift them from one place to another, often at great cost.
To many states, economic development means tax rebates and other costly incentives to lure businesses away from their neighbors -- "smokestack chasing," it is called.
But those tax breaks, while often successful at attracting low-tech businesses in search of bargains, can at the same time deprive state governments of revenue they need. Without that money, states often cannot improve their schools and universities, enhance their roads, bridges and other elements of the infrastructure -- or in general prepare themselves for the high-technology industries the nation needs to remain competitive in the world.
Tax incentives were the key to Mr. Clinton's economic development program in Arkansas. In the last decade, it produced impressive growth in basic manufacturing jobs, as Mr. Clinton often noted in his campaign speeches.
But most of the new jobs were in new, expanded or relocated plants that generally hired low-wage workers. And even with all those new taxpaying employees in Arkansas, the business-tax rebates insured that Mr. Clinton still had to cut state spending to balance the budget and then raise other taxes to pay for school improvements and other social programs.
In his book "Laboratories of Democracy" (Harvard Business School Press, 1990), David Osborne profiled Mr. Clinton's administration. This study, otherwise generous with praise for Mr. Clinton, criticized the Governor for the size of the tax credits he gave businesses, noting that they cost Arkansas at least $10 million in 1986 alone.
"I asked Clinton about this once," Mr. Osborne said in an interview. "And he said: 'Yup, I plead guilty. It was a mistake.' " In Mr. Osborne's book, Mr. Clinton is quoted as telling the author several years ago: "In 1983, unemployment was 13 percent, and for three years I was desperate to do anything to keep manufacturing jobs. But I think I did overdo it."
 
Largess
Most Aggressive In Tax Incentives
 Kentucky is similar to Arkansas in many ways. Half Southern, half Mid-western, it is largely rural and poor. By many national measures of wealth and education, Kentucky, like Arkansas, ranks not far from the bottom when compared with other states.
Last summer Kentucky began what may be the nation's most generous tax-incentive program to recruit new businesses, and it has already attracted several hundred jobs. But it also touched off a regional war.
The most visible part of Kentucky's program is the television advertisements. Since late summer, the state has been running 30-second commercials on CNN showing Gov. Brereton C. Jones leaning toward the camera from behind a polished, dark-wood desk.
"As Governor, I'm asking you to consider Kentucky for your business location," he says. "Locate your white collar jobs in Kentucky, and the state will pay half your rent for 10 years and up to half your start-up costs."
In another ad, the Governor promises: "Locate your manufacturing plant in Kentucky, and the state will reimburse your entire investment. In Kentucky, we're serious about jobs!"
 
Other States Cry Foul
 The lucrative tax rebates were Lieut. Gov. Paul E. Patton's idea. His elected position has no duties, so early this year Mr. Jones appointed him head of the state's economic development cabinet as well. Very quickly he drafted the tax incentive plan, the legislature passed the bill and the new law took effect in July. Officials in Ohio and Tennessee promptly cried foul.
"It's the most vicious piece of legislation I have ever seen," Mayor Dwight Tillery of Cincinnati complained.
Almost immediately, Ohio's General Assembly prepared its own generous economic incentive bill, and at the hearings in August, one state senator summed up the general sentiments when he said: "Ohio can't stand by and be a patsy."
After Gov. George Voinovich told the state Senate this was a "must pass" bill, it was enacted. So now Ohio, too, has a generous tax-rebate program -- along with all the economic burdens it brings along.
In Jackson, Tenn., meanwhile, officials were preparing to announce late last summer that the International Paper Company was going to build a plant there. It would employ 400 people manufacturing paper labels for cans.
But just before the announcement, International Paper heard about Kentucky's new program and reconsidered. The company's project manager, Kris Schmaling, told the Nashville Business Journal that Kentucky's tax incentives were worth $39 million to International Paper, so "we literally took the Jackson construction plans and modified them for Bowling Green," in southwestern Kentucky.
That was not the only new plant Tennessee lost to Kentucky, and economic development officials were furious. They, too, began lobbying that state's legislature to enact similar incentives.
But at Middle Tennessee State University, Tony Eff, a professor of regional economics, warned Tennessee not to join the regional smokestack chase.
"That was a good strategy 20 years ago, when what made us competitive was low-cost, hard-working workers," he said. "But if employers want that now, they can go to Mexico." And in fact, several states that have used temporary tax-rebate programs to lure businesses are finding that as soon as their rebates expire, some of the companies move away to take advantage of incentives elsewhere.
Now, Dr. Eff says, Tennessee must begin manufacturing new, high-technology products that other countries cannot easily produce. Businesses of that sort usually are not after tax rebates. They look for states with attributes like strong universities, educated and well-trained citizens and advanced communications.
As for tax incentives, Dr. Eff says, "I don't think we can afford it."
Lieutenant Governor Patton says he has heard the argument that Kentucky cannot really afford the incentives, either. But he argues that even though large tax benefits are given to the companies, the state still gains revenue. The new employees "pay sales taxes, property taxes, gasoline taxes," he said.
At the same time, however, these people and their children fill more classrooms, add traffic to the highways, make additional demands on the state Medicaid program. The list goes on. So determining whether the state wins or loses in the end is difficult if not impossible.
"Some people say it's the wrong way to go, that we are eroding our tax base," Mr. Patton acknowledged. "But in Kentucky's situation, we still have high employment, and as long as we bring in jobs for local people, it's helping us."
 
A Big Score
Kentucky Lands Toyota's Plant
 Kentucky generally prospered in the latter half of the 1980's, largely a result of several lucky strikes. The most notable was Toyota's decision to build an assembly plant in Georgetown, after the state offered $140 million in incentives.
But the economic consulting firm DRI-Mcgraw Hill projects that Kentucky will rank 34th in the nation in job creation next year. The Corporation for Economic Development, another national consulting firm, ranks Kentucky 39th, and its annual report card on the states gives Kentucky D's for both economic performance and development capacity.
The same two firms rank Utah 10th and 8th respectively in job creation. And in the same two categories the report card gives Utah two A's. This is largely because Utah puts most of its energy into a different approach.
Mr. Alder's office, the Centers of Excellence program, is a central part of that. It seeks out promising research in university laboratories in the state -- professors with projects that ordinarily might produce interesting articles in academic journals but seldom much more.
 
Professors Thinking Commercial
 The state encourages these professors to refocus their work toward commercial applications. And then twice a year, professors across the state can enter a competition of sorts for state financing up to $300,000 a year that must be used to move their work from university labs to new commercial ventures.
Start-up businesses of this sort generally take several years to get going. But since the program was begun in 1986, it has led to the creation of 65 high-tech companies employing almost 1,500 people, plus about 1,000 more people hired to carry out additional work in the associated university labs. Not all of these companies will survive. But those that do provide jobs that were not simply shifted here from other states. They did not exist before, and most of them pay higher than average wages.
 
A Success
Utah Seeks Out Cutting Edge
 In northeast Salt Lake City, right beside the university campus, the entrance sign to a modern industrial park reads: "University of Utah Research Park: Technology, Creating Industry, Creating Jobs."
Inside are rows of squat, red-brick industrial buildings housing more than 50 start-up concerns, all of them born of research in the university's labs, many of them financed in part with money from Mr. Alder's program.
Not many universities encourage their professors to start businesses; in fact the whole idea seems contrary to the philosophy of academia. But "this institution has a view that we are an important part of the regional and local economy, and one thing we can do for the state is commercialize our research," said Richard Koehn, the University of Utah's vice president for research.
That's not just an altruistic view; by a variety of arrangements the university shares in the profits from commercial ventures born in the school's labs. "Last year we took in $1.3 million," Dr. Koehn said.
And it is also true that his university is known for unorthodox experiments. It was here in 1989 that two researchers announced that they had achieved cold nuclear fusion, a claim that was later largely discredited. And it was here, seven years earlier, that Dr. William DeVries implanted the first permanent artificial heart in a patient, Barney Clark. He died three months later.
On a trial production line in one of the industrial-park buildings, a wide strip of special, porous plastic material rolls past, and steel nozzles just above spit small globs of clear gel at designated intervals, 70 of them a minute. A few inches farther along, another layer of plastic is laid on top, a punching device cuts the sheets into individual two-inch squares. And then these little patches of medication are dumped into a basket ready for packaging -- the first products in a new market with an estimated potential value of $1 billion.
The squares are transdermal patches of testosterone, the male sex hormone. They are like the nicotine patches many people use to help them quit smoking, though far more sophisticated. Pasted most anywhere on the body of a patient suffering from malfunctioning gonads, they dispense testosterone through the skin to replace the testosterone the body should be producing on its own, under a new, patented process unknown before it was pioneered in a University of Utah laboratory.
 
Field Didn't Exist Before
 Creation of the process was financed in part by more than $1 million from the state, Dr. Sung Wan Kim, one of the inventors, said. With encouragement from both the university and Mr. Alder's office, he founded a company, Theratec Inc., which produces the patches and several other novel drug delivery technologies.
Theratec made a public offering of its shares early this year, and the over-the-counter stock has grown to be a darling of some financial analysts. "The unappreciated gem of the drug delivery area," an analysis by Vector Securities said early this year. Last month, Kidder, Peabody & Company said "the uniqueness and proven benefits of these products gives us confidence in the company's profitability."
Now Theratec employs 80 people in a field that did not exist just a few years ago. And the company is almost certain to grow after it gains Food and Drug Administration approval for its initial products. Already, the average salary of Theratec's employees exceeds $40,000 a year. But like most speculative new companies, Theratec's early days were not easy.
"It would have been tough getting going without that money from the state," says Dinesh C. Patel, the company's president. "The state stepped in where most new companies fail."
Dr. Kim said, "Because of the state funding, we were able to initiate many new areas of research," adding that the Clinton Administration should look to Utah for ideas.
"The new Government in Washington has to stimulate small technologies like ours," he said.
Stephen C. Jacobsen has a similar view. He is a professor of engineering at the same university, and with help from the state, among others, he created a successful robotics company now employing 120 people. He put it this way: "People like us create the headwaters of innovation that can enable this country to stay ahead of Japan. But in the beginning, it's a minefield, and that's where the state helps."
If the Federal Government "doesn't do something to help entrepreneurs, something like the state does here, then we'll be in trouble."
NEXT: As jobs develop, so must the the work force. Apprenticeship is one way.

HEADLINE: 2 Economic Signs Hint Of Growth

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Two new reports suggest that the economic picture is getting a bit brighter.
Signaling a possible upturn in manufacturing, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders for big-ticket factory goods -- cars, airplanes, machines and the like -- shot up 3.9 percent in October, the biggest gain in more than a year, to $124.4 billion. 
 And in a positive portent for retailers about to enter the make-or-break Christmas season, the Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence jumped 11 points, to 65.5, in November. The post-election rebound in consumer spirits entirely reversed a string of monthly declines in the measure since June.
"There's a growing sense that the economy is performing better than it has since the beginning of the recovery," Ed Yardeni, chief economist at the C. J. Lawrence securities firm, said.
 
Forecasts Remain Unmoved
 But while yesterday's reports set off a stock market rally, neither report was quite as strong as it looked at first glance and neither prompted forecasters to revise upward their modest predictions for economic growth in the current quarter.
"The readings are better," said Fabian Linden, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, "but they're still not at levels associated with a robust recovery."
The durable goods report, for example, found orders rose more than forecasters had been expecting, and a small decline originally reported for September was revised into a small rise. Most significantly for future production, the backlog of unfilled orders held steady in November after shrinking in each of the previous 13 month.
Still, most of October's gains were concentrated in just a handful of industries. Orders for aircraft, autos and other transporation equipment spurted 20 percent, while military equipment orders leaped 42 percent. Excluding military goods, orders would have risen only 2.2 percent. And without the jump in transportation equipment, orders would have fallen seven-tenths of a percent.
The surge in military orders prompted rumors along Wall Street that the Bush Administration had attempted to pump up military spending in advance of the election. But Michael Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., dismissed such speculation, saying it is entirely typical for military orders to swing from month to month.
"The fact that orders fell so much earlier in the year meant they were poised for a rebound," he said. "I thought we'd get it sooner, but it was all bunched in October."
Analysts said the problem with the orders report was that it showed strength in areas where growth might not be able to be sustained. "What's needed is a more powerful signal to manufacturers in the form of several months of rising order backlogs," Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said.
Absent real job growth, economists warned, the spurt in consumer confidence does not guarantee a rise in the pace of spending from the summer's solid 3.4 percent annual rate. "As the recession has gone on, spending has been driven more and more by income and need and less and less by confidence," David Kelly, an economist at the Boston Company, said.
In fact, he and other analysts attributed most of the jump in consumer confidence to Gov. Bill Clinton's victory in the Presidential election. A weekly poll by ABC/Money magazine showed that consumer confidence was declining right up until the election Nov. 3d. And, according to a national exit poll conducted for four television news organizations, 61 percent of those who said they were worse off than four years ago voted for President-elect Clinton. "The most pessimistic voters got the President they wanted," Mr. Kelly said.
Mr. Linden, however, offered a more upbeat view that waning pessimism reflected real improvements in the economy. He noted that confidence did not bounce up strongly or for long following past Presidential elections, even Ronald Reagan's defeat of Jimmy Carter in 1980.
 
Belief in Job Growth Rises
 The Conference Board survey does show that consumers are becoming less gloomy about job prospects. The number of respondents who expected jobs to become more abundant six months hence rose to 16.7 percent from 13.5 percent, while those who thought jobs would be scarcer shrank to 20.1 percent from 25.4 percent.
Indeed, the official unemployment rate has drifted down from 7.8 percent in June to 7.4 percent in October and new unemployment insurance claims have been running below 400,000 -- a kind of dividing line between a labor market that's dead in the water and one that is showing signs of life -- for the last five weeks.

HEADLINE: French Socialists Look for Support on Farm Deal

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Isolated in Europe and unpopular at home, France's Socialist Government is looking for a strong vote of support for its rejection of a farm trade agreement between the United States and the European Community when the National Assembly debates the issue here Wednesday.
But while opposition parties have also denounced the accord as harmful to France's one million farmers, they are resisting the call for "national cohesion," hoping instead to exploit the Government's difficulties in the run-up to parliamentary elections next March. 
 Until now, the world's attention has been centered on whether France can block the agreement, viewed as the key to progress in global trade liberalization talks that have been going on since 1986 under the auspices of the 108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
Yet, more than anything, it is the French Government's political weakness at home that is forcing it to risk a major confrontation with its 11 community partners that could further undermine the region's ambitious blueprint for greater economic unity.
France's Socialists, already widely expected to be defeated by a conservative coalition next March, fear a still greater electoral backlash if they are seen to have betrayed the farmers and if the farmers carry out their threat to block highways and disrupt imports.
The domestic dimension to the crisis will come into focus Wednesday, not only because of the parliamentary debate, but also because farmers have scheduled demonstrations against the agreement in Paris and other cities.
The Government's objective in the National Assembly appears to be to win overwhelming backing for its argument that the farm trade pact with the United States goes beyond the subsidy and production cuts that the community agreed to when it changed its common agricultural policy last May.
The community's executive commission, which worked out the deal, will probably reject this argument at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday before the French debate. Parliamentary support for new negotiations could, however, help France obtain face-saving concessions from the commission.
The two main conservative opposition parties, however, now seem likely to abstain in the vote of confidence being sought by the Government. Instead, in a blatant bid to woo the country's farmers, they plan to sponsor a resolution demanding that France veto the agreement as it now stands.
Although the Socialists are in a minority in Parliament, Communist deputies usually prevent the right from obtaining the 286 votes needed to win a censure vote to topple the Government.
Yet, even if the Government survives Wednesday's vote, as seems probable, the bitter debate that is expected to preceed it may do little to help Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy win political support at home or new negotiating room abroad.
Despite opposition calls for a French veto, Government officials now concede that France can only veto a global GATT accord that may emerge from negotiations that resume in Geneva Thursday, not the separate farm trade deal concluded with the United States.
Further, since many non-farming sectors of the French economy are set to profit from a global trade package, speculation about a French veto of a GATT accord is not taken seriously in other European capitals. Rather, Paris is seen to be playing for time while it seeks a way out of the crisis.
Domestically, though, its options are few. Not only is the opposition complicating the search for a solution by backing the more drastic demands of farming groups, but the farmers themselves are in a fighting mood.
In a letter to President Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Laigneau, leader of Coordination Rurale, announced plans to intercept trucks bringing American, British, Dutch and Irish food products into France. "To help you resist those Europeans too sensitive to American charms, we have decided to apply our own measures of retaliation," he said.
Already this week, angry farmers have blocked entry into a Coca-Cola bottling plant and many McDonald's restaurants, and wider protests are planned for Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Chinese Apparently Halt Rights Talks With U.S.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 24

 BODY:
In a rebuff to President Bush and a warning to President-elect Bill Clinton, China appears to have suspended its discussions with the United States on human rights issues, including American inquiries about specific political prisoners.
The action by the Beijing authorities halts a process that began in December 1990, when the Bush Administration hailed the talks as a sign of progress on human rights following the violent suppression of the democracy movement in June 1989. 
 The dialogue on rights was never especially productive, but it gave American diplomats and visiting officials a basis for raising inquiries about specific political prisoners. These on-again, off-again discussions, about broad human rights topics and individual cases, sometimes drew minimal Chinese responses and occasionally led to real improvements in people's lives.
For all the frustrations, the discussions meant that China at least acknowledged that human rights were a valid topic of discussion. Now, even that much seems to be in jeopardy.
Mr. Clinton sharply criticized China for human rights abuses during the Presidential campaign. Since the election, he has eased up a little on that criticism, but indicated that he would continue to take a tougher line on the issue than the Bush Administration.
 
Throwing Down the Gauntlet
 In effect, then, the Beijing authorities were laying down a challenge to Mr. Clinton as he and his advisers fashion a China policy.
Their action also comes as disagreements are expected in coming months on trade and other issues.
The Chinese approach in the wake of the American election is still being developed, however, and may permit discussions about human rights with legislators and others who are not part of the Administration.
In a significant step, China is welcoming a delegation of five Senators next month, a visit in which rights concerns are certain to be raised.
The latest Chinese decision seems to be a response to Mr. Bush's announcement in September that the United States would permit the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Beijing's adversary, the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. The Government here was outraged by the sale, which appeared to violate American pledges, and some diplomats expect further retaliatory action.
"The United States Government decision to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan has seriously hurt Sino-U.S. relations," the Foreign Ministry said in an oblique statement today, 24 hours after it was asked for details about the suspension of the human rights discussions. "The Chinese Government has expressed its solemn and just stance on this."
The United States is not without leverage. Beijing, for instance, is worried that if it reacts too strongly, it will lose its low-tariff access to the American market, known as most-favored-nation status. Mr. Clinton has said that he favors linking China's trade with its human rights situation, but much will depend on how this principle is drafted into legislation on extending this trading status.
A Western diplomat explained: "You're talking about the U.S. taking 30 percent of their exports, and their exports to the U.S. are growing 40 percent this year. And they're counting on this to continue to grow. It's something that their entire reform package is based on."
Mr. Clinton's changing tone in recent weeks leaves his intentions unclear. During the campaign, he said that President Bush had failed to win concessions from China on rights and trade issues, but last week he said that "in the last several months" China had begun to moderate its policies.
"We have a big stake in not isolating China, in seeing that China continues to develop a market economy," Mr. Clinton said. "But we also have to insist, I believe, on progress in human rights and human decency."
The Foreign Ministry did not directly respond to the questions about whether the rights discussions had been terminated. By avoiding a direct response, the ministry seemed to be offering tacit confirmation without painting itself into a corner.
In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, the United States Embassy in Beijing took two days to provide this terse response: "We believe an active dialogue on the issue offers the best chance of furthering both countries' interests. We continue to press China on human rights at every opportunity."
The embassy declined to comment further, but at a meeting earlier this month, American diplomats are believed to have tried to give the Chinese Foreign Ministry an unofficial though written inquiry on political prisoners.
The Chinese refused to accept it, so the Americans left it on a chair as they packed up and prepared to leave the room. The Chinese picked it up and said that there would be no response. The Americans were apparently heartened that they at least picked it up.
China's growing trade imbalance with the United States, in which its exports far exceed its imports, is another prickly issue. The surplus, now second only to Japan's, amounted to $13.4 billion in the first nine months of this year, more than in all of 1991.
The Beijing leadership has also been slow to carry out an agreement with Washington on curbing the export of goods made with prison labor.
If that were not enough to worry about, the Chinese Government's fierce opposition to democratic changes in Hong Kong may cause further tensions with the United States.
There have been significant improvements in other areas. China seems to have curtailed its arms sales, and it has allowed many, if not all dissidents to leave the country. It has released some prominent Catholics from prison and sharply toned down its Communist propaganda.
Last month, Beijing caved in on American demands that it open its markets to more American goods, and it is taking other steps to allow parts of its economy to be run on market lines. And, in a bouquet to Mr. Clinton, the Chinese announced shortly after the election that they would buy two million tons of American wheat, the first such purchase this year.
The suspension of human rights discussions was apparently decided at the highest level. The leadership informed various Chinese ministries that they should not discuss rights issues with American officials.
A test of how the Chinese will apply the suspension is expected during the Senators' visit. According to current plans, the delegation is to be led by Senator David L. Boren and to include Senators Bob Kerrey, Carl Levin, Claiborne Pell and John W. Warner.
In an important suggestion that it wants to be conciliatory, China plans to let the Senators visit Tibet. It ordinarily controls access to Tibet very tightly, effectively barring Western journalists from visiting the region.

HEADLINE: WEST WILL EXPAND HIGH-TECH SALES

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Western trade group established to police high-technology sales to Communist countries radically shifted its focus today by opening its doors to its former enemies and urging them to join in controlling sensitive exports to nations threatening global security.
The 17-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, held a meeting today that Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and other successor nations to the former Soviet Union were allowed to attend for the first time. American officials said the message to them was that they would receive increasingly sophisticated Western technology as they provided evidence they had imposed effective export controls. 
 Alan Larson, the head of the United States delegation, said that Iran's recent buildup of sensitive military technology -- some of it apparently acquired from former East bloc countries -- was not specifically raised.
But it was clear that the United States and its Western allies were seeking to use the meeting to enlist the cooperation of the Soviet Union's successor states in preventing sensitive technology reaching what Mr. Larson called "countries of concern to the international community."
 
'No Explicit Discussion of Iran'
 "There was no explicit discussion of Iran," he said. "There was a broad discussion of the need to have in place effective multipurpose export controls and to make sure that sensitive equipment does not end up in hands that could be destabilizing."
A senior Commerce Department official, Joan McEntee, added that to draw up a blacklist of proscribed nations -- like Iran, Syria or North Korea -- would be premature because most of the former East bloc countries have not yet learned how to police exports in market economies.
Proliferation has become a highly sensitive issue in both Europe and Washington since the West's failure to detect the scale of Iraq's nuclear program. In recent weeks, the Bush Administration has expressed deep concern over sales of militarily useful equipment and technology to Iran - including fighter aircraft, bombers, submarines and tanks from the former Soveit Union.
American officials said they met with a 12-member Russian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory V. Berdennikov. In the talks, Mr. Larson said the Russians "recognized that their export control regime is not adequate and that there is a serious problem with sensitive technologies, and they expressed an extreme willingness to work with us."
 
'Deal They Could Not Refuse'
 Mr. Berdennikov said Russia was determined to insure that the country could not become a platform for the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
At the two-day meeting, which ended today, Cocom countries -- which include all NATO countries except Iceland, plus Australia and Japan -- offered their former enemies what Mr. Larson called "deal they could not refuse": act rapidly to control exports and show that Western technology will be put only to civilian use, and in return gain increasing access to sensitive technology and wide-ranging Western assistance.
The United States said it would provide $11 million to help the former East bloc countries set up export control systems, as well as offer technical assistance on the drafting of laws and training for customs and licensing officials.
Countries seeking greater access to Western technology would have to guarantee that the equipment would be used for civilian ends, allow Western countries to make spot checks and introduce a comprehensive export control system capable of insuring that a country to which sensitive goods are being sent is indeed the end user, American and European officials said.
 
Applications by Year's End
 "We believe it essential that governments carefully consider the potential of sensitive exports to enhance the indigenous weapons manufacturing capability of countries of concern to the international community," Mr. Larson said.
West European officials said that countries wishing to take up the Cocom offer were expected to apply by the end of the year. Once they demonstrated that they had complied with the conditions, controls on technology exports to them would be relaxed.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO REVEAL GROWTH PLAN SOON

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton plans to present his economic package to Congressional leaders before Inauguration Day, the chief of his economic transition team says.
Robert B. Reich, head of the economic team, said in an interview Monday night that Mr. Clinton's economic advisers would present policy options to him by mid-December and that Mr. Clinton would probably refine his campaign's broad economic plan into a more specific package by Christmas. 
 "He then rolls up his sleeves and begins working with Congress intensively," Mr. Reich said, noting that this would probably be in early January.
Congressional leaders told Mr. Clinton last week that if he wanted his economic package to move swiftly through Congress soon after Inauguration Day, on Jan. 20, that he should make sure that they had a chance to examine it beforehand.
 
Awaiting Economic Indicator
 Mr. Reich made clear that the economic advisers were considering options to lift the weak economy that might increase the budget deficit. But he said that whether the advisers actually recommended such options would turn largely on whether the economy strengthens or sags over the next two months.
"Any President, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, who faces a completely stagnant economy when he takes office has to consider stimulating it with additional spending," Mr. Reich said.
"As a last resort," he said, "the President may have to temporarily enlarge the deficit. But he would do so only with a credible commitment to reduce the deficit by an even greater amount when the economy is back on track."
Mr. Reich said the economic transition team was looking into policies to reduce the budget deficit in the long term that would go beyond what Mr. Clinton proposed in the campaign. He declined to discuss specific options, although several of Mr. Clinton's advisers said the economic package would not call for increasing taxes on gasoline.
Mr. Reich said Mr. Clinton's advisers were also examining ways to encourage banks to lend more "without compromising their financial integrity."
 
Investment Tax Outlook
 And, concerned that many corporations might postpone investments until Mr. Clinton's proposed investment tax credit is legislated, Mr. Reich said such a tax credit would most likely be retroactive. This would encourage companies not to delay their investments.
Mr. Reich noted that past investment tax credits had been made retroactive for four to six months before the date they were signed into law. "I have every reason to suppose that, should an investment tax credit be proposed by the President-elect, the same principle of retroactivity would apply," he said.
The economic transition team is checking and rechecking the revenue, spending and deficit estimates contained in the economic plan that Mr. Clinton put forward during the campaign. Mr. Clinton said then that he would cut the $290 billion budget deficit in half within four years.
Several advisers acknowledged that in the campaign Mr. Clinton most likely overstated the amount the Government could collect in tax payments owed by foreign corporations.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Use Economic Conference to Build Support

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 24

 BODY:
Advisers to President-elect Bill Clinton said today that a meeting on the economy scheduled here next month, originally described as an important policy conference, would be a televised discussion aimed at building support for his economic proposals.
The conference will be held Dec. 14 and 15 in Little Rock, probably at the State House, Clinton aides announced at a news conference. It will resemble Mr. Clinton's highly successful town meetings during the campaign; he will preside over the conference and ask questions at the sessions, whose participants include what Clinton aides called "real Americans." 
 Since plans for the economic conference were first disclosed two weeks ago, it has drawn attention beyond the expectations of Clinton advisers, with well over 1,000 people asking to be invited. Clinton aides today appeared to be redefining the purpose of the event and playing down expectations. For example, at first the aides had said that the event might be closed, but today they said television news cameras would be permitted.
They also called the conference a "retreat," not the graver sounding "summit" that Clinton advisers had originally described. And they said the meeting would break into sub-sessions on four or five economic topics but that the conference would not conclude with any report or policy pronouncements.
 
Extreme Caution
 Clinton aides are said to be using extreme caution in choosing participants because some fear that the event could backfire, with attendees using the forum to make highly visible and embarrassing attacks on the incoming Administration.
While the guest list was still being put together today, people involved in the process, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said participants were certain to include John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer; John A. Young, president of Hewlett-Packard; Paul A. Allaire, chairman of Xerox; Roger W. Johnson, chairman of Western Digital; Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and John H. Bryan, chairman of Sara Lee.
Those men represent a cross-section of major executives. Mr. Johnson, for one, was a major Republican contributor who backed Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Clinton has already heard their opinions because they all served as informal advisers during the campaign.
Aides said that while the conference is being held, Mr. Clinton will privately be given a summary of economic policy options from his economic policy team, led by Robert B. Reich, a public policy expert at Harvard University.
As details of the conference were being announced today, Mr. Clinton met at the Governor's Mansion with Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who is mentioned by Clinton aides as a candidate for Treasury Secretary. Mr. Clinton met later today with Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, who is said to be under consideration for Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Energy.
It was the first time since the election that possible Cabinet appointees had openly been seen meeting here with the Governor.
Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, described the meetings as wide ranging, general discussions. In the case of Mr. Bentsen, some Clinton aides sought to discourage speculation about the Cabinet and suggested that this was nothing more than a stroking session. They said Mr. Bentsen might be more valuable to the new Administration if he stayed in the Senate.
Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona, who has also been mentioned as a candidate for a Cabinet position, arrived in Little Rock today for a meeting with Mr. Clinton on Wednesday.
Mickey Kantor, a Clinton aide who is coordinating the economic conference, said it would be neither "a negotiation or a beginning of drafting of a package." He said the participants would talk about Mr. Clinton's economic proposals with the goal of "putting some meat on the bones," and added: "This is assessment and input. And frankly, it makes sense to allow folks who are stakeholders, folks who cover the wide spectrum of this economy, to sit with the President-elect and Vice President-elect."
A senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said, "Anytime you have something that lasts a day and a half and someone says that's where the real work is going to be done, you know it's not really -- the real work is going on right now."
 
'In the National Interest'
 But Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's deputy for economic policy, insisted that the event would not turn into the public relations stunt that marred an economic conference that Gerald R. Ford held after taking office in August 1974.
"People will have to talk about what's best in the national interest, not just their special interests," Mr. Sperling said.
Michael K. Deaver, who was President Reagan's chief image consultant, said what Mr. Clinton was trying to do was not unlike his efforts during the Reagan transition.
"Reagan was a guy that was untested," Mr. Deaver said. "So we tried to have visuals of him sitting down with people who were respected. With Clinton, by identifying himself with credible people, he assumes some of that credibility. And he may learn something."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks to Avoid Increase in Subway Fares

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that he had proposed to legislative leaders a transportation financing plan that would eliminate a projected New York City Transit Authority deficit without raising bus and subway fares next year.
The Governor's plan, according to administration and legislative officials, would include an increase of 50 cents in the $2.50 toll on Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority crossings. That increase is already being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority but, unlike the M.T.A., Mr. Cuomo would exempt the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn. 
 Mr. Cuomo would tap a number of other sources to close the Transit Authority's $266 million projected deficit, including a commuter rail surplus, proceeds generated by the state's petroleum business tax, New York City transportation money and pension-related contributions, and Transit Authority budget cuts.
Legislative officials said the plan would defer a fare increase until January 1995, two months after the next gubernatorial election.
The Governor, just back from a six-day trade mission to Italy, called a news conference today to warn legislators that a fare increase would be unavoidable if they did not return to Albany to address the complex and politically volatile issue of transportation financing.
"If they refuse to come, or came to a special session and refused to act, I believe the fare goes up automatically by the end of the year," he said.
Aides to both Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican, said they had received only preliminary briefings on Mr. Cuomo's plan.
The transportation issue pits New York City Democrats who want to avoid subway and bus fare increases against suburban and upstate Republicans who are more concerned about financing for commuter railroads and highway construction.
The issue also is inseparable from the 1993 mayoral race in New York City. Republicans would love to saddle Mayor David N. Dinkins, a Democrat, with a fare increase just before next September's primary.
A major issue in dealing with the Transit Authority's deficit is the Legislature's appropriation of approximately $700 million that will be generated this year by the petroleum business tax. Under legislation passed in 1991, when the tax was imposed to help close a budget gap, the proceeds must be dedicated to transportation needs beginning this April, the start of the fiscal year.
Mr. Cuomo has proposed using some of that money to close the Transit Authority deficit. But he has also proposed rescinding the 1991 agreement so the tax money could be used to balance the state's 1993-94 budget.
Mr. Cuomo said today that the change would be no different from promises that were broken in the past, including repeated deferrals by Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature of a scheduled income tax cut. "If you are hit by a calamity, as we were, a recession, you have to make new judgments," he said.
Cuomo administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Governor had proposed funneling more than half of the petroleum business tax revenue into the state's general fund next year. One legislative source said Mr. Cuomo would dedicate $535 million to the general fund and $74 million to the Transit Authority deficit, leaving less than $100 million in tax proceeds for other transportation needs.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Taps Played For Radio's Lush Format

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
"ELEVATOR MUSIC" has had a long, successful ride in the fractious New York radio market. But the demands of advertisers, reflecting significant changes in the consumers who are the stations' listeners, are announcing, "last stop, everyone out" for artists like the 101 Strings and Mantovani and their lush, Muzak-like instrumental recordings.
The metropolitan region's final purveyor of elevator music, a format also known in the radio industry as beautiful music or easy listening, is Park Communications's WPAT, which simulcasts its programming on 930 on the AM dial and 93.1 on the FM dial. For almost four decades, those sweet sounds -- described by somnolent announcers as "In the air, everywhere" -- brought high ratings and, consequently, robust advertising revenue, despite dismissals from fans of less saccharine music who derided orchestral versions of pop standards like "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," "I Feel Pretty" and "The Way We Were." 
 But now WPAT is remixing its music, introducing a format it calls "soft 'n' easy," doubling the time for recordings by vocalists to around 50 percent of air time; adding more contemporary singers like Elton John, Bette Midler and Bonnie Raitt, and updating the remaining instrumental sounds by eliminating almost all pre-1960 recordings.
"We're calling it bringing easy listening into the 90's," Gene Hobicorn, general manager at WPAT, said in a telephone interview from his office in Clifton, N.J.
"After doing audience research," he added, "we came to the conclusion that listeners would spend more time with us if we made it a more interesting place to come to." To promote the changes, a campaign by Dick Levy Advertising in New York promises "all the soft favorites of yesterday and today." Television commercials have begun on local stations, and print advertisements are scheduled to start running next week.
WPAT's shifts underscore a reality in radio summarized by the phrase "You are what you play." The format of a station determines its audience; for instance, younger men prefer heavy-metal rock 'n' roll, while older women prefer soft-rock vocals from the 1960's and 1970's.
Bluntly put, elevator music appeals most to listeners aged 55 and older, a demographic segment as attractive to advertisers as an hour of Percy Faith playing "Laura" would be to Axl Rose. WPAT-AM and FM were eighth in average share among listeners 12 years and older, according to Arbitron ratings this summer, but ranked second with adults 50 and older, behind only talk-radio WOR-AM.
So if older listeners, disconcerted by the change in sounds, are replaced by younger ones, Park Communications would be as thrilled as a singer whose new release goes platinum.
"It's pure economics," said J. T. Anderton, managing editor at Radio Business Report Inc., an industry newsletter in Springfield, Va. "Far and away, the most frequent request from advertising agencies is to reach people 25 to 54. So the easy-listening stations haven't been able to command advertising rates as high as those on stations with younger listeners."
Indeed, local radio executives estimate advertising revenue for WPAT- AM and FM at $6 million to $8 million this year, compared with $22 million or more for the market's most popular stations like WCBS-FM, which plays the "golden oldies" favored by free-spending baby boomers.
Since only about 175 of the nation's approximately 9,700 commercial stations still broadcast in the easy-listening format, Mr. Anderton said, "It's fair to say it's fading from the scene." Among others abandoning elevator music, he listed WGAY-FM in Washington and WMVX-FM in New York, a former rival of WPAT when it was WRFM.
WPAT's new ad campaign emphasizes artists the stations have never played before, Dick Levy, president and creative director at Dick Levy Advertising, said.
"You don't expect to find Michael Bolton on WPAT," he explained, referring to the belting balladeer. "Now it's an exciting place for advertisers and agencies to put their commercials."
Both Mr. Levy and Mr. Hobicorn stressed that the new format was very much a work in progress. For instance, Mr. Hobicorn is still wondering whether to play contemporary artists' recordings of pre-1960 music, like Harry Connick Jr. performing "It Had to Be You."
One exception has already been made, he said: Pre-1960 songs by Johnny Mathis, "a mainstay of this station," are staying, a decision that will, no doubt, leave listeners "Misty"-eyed.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Schools Face Insolvency and a Takeover

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The nation's second-largest school system stands on the verge of fiscal collapse.
The system, the Los Angeles Unified School District, says it will declare itself insolvent on Wednesday if a state judge permanently orders it to reverse a 12 percent pay cut imposed on teachers. The State of California would then take over the system. 
 If that happens, it will be by far the largest school district in the United States to go bankrupt, and the ultimate cry of agony from the far-flung system of 641,206 pupils and 651 schools that has been struggling for years against overwhelming forces of urban decay, racial division, bitterly divided school-board politics and now financial ruin.
These problems have been aggravated by the fiscal problems of the state, which has been forced to cut the funds it gives to local districts.
In a last-ditch bid to avert insolvency, the California State Board of Education in Sacramento held an emergency meeting today, its first ever, and agreed to waive three provisions of the state education code. By doing so the board hoped to change the opinion of Superior Court Judge Stephen E. O'Neil, who precipitated the crisis on Nov. 5 when he issued a temporary restraining order holding that the district had illegally cut teacher salaries and ordering it to issue supplemental paychecks totaling $20 million by today.
 
Strike Authorized
 Judge O'Neil is expected to rule Wednesday on the teachers' union motion to make the order permanent.
The 34,000-member union, the United Teachers-Los Angeles, has authorized a strike over the pay cut, which was imposed last month by the district's seven-member board to bridge a $400 million shortfall in its $3.9 billion budget. Teachers have been working without a contract since Sept. 30.
In an interview, the president of the board, Leticia Quezada, said schools would run out of money before the school year ends if Judge O'Neil rules against them. "Then we will be in bankruptcy," she said. "This whole issue has tremendous implications for the entire State of California."
While a state takeover would not mean padlocking schoolhouse doors, it would have devastating effects on the struggling system and its pupils, half of whom enter kindergarten without speaking English and half of whom live in poverty.
The state, itself hobbling along with almost no reserves, is almost certain to order further stringent economies and would probably abrogate union contracts, cutting pay and laying off staff. Under a new state law, an insolvent school district must cede authority on all financial matters to the county superintendent of schools, who acts for the state. In the case of Los Angeles County, that person is Stuart E. Gothold, and he informed the district last Thursday that he would intercede if the judge rules adversely on Wednesday.
When the Richmond Unified School District, near San Francisco, went bankrupt in 1991, the state took over and lent the district money but ordered a 9 percent pay cut for all employees, shortened school hours and reduced staff and support services.
In the past five years, states have taken over 10 school districts for financial reasons, and another five districts for deficient academic performance, said Chris Pipho, an analyst at the Education Commission for the States in Denver. In New Jersey, Paterson and Jersey City are under state authority.
Los Angeles teachers maintain they are being made to pay for inefficiency and a sluggish administrative bureaucracy, and that sports and other extracurricular activities should be cut first. In an interview, Helen Bernstein, president of the union, said pay would drop from 9th-highest to 42d-highest among the 43 school districts in Los Angeles County.
"Why are we taking such a massive pay cut?" she said, noting that it would discourage good teachers from teaching in the city's schools. "It does not take a wizard to figure out that the priorities are all mixed up."
 
Frustration at School
 The teachers won a total of 24 percent in raises between 1988 and 1991, leaving the district facing high salaries and declining revenues now. According to the American Federation of Teachers, the salaries for veteran Los Angeles teachers rank 11th among major American cities, at $45,239 a year, and first for beginning teachers, $29,529 (compared to $49,353 and $26,238 for New York City, which has the nation's largest school system). The cuts would reduce the pay to about $40,000 for experienced teachers and $26,000 for beginners, and health benefits would be trimmed, too.
The frustration of teachers was apparent this morning at the Ulysses S. Grant High School in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles.
"The union is jumping up and down for money that the district doesn't have, that the state doesn't have, and that the country doesn't have," said Jonnie Johns, a third-year English teacher who takes home about $19,000 a year after taxes. "Everybody is putting their head in the sand, bickering over dollars, and they're not facing the truth, that the system is collapsing. We're out of money, we're out of morality, we're out of everything."
Ms. Quezada, the board president, said that the board had been very generous with teachers in the past. "Our track record does not say we like to cut pay," she said. "But given the financial conditions, this was the last resort."
A state takeover would damage the union, because further budget cuts would presumably be imposed said Ms. Bernstein, but many teachers would prefer that to the fractious board. "Most teachers will tell you they'd want someone to come in and reorganize it," she said.
In Sacramento, the State Board of Education, meeting at the request of the Los Angeles district, voted 9 to 0 to waive three provisions of the education code that union lawyers had used to win the restraining order. One of them states that local boards can reduce salaries before the beginning of a school year but not after that.
The district argues that the matter should be settled by the Public Employment Relations Board, a state agency, not the courts, and urged teachers to use "caution" in spending the supplemental salary checks distributed today under court order because the money would be recovered by deductions from future checks should the board prevail in court.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Lower On Rumors of Devaluations

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower yesterday after a day in which traders were confused by conflicting rumors that various European currencies would be devalued.
Gold prices settled little changed. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $334.43 an ounce, off 10 cents from Monday. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put gold unchanged at $334.50. 
 The dollar is normally sought as a haven from European currency turmoil, but the current high European interest rates checked the flight.
Andrew Hodge at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York said the European tension would not subside until Germany made its interest-rate policy clear. "Would the Bundesbank cut rates Wednesday in its money-market operation or after its council meeting on Thursday?" he asked. "The market waits to find out."
Rapid growth in Germany's M-3 money supply, reported yesterday, threw some doubt at those who believe a cut will be coming soon. That M-3 figure rose an annualized 10.2 percent in October. The 1992 target was 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent.
In New York, the dollar finished at 1.5942 German marks in late trading, down from 1.5972 on Monday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124 yen yesterday. The market was closed on Monday. Later in London, it rose to 124.08 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar was quoted at 123.85 yen, down from 124.05 on Monday.
In London, the British pound eased to $1.5155 from $1.5165.
In New York, the dollar edged up to 1.2878 Canadian dollars, from 1.2875. Several major Canadian banks raised their prime lending rate to 9.75 percent from 9 percent.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4293 Swiss francs, down from 1.434; 5.4115 French francs, down from 5.4265, and 1,383 Italian lire, down from 1,384.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Turns to Industry Experience to Lure Films Back to City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
New York City turned yesterday to a member of the film industry to head the Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting to draw back major television and film production, which has largely abandoned the city in search of cheaper locations.
The selection of Richard Brick, a 47-year-old New York native, ends a long and troubled search, led by Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. 
 His mandate was to find a director as familiar with Hollywood as with the problems affecting the industry in New York, which at least remains in the hearts of studio executives in one sense. Many are disguising their new locales to look like New York.
The former chairman of Columbia University's graduate film division and a member of the Directors Guild of America, Mr. Brick was chosen for his diverse background in production, his work as a creative artist on several acclaimed feature films, his connections in the entertainment industry and his familiarity with New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins said.
 
'I Am Not the Messiah'
 But it might ultimately be his marketing skills that determine whether he succeeds in a job that city officials say had helped generate up to $3 billion a year.
Understandably, the expectations surrounding this appointment have become enormous, Mr. Brick said at a news conference with Mr. Dinkins.
"But I have to be frank; I am not the messiah," he said. "But what I do offer is an appreciation of the complexities of the problems facing this industry." Once a great magnet for attracting producers to its neighborhoods and landmarks, the city has been caught between a sagging economy and several labor disputes, a combination that has driven most of the larger studios, like Universal and Columbia, to locations that studio officials say are more economically hospitable.
And from a New Yorker's perspective, imagine the impudence of it all, using urban backdrops in places like Chicago and Baltimore as the streets of New York.
"Even my son can tell the difference," said Mr. Brick, an adjunct professor at Columbia, whose wife, Sara Bershtell, and 11-year-old son, Noah, accompanied him. Among his more recent credits, Mr. Brick produced "Hangin' with the Homeboys," a 1991 release filmed in the Bronx and Manhattan.
Although he cautioned not to expect miracles, Mr. Brick is taking an office with widely expanded responsibilities, so critical has the schism developed between major production companies and the city. Beyond serving as liaison between the municipal government and the studios, the principal task of his predecessors, including Nina Streich, the acting director since May 1, Mr. Brick is being charged with taking a more aggressive role in marketing and promoting to attract business back to the city.
 
Cost and Cooperation
 "The film and television industry in New York City is not as strong as it once was, and we're facing competition," Mr. Sullivan said. "New York City is perceived to be expensive or uncooperative. The task before us is to figure out how specifically we can bolster the production levels of the city."
It might require more patience than energy. A major studio executive in Los Angeles, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited several reasons that New York should remain the primary choice for major projects of urban motif, but he overstruck them with the grimmer realities of current economic conditions and the cost of doing business in New York that he claimed was higher than elsewhere.
In effect, he concluded, it might not matter who serves as chief of the department.
While Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Brick said that higher production costs in New York were more perception than reality, they both acknowledged the ugly landscape that mutes the difference. As the sluggish economy was nibbling away at New York's relations with the major production companies through last year, a seven-month labor dispute between studios and several theatrical unions through May of last year devoured almost everything else. A result was a virtual shutdown of all major projects in the city, leaving independent producers as the chief operators.
Even now, a dispute between studios and Teamsters Local 817 in New York remains unresolved, although an agreement is expected shortly.
The choice of a new head for the relatively low-budget office became the subject of intense controversy after local film makers protested that four finalists chosen in June by a nine-member search committee simply were not up to the job.
Mr. Brick's long career includes work as a sound technician and boom operator -- both union jobs -- followed by positions as a location manager for the 1980 film "Ragtime"; production manager in 1982 for the film "Silkwood" and the television mini-series, "Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last," and unit production manager on the 1983 film "Places in the Heart."
Along the way, he befriended all sorts of important people in the entertainment industry, the kind of people he wants to attract by convincing them, as he said, that the issue of cost has been misperceived.
Jaynne C. Keyes, who held the post until seven months ago, hailed Mr. Brick's selection.
"Richard has a great understanding of the industry," she said. "I've worked with him when he was producing, and he understands the business as few who work in film do."
Ms. Keyes, who now is a motion picture agent with the William Morris Agency here, said of Mr. Brick's challenges:
"Film is an industry that is movable back, as it was movable away. We can get 'em back as well as we've lost 'em. New York is the film capital of the world; it has the power and the location."
Citing the many quality actors and technicians in the metropolitan area, Mr. Brick said studios need to be shown that they can produce projects in New York at levels comparable to cities that have siphoned off projects that might have otherwise been produced in New York.
He will need more than luck to succeed, the studio executive said.
"New York has a strong labor pool, and a lot of talented people live there," he said. "People like Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee are committed to doing movies there. But it's the general economy that's going to have more to do with it than anything."

HEADLINE: Ambitious Talk on College Loans

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Throughout the Presidential campaign, it was one of Bill Clinton's biggest applause lines: junk existing loan programs and replace them with a new plan that gives every American the chance to go to college, if he or she is willing to give something in return.
It was a classic Clinton message of benefit and sacrifice, and it also played to the hearts of middle-class voters worried about paying for their children's college educations. 
 As he makes the transition from candidate to President, Mr. Clinton has signaled that he intends to pursue his plan to revamp the college loan program -- a plan whose central feature would allow students to wipe out their loans by performing public service -- even though early analysis shows it is not as generous, innovative or inclusive as he has made it out to be.
At his first post-election news conference, on Nov. 12, Mr. Clinton put the college plan just behind economic growth, the deficit, health care and political reform on his priority list.
 
Details to Be Decided
 Later in the session he leveled with reporters about how much work still needed to be done on the loan plan. "How much money should everybody be able to borrow a year?" he asked. "What contributions should people's families be expected to make, if any? If you put this into effect, how are you going to keep the colleges and universities of this country from using it as an excuse to explode tuition even more? I mean, there are lots of factual questions."
For all the political capital Mr. Clinton has invested in the loan program, and all the enthusiastic response, the details remain sketchy.
At its most basic, the President-elect's plan sets out to do three things:
*Make tuition loans available to everyone, regardless of income.
*Allow students to pay back the loans at rates that vary with their incomes.
*Give students the option of repaying all or part of their loans by taking community-service jobs that provide stipends for living expenses.
In one form or another, the provisions have been tried before or are available in a limited way now. What makes the Clinton plan different, and what gets college administrators excited, is that it brings together several ideas that have had wide support and proposes to carry them out full tilt with the solid backing of the President.
At a recent meeting at New York University, several college presidents expressed support for the Clinton plan, which they predicted would be Mr. Clinton's major higher education initiative. But they worried about its cost.
Mr. Clinton has said the plan will cost around $12 billion a year when it is in place, more than double that of the current program, which has a price tag of $4 billion to $5 billion a year.
 
Doubt on Cost Projections
 The incoming Administration figures that the loan part of the program will roughly pay for itself; that is, loan repayments would cover the cost of new loans over time. Education experts say this may not be true, and experience has shown loan programs to be more expensive than their backers intended.
Mr. Clinton's advisers also assume that loan defaults, which now cost around $3 billion a year, would be reduced because the repayments would be collected by the Internal Revenue Service along with Federal income tax returns.
The new costs, about $8 billion a year, would cover the creation of a National Service Trust. Clinton officials said students could wipe out $10,000 a year or more in loans, up to a maximum of $20,000, by working after graduation at a reduced salary in some aspect of public service, say, as a teacher in an inner-city school or as a police officer in a tough neighborhood.
Currently, students who use a type of Government loan called a Perkins Loan have the option of working as teachers or in the Peace Corps to have their loans forgiven. Since 1972, the Government has canceled $238 million in loans to students who have become teachers in hard-pressed neighborhoods. But this represents a small percentage of the $15 billion in student loans made each year.
 
Participants Are Few
 Some medical schools also forgive loans if the graduate works as a doctor in a poor area, but, again, few have participated.
Service is the heart of the Clinton proposal, but many people are unsure about how well it would work. Franklyn G. Jenifer, president of Howard University, said that the volunteer service would have to be tightly restricted and that the jobs would have to constitute real service and sacrifice. L. Jay Oliva, president of New York University, said he wondered how much it would cost to train, transport and keep track of the thousands of volunteers.
There is also the cost of paying stipends, which Mr. Clinton said would be borne by the Government, not local employers.
Members of Mr. Clinton's staff said the community service program would probably be limited to about 250,000 participants, but they see little likelihood that even that many would participate, given the record of involvement in similar programs.
How attractive would it be for students to give up two years of income -- around $35,000 for an entering teacher in many places -- to wipe out a $20,000 loan that they could pay back over 20 years at a cost to them of roughly $1,000 a year? How many would be willing to live in inner cities or poor rural areas and subsist on a small stipend to cover room, board and all other costs?
 
Level of Interest Questioned
 "I suspect there are some people who will look at this and say, I don't want to do that," said Dallas Martin, president of the National Association Student Financial Aid Administrators.
While service repayment makes up the bulk of Mr. Clinton's estimated cost, the more traditional loans will affect far more students. Here Mr. Clinton has adopted the same basic idea proposed by his chief economic adviser, Robert Reich, and Senator Bill Bradley, and tried by at least 11 universities on a small scale.
In essence, the plan allows college students to pay back tuition loans at different rates, depending on how much they earn after they graduate. For example, if two university students each borrow $40,000 while in college but one becomes a social worker after college and the other a corporate lawyer, the lawyer would have to make larger payments. To insure that the loans are repaid, Mr. Clinton has said he would have the Internal Revenue Service collect the payments.
The idea of income-contingent loans has been tried. In 1973, Yale University, using its own money, began offering students the option of repaying loans at interest rates based on their incomes after graduation. Donald McM. Routh, university director of financial aid, said that between 1973 and 1978, Yale made 3,602 such loans to undergraduates, graduate students and students in professional schools.
 
'Very Complex Program'
 "What we learned is that this is a very complex program to administer," Mr. Routh said. The biggest single problem was getting the tax returns from the borrowers each year to determine their income. It also proved difficult to make fine distinctions about income, like whether to take into account all or part of a spouse's income.
Yale discontinued the program, he said, because it was more expensive than expected and took longer to reach the break-even point where loan repayments equaled new loans.
In the late 1980's, the Federal Government selected 10 colleges and universities and ran the same type of loan program with the same results. A study showed that collecting income information was an administrative nightmare.
Officials in the Department of Education are already working on such details because the Higher Education Reauthorization Act passed last summer experiments with loans in several ways, including keying repayments to income. In one project a group of universities will be allowed to lend money directly to students, bypassing the banks that now make most loans.
Education officials said they would need a year to draw up the regulations that will govern the new program. The first loans will not be available before the spring of 1994.

HEADLINE: Bank Money Market Yields Mixed for Coming Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
New yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit will be set today at levels flat with last week in the New York area and up slightly from those in other areas.
Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor said the average certificate of deposit yield last week rose 2 to 3 basis points. Last week marked the fifth consecutive week of rises in the five-year C.D., a sign that the downslide of the last 43 months has ended. (The latest rate will be posted today.) 
 But the recent results suggest this will be more of a quiet rise than a sharp upturn, analysts say, adding that a more substantial rise is not likely until next year. Right now, with the economy weak and inflation low, these analysts said, the Federal Reserve knows that if it raises rates too soon, it will risk derailing the recovery and perhaps pushing the economy back into recession.
 
Another Rise at Treasury Auction
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates moved up for the seventh consecutive week. The auction is often viewed as a harbinger of how banks could set their savings rates in the weeks ahead.
The average discount rate at auction for a three-month bill jumped to 3.27 percent, from 3.13 percent at the previous auction, while the six-month bill rose to 3.45 percent, from 3.37 percent.
Few changes are reported in the New York area: the combined average yields of both commercial and savings banks show a money-market account and three-month C.D. both unchanged at 2.77 percent and 2.85 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the six-month certificate slipped a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 3 percent.
The largest changes this week will be at European American Bank, which pared its money-market account 11 basis points, to 2.58 percent; at Bank of Tokyo, which recently cut its three-month certificate 6 basis points, to 2.96 percent, and at Midlantic of New Jersey, where a six-month certificate sank 15 basis points, to 3.25 percent.
Outside New York, yields at 20 large banks tell a different story. An average money-market account is up a basis point, to 2.68 percent, and the average six-month C.D. has risen 2 basis points, to 2.98 percent.

HEADLINE: Man Guilty Of Murder Of Woman In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
An unemployed handyman was convicted yesterday of murdering a Hasidic woman, who was stabbed to death during a burglary in her apartment in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.
More than 30 spectators, many of them women from the Hasidic community in Crown Heights, sat quietly in the small, fourth-floor courtroom as the jury found the defendant, Romane LaFond, guilty of killing Phyllis LaPine while committing a burglary in her home on Feb. 6. 
 In a corridor outside the courtroom moments after the verdict, the victim's husband, Dennis LaPine, said his wife's death left "a big void" for him and their four children, but "at least now there's justice." He added softly, "The soul of my wife can have a complete rest."
"I want to thank the jury for doing justice," Mr. LaPine said. And he said the verdict provided "a resurgence of hope in the American jury system."
 
Tensions in the Community
 He was apparently alluding to the acquittal of Lemrick Nelson Jr. in the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum, a Hasidic scholar stabbed to death in August 1991. He was slain in a racial disturbance after a black child, Gavin Cato, was accidentally killed by a car driven by another Hasidic man in Crown Heights.
The murder of Mrs. LaPine was not considered a racial incident, but it increased tensions in Crown Heights because the defendant was black and the community remained troubled in the aftermath of the racial disturbances last year.
Mr. LaFond, a 24-year-old resident of Crown Heights, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison for Mrs. LaPine's murder. Justice Francis X. Egitto, who conducted the eight-day trial in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, scheduled the sentencing for Dec. 14.
The prosecutors, Michael Vecchione and Jon Besunder, presented evidence by a fingerprint expert that a bloody palm print found on the wall next to Mrs. LaPine's body was the print of Mr. LaFond.
 
Identification by a Witness
 "LaFond convicted himself when he left that palm print," Mr. Vecchione observed after the verdict. He praised the police investigation for providing the prosecution with "the tools to do the job."
The defense lawyer, Samuel Gregory, said he would appeal the conviction. He said the palm print showed that Mr. LaFond had been in the apartment but that it did not prove he committed the murder.
Mrs. LaPine was killed when she returned to her home at 680 Lefferts Avenue after shopping at a supermarket. Her assailant stabbed her repeatedly, spattering a wall with blood. A credit card was missing from her pocketbook.
Testifying for the prosecution, a 16-year-old student, Odino Brown, identified Mr. LaFond as a man he saw running through a backyard near the LaPine home on the afternoon of the murder. Mr. Brown said that the defendant was holding a stick in his right hand and that "he had blood on his hand."
 
Seven Hours' Deliberation
 The trial's most poignant testimony came from a witness who recalled finding Mrs. LaPine's 2-year-old daughter singing a children's song, alone in a bedroom next to the hallway where the victim's body lay on the floor.
The jury deliberated for seven hours on charges that included a legal distinction between an intentional murder, which means deliberately intending to kill someone, and a murder committed as part of a felony, such as burglary. Either murder charge carries the same sentence.
There was a brief gasp from the spectator section when the jury announced that the verdict was not guilty on the first count, intentional murder, but that was quickly followed by a guilty verdict on the second count, murder in the course of a felony. The verdict on the third count, burglary, was also guilty.
One man in the rear of the courtroom started to applaud after the verdict. But the judge, who maintained strict order throughout the trial, quickly ordered a court officer to remove him from the courtroom.

Air Rivals Matching Fare Cuts

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines agreed yesterday to match the winter discounts America West Airlines disclosed on Monday.
All the major airlines have now agreed to offer the discounts, which average 30 percent, on competing routes. The debt-plagued industry thus finds itself holding another sale less than a week after it retreated from an attempt to raise fares as much as $30 on connecting flights. 
 "It used to be that people made travel plans well in advance, but now the carriers are vaccinating the public to wait for the next white sale before they travel," Richard P. Friese, publisher of Travel Agent magazine, said. While such sales are a bonanza for travelers, he added, in the long run they could prove disastrous for passengers and carriers alike.
 
Conditioning Travelers
 The notion that passengers have become conditioned to wait for each new sale before buying tickets has been widespread within the travel industry since last summer's half-price sale. That sale generated record boardings but in trimming margins added to the financial woes of an industry that according to the chairman of American Airlines, Robert L. Crandall, "has lost $7 billion since Jan. 1, 1990."
The new nonrefundable fares will be available in 475 of America West's 1,000 markets. They require a 14-day advance purchase by Dec. 11 for travel between Dec. 7 and Feb. 4 and require a Saturday night stay. Round-trip fares between New York and Los Angeles, for instance, will fall to $348 from $500 previously, and fares between Boston and Las Vegas, Nev., will drop to $338 from $490.
If the fare cuts are not as deep or as wide as those of last summer, some travel officials say they were prompted by similar concerns about the economy. The industry's load factor, the percentage of available seats filled by passengers, through October 1992 increased only 1.3 percentage points from the period a year earlier.
 
'Some Sticker Shock'
 Yet Kevin Murphy, airline analyst for Morgan Stanley, noted that average revenue per passenger mile on domestic fares rose to 13.2 cents last month from 10.6 cents in August. "That means that when the airlines raised prices after the fare wars, they probably created some sticker shock," Mr. Murphy said. "And with the economy still not recovered, they probably felt they had to offer this week's excursion fares to get people back on planes."
The real test of whether the airline industry is on the road to recovery, Mr. Murphy said, will occur by the end of next summer. "Without a profitable third and fourth quarter next year," he said, "even some of the well-known better-capitalized carriers may have to make major structural changes."
The AMR Corporation's American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, is already studying such changes. It recently laid off 1,000 managers, and a recent issue of the weekly World Airline News quotes Mr. Crandall as telling employees that American is considering closing hubs, paring domestic operations and possiblly selling off parts of the company.

Midmonth Vehicle Sales Up by 4.8%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built vehicles rose 4.8 percent in mid-November, led by a sharp increase in sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. But car sales remained sluggish.
The outcome of the Presidential election does not seem to have motivated consumers, as was expected by many retail dealers. "The slightest thing stops a deal from going through," said Scott Lawson, general manager of Island Chevrolet-Buick-Pontiac in Fernandina Beach, Fla. 
 Domestic light-truck sales rose 14.4 percent, to 116,171, while domestic car sales fell 1.3 percent, to 157,452. Overall vehicle sales were 273,623 for the period of Nov. 11-20, compared with 260,968 last year.
 
Annual Selling Rate
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 5.8 million, up from 5.6 million in early November. Last year in the period, car sales were running at an annual rate of 5.9 million.
"November is clearly weaker than October," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "We're seeing one step forward, one step back. The recovery remains gradual."
The National Automobile Dealers Association called mid-November sales unimpressive. Citing positive consumer confidence numbers released today, the trade group said it hoped "numerous small-ticket purchases in December" would lead "to a stronger economy and more big-ticket purchases in our industry's all-important spring selling season."
The General Motors Corporation, the No. 1 auto maker, whose corporate restructuring has produced somber headlines, reported a strong gain in the sales of light trucks but a sharp drop in car sales. Every G.M. car brand but Cadillac and Saturn posted declines. Overall car sales fell 14.4 percent, to 67,144, while light-truck sales rose 11.5 percent, to 42,738.
The Ford Motor Company's car sales gained 21 percent, to 44,645, while light-truck sales fell a scant seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 36,492. Sales of the Ford Taurus rose 50 percent for the period, with the company providing sales incentives on the model in an attempt to overtake the Honda Accord as the top-selling model in the United States.
Sales for the Chrysler Corporation, which does not report 10-day figures, were estimated at 18,500 cars, up 15.3 percent, and 29,200 light trucks, up 34.3 percent, by Ward's Automotive Reports. Chrysler reports sales only once a month.
 
Japanese Companies

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
THIS, in case you didn't know it, is champagne time. Or, to be precise, sparkling-wine time. By the end of the year, Americans will have polished off some 173 million bottles of champagne and sparkling wine, 57 million of them from now to the end of December. Not bad for a recession year.
What's more, Americans are probably going to drink more this year than last. Only a tiny bit more, to be sure, but then, sparkling-wine consumption had been dropping steadily since 1985. That year, we popped almost 220 million champagne corks. 
 These numbers come to you courtesy of the Jobson Beverage Group, which puts out a batch of trade publications for the wine and spirits industry. The figures for 1992 are Jobson's projections. Industry economists follow this stuff religiously, of course, but what can the rest of us learn? A steady decline through the late '80s and a modest turnaround this year: the stock market is said to follow hemlines, so maybe champagne can tell us something about the economy.
According to Jobson's number crunchers, consumption this year will be up a minuscule eight-tenths of 1 percent, about 1.3 million bottles. And the increase will all be in domestic wine. Sales of imported sparkling wine continue to drop, but only about 2.6 percent for the year. Last year, imports were off 16.6 percent, and the year before, 12.3 percent.
Domestic sparkling wines will show a gain of about 2 percent, Jobson says. They were up a bit last year, too: eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Jobson estimates consumption of domestic sparkling wines to be about 11 million cases, or 130 million bottles, and that of imports to be about 3.6 million, or 43 million bottles.
Americans drink better than three times more domestic sparkling wine than they do imported. It's not hard to understand why: price and distribution favor the local product. There are drinkable domestic sparkling wines for under $5, and the people who produce them, like E.& J. Gallo, make sure they are in every corner of the country. The imports -- even the least expensive, roughly $7 -- start with a Federal excise tax and duties of 92 cents.
The big surprise, assuming Jobson's figures are on track, is in French imports, which it expects to show a 14 percent increase. Much of that is in non-Champagne sparkling wines, mostly from the Loire Valley, but Champagne figures are expected to show an improvement, too. The big drop is in Spanish sparkling wine -- cava -- which is expected to be down 25 percent.
Some of this loss may be attributed to the fact that the biggest Spanish companies, Codorniu and Freixenet, are competing with themselves. Both now have large sparkling-wine operations in California. But then, so do some of the Champagne houses, among them Mumm, Moet & Chandon, Deutz, Roederer, Piper Heidseick, Taittinger and Lanson.
Price may account for the improved showing by domestic sparkling wine, but only partly. Jobson suggests new brands may have helped and mentions Gallo's Eden Roc and Domaine Ste. Michelle from Washington State.
Quality has to be a factor, as well. Domestic sparkling wines have improved markedly in recent years, to a point where the best of them can best lesser Champagnes in blind tastings. They are helped by the fact that the quality of Champagne has suffered in recent years. Some of the obscure labels turning up in wine shops should never have been allowed to leave France. They compromise the reputations of the good Champagnes.
The best American sparkling wines -- most of them, anyway -- come from California. And now, even some of the best are getting better.
Domaine Chandon, Moet & Chandon's American cousin, has introduced l'Etoile, a non-vintage special cuvee, or blend, in a special bottle, costing about $25. Domaine Chandon's best regular bottling, Chandon Reserve, sells for about $17.
New this year is J. Schram, a special cuvee from Schramsberg Vineyards that will be released only in the best vintages. On sale now is the 1987 vintage, a very elegant wine, beautifully packaged in a special bottle. The price: a hefty $50. For more modest budgets, there is Schramsberg's lovely Blanc de Blancs 1987 for about $25.
One of the surprises of the year is a sparkling wine from, of all places, New Mexico. It's called Gruet after its producer, Laurent Gruet, who came to New Mexico from Champagne. The wine is good to drink, and an excellent conversation piece. It is about $13 for the brut, a bit more for the blanc de noirs.
The various French branches, if that's the proper term, and the Spanish companies, as well, all produce good sparkling wines. In a recent tasting, Domaine Carneros, Taittinger's American venture, came off particularly well. It sells for about $17. There are those who insist that Codorniu and Gloria Ferrer, Freixenet's California winery, do better than their mentors back in Spain. Codorniu's Napa Brut is around $15 and the Gloria Ferrer Royal Cuvee Brut is around $13.
Year in and year out, some of California's best sparkling wines are from Iron Horse, in Sonoma County's Green Valley. The top of the Iron Horse line is a blanc de noirs called Wedding Cuvee, but the regular vintage brut, a pinot noir and chardonnay blend, is a particularly agreeable wine at about $19 for the 1988.
Up in Mendocino County, Roederer Estate makes a delightful brut that sells for about $16 and, just down the road, John Scharffenberger makes a variety of sparkling wines, including a cremant, which is softer than a regular champagne, a blanc de blancs and a brut. The brut is easiest to find, and it sells for about $13.
 
TASTINGS
Chateau Gloria, St. Julien 1989, in double magnum. About $85.
 Want to make tomorrow's dinner truly memorable? Pick up this bottle of Chateau Gloria and dazzle everyone at the table. A double magnum is the equivalent of four regular bottles, and it is a striking sight on anyone's sideboard. The wine itself needs no introduction to Bordeaux fans. Henri Martin, who died last year, created Gloria virtually single-handedly, and the wine has never lost its popularity. It has all the attributes of a good St. Julien: medium body, richness, never harsh or tannic and ready to drink at a fairly young age. That's important with big bottles; they hold so much wine in proportion to the amount of air under the cork that they age a bit more slowly than smaller bottles. Don't buy a big bottle unless you are sure the wine will be consumed. Leftover wine does not keep well in a large bottle: there is too much air in it. The wine should be decanted into a smaller bottle and tightly corked.

On the Bum, or the Next Train Through
Playwrights Horizons
416 West 42d Street
Clinton
Through Dec. 13
 
Written by Neal Bell; directed by Don Scardino; set by Allen Moyer; costumes by Sharon Lynch; lighting by Kenneth Posner; sound by John Gromada; production stage manager, Dianne Trulock. Presented by Playwrights Horizons, Mr. Scardino, artistic director; Paul S. Daniels, executive director.
 
WITH: Bill Buell, William Duell, Jim Fyfe, Kevin Geer, John Benjamin Hickey, Robert Hogan, Cynthia Nixon, James Rebhorn, Joyce Reehling, Ross Salinger, Campbell Scott, Maureen Shay and J. Smith-Cameron. 
 Eleanor Ames (Cynthia Nixon), the protagonist of Neal Bell's comedy "On the Bum, or the Next Train Through" is an unemployed actress in Depression-era New York City who hops a freight train to the Middle Western town of Bumfork to work in a production sponsored by the Federal Theater Project. The play turns out to be a ludicrous verse drama by a local matron named Jessie Mae Burst (Joyce Reehling). "And then again she may not," goes the running joke after each mention of her name. Jessie Mae's play memorializes an actual flood that devastated the town many years earlier when a dam collapsed.
Some of the funniest scenes in "On the Bum" are the poor actors' singsong recitations of Jessie Mae's "Pyramus and Thisbe"-style verses, with rhymes like "struggle" and "gluggle."
But beneath its raucous humor, "On the Bum" reaches for deeper connections between the depressed cultural climate of 1938 and present-day America, and especially the wary relationship between the Federal Government and the theater. The plot assumes undertones of a thriller when Eleanor begins to suspect that the flood was no act of God but involved skulduggery and a cover-up by people in high places. But because the play's political implications aren't developed until late in the second act and are treated so cursorily, the savage edge of Mr. Bell's humor fails to register.
What the play shows in abundance, however, is the playwright's ear for the poetry of idiomatic American speech. The language of the play is a torrent of colliding styles elevated to a comic poetic rhetoric that is as energized as it is self-conscious. The vernacular game-playing begins in the opening scene where Eleanor, supervised by a pretentious pseudo-English director (Campbell Scott), is rehearsing a rustic comedy whose characters speak in a cartoonishly twangy "L'il Abner" dialect.
"On the Bum" is the inaugural production of Playwrights Horizons under its new artistic director, Don Scardino. In his ingenious and economical production, designed by Allen Moyer, 13 actors assume 35 roles. Ms. Nixon makes an appealingly feisty Candide-like figure. Mr. Scott is commanding in dual roles as the pompous director and as Eleanor's married sweetheart in Bumfork.
The play's staging as a sort of thinking person's vaudeville show echoes the language's riotous ring, as the actors are rolled on and off on giant platforms draped with Edward Hopper-like paintings of rural America. Wonderfully acted with oratorical flourishes that recall the glory days of network radio, and spiced with a soundtrack of vintage swing music, "On the Bum" boldly reimagines an era when people, stimulated by magic voices on the airwaves, really cared about how they spoke.

Six for Women

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
So much is contained in a small story Bishop P. Francis Murphy recounted recently in Commonweal magazine. The Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore asked a class of first graders the number of sacraments, a question as elementary to Catholic schoolchildren as the ABC's.
"One little girl promptly responded: 'Six for women and seven for men,' " the Bishop wrote. 
 What a smart little girl. The gender-specific sacrament is ordination, the one that makes men Catholic priests. Bishop Murphy believes that is wrong. Of the ordination of women he writes, "Justice demands it."
But he is still in the minority, and last week, when the American bishops rejected their own pastoral letter on the role of women, the dis-ease of the Catholic hierarchy with half its people was made painfully manifest.
Since the National Conference of Catholic Bishops was founded in 1966, it has wrestled with issues of social welfare, armed conflict and economic justice. But the pastoral letter on women is the first in its history on which the conference has been unable to reach consensus, falling far short of the two-thirds majority needed for approval. By the time it had been drafted and redrafted, homogenized and Vatican-vetted, its vitality was gone and its supporters nearly outnumbered by those who thought it more divisive than illuminating.
And while many of the bishops preferred to focus on other issues, the pastoral letter had at its heart what has become for some Catholic women the most obvious symbol of church patriarchy, the refusal to consider the ordination of women.
The new catechism reads, "The Lord Jesus chose men to form the college of the 12 apostles. . . . The Church acknowledges that it is bound by this choice of the Lord Himself." As though the single-sex Congress of the early days of the Republic inevitably dictated that Congress should remain so today, the church, at its most literal-minded, considers the New Testament in a vacuum, divorced from the mores of its times, the larger lessons of Christianity and the overarching issue of humanity.
Stretch this, and you can argue that stories that Christ was a carpenter dictate that only those skilled with hand tools shall be called to the priesthood. It ignores the fact that Catholicism is not powered by the literal facts of Jesus' life alone, facts that vary from gospel to gospel. Its engine is its ethos, an ethos at odds with discrimination that, no matter how cloaked in unbroken tradition, is nothing more than gender prejudice made theological writ.
This is precisely what those who oppose the ordination of women would expect me to say. The Auxiliary Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend, John R. Sheets, recently described some proponents of ordination for women as "those whose stridency hints at something more at work than theological clarification." And the failed pastoral letter itself took aim at radical feminism. How much easier to dismiss us as fringe elements than to consider in a thoughtful fashion the more troubling question of exclusion as tradition.
The remarkable thing is how many of those seen as malcontents have stayed within the church of our mothers. In an earlier, more vivid version of the pastoral letter, many women were quoted. One said, "As I reflect upon my experience as a Catholic woman what stands out the most for me is that I choose to participate in an institution that is discriminating against me as a woman."
That child Bishop Murphy quotes cannot even be an altar girl. That is indefensible. Defend it the hierarchy does, by saying that women can serve in ways just as valuable but not identical. It is a classic separate-but-equal argument; the separation is real but the equality illusory.
"Jesus inhabited a world which was utterly different from our own," A. N. Wilson writes in his uncommonly intelligent new book, "Jesus: A Life," an exploration of both the historical figure and the Christ of faith. While some prefer to think our position is political, the truth is that it is precisely in that nexus of spirit and gospel story that many of us find the argument for the ordination of women in the Catholic Church. For it comes down to this: Can we imagine that, carrying out his mission today, the Christ of charity and unity would have restricted his circle to men alone? No. So crabbed a spirit would not have survived so long.

HEADLINE: Germans, Hazy About Past, Distrust the Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Where Are Germany's Leaders?" (editorial, Nov. 12) is right on target, but a recent business trip adds some dimensions to the call for a look within, rather than at foreigners. 
 I was told by a number of people older than 50 that from 1945 to 1966 German high school textbooks mentioned nothing about the Hitler period from 1932 to 1945: it was simply too controversial a topic. No wonder that 10 percent of the German people, according to recent polls, do not believe the Holocaust happened.
Several of my informants consider nationalism a recent reaction to a prolonged lack of German identity in the postwar period. For this some blamed the feeling of guilt harbored by a generation that lived passively through the war years. Others felt that until their recent economic pre-eminence, Germans could not hold up their heads among Europeans.
The stridency of the calls of Germany for the Germans is in part attributable to an overcompensation for the earlier feelings. What is striking is how widely it is shared by all social classes. While the tones in an upper-class household are more muted and in a suburban train more obvious toward the several Africans and Asians aboard, you encounter the emotion wherever you go.
There is an ahistoricity about all this anger toward foreigners. Not a single person within Germany -- although several Swiss mentioned this to me -- recalled that xenophobia was precisely the way that post-World War I Germany responded to its problems, and the use of that feeling Hitler made in galvanizing the country around the Nazi Party.
Lastly, there is a revulsion among ordinary citizens of every social class against politicians. No one I met had a good word for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose lying about the cost of unification and refusal to increase taxes so that his party would get re-elected, have clearly brought on the draconian monetary measures of the Bundesbank. Many other politicians came in for much the same drubbing.
No wonder that Germans sense things are not going well economically in their country and that they may be entering a recession within a year. The liberal asylum policy has brought in many people whose lack of language and other skills make them much harder to integrate than other Germans, although we have faced similar problems in Florida and California. Even East Germans -- who are still arriving at the rate of 1,000 a day -- are looked down on and discriminated against west of Berlin.
Yes, Germany needs new and better leadership. However, the followers of the new leaders will have to reckon with their own feelings and energies. It is said that people get the government they deserve. Perhaps we've just rediscovered that in the United States. Is it possible that Germans will come around to the same conclusion?

History's Pendulum Defeats Custer Again

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
It has been more than a half-century since movie audiences first saw Errol Flynn, as a dashing Gen. George Armstrong Custer, die with his boots on at the Little Big Horn, along with all those extras playing the 262 other United States cavalrymen who fell with him on June 25, 1876. That has been enough time for Americans to be made aware of a point of view other than the settlers-against-savages version long promoted by Hollywood, the popular press, traveling shows and some histories. In recent decades, it has been the Indians' turn to be romanticized.
"Last Stand at Little Big Horn," written by the producer Paul Stekler and the Blackfoot novelist James Welch, is in accord with the revised consensus without getting sappy. For the Plains Indians, says the narrator, N. Scott Momaday, the encounter with Custer was "one of many battles to prevent the theft of their land." Their hour of success was just a passing episode in a profound defeat.
The accounts of the white side come largely from the usual historical sources, embellished by photographs. The Indian version is told in stories and songs handed down through generations and is accompanied by drawings. That alone suggests the nature of the differences between the Lakota and Cheyenne peoples, who made their homes in the Montana Territory, and the pioneers and gold-seekers from the East. Yet the irreconcilable points of view have been fitted together in a coherent hour that goes beyond the brief battle at the Little Big Horn to what America's westward expansion meant for those who were simply in the way.
The program has no criticism of the cavalrymen, described as impoverished young immigrants and farm boys, who did not ride or shoot nearly so well as western movies would have it and who endured miseries in unwelcoming territory. The program makes the case that they were serving the political and economic interests of grander classes and the imperatives of an expanding nation.
As for Custer, whose image his widow, Elizabeth, dedicated herself with considerable success to polishing for more than 50 years after his death, tonight's program contributes to his debunking as a swaggering, egotistical self-promoter who rashly led his men to their deaths. Yet at the time, he was portrayed as a martyr, and the massacre of his outnumbered troopers became a pretext for wiping out the Plains Indians. A son of the Lakota leader Crazy Horse, speaking for his people, says, "Wherever we went they came to kill us."
Much of the nation seems to understand now that no just compensation is possible for what was done to America's Indians, but it is possible, at least, to tell their story in a way that treats them as human beings. Narrowly avoiding a popular tendency to demonize whites and glorify Indians, the latest offering from "The American Experience" makes an intelligent and moving contribution to that cause.

Boeing to Slow Output, Leading to Job Cuts

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that it would slow production rates on its 757 and 767 jetliners next year, resulting in the loss of an estimated 2,000 jobs in the Seattle area and 500 jobs in Wichita, Kan.
"The decision takes into account the cumulative recent requests of a number of our customers for changes in their delivery stream," said Dean Thornton, president of Boeing's commercial aircraft group. 
 Boeing's production cuts, which analysts said had been anticipated, are a reflection of a steep downturn hitting the commercial aircraft industry, which in 1989 had booked a record 1,662 orders.
Every major airline is putting orders on hold. Pratt & Whitney, one of the nation's two principal aircraft engine makers, said that in the last year $9 billion in commercial airline orders for planes using its engines alone have been deferred or canceled because of declining air travel, reduced profits and price competition among carriers.
Boeing, the industry leader, like other commercial aircraft makers, McDonnell Douglas and Europe's Airbus Industrie, is stretching out deliveries of new commercial airliners because buyers are in difficult straits. The airline industry has lost $6 billion in the last two years. The Persian Gulf war along with a sluggish world economy and half-price fare wars have left the airline industry with huge losses in recent years.
The announcement yesterday represents yet a new round of cuts by Seattle's largest manufacturing employer. Over all, Boeing's work force of 144,000 has declined by 9,000 this year. Of those, 4,900 jobs have been cut on military work and 2,500 in commercial plane building, said Russell D. Young, a company spokesman. In the Puget Sound area, 5,700 jobs were cut, but most were achieved through attrition, he said. About 2,000 jobs were eliminated by layoff.
 
Cuts to Trim Production Levels
 The new cuts will trim 757 production by 42 percent, to 5 planes a month from 8.5 a month by November 1993. Production will decline by 20 percent on the wide-body 767 to four planes a month from five.
So far, the only commercial production line left unhurt has been the company's wide-body 747, used most often on international flights. Earlier, the company had cut production of its best-selling short-range aircraft, the 737, by 33 percent, to 14 planes a month from 21.
Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst with Cowen & Company, expects further production cuts by Boeing. "The total market is in disarray," he said. "The question is, is '95 going to be a rebound? That's the earliest chance."
Susan J. Davis, a Boeing spokeswoman, said expected job losses in commercial plane-building would be higher except for the anticipated start of production next year on Boeing's new 777 long-range jetliner. The first 777 deliveries are not expected before 1995.
Boeing has so far this year delivered 373 commercial airliners and received 165 new orders. Since peaking in 1990, Boeing's backlog has declined by 20 percent. The company's backlog on Oct. 31 stood at 1,449 aircraft, compared with 1,658 as of last Dec. 31.
Separately, Boeing and its second-largest union, the Seattle Professional Engineers Employees Association, are apparently close to reaching an agreement on a new three-year contract.
The new contract calls for technicians to get a 9 percent total wage increase for the first year and engineers to get 6 percent. Both groups would receive 5 percent in the second and third years.
The union representing Boeing's engineers and technicians recommended the new contract to its membership.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday Boeing stock fell 37.5 cents, to $34.625.

HEADLINE: A STRONG UPTURN FOUND IN ECONOMY IN THIRD QUARTER

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew by a surprisingly robust 3.9 percent in the third quarter, the Government reported today, and President-elect Bill Clinton said the news might cause him to rethink his short-term plans to spur the economy.
The Commerce Department report represented an unusually large upward revision of its previous third-quarter growth estimate of 2.7 percent, which was already stronger than economists had predicted. It was by far the strongest three months of growth since President Bush took office. 
 Although Mr. Clinton said the report could change his short-term plans, he left the door open to a spending program intended to stimulate the economy. Mr. Clinton said he feared that growth could slow once again.
 
No Long-Term Change
 The President-elect also seemed anxious not to foreclose the option of short-term deficit spending if he needs to give the economy a jolt or keep his campaign promise to create jobs.
"It could have some impact on short-term judgments," Mr. Clinton told reporters in Little Rock, Ark. "But we're going to have to see if these figures tell us anything about what is likely to happen for the next year." He added that the report "won't change my long-term plans at all" to try to strengthen the nation's industrial competitiveness.'
Several other economic reports released today underlined the sense that a recovery was taking hold after three years of sluggish growth. But many economists said it was still too early to declare a turning point and a stronger recovery.
 
White House Hails News
 Nevertheless, the White House immediately trumpeted today's news as a belated confirmation of Mr. Bush's campaign assertions that the economy was doing better than other candidates acknowledged or the American people seemed to believe.
"The Bush recovery is coming on strong," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, shouted over the roar of the President's helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House as Mr. Bush headed to his family home in Maine for the Thanksgiving weekend. "I'm talking about this economy that is showing signs of life and looking good, looking strong, living up to our predictions of the last several months."
The economic news provoked wistful speculation among some Republicans who suggested that if the good economic news had come in the second quarter rather than the third quarter, President Bush might have won on Nov. 3. "President Bush's Thanksgiving turkey arrived too late," said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
The Commerce Department frequently makes upward or downward revisions in its initial estimates of gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in the nation -- as it gathers information that was not available when the first estimates are released.
Today's report raised growth estimates after more complete statistics showed that exports, business inventories and consumer spending were all higher than October's less-complete statistics showed.
The G.D.P. figures and the unemployment rate are the nation's two most closely watched statistics, providing businesses, investors and elected officials an important gauge for the health of the economy.
 
Other Healthy Reports
 In addition to the Commerce Department report, several other reports today showed the economy picking up. Sales of existing homes jumped 9.1 percent in October, to their highest level in four years, the National Association of Realtors said. New applications for state unemployment benefits fell by 12,000, to 374,000, during the week ended Nov. 14, the sixth decline in eight weeks, the Labor Department reported.
And those come after surveys by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan showed a significant jump in consumer confidence, which could portend a strong rise in consumer spending. In addition, on Tuesday the Government reported that orders for durable goods rose 3.9 percent in October, their biggest increase since July 1991.
"I think now we've turned a corner," Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin said in an interview. "This is a big present to President-elect Clinton as we go out the door."
But Mr. Clinton and his aides took a different view, arguing that the strong third quarter did not necessarily signal a robust recovery.
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, called the report "good news, but still probably not good enough," He said economists were "not at all clear on whether or not we're going to have real growth in the fourth quarter."
He added, "We have to wait and see and see if it's necessary" to have a stimulus program "at the beginning of the year."
 
 
Reich Is Cautious
 In an interview, Robert B. Reich, the head of Mr. Clinton's economic transition team, added, "To the extent that it's a one-time blip turning on new investments resulting in larger inventories and additional exports due to a low dollar for that particular period, then we probably can't count on that figure to signal the beginning of a buoyant recovery."
The stock market reacted favorably to today's news, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 17.56 points on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at 3,266.26.
Today's report on gross domestic product seemed to contradict suggestions by the Clinton camp that the Bush Administration had, with an eye to Election Day, overstated growth in its preliminary estimate in October, which said that output rose by 2.7 percent in the July-through-September period. Coming in the heat of the campaign, that figure stunned most economists, who were forecasting feeble growth of around 1.5 percent in the third quarter.
A final report on third-quarter gross domestic product will be issued on Dec. 22.
"These numbers show an improving economy, but hardly a booming one," Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. "The economy has grown at a rate averaging 2.75 percent over the last three quarters, that's certainly better than the last three quarters of 1991 when it averaged 1.25 percent."
 
Slower Quarter Seen
 Most economists predict that growth will slow down in the fourth quarter. "I don't think 3.9 percent is sustainable," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank. "The fourth and first quarters will be relatively sluggish. There won't be a measurable improvement in jobs and fortunes of average Americans. We're still not on Easy Street."
He predicted growth of 2 percent in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, saying the third-quarter numbers included some one-time positive factors. Inventories grew for the second consecutive quarter, government spending, especially military spending, was up sharply, partly to carry out certain expenditures by the end of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. He also suggested that some businesses are deferring investments that had been planned for the fourth-quarter because they want to wait until Congress approved Mr. Clinton's proposed income tax credits.
"There are a lot of conflicting things here," Mr. Clinton said as he was leaving what aides described as a routine checkup by his internist. "There's some increased activity. But manufacturing is still in some trouble. There's still a lot of structural layoffs planned and Boeing announced another layoff today."
Even though Bush Administration officials and many economists expect growth to be weaker in the fourth quarter, the strong third-quarter numbers could persuade Mr. Clinton to scale back any plans to create jobs through increased deficit spending.
Today's report said output rose by $47 billion in the third quarter, fueled principally by growth in consumer spending, exports and government purchases. Consumer spending was up a robust 3.7 percent, or $29.9 billion, $2.3 billion more than the October estimate. Business inventories rose by $12.4 billion, up $5.5 billion from the October estimate. Government purchases rose $7.6 billion, up 3.3 percent overall and up 6.7 percent in just military spending. Exports rose $12.8 billion, which is $10.2 billion more than the October estimate.
The Commerce Department also reported today that corporate after-tax profits, in their biggest fall in six and a half years, slumped by 6 percent, or $14 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $218.8 billion. The main reason for the decline was that Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana and Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii devastated insurance company profits and caused many companies to write off nonrepairable damage. Without the hurricanes, corporate profits would have increased by more than $20 billion.

HEADLINE: Clinton Names Team to Probe U.S. Agencies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 25

 BODY:
Beginning the real back-bending work of digging through the impacted, encrusted layers of each Federal department and agency to find out what, and who, is buried there, aides to President-elect Bill Clinton today announced the appointment of nine chief diggers, called "cluster coordinators."
The appointments come as Mr. Clinton's transition operation moved from the initial business of organizing itself to the more daunting work of actually organizing a new Government. 
 In this regard, the President-elect has begun the process of personally interviewing applicants, with a small parade of Democratic notables making its way to the Governor's Mansion Tuesday and today.
The meetings were private, and Mr. Clinton emerged in public view only once all day, to make two visits to doctors. The Governor spent about an hour in the office of Dr. Santa Cruz, an internist, before going to the office of Dr. Andrew Kumpuris, a cardiovascular specialist.
 
Ranking Cabinet Candidates
 George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's director of communications, described both doctors' visits as "just routine check-ups." Mr. Stephanopoulos said he did not know why neither appointment was listed on the President-elect's schedule. Asked specifically if the visits had come in response to any specific malady, he said no.
Three of the politicians who met with Mr. Clinton -- Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, both of whom visited today, and retiring Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, who came Tuesday -- are considered the ranking candidates for the job of Secretary of the Interior. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who was a Tuesday arrival, has been mentioned as a contender for Secretary of the Treasury.
All the visits this week were cloaked in as much secrecy as possible in the intimate confines of a small city overly populated by reporters. No visits were announced, and no statements were made afterward. Transition officials will say only that discussions are at least in part real job interviews, not merely exercises in ego-stroking. The official said more discussions were planned next week, after the Clintons return from a trip to California.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said it was safe to assume that Mr. Clinton was discussing the positions of Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Energy with Mr. Wirth, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Babbitt, and that he "wanted to discuss the economy and other issues" with Mr. Bentsen.
Mr. Clinton also took the unusual step today of recording the kind of ceremonial Thanksgiving address traditionally issued by Presidents, not Presidents-in-waiting.
"My fellow Americans, as we celebrate Thanksgiving this year, we have, as always, much to be thankful for," Mr. Clinton said in a brief speech released for radio broadcast on Thanksgiving Day. "I am especially thankful this Thanksgiving. During this last year, Hillary and I have been given the opportunity to meet many, many thousands of you all across America from all walks of life. We are forever grateful to all of you for your help, for your example, for your courage and for your friendship."
Today's appointments to the transition operation were the second wave of such. In the first, on Nov. 12, Mr. Clinton named an array of people to what were called "policy pods." Each pod oversees a specific policy area.
In today's round, nine "cluster coordinators" were named, each assigned to lead a group studying the departments and agencies in a specific area of the Federal bureaucracy.
Those named and their speciality areas were:
Franklin Delano Raines, the vice chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association, to study economic and international trade.
Samuel R. Berger, a senior foreign policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, foreign policy and national security.
Frederico F. Pena, the former Mayor of Denver, transportation.
Sally Ride, the former astronaut, science, space and technology.
James Gustave Speth, the president of the World Resources Institute, natural resources.
Johnetta B. Cole, an anthropologist and the president of Spelman College, education and labor.
Representative Tom Downey of Long Island, health, human services and housing.
Peter B. Edelman, a professor of law at Georgetown University, and Bernard W. Nussbaum, a New York corporate lawyer, justice.
Dietra Ford, a staff member of the Committee on the District of Columbia in the House of Representatives, government operations.

HEADLINE: Unit for Animal-Disease Study Trims Safeguards

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORIENT POINT, L.I.

 BODY:
When the United States Agriculture Department created a center to study foot-and-mouth disease, the deadly livestock infection, it selected Plum Island, 850 remote acres dotted with scrub pines off the northeastern tip of Long Island. The virus could be so easily transmitted, and its escape would be so catastrophic, that Congress demanded it be studied offshore.
Beyond the water barrier, there was an extensive system of precautions, including an elaborate showering procedure for employees, decontamination and a weeklong enforced quarantine for cars leaving the island. 
 But 38 years later, things have changed at Plum Island, America's bulwark against epidemics of foreign animal diseases. Interviews with past and present employees and a review of internal documents indicate that staff cutbacks have undermined the traditional safety precautions at the island and that the center's plant and equipment have deteriorated to the point that repairs are expected to cost $60 million. An internal memo from the Agriculture Department, which owns and operates the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, describes long-standing violations of environmental codes.
Much of the criticism of Plum Island comes from former union members, many of whom lost their jobs or were forced to take pay cuts when a private company took over management of the installation last year.
They point out that since the conversion, the support staff has been cut by a third, from 144 to 100, the professional fire department has been eliminated, and many of the backup systems to contain viruses have been pared away.
Moreover, documents show that the switch to a private contractor has not saved any money because of unforeseen additional costs.
While the risk of a deadly virus's reaching the wild deer or horse farms of the North Fork of Long Island is small, the far greater danger, employees say, is to workers who would be largely unprotected in the event of a fire or a release of viruses, some of which could be fatal to human beings. The Agriculture Department, however, says that while safety procedures have been relaxed, they are adequate.
Dr. C. G. Crawford, the department's deputy area director for Plum Island, defended relaxation of the safety regulations as "reasonable precautions" for a remote threat of contagion.
"I can think of a whole myriad of hypothetical situations where something might happen, and I refuse to categorically state that nothing will happen," he said. "By the same token, I believe the probability of all these events occurring at the same time is very, very remote." But some employees are disconcerted by the new approach, and Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, Democrat of Centereach, shares their fears.
Earlier this month, in response to news organizations' inquiries, he questioned whether the private contractor, the Burns and Roe Services Corporation of Oradell, N.J., could maintain an adequate support staff under its budget. He also questioned "whether cuts in staff have caused unacceptable risks in safety and security; and whether workers are being properly protected on the job."
 
The Island
 Harmful Viruses And Few Visitors

 To residents of Long Island's easternmost hamlets, Plum Island is also known as "Mystery Island," a place where no people live. With its restricted access and work rules that seem to have dropped out of "The Andromeda Strain," there have always been suspicions that the animal disease center was researching biological warfare.
To dispel those fears, Plum Island opened its doors to reporters in 1971 -- one of only three times that news organizations have been allowed to visit. The other occasions were at the center's opening in 1954, and in 1978, to reassure the public after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease on Plum Island. Dr. Crawford denied a request by The New York Times to visit the complex but said he planned to allow a reporters' tour next month.
Those who have visited the island describe a place that any science fiction writer would be proud to have imagined. In an article last July, Karl Grossman, a reporter for The Hampton Chronicle who was on the 1971 and 1978 tours, wrote about a scientist who held "a tiny vial and explained that its contents could infect 10,000 trillion cattle with foot-and-mouth disease." The scientist went on to point out that 10,000 trillion cattle "was all the cattle that lived on the planet -- indeed, all the cattle that ever lived on the planet."
To enter a laboratory or decontamination building, employees and visitors take off their clothes and don lab-supplied jump suits, underwear and slippers. They enter through an air lock, the negative air pressure sucking the good, clean air with them into the chamber while insuring that none of the air inside escapes.
 
Foreign Animal Diseases
 Workers near harmful viruses that could be transmitted through the air are supposed to wear face shields with respirators although a inspector for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found in 1988 that employees were not fitted for respirators. Upon leaving the buildings, the workers strip, pass back through the air lock, scrub their nails, spit and blow their noses to clear their respiratory systems, shower and shampoo their hair.
In addition to foot-and-mouth, scientists for the Agricultural Research Service at Plum Island study foreign animal diseases like Rift Valley fever and glanders, while the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service diagnoses meat for possible importing. Some of the diseases, like the Japanese encephalitis virus, can be transmitted to human beings, sometimes causing death, so certain employees must be vaccinated first. For other diseases, like African swine fever, no vaccines exist, so safety precautions are critical.
Until recently, animals were taken to the laboratories in relays, moved from one truck to another. This was considered safer than using a single truck because it reduced the chances of a trailer that had been near the labs carrying a virus off the island.
Jerry J. Callis, the director of Plum Island until 1988, instituted the relay system after the 1978 outbreak of foot-and-mouth and mouth disease, which led to the precautionary killing of all the animals on the island -- 200 cattle, sheep, pigs and ponies, according to news reports -- and more biocontainment.
But last month, a two-page internal memo redefined safety on Plum Island, superseding a 200-page binder of biocontainment procedures. The memo said a single trailer would deliver the animals directly from the dock at Orient Point to the laboratory buildings, and need only be hosed down -- not subjected to a more thorough decontamination -- before leaving the island.
Dr. Ron Yedloutschnig, the scientist who diagnosed the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 1978, said he could not judge current procedures on the island, since he retired two years ago. But he noted that Burns and Roe had hired a number of new and part-time employees and that contractors were building an $18 million extension on a laboratory.
 
'Highly Infectious'
 "When I was there, every person on the island was the same," Dr. Yedloutschnig said. "We all had the same safety thoughts. But today, there are fewer permanent employees. I would be more safety conscious because the people are less safety conscious. The agents we are working with are highly infectious."
Dr. Crawford said there was no reason to presume contractors or temporary employees would be less concerned about safety than veteran employees, and he noted that all must sign pledges to avoid animals off the island -- though the quarantine had been cut to three days, from seven, for all but lab workers. He also said that technological advances meant Plum Island required fewer animals and smaller amounts of viruses to carry out its research in recent years, lessening the likelihood of a virus outbreak.
 
The Vulnerabilities
Decaying Plant And Safety Flaws
 When Hurricane Bob struck in August 1991, the backup electrical systems for a lab failed for 18 hours, disabling the negative-air-pressure systems that insure viruses are contained. Although no viruses reached the mainland, the incident was a stark reminder of Plum Island's vulnerability. But the decay of the island's physical plant was known before Bob hit.
"Plum Island is the front line of defense against foreign disease agents and physical decay is evident at this installation," an Agriculture Department panel said in December 1990.
An inspection by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1988 came up with 139 violations, covering everything from exposed electrical cables to open incinerator pits and untested fire alarms. Nancy Adams, OSHA's area director, said letters from the Agriculture Department indicated that the violations had been corrected. But no inspector had returned to confirm that, she said, and Mark Fagerlin, the president of Burns and Roe, cited similar violations to explain extra expenses that his company has incurred.
 
3 Trouble Spots
 OSHA did return two months ago, prompted by a high level of workers' compensation claims. The claims, at 8.65 per hundred workers, were more than triple the average at other Government installations, said Randy Wilson, of the United States Department of Labor. Ms. Adams declined to discuss results of the September inspection.
The island's environmental practices have not fared better. An Aug. 24 memo from the agency's hazardous-waste management coordinator noted three trouble spots on the island: "improper handling of asbestos-containing material, sanitary landfills in violation of state standards and improper management of hazardous wastes."
Dr. Crawford said the repairs were under way, with Congress appropriating $6 million this year for repairs to Plum Island's plant.
 
The Contract
Looking for Ways To Reduce Costs
 The award of a contract to run Plum Island was made under a Government-mandated review that requires agencies to hire private companies if they can provide the same service for 10 percent less than the Government.
Burns and Roe proposed running Plum Island at a cost of $18.3 million over four years, beating a Government bid of $23.7 million. But a Burns and Roe "Funds Expenditure Report" dated September 1992 shows the bill at the end of its first year was $5.8 million -- $1.1 million more than the $4.7 million contract eventually awarded. Add the salaries of three quality-assurance specialists and an administrative contracting officer who oversees the private contractor for the Agriculture Department, and the cost roughly equals the department's bid for running the installation with a third more staff.
Dr. Crawford said the costs ran higher because the Agriculture Department requested more work from Burns and Roe than had been foreseen.
Mr. Fagerlin, the company's president, said that equipment on Plum Island was so neglected that maintenance and replacement costs were higher than expected.
"That was how we would do it based on what the Government said the job was," Mr. Fagerlin said of the initial proposal. "Then, when you get out there, you see what the job really is. We're always looking for ways to cut the costs of how we do business, and so is the Government."
 
'Not Like the Government'
 That is what troubles current and former employees, whose union, Local 1940 of the American Federation of Government Employees, bitterly contested the switch to a private contractor. "A private company is out to save money," said Edward L. Hollreiser, the local's former president, who lost his job with the arrival of Burns and Roe. "It's not like the Government."
"As the employees get stretched thinner and thinner, there's more likelihood of an accident," he said.
In several memos, the company said that running Plum Island was more complex and expensive than anticipated. The Government responded by scaling back its staffing demands and paying the higher costs.
For example, nine security guards who used to patrol the island round the clock have been cut back to four, with one of the two guards on the evening shift also doing laundry.
Dr. Crawford acknowledged that intruders could land a boat on the island and gain access to viruses, but he said he did not believe that it posed a serious threat. "We don't feel that guarding the island is the mission," he said.
In the switch to a private contractor, the island's professional fire department was dropped and replaced with a volunteer brigade of employees forced to assume "collateral" firefighting duties during normal workday hours. Nights and weekends there is virtually no fire protection.
 
Consultant's Warning
 The decision was made despite a March 1990 consultant's report that deemed conversion to a volunteer fire department "perhaps the worst of three options" presented. Dr. Crawford dismissed the study's warnings against a volunteer brigade, however. "Just because somebody has a report doesn't make it the answer," he said.
Mr. Fagerlin, of Burns and Roe, went further, saying he believed a score of employees who had taken a firefighting course would be more effective than a professional force, because they would likely be at the scene of a fire.
But Roger Breeze, the island's research director, expressed reservations in a memo. He wrote that generally when an alarm sounds "an ill-assorted group of people drift up wearing various items of clothing, but usually not the firefighter turnout gear we went to great trouble to provide, and mill about without apparent discipline or leadership."
Russ Ashworth, the Agriculture Department's specialist on conversions to private contractors, described the last year at Plum Island as a "challenging transition period," and said the department was monitoring the operation of the island. "It's still our hope and desire that it will prove more economical and efficient with a private contractor," he said.

HEADLINE: IRISH VOTE COVERS ABORTION QUESTION

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Nov. 25

 BODY:
As the Irish voted in a national election today, they had already been told by pollsters and other experts how they would select a new Parliament and how they would deal with three constitutional amendments that would liberalize the abortion law.
No one will know if the estimated 1.7 million voters agreed with the predicters before Thursday, when the ballot-counting begins. The results on abortion will probably be clear in the afternoon, but a close parliamentary election could drag out the count to Friday or Saturday, under a system of proportional representation that can involve 10 counts for a single seat. 
 According to the experts, the newspapers and the polls, the Irish will deny Prime Minister Albert Reynolds the 83 seats his Fianna Fail party needs for a majority. That would probably mean a coalition Government either between Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny) and the Labor Party of Dick Spring, or a mix of three or four parties excluding that of Mr. Reynolds.
On the abortion issue, approval is expected for amendments that will guarantee women the right to travel abroad for abortions, as more than 4,000 Irish women already do each year to Britain, and for the right to receive abortion clinic information in Ireland.
 
Many Questions Open
 But recent polls and politicians say the voters will disapprove the amendment that would expand the grounds for legal abortion. If that happened, abortion law would be based on a Supreme Court decision last March that ended the categorical constitutional ban on abortion, but left many questions on the legality of abortion here.
In its decision, the court overruled the Government and allowed a 14-year-old girl who said she had been raped to go to Britain for an abortion, after her doctors and lawyers said she had threatened to kill herself. The proposal voted on today does not permit suicide threats or rape or incest as legal grounds for abortion.
The two-and-a-half week campaign on politics and abortion included an incident in which Mr. Reynolds used a vulgarism to describe an opposing point of view. The public outcry was considerable, as women phoned radio stations to say that if their little boys talked like that, they would have their mouths washed out with soap. Mr. Reynolds apologized, saying he considered the word an American term for rubbish.
All the parties, recognizing that the main concern of voters in a country with 20 percent unemployment was the economy, promised to create jobs without spending too much money, while holding down taxes and mortgage rates. In the last days of the campaign, pressure increased on European money markets for a devaluation of the Irish punt, now pegged unusually high against the British pound. None of the party leaders would promise absolutely not to devalue.
 
Coalition Expected
 Outside a polling place on Killarney Street in central Dublin this afternoon, a Fianna Fail party worker handed out leaflets and said his party had "no chance" to win a majority. "It'll have to be a coalition of Labor and Fianna Fail," he said, but added that he was worried that Mr. Spring, the Labor Party leader, might not agree because "Reynolds has antagonized him" with campaign charges that Mr. Spring has called dirty tricks.
The Government proposal on expansion of the grounds for abortion was opposed by the opposing sides in the debate in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. The Pro-Life Campaign said the proposal would legalize abortion, which they consider murder. Women's groups that want to liberalize the law also opposed the Government proposal because it says abortion would be legal to save "the life as distinct from the health" of the mother.
If that amendment is defeated, the new Parliament may try to legislate a new abortion law, or it may let the issue drop, waiting for an other test case to arise. The Catholic Church deplored abortion in principle, but said people were free to vote yes or no on the three amendments.
Today, the abortion campaign continued right up to the time polls closed. At the Connolly Station in downtown Dublin, two middle-aged men handed out leaflets reminding people that Pope John Paul II opposes abortion. The Pro-Life Campaign produced a letter against abortion from Mother Teresa, the Nobel Prize winner, in Calcutta.
 
Short Campaign a Mercy
 Many people and several newspapers said that the election was unnecessary and that the short campaign was a mercy. The main parties spent about $1 million, but not a penny on television advertising.
The national network, Radio Telefis Eirann, apportions television time to the parties in relation to their strength at the last national election, in 1989. This meant that the strongest party, Fianna Fail, got a total of 24 minutes, the rest proportionately less.
There were some smiles. Early in the campaign the Government issued a new 20 (about $33) note engraved with a portrait of the 19th-century national hero Daniel O'Connell that is, all Irish agree, the spitting image of Bertie Ahern, the Finance Minister.
In its pamphlet explaining the voting system, the Department of the Environment, which is in charge of elections as well as pollution control, presented a sample ballot with sample candidates. Those familiar with James Joyce's "Ulysses" noticed that the candidates listed were all familiar, beginning on the top line: "BLOOM -- LIBERAL, Leopold Bloom of 7 Eccles Street, Dublin, Advertising Agent."

HEADLINE: Ill Effects Force Easing of Ban on Prison Smoking

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MONTPELIER, Vt., Nov. 25

 BODY:
The nation's only complete ban on smoking in prison, imposed by Vermont at its six corrections centers and two county lockups last summer, created so many problems that the state has now been forced to ease it.
Vermont imposed the statewide ban in July to counter indoor air pollution and to head off lawsuits by nonsmoking prisoners over the dangers of secondhand smoke. 
 But a thriving black market inside the prisons then pushed the price of cigarettes to $40 a pack and to as much as $3 for a single cigarette. Some prisoners used threats and violence to get tobacco, while others traded sexual favors or prescription drugs for a smoke.
As a result, State Corrections Commissioner John Gorczyk announced Tuesday that smoking would be allowed outdoors in designated areas. "We achieved our objective of clean air and smoke-free facilities," he said.
Although other states have designated no-smoking wings at their prisons, Vermont was the first to try an absolute ban.
The issue of whether a state has an obligation to restrict secondhand tobacco smoke among a captive population is before the United States Supreme Court, which is expected to rule next year on a Nevada prisoner's contention that his passive smoking endangers his health. A Federal appeals court has ruled in that case that involuntary exposure to smoke can be a constitutional violation if it poses an unreasonable health risk.
 
Marlboros? No, Tang.
 But the complete ban tried by Vermont officials posed some severe side effects. "They have increased the stress factors in here astronomically," Dana Eaton, a prisoner at the Northwest Correctional Facility in St. Albans, said last week. "We have guys in here who are even smoking coffee and Tang. They are that desperate."
Richard Turner, director of the Vermont Division of Correctional Services, confirmed prisoners' accounts that threats, violence and black-marketeering had been used to get tobacco. "That predatory behavior ranges from somebody having to deliver money to verbal pressure to physical," he said. "I'm not hearing a rampant sex thing going on, but it's not out of the realm of possibility."
Guards, like the inmates forbidden to smoke inside the prisons, were apparently the leading source of black-market cigarettes. Mr. Gorczyk and Mr. Turner acknowledged a few incidents in which guards had been caught smuggling cigarettes. "It's a problem when there's that much money to be made on a substance that's legal right outside the building," Mr. Gorczyk said.

HEADLINE: French Politicians Sound Like Farmers (i.e., Angry)

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 25

 BODY:
France's political parties today unanimously denounced a farm-trade agreement last week by the United States and the European Community, but the main conservative opposition bloc refused to endorse the Government's strategy for reversing the agreement.
While Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy promised Parliament that France would veto any broader, global trade package harmful to the country's interests, the conservative opposition voted against a confidence motion proposed by the Government, arguing that its stance was not tough enough. 
 Conservative legislators were unhappy that the Government had not pledged to veto a United States-community agreement that they regard as an attack on French agriculture. The pact calls for sharp reductions in farm subsidies, which would make it harder for France to sell its agriculture products abroad.
 
A Veto That Isn't There
 Under community rules, however, as the Government has acknowledged, France can only veto a global trade accord that may include the United States-community farm deal, not the United States agreement itself.
The trade issues are being negotiated as part of the "Uruguay round" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The aim is to lower barriers to trade, from quotas to tariffs to subsidies. With the United States-community agreement on farm subsidies, talks on a GATT accord may accelerate.
Subsidies are regarded as a trade barrier because they allow France and other countries to undercut exports from countries that limit subsidies or cannot afford them. France is the largest farm producer and exporter in the European Community.
The result of the debate today represented a new setback for Prime Minister Beregovoy, who had assured opposition legislators that a vote in favor of the motion "would in no way be interpreted as support for the general policies of the Government," but would simply show that France was united.
 
The Political Spin
 Despite this appeal, however, the farming dispute is now deeply enmeshed in domestic politics. And with a conservative coalition well placed to win crucial parliamentary elections next March, opposition leaders apparently saw an opportunity to deepen the socialist Government's problems.
Jacques Chirac, a former Prime Minister who heads the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic, brushed aside the call for "national cohesion," saying the Government had betrayed France as well as the farmers. "It has led us to capitulate once again before Washington," he said.
One unanswerable question is whether the GATT talks will drag on until after the March elections. If they do, it could become the conservative's challenge to resolve the dispute -- without shattering European unity by vetoing a GATT agreement.
Today, the opposition left itself little room for compromise.
 
The Farmers March
 After nine hours of heated debate in a crowded chamber, the confidence motion was eventually adopted tonight when a score of Communist and independent deputies backed the socialist minority to give Mr. Beregovoy 301 votes, with 251 against and 6 abstentions.
To coincide with the debate, 3,000 farmers gathered on the nearby Esplanade des Invalides to protest the farm agreement. Violence erupted when some threw stones and bottles at riot police blocking streets approaching the National Assembly. More than 50 police officers were injured.
 
A Pledge of Defense
 The main arena, however, was in Parliament, where Mr. Beregovoy referred repeatedly to the possibility of a French veto of a GATT agreement as a way of underlining his determination to defend French agriculture.
But the Prime Minister was forced to concede that the opportunity for a veto would exist only if and when a global trade package was presented to the European Community governments.
These global talks, which began in 1986, were stalled for several months by the community's long-standing squabble with the United States over farm trade, but they now are to resume Thursday in Geneva, thanks to the United States-community deal.
In reality, since nonfarming sectors of the French economy would benefit from successful completion of a GATT accord covering services, intellectual property and industry, as well as agriculture, officials in many European countries think it highly unlikely that France would use its veto.
 
Let the Crisis Come
 Mr. Beregovoy also said that on Thursday, France would request an urgent meeting of the community's foreign and agricultural ministers to address the farm-trade dispute. "We will pursue negotiations," he said. "They will be difficult. I hope they go quickly. It is not true that France is alone."
France's hopes for a quick solution, though, suffered a new blow today. Addressing the National Assembly, Mr. Beregovoy reiterated his Government's view that the agreement with Washington violated the terms of a change in the community's Common Agricultural Policy, signed last May.
Almost coincidentally, however, the community's executive commission ruled unanimously that the cut-back in the subsidized farm exports agreed on with Washington was compatible with the policy. It also supported a study showing that the agreement would not unduly harm French farmers.
 
A Lack of 'Firmness'?
 Government officials here said France's strategy would now be to play for time, in the hope not only of winning additional concessions, but also of extracting such benefits from a GATT accord that a veto would be unthinkable.
Worried that today's debate would send a message of a weak Government and a divided France, Mr. Beregovoy returned to the podium shortly before the vote to appeal to the conservative opposition to re-think its plans to vote nay, "so that the national interest can be better defended."
Speaking for the opposition, however, Charles Million, a leader of the center-right Union for French Democracy, said the Government had "lacked firmness" in the negotiations and that the Prime Minister had said nothing to deserve the confidence of legislators.

HEADLINE: Countries Agree To Hasten Steps To Guard Ozone

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
Spurred by recent evidence that the earth's protective ozone layer is being depleted even more extensively than feared, the nations of the world agreed yesterday to bring forward yet again the deadline for halting production of the most important ozone-destroying chemicals.
Meeting in Copenhagen, representatives of 87 countries moved up the phase-out deadline from the year 2000 to Jan. 1, 1996. The chemicals affected, mainly chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, are industrial chemicals widely used as refrigerants, solvents and cleaning agents. The delegates set an even earlier deadline, Jan. 1, 1994, for chemicals known as halons which are used in fire extinguishers. 
 The delegates also set a timetable for eliminating hydro-chlorofluorocarbons, or HCFC's. Industry has been relying on these chemicals as interim substitutes for the more potent ozone destroyers pending the development of permanent substitutes. HCFC's, which still deplete ozone but not as much as the chemicals they replace, are now to be eliminated in stages starting in the year 2004 and ending in 2030.
 
No Ban on Pesticide
 But the negotiators in Copenhagen refused to ban production of methyl bromide, a pesticide that had been the only known ozone-depleting chemical remaining unregulated internationally. Instead, they decided to freeze production at 1991 levels in 1995 and to consider further reductions then in light of further scientific evidence.
Scientists estimate that methyl bromide will account for 15 percent of ozone depletion in 2000, and both environmentalists and the Bush Administration had strongly advocated curbs on its production.
In practice, the new commitments under a 1987 treaty called the Montreal Protocol will not affect United States producers as much as those in some other countries, since the Bush Administration has already adopted regulations on the most important chemicals as stringent as those approved in Copenhagen.
The United States did, however, commit itself to increased payments to a fund designed to aid developing countries in adopting substitutes for the ozone-depleting subtances. The delegates voted to increase the fund to between $340 million and $500 million for the 1994-96 period, up from $240 million in the previous three-year period. The United States is expected to increase its annual contribution from the current $28 million to $40 million in the next Federal budget.
"I think it's another milestone on the way to restoring the ozone layer," William K. Reilly, the head of the American delegation, said of the overall agreement. "It's testimony that when economic considerations are uppermost, we can still make progress on the environmental front."
Environmentalists praised some aspects of the agreement but criticized others.
"It's basically half a loaf," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund. "I'm glad they did what they did with the major ozone depleters." But on the issue of methyl bromide, he said, "they left an important part of the problem unfinished and the're going to have to revisit it soon."
Dr. Oppenheimer also said that the timetable for eliminating HCFC's was too long to serve as an incentive for industry to accelerate its search for permanent substitutes.
By acting so weakly on methyl bromide, the conferees missed an opportunity to ease the ozone depletion problem just when it is expected to be worst, Liz Cook, who attended the conference as a member of Friends of the Earth, said. That is, ozone depletion is expected to get worse in the years immediately ahead, before the cutbacks in CFC's and other chemicals are fully felt and the ozone shield starts to regenerate itself. Unlike the other chemicals, methyl bromide persists in the atmosphere only a short time, and scientists believe that eliminating it now would ease the increasingly heavy immediate burden.
The United States is expected, on its own, to eliminate methyl bromide under provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990. In Copenhagen, Mr. Reilly had pressed for at least a 25 percent reduction in global production of the chemical by 2000.
By reacting with atmospheric chlorine, CFC's and the other chemicals destroy ozone that blocks the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The rays cause skin cancer and eye cataracts, and Mr. Reilly said that reductions like those agreed to in Copenhagen are expected to result in a million fewer cases of cancer and 20,000 fewer cancer deaths in the United States by the year 2075.
The original 1987 agreement under the Montreal Protocol called for a 50 percent reduction in the production of the ozone-depleting chemicals by 1998. Scientific evidence subsequently suggested that the ozone shield was depleting more rapidly than had been thought, and in 1990, in London, the treaty's signatories adopted a deadline for phasing out the major chemicals altogether for the year 2000.
Since then, alarm has grown even louder. In October 1991, scientists announced for the first time that the ozone shield had been found weaker over the United States and other temperate-zone countries in summer, when the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays are the strongest and pose the greatest danger to people and crops.
The deadlines adopted at the meeting in Denmark apply to developed countries, which produce an overwhelming share of the world's ozone-depleting chemicals.

Fukutake And Berlitz Amend Pact

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 25

 BODY:
Berlitz International Inc. and the Fukutake Publishing Company have agreed in principle to amend their merger agreement, the two companies said today.
The announcement came three weeks after Fukutake, Japan's largest educational publishing company, asked to renegotiate the deal because of weakening financial results at the Princeton-based language service business. 
 "It is the continued objective of both parties to consummate the transaction by year-end," Berlitz said in a statement.
Berlitz's shares jumped $3.625 today, to $20.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, where the 21 percent gain was the second-biggest rise of the day.
 
Increase in Sales
 On Nov. 11, Berlitz had announced that its third-quarter sales increased 11.4 percent, but its profits were off sharply because of higher operating costs and the global recession. Earnings fell 87.7 percent for the quarter, to $700,000, or 4 cents a share, from $5.7 million, or 14 cents a share, in 1991's third quarter.
Fukutake, based in Tokyo, agreed in August to purchase about 67 percent of Berlitz.
Changes in the merger plan will reduce the cash Berlitz shareholders will receive to $19.50 a share, from $21.62. Shareholders will still be entitled to receive 0.165 share of new common stock of the surviving corporation for each Berlitz share they own and a contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from the sale of three notes issued by the Maxwell Communication Corporation and its affiliates, Berlitz said. Maxwell owns just over half of Berlitz.
After the merger, existing Berlitz shareholders will own approximately 33 percent of the new common stock, Berlitz said.
The cash portion of the original deal was to have been about $413 million, based on the 19.1 million common shares Berlitz had outstanding in August. It was unclear what that figure would be under the revised agreement.

HEADLINE: Backers of Haitian Military Growing Nervous Over Refugees

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 23

 BODY:
After the overthrow of Haiti's first democratically elected President 14 months ago, members of the elite who supported the military coup laughingly cheered the exodus of thousands of desperate boat people, calling the refugees Haiti's atomic bomb.
For most of a year, the elite's expectations have proven correct. Although the United States quickly took a hard line against the coup, vowing to restore Haiti's elected Government, the appearance of a rag-tag flotilla heading for Florida abruptly relegated the reinstatement of the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to the diplomatic background. 
 For fear that increased misery would only encourage flight, the Bush Administration soon softened the hemispheric embargo imposed on Haiti, making exceptions for the light industries that employ thousands, increasing relief assistance and resisting calls by Father Aristide's backers to block oil deliveries.
 
The Elite Are Now a Target
 Now, with a new United States President preparing to take office after promising to ease Washington's policy toward the refugees, many in Haiti believe that the prospect of a renewed wave of boat people has suddenly redirected the refugee bomb at the soldiers and millionaires who have repeatedly refused a political settlement.
In the last year, diplomats say, each of the options tried by the Bush Administration for containing the refugee problem, from stockading boat people for months at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, to tying up much of the Coast Guard intercepting and returning them, has shown severe limitations in handling the 40,000 people who have set to sea in small wooden craft.
Since President-elect Bill Clinton recently renewed a campaign promise not to return Haitians summarily, which was the one Bush Administration tactic that seemed to stem the tide, Haiti's elite has braced for the prospect that a sudden refugee exodus will re-energize Washington in its efforts to reinstate the exiled President.
 
Warning From Rangel
 In a visit here last week aimed at driving that point home, Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat, said as much to Haitian military and political leaders. "I came here to tell them that the situation for them cannot get better under the new Administration," Mr. Rangel said.
If the embargo is maintained or strengthened, recent envoys have warned, it could cause a collapse of the economy and the kind of chaos that Haiti's small army could not hope to contain. Moreover, they have hinted, Washington's support for a settlement that would preserve the current military leadership over Father Aristide's objections could also be withdrawn if negotiations do not progress.
Even before the Clinton Administration takes office, Haitian political leaders and foreign diplomats say, there are signs that the message has begun to sink in. For the first time, these analysts say cautiously, military leaders may be prepared to discuss Father Aristide's eventual return.
 
Hints of Reconciliation
 Last week, in a speech commemorating Haiti's victory over Napoleon that was seen by many as conciliatory, the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, rejected new elections, a solution favored by Father Aristide's bitterest enemies, and spoke instead of negotiating an end to the crisis.
Even members of a commission here appointed by the President to represent him reacted with a hint of optimism. "We are studying it to see the extent to which it agrees with our own position," said Micha Gaillard, a member of the commission.
A few days earlier, Father Aristide's representatives, who had themselves seemed intractable, issued what diplomats say was an even more conciliatory statement. It called not only for an end of harsh repression and for the President's prompt reinstatement, but also for guarantees against "attempts at vengeance and lynching," which many coup supporters have said they fear should Father Aristide return.
"For the very first time, the two sides have begun to speak in somewhat similar language," said Rene Theodore, a Haitian political leader who had been chosen as a compromise prime minister in a failed attempt at a settlement earlier this year.
"People have realized that if, with Bush, a policy seeking the return of democracy in Haiti had allowed indefinite delay, with Clinton speaking about Haiti even before he takes office, not only will there be an engagement but it will be a priority."

HEADLINE: Teaching High School Students How to Work

SERIES: Finding What Works/Third of four articles: Apprenticeships.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In the morning, they are two high school girls with big hair, red nails, and bored looks in physics class. Sylvia Velez doodles. Susan Colarusso chews gum. They wonder what they have to gain by memorizing the difference between velocity and acceleration.
But in the afternoon they are cheerful exemplars of the job-training approach that economists, in unusual numbers, are endorsing as a tonic for the nation's ailing economy. As members of a youth apprenticeship program here, called Project ProTech, they spend part of their high school days cultivating a marketable skill, in their case as hospital technicians. 
 Traveling each day to one of the nation's premier teaching hospitals, they turn tissue samples into medical slides. They get paychecks. They complain about taxes. "We're women of the 90's," Ms. Velez said with unconcealed pride.
 
To Revive the Economy
 That at least is the hope of many job-training experts. They argue that to revive the economy the nation must not only create more jobs but also train better workers, especially high school students who do not go on to graduate from four-year colleges. These student make up 75 percent of all those who start high school, and they have seen their earnings decline sharply in recent years.
Many, including the older siblings of Ms. Velez and Ms. Colarusso, leave school disaffected, enter the work force with no special training and bounce from one low-wage job to another, year after year, before settling into unpromising occupations. Many economists believe that this not only hurts the workers' personal finances but also leaves the nation at a disadvantage in its competition with other nations that have better trained workers. While unskilled young people are now seen as a brake on the economy, properly trained, they could help power its engine.
Attempts to blend high schools and job-training have a long American history, but the record is mostly undistinguished, leading to few good jobs. Only a few thousand students are now in youth apprenticeship programs being tried in about 20 states. But what makes these programs different, their advocates say, is the intensity of the training and the goal of leading to a certifiable skill universally recognized by employers.
Students in Project ProTech are promised part-time hospital jobs during two years of high school and two years of junior college, after which they are supposed to be certified in a marketable medical skill. While Ms. Velez and Ms. Colarusso are working in histology, the study of tissues, other students work in radiology or hematology. In other parts of the country, apprenticeship programs are training students to work in machine shops or commercial printers.
President-elect Bill Clinton is so enthusiastic about the approach that he made it a frequent campaign theme and has pledged legislation that would provide about $2 billion a year to support the programs.
"It's a big deal for us," said Bruce Reed, the Clinton transition team's deputy director for domestic policy.
But it will be a formidable task to turn youth apprenticeships from a group of promising pilot projects to a common American experience. To do what the advocates want would require a fundamental reorganization of American education. It would demand a kind of cooperation among businesses, schools and Government that is common in some countries but unprecedented here.
"On the one hand, there really is a consensus that we have to do something drastic about what is the worst school-to-work-transition system in the industrial world," said Andrew Hahn, a professor of public policy at Brandeis University and an advocate of youth apprenticeships.
"But," he warns, "the technical problems of apprenticeship programs could be overwhelming: where are you going to put all these kids?"
 
Obstacles
Cost and Effort Are Substantial
 Project ProTech illustrates both the potential benefits and the likely perils of the youth apprenticeship approach. After morning classes of English, algebra and physics, Ms. Velez rides a bus downtown to Deaconess Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School.
There she joins the hospital technicians who take pieces of patients' bones and tissue, process them in chemicals, imbed them in wax and then slice them into razor-thin ribbons. She takes the shavings, attaches them to slides, dips them in dye and carefully checks the numerical coding, to be sure the slides are matched to the patients.
Her pride in her white lab coat is unmistakable, and her supervisor, Freddy Perez, says that with a year's training she is now as competent as most members of the regular staff.
"I can guarantee you a hospital would hire her," he said. "I would hire her."
Ms. Colarusso does similar work on experimental tissues in a research laboratory.
Part of ProTech's promise is that it centers on an expanding industry, health care, where future employment opportunities are likely to be plentiful. Like hospitals, many printers and machine-tool businesses have also been concerned about the availability of trained employees, and some are sponsoring apprenticeship programs, too.
But all these programs are too new to have track records. And in Boston, program officials warn that it takes considerable amounts of time and money to coordinate the three-way relationship among the schools, hopsitals and the Private Industry Council, the business group that runs ProTech. Even with a $970,000 Federal grant, the program is able to serve only 120 of the city's 15,000 high school students.
Lois Harrison-Jones, the school superintendent, speaks of ProTech admiringly but balks when asked if she would commit money from her own shrinking budget to sustain it. "If that happened, it would be at the expense of something else," she said.,
In addition, the students who participate have been selected in part because of their special motivation. ProTech applicants have to write essays, get supporting letters from teachers and families and submit to interviews by the hospital, school and industry council.
Last year 115 people applied for 70 spots. Youth apprenticeships are unlikely to help the most troubled students, since no one expects hospitals or businesses to take on the burden of training.
For Ms. Velez and Ms. Colarusso, both 18 years old, the program does seem to be having a clear, positive effect. But it is not necessarily the one intended. The students, their families and their supervisors say the program has raised their confidence and drive, but neither student is sure she wants to be a histology technician. Both are applying to four-year colleges, something they did not plan to do before entering the program, but remain uncertain about what will come next.
"I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet," Ms. Velez said.
"Yeah, there's so much," Ms. Colarusso said.
While no one denigrates the importance of general ambition, Mr. Hahn, the Brandeis professor, warns that this is not the goal of apprenticeships. "These are very expensive programs that are supposed to place people in particular jobs," he said.
 
Dead Ends
Bored in Schools, Lost in Job Market
 As the economy has shifted away from semiskilled but well-paying manufacturing jobs in the last two decades, the prospects of unskilled workers have grown correspondingly weak.
For men younger than 25 with only a high school diploma, earnings adjusted for inflation fell 28 percent from 1973 to 1986, according to calculations by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. In dollar terms their annual earnings fell from $14,937 in 1973 to $10,720 in 1986, expressed in 1985 dollars.
For high school dropouts, the decline was even more precipitous, from $11,595 in 1973 to $6,725 in 1986, a drop of 42 percent. Later figures were not available, but for both groups the decline is believed to have continued.
Like the sisters of Ms. Velez and Ms. Colarusso, most students who are not bound for college spend years after high school drifting. Miriam Misla, Ms. Velez's sister, made beds at a Hyatt hotel and worked in a candy factory, never earning more than $4.50 an hour. Karen Colarusso bounced between the Job Corps and various dead-end jobs at the local mall.
"She ran around with a bad crowd, that's why," Ms. Colarusso said. "That's what I was doing until I smartened up."
Employers often attach limited meaning to a high school degree, even when a student gets one; they may neglect to check grades, for instance, or to compare schools' reputations. And students often see little connection between what they study in class and their ability to prosper outside it.
Sitting in physics class recently, Ms. Velez and Ms. Colarusso were asked to calculate the acceleration of a person who falls from a hot-air balloon. At 76,400 feet. With no parachute. While wearing size 16 shoes.
Others in the class got up and roamed the room. One student shook his hips seductively while singing in falsetto into an imaginary microphone. The teacher explained that the clue about shoe size was a red herring, but this forced him to explain what a red herring was, and he was soon mired in a digression about the color of herring, which is silver.
Ms. Colarusso chewed gum and shrugged good-naturedly at her confusion. "Red herring = fish," she dutifully wrote in her notebook, uncertain where the information was getting her.
For students not going on to college, traditional vocational programs are intended to supply part of the solution. But the coordination between what schools teach and what employers want has been notoriously weak. Studies have estimated that as many as 70 percent of the students who graduate from these programs never work in their field of training.
Community college programs try to fill part of the gap. But most students start and stop those programs several times, and community colleges have also been accused of neglecting employers' concerns. The Federal Job Training Partnership Act tries to reach young unskilled workers, but its financing is modest and its program short-term, and a recent study showed it was actually lowering the earnings of young men.
 
Models
Which Programs Will Work in U.S.?
 The advocates of apprenticeship programs point to Germany as a model of what close school and work connections can accomplish. There, approximately two-thirds of the country's students participate in a formal apprenticeship program. It offers training in 375 occupations and a social compact promising a likely job when they are finished.
German students not planning to attend college usually choose their occupations as young as age 14. Businesses see the system as a pipeline for future employees and put up about 40 percent of the cost.
No one expects an American adaptation to be as rigid. The education system here has long considered early tracking to be a form of class oppression that consigns people to working-class lives at an early age. General education is seen as a requirement of democratic society, and American programs, like Project ProTech, would be unlikely to discourage students who decided they wanted to attend college.
Still, many schools do want to build closer links to business. The question is how?
Can school administrators and businesses overcome their mutual distrust? Where will programs find enough businesses to devote their time and money to training students? Will the businesses really hire their trainees? What happens in an economic downturn?
Businesses may have their own qualms. Given the notorious mobility of the American labor force, a Boston hospital may worry that it will spend four years training histology technicians who will then move to Florida.
And there is also the issue of standards. A true apprenticeship model assumes students can pass a single test -- as a radiology technician, say -- and then carry that credential with them anywhere in the country. But only a limited number of fields operate with such agreed-upon national credentials.
Attempts to expand them are likely to bring fractious debates over who writes the rules. And the stricter the guidelines, the greater the chance of driving capable but uncredentialed people from the field.
Despite these hurdles, some experts are optimistic. They argue the nation now has a consensus that it needs to improve its workers' skills and a President-elect who is pledging backing and a budget. "I think you can phase in a full-blown program in 5 to 10 years," said Ira Magaziner, a Providence business consultant and a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton who is on the transition team.
But Professor Hahn of Brandeis is less certain. "It's difficult to see how the movement could become institutionalized very quickly," he said.
 
Fringe Benefit
Students Gain Self-Confidence
 In addition to all else they share -- hair style, classes, and work schedule -- Ms. Colarusso and Ms. Velez have the same date of birth, Sept. 12 -- 18 years ago. Walking to their bus stop after work, they seem like a Boston version of "Laverne and Shirley," two working women so intertwined they can complete each other's sentences.
Would they fool around if they worked beside each other?
"I wouldn't," Ms. Velez said.
"No!" Ms. Colarusso interrupted.
"When I'm at work, it's at work," Ms. Velez said.
"Work in a professional manner," Ms. Colarusso said.
Before entering the program, they had only the haziest notions of what might await them in the world beyond high school. Ms. Velez's mother, who is from Puerto Rico and does not speak English, has mostly lived on public assistance. Ms. Colarusso's mother is a clerk with the Census Bureau, but her daughter knows little about what she does. "She has her own desk; that's all I know," she said.
When asked what they have learned, both students talk first about social rather than technical skills. Ms. Colarusso said that when she first started working, her nerves would flare in the presence of doctors. "Now I walk by and not get all tied up," she said.
Dean L. Manheimer, the hospital's vice president for human resources, said Deaconess's decision to join the program was born of both altruism and self-interest. "We've got a lot of jobs to fill, and we need highly technical people," he said, explaining that he sometimes recruits trained technicians from as far away as Ireland. Taking on 10 high school students who earn $6 an hour gives him the chance to train and screen potential future employees.
But he warns that letting high school students loose in hospital laboratories involves "an enormous commitment of time and resources." The students' salaries alone will cost the hospital $74,000 this year, and Mr. Manheimer estimates the program consumes another $20,000 worth of supervisors' salaries. He has paid for the program in part by shifting money to it from his recruitment budget.
Janet Saxton, Ms. Colarusso's supervisor, would not let her out of sight for months. When Ms. Saxton ran an errand, Ms. Colarusso was required to follow, so she would not be left in the laboratory alone.
Even now, her uncertainty is often evident. Pointing to a piece of tissue, she identifies it as "diaphragm -- no, diagram, right?"
"Diaphragm -- you were right the first time," Ms. Saxton said.
"She knows all the words," Ms. Colarusso said. "I'm just getting to know them."
But Ms. Saxton said her protege's skill in preparing slides allowed her to double her output over the summer. And Sheila Colarusso, her mother, is among those impressed by her daughter's rising grades and polished attitude.
"I'm shocked," she said. "This is the first time I've ever seen a school program work."
Ms. Velez, an honor roll student, is applying at four-year schools that range from Regis College in Weston, Mass., to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. At the same time, she is trying to lift her combined score of 730 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
When Mr. Perez, her supervisor, starts talking about her work, he gets so enthusiastic he often has a hard time stopping. He talks of the time a pathologist stopped by to compliment him on the slides the lab prepared for a conference. "I said, Thank Sylvia," he said, since she had made them.
But Mr. Perez's favorite story is about the day Ms. Velez had to leave the lab early and admonished him to put the bone samples into a chemical vat, a last piece of business she ordinarily performs.
"She said, 'Don't forget the bone!' " Mr. Perez said. "I said, This kid's telling me what to do!"
Sure enough, Mr. Perez forgot the bone.
And 45 minutes later an alarm clock went off inside his desk drawer. "I go to my desk," he said, "and I see this big paper: 'Freddy, don't forget the bone.' "
He beams as he tells the story, but Ms. Velez rolls her eyes.
"That's the only way he remembers -- a bell and a big note," she said. She spoke with the exasperation of a teen-ager who must suffer adults. She spoke with the confidence of someone about to become one.

Money Market Funds Show Little Movement in Yields

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields on tax-exempt money market funds edged lower in the latest week, while those on taxable funds were unchanged for a second week, according to the most recent survey by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
Tax-exempt yields slipped for the third straight week as assets rose by $619 million, to $98.1 billion. Analysts said the changes in the latest week were so slight that there did not seem to be strong forces at work. The average number of days left to maturity of securities being held in fund portfolios edged ahead to 64 from 63. 
 The seven-day average compounded yield slipped a basis point, to 2.20 percent, with the simple yield also down a basis point, to 2.17 percent. Over 30 days, the average compounded yield was up a basis point, to 2.24 percent, with the simple yield up the same amount, to 2.22 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Assuming there are no state taxes, the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket is about 3.05 percent; it is about 3.19 percent for investors in the 31 percent bracket.
 
Top Performer
 Among tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, IBC/ Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management again outperformed the rest of the group with a yield of 2.84 percent, a basis point lower than its average the previous week.
"Nothing is happening this week, although we may see a small rise in yields to reflect what is happening in the short end of the markets," Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, said. "The economic numbers now out reinforce the current hands-off policy by the Fed as the economy shows signs of life. The supply of new municipal short-term paper is steady and so is investor demand, and that is keeping yields steady."
The average seven-day compounded and simple yields for taxable money market funds were unchanged at 2.78 percent and 2.74 percent, respectively.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios remained at 63.
Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, the top-yielding fund in this category for the last month, again had the best return in the latest week, with a yield of 3.67 percent, a drop of 10 basis points from the previous week.
For government-only funds, the United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services in San Antonio, led with a yield of 3.86 percent, unchanged from a week earlier.
By comparison, current bank money market account yields are steady at 2.78 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
High-Tech Stake, Political Sizzle

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IS Bill Clinton in for clear sailing on international trade? Do not bet on it.
Last week's compromise over subsidies for France's cosseted grain farmers apparently broke the stalemate on world trade negotiations. And the momentum behind the North American Free Trade Agreement now seems almost unstoppable. 
 But conflict still lurks on the horizon, and in no small measure because this Administration is likely to be the first since World War II that is less than committed to freer trade. Indeed, trade policy sits on a natural fault running through the new Democratic coalition.
On one side is the economics and foreign policy establishment, upscale academics and Wall Street power brokers who are convinced that open trade is the best defense against stagnation and political conflict in the industrialized world. On the other are assorted economists, lawyers and lobbyists who see trade -- especially trade in high-technology goods -- as a prime battleground in the post-cold-war era. Their badge of intellectual respectability is the "new trade theory," a modern critique of the century-old logic of free trade.
While the ranks of these trade "activists" -- they do not cotton to the "protectionist" label -- may be small, their influence with Congressional Democrats, Silicon Valley industrialists and the Clinton inner circle is large. One of the rank, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, holds a key position on the Clinton transition team. And it is perhaps no coincidence that her new book, "Who's Bashing Whom?" was published by the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy research group that rarely strays far from the corridors of Democratic power.
Both sides agree that the classic rationale for protecting domestic industry -- the "we can't compete with workers who live on a bowl of rice a day" argument -- is passe. Both sides also agree that America's chronic trade deficit is driven by differences in national savings and investment rates, and is thus no indicator of foreign perfidy. But the activists part company with traditional free traders on whether the composition of trade should be a critical government concern.
The activists argue that the big winners in trade are the countries that export goods from industries that generate fat profit margins, high wages and valuable technological spinoffs. And the way to end up a winner is to use the trade laws to assure that American companies get an even break (or better) when it comes to selling high-technology products in world markets.
Japan and, more egregiously, Europe often behave as if they agree, subsidizing high-technology research, organizing joint corporate product development and fencing out foreign competition. Where the foreigners will not play by the rules, the activists say, the proper response is tit-for-tat. And that means micromanaging trade -- everything from imposing countervailing duties to negotiating "voluntary import expansion" agreements under threat of retaliation.
Paul Krugman, an economist at M.I.T. who wrote much of the book on the new trade theory, is nonetheless skeptical of its relevance. "I can always get one of my graduate students to build a model" showing how intervention might improve Americans' welfare, he said; the tricky part is preventing it from becoming a tool of special interests.
Gary Saxonhouse, a University of Michigan specialist on the Japanese economy, is less judicious in his critique of the activists. If the idea is to promote wealth-producing export industries, he says, high technology is an odd place to begin. Investments in high tech have not, on average, been particularly lucrative. And most of the jobs created by high-tech companies are assembly line drudgery -- the $7-an-hour work that Bill Clinton is pledged to replace with good jobs.
Of course, these industries also employ engineers and managers. But Mr. Saxonhouse points out that there is no particular scarcity of jobs for the highly skilled. And, ironically, by intervening to increase the demand for these skills without increasing the supply, Washington would only widen the wage divide between the skilled and unskilled.
Mr. Krugman offers a bridge for the gap that divides the free traders from the activists. The one area where the activist trade argument holds most intuitively, he suggests, is in technological spinoffs -- the extra kick other businesses get from breakthroughs in technology. But one could promote such industries with subsidies that, unlike overt protection, would be under the eye of the taxpayers and perhaps less likely than tariffs or quotas to incite foreign retaliation.
This is hardly a panacea, warns Richard Cooper, a Harvard economist. Selective subsidies, he said, require picking winners, "the classic problem of industrial policy."
Problem or not, it seems the path of least resistance for a President who seems eager -- but not too eager -- to break with past trade orthodoxies. Mr. Clinton may have gotten elected by reinventing a Democratic majority party. However, governing with the new coalition may prove to be harder than getting elected by it.

HEADLINE: How Ocean Spray Gave Cranberries Some Sparkle

 BODY:
Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. has managed to take the homely, tart-tasting little cranberry beyond the familiar sauce of the holiday season to a range of products like sherbet and yogurt, cookies and muffins and even bagels.
It recently joined the "new age" drink parade with its Refreshers, a juice drink aimed at bridging the gap between soft drinks and pure juices. 
 And coming next from Ocean Spray's testing kitchens: sweetened dried cranberries called "Craisins."
"The challenge has been to get people to use cranberries at other times of the year and in a variety of products," said John S. Llewellyn Jr., president and chief executive of Ocean Spray. "But it's often difficult to change habits."
Whatever the difficulties, Ocean Spray has had a gusher of growth over the last decade. On the strength of a rainbow of juices, coupled with this widening array of other foods, Ocean Spray recently topped sales of $1 billion, nearly triple the sales of 10 years ago.
And Ocean Spray juices are now popping up in places where consumers usually do not see them -- vending machines and convenience stores -- as part of a distribution deal with Pepsico Inc.
Individual drinks, in cans and bottles, with names like Crantastic and Mauna La'i, represent roughly $100 million, or about 10 percent, of Ocean Spray's sales, company officials said. And with the Pepsi agreement, they expect the single-serving segment to grow to 30 percent of its sales.
Emanuel Goldman, a beverage stock analyst with Paine Webber in San Francisco, said the match-up was consistent with Pepsi's desire to broaden its range of drinks.
"We're living in an age when healthy things are viewed in high esteem, and Ocean Spray has developed products that go along with this new health consciousness," Mr. Goldman said. "The challenge is how Pepsi can distribute the products through soft drink bottlers in an economically viable manner."
Mr. Goldman freely acknowledges he is a bit prejudiced. "I love the cranberry muffins," he said.
 
A Healthy Image
 Kim Haley Small, marketing manager at Pepperidge Farm Inc., said in developing its Wholesome Choice line of cookies, Pepperidge Farm looked for fruits that when baked into cookies would be both tasty and low in fat. "Consumers perceive cranberries as a wholesome, nutritious product," she said.
At General Mills Inc., which introduced cranberries into its Basic 4 cereal in 1991, it was the flavor and color that made cranberries a natural addition to a mix of grain flakes raisins, almonds, yogurt covered walnuts and apple-and-prune nuggets.
"Cranberries fit very well," said Kathryn M. Newton, a General Mills spokeswoman. "It's a good and healthy combination."
 
Native to North American
 Most of the world's cranberries are cultivated on a total of about 26,000 acres in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington and another 4,000 acres in British Columbia and other parts of Canada.
The cranberry is one of only three native wetland fruits in North America along with blueberries and grapes. Cranberries need dry soil surrounded by plenty of fresh water, so the bogs in which they grow are crisscrossed with drainage ditches.
The use of pesticides and fertilizers to grow the berries as well as the frequent -- and lengthy -- flooding of the bogs to eradicate pests is of growing concern to environmentalists and has spawned a web of regulations making it more difficult for growers to expand.
Ocean Spray, based in Lakeville and Middleboro, Mass., was founded in 1930 by as a farming cooperative and was initially run as a seasonal operation, peddling cranberry jelly for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners and selling a much tarter version of its cranberry juice.
The company later diluted and sweetened the juice with water and corn syrup and expanded its juice line in the 1960's with the introduction of a cranberry-apple juice product and other blends.
Ocean Spray remains a growers' cooperative, privately owned by 700 cranberry growers and 150 citrus growers.
 
Layers of Regulation
 Regulatory constraints have limited the industry in the United States to the modest 26,000 acres of bogs.
"We have a very complex regulatory system that requires permits from local, state and Federal Government," said Jeff Carlson, president of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association, which represents about 450 growers in Massachusetts. "Most other states do not have that multitier regulatory policy. That makes securing permits for expansion, even to reclaim abandoned cranberry bogs, very difficult."
In Massachusetts, growers need approvals from a local conservation commission, the state Environmental Protection Department and the Army Corps of Engineers.
 
A Supply Shortage
 "It has been virtually impossible in the last five years to expand cranberry production," said Jere D. Downing, executive director of the Cranberry Institute, a trade organization in East Wareham, Mass. Mr. Downing and growers expressed concern that without further expansion, the industry could face hurdles in meeting the growing demand for cranberries.
"It is an issue the cranberry industry is still grappling with," Mr. Downing said. "There is currently a shortage of fresh fruit and much debate about what expansion could mean for the industry. Right now, every berry that's grown is sold. We can't seem to grow enough."

HEADLINE: Trenton Faces Deadline on Health Care

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Forced into action by a Federal judge and the need to repair a system near collapse, the Legislature on Monday will consider a complicated and untested package of bills that may produce one of the most comprehensive programs in the nation for paying for hospital care for the poor.
The plan was shaped largely by political considerations and almost no one likes it entirely. But if the proposed measures are adopted -- and the outlook is uncertain -- the changes will be sweeping. They range from deregulating hospitals to requiring that insurance companies enroll everyone who applies, regardless of age, sex or health. 
 "It is an experiment," said Dr. Bruce Siegel, the state's acting health commissioner. "We are entering a brave new world of less regulation. No one has been in this territory before, and I hope that the Legislature will listen very carefully to the concerns that have been raised by the urban hospitals."
A senior state official described the legislation as "a political crapshoot."
"I don't think anybody knows what the effects will be," the official said. "The Legislature says it will make changes if they are necessary. But who knows what the political climate will be like in six months."
 
Debate Against a Deadline
 The package includes four bills. The most controversial, the Health Care Reform Act of 1992, would deregulate hospitals in New Jersey. It also would divert $1.6 billion over the next three years from the state's unemployment trust fund to pay for the hospital bills of the uninsured poor.
Under the old system, in operation since 1980, hospital care for about 823,000 uninsured and indigent patients in New Jersey has been paid for through a 19.1 percent surcharge on every hospital bill for an insured patient, except for those covered under Medicare. That plan was outlawed in May in a ruling by Judge Alfred M. Wolin of Federal District Court in Newark.
Supporters of the proposed changes say they could serve as a national model for health care reform, but critics say it could mean the ruination of urban hospitals and much of New Jersey's health-care system.
There is ample support for either view, and both sides today continued to amass information in preparation for a legislative debate on Monday and a vote that will come only hours before a 12-year-old plan under which New Jersey provided hospital care for its poor is due to expire.
 
A Bipartisan Effort
 Working as much under the shadow of next year's gubernatorial race as they were under that of the Federal court, Gov. Jim Florio and the Republican legislative leadership, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, opted for a bipartisan effort at health-care reform.
Some labor groups and business organizations had lobbied for raising the sales tax to 7 percent, barely six months after it was rolled back to 6 percent, to help pay for hospital care for the poor. Others favored an increase in so-called sin taxes on tobacco products, liquor and beer.
But both Mr. Florio and the Republicans rejected such an approach.
The unemployment trust fund became the most politically pleasing target, despite concerns from the Federal Department of Labor and others that tapping into it would risk its solvency.
The fund, which is used to pay benefits for people who lose their jobs, has a reserve of $2.4 billion and annual income of $1.2 billion from employer and employee contributions and interest.
To appease some critics, including the Federal Department of Labor, the negotiators added language to the bill that said if the unemployment trust fund balance fell to $1.5 billion, employers would pay a new payroll tax of 0.6 percent. But mindful of next year's gubernatorial race, even that provision does not kick in until 1994.
 
City Hospitals See Danger
 No matter where the money comes from, urban hospitals have argued that the Health Care Reform Act will be their ruin.
Under the bill, hospitals will be able to set their own prices after a one-year transition period.
Urban hospitals, which currently serve about 80 percent of the indigent uninsured, said they would be forced to increase prices steeply for their insured patients. This increase, urban hospital officials say, would drive insured patients to hospitals that are able to hold their costs down because they serve fewer poor patients. Urban hospitals fear that such a move would eventually put them out of business.
Under the current law, costs to insured patients at urban hospitals are offset by the surcharge on hospital bills, distributed through the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund. This year the fund doled out $750 million.
The bill before the Legislature on Monday would allocate $600 million for uncompensated health costs in its first year, 1993, and $500 million each of the next two years. After three years, the fund would end and hospitals would be forced to deal with the problem of uncompensated health costs on their own.
If Monday's deadline passes with no new legislation in place, the state's health-care system will be thrown into chaos, with hospitals required to serve uninsured poor patients, but with no idea how they would be paid. In addition, the state stands to lose $350 million in matching Federal funds for the money it spends on uncompensated care.
 
Republicans Bolster Support
 Without an alternative plan before him and faced with a Monday deadline and a two-thirds Republican majority in both chambers of the Legislature, Mr. Florio has given his grudging support to the plan and has said he will sign it.
If the health care act is approved, it will be over the objections of two of the most powerful lobbying groups in the state, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the State Chamber of Commerce, and without the support of some influential members of the Legislature.
"Fear of the 'T-word' has thrown the discussion of a funding source down into a cowardly level of semantics," Senator Richard J. Codey, a Democrat from West Orange, said on Monday.
"There are too many unanswered questions about what happens to the urban hospitals, what will happen to outpatient services for the poor, and what incentives there will be to provide charity care."
The Republicans spent today trying to bolster party support for the bill, especially in the Senate, and responding to a flood of criticism.
Senator C. Louis Bassano, the sponsor of the bill, issued a news release in which he responded point by point to what he described as "myths" and "complete fiction" about his bill.
"This is consumer- and provider-friendly legislation that has been crafted over the course of many months with input from lawmakers, providers, insurers and consumers," Mr. Bassano said. "While it may not be perfect, we've still not seen a viable alternative."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Light Day Despite Economic Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on world currency markets yesterday in extremely light pre-holiday trading.
Gold prices also lost ground after rising in Asian markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $333.50 an ounce, off 80 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slid 90 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $333.70. 
 The currency markets seemed to shrug off several favorable reports about the United States economy. The Commerce Department said the economy grew at a brisk 3.9 percent annual rate during the third quarter, far better than the original report and better than analysts had expected.
Separately, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes soared 9 percent in October, and the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,000 in mid-November.
"The numbers were good, and the market tried to react," Kevin Lawrie, a trader at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said. But "the market just seemed to die a slow, natural death."
Mr. Lawrie attributed the lack of interest to a dearth of participants ahead of Thanksgiving Day.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.60 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.83 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 123.75 yen, down from 123.85 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5245, from $1.5190 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.5295 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.5255.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5865 German marks, down from 1.5945; 1.4265 Swiss francs, down from 1.4290; 5.3750 French francs, down from 5.4135; 1,373.50 Italian lire, down from 1,382.00, and 1.2838 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2864.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5940 German marks, down from 1.6020; 1.4310 Swiss francs, down from 1.4370; 5.3940 French francs, down from 5.4475; 1.7895 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8025; 1,377.50 Italian lire, down from 1,389.50, and 1.2831 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2888.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 17.56; Other Indexes at Highs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Signs that the United States economy is picking up steam helped carry stocks higher yesterday for a second consecutive day.
The Nasdaq Combined Composite, Standard & Poor's 500-stock and New York Stock Exchange Composite indexes all closed at record levels. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 17.56, to 3,266.26, led by Westinghouse Electric. 
 The broader market averages were led by shares of economically sensitive automobile, electrical equipment and long-distance telephone companies. The Nasdaq composite advanced 2.39, to 648.33; the S.& P. 500 rose 1.60, to 429.19, and the New York Stock Exchange composite increased 0.86, to 236.13. The three indexes eclipsed all-time highs set on Tuesday.
Advancing common stocks outnumbered declining issues by about 4 to 3 on the Big Board. Trading was heavy considering that it was the day before Thanksgiving, with about 208 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Everybody seems to be getting optimistic about the economy and that's what the market wants," said Sid Dorr, head of institutional equities at Charles Schwab & Company in San Francisco.
The United States Commerce Department said the economy grew 3.9 percent in the third quarter, up from an originally reported 2.7 percent and the largest gain since the final quarter of 1988. The Government reported that the number of Americans filing first-time unemployment claims fell 12,000, to a seasonally adjusted 374,000, in the week ending Nov. 14.
Two private groups released additional positive news about the economy. The University of Michigan reported to clients that consumer confidence is up this month, while the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose 9.1 percent in October.
Michael Lenahan, head trader at James Capel Inc., said: "The economy finally seems to be making some progress. At the same time, interest rates are low and that's really helping the stock market." The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond is at 7.54 percent, down 22 basis points since Nov. 6. Comptronix fell 15 7/8, or 72 percent, to 6 1/8, on news that the company's board had formed a special committee to investigate allegations that senior officers intentionally overstated profits.
Westinghouse Electric rose 1 1/2, to 12 1/2, in response to a broad restructuring and management reshuffling at the financially pressed company. An analyst at Paine Webber raised his rating on Westinghouse's stock to "attractive."
Glaxo Holdings declined 1/4, to 24, after a decision by the European Patent Office in Munich to give SmithKline Beecham certain patent rights for its Kytril anti-nausea drug.
Networth Inc. doubled in its first day of trading to 16, bid up by a stampede of investors who want to own shares of a company in the sizzling market for computer networking. The stock was priced for sale at $16 a share through a group of underwriters led by Robertson, Stephens & Company. The price was artificially low because Networth's controlling shareholder, Ungermann-Bass, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tandem Computer, insisted on the $16 price.
BankAmerica soared 2 3/8, to 45 1/4, on optimism tied to the bank's decision to close about 450 of its California branches by April. Gap Inc. fell 1 3/8, to 36 1/4, after analysts at Goldman, Sachs & Company. and the First Boston Corporation reduced earnings estimates for the retail store chain.
Berlitz International Inc. surged 3 5/8, to 20 7/8. Berlitz and the Fukutake Publishing Company agreed on amended merger terms that would reduce the cash portion of the consideration that Berlitz shareholders will receive to $19.50 from $21.62 a share.

HEADLINE: A Campaign Needs Help to Give Help to the Neediest;
From Struggling Business Owners to Strapped Parents, Charities Find Many Require Aid

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
When clients first stopped calling her employment service last spring, Mitzie G. thought that the telephone was out of order. Every few hours she checked for a dial tone or crawled under her desk to examine the wiring. Sometimes she had friends ring her to make sure that the lines were working.
The truth, as she finally admitted to herself, was that the recession was destroying her business. After nearly a decade of finding jobs for the unemployed, she was joining their ranks. Would she lose her house, which symbolized how hard she had struggled for her children? 
 Mitzie G. and dozens of other single mothers walked the aisles recently at a newly opened distribution center run by Catholic Charities in Jamaica, Queens. They picked free cans of beef, chicken broth, string beans and other food off the shelves as they sought some relief from an economic slump that has often sapped them of their savings and their spirits.
"There were some days when I just locked myself in my office and cried and cried," Mitzie G. recalled, giving voice to the fears -- of hunger, homelessness and illness -- felt by many New Yorkers out of work for the first time in their lives.
Faced with seemingly endless need sowed by a stubborn recession, groups like Catholic Charities harbor their own fear: that New Yorkers will feel so overwhelmed by the despair around them that they will turn away, that each new round of discouraging statistics will only numb them even more, that they will come to accept the state of their city instead of trying to better it.
But these philanthropies prefer to believe that stories of people like Mitzie G., who has received money from Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, to pay her mortgage and is now trying to restart her business, show that even when times are tough, New Yorkers will not abandon each other.
Against this backdrop of misery and hope, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund begins its 81st annual appeal on Sunday. The seven charities that receive grants from the fund have formed a bulwark against the recession in New York City, while also continuing to care for thousands of people suffering from a host of ills, including drug addiction, AIDS and child abuse.
Despite the lingering regionwide slump, the fund mounted its most successful campaign ever last year, raising $5,083,550.81. That represented large contributions from wealthy executives, movie stars and foundations; even more, it represented a surprising surge in modest donations, gifts from minimum-wage workers, shopkeepers, office raffles and children who squirreled away pennies.
The gifts seemed to reflect the spirit of renewal that is at the heart of the fund's mission.
Last Thanksgiving, Chris Mouzon and Patricia Vincent were living in a ramshackle one-bedroom apartment in Harlem with their seven children and two other people. Fire had damaged their building, leaving their cramped apartment with poor plumbing and crumbling walls. The rooms were infested with rats and cockroaches; addicts smoked crack in the hallways.
They lived there because they had no choice.
Mr. Mouzon, 26, had lost his job in construction, an industry where the unemployment rate has skyrocketed because of the recession. His search for work had proved futile.
"I thought that pretty soon we would be out on the street," he said earlier this week.
But the Children's Aid Society soon found his family an apartment and provided them with clothing, day care and after-school care for their children, using money from the Neediest Cases. In an interview at their new home on West 118th Street in Harlem, the children said they never want to return to their old apartment.
"There was no room over there, so we couldn't play at all," said James, 8 years old, as he cuddled on the couch with Christina, 7 months; Chris Jr., 18 months, Shameka, 2, Shanna, 3, Judy, 4, and Jermaine, 7.
Mr. Mouzon smiled broadly, as if energized by the joy of his children.
"This apartment is a blessing for me," he said. "My morale is really high. It makes me feel good to see my kids happy. I feel like I've been rescued."
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund was born in the early years of this century. Then, as now, New York City seemed a striking paradox of poverty and wealth. In 1911, that contrast troubled Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, after he gave a beggar a few dollars so he could find a place to sleep on Christmas night.
Ochs soon decided that if his readers knew about the suffering around them, they would be eager to help. The next year, The Times published an article with the headline: "Santa Claus, Please Take Notice! Here are New York's 100 Neediest Cases." Within a few months, 117 contributors gave $3,630.88.
This year, with the unemployment rate in New York City at more than 10 percent and the welfare rolls at more than one million people, the seven charities aided by the fund are stretched thin. They say they must focus on basic services like food, clothing and shelter.
"What we've returned to is much more reminiscent of what this agency did during the Depression," said Thomas DeStefano, executive director of Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens.
The United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York has cut 5 percent of its programs in each of the last three years because donations have not kept pace with inflation and the growing need. That means that social workers no longer visit more than 100 homebound elderly people in Queens.
"We are no longer doing any preventive work," said Stephen Solender, the group's executive vice president. "We're in a constant triage mode. That is going to mean high costs to our society down the road."
The Children's Aid Society is so worried about hunger in poor neighborhoods that it is now serving full meals at many of its after-school programs instead of milk and cookies. The society is conducting twice as many dental exams for children as it did only a few years ago.
"People who were borderline, more and more of them have slipped below the safety net," said Philip Coltoff, the society's executive director. "Those are the people who ordinarily might not need us. Now they are at our doorsteps."

HEADLINE: Put Communities Back in Community Colleges

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Community colleges, you report Nov. 11, are being forced to restrict access, as well as their goals. You point to the need for more capacity and funds in community colleges throughout the country. 
 You present a somewhat inaccurate perspective when you declare that "with the new focus on jobs, many of the colleges seemed to have lost sight of their original academic mission," and "Now just 24 percent of community college students transfer to four-year colleges."
I remember throughout my high school and college years hearing my father, who for 25 years was president of Yuba Junior College in Marysville, Calif., and for a time president of the Northern California Junior College Association, tell me of his battles to preserve his presidency against insurgents who argued that community colleges should concentrate on academic courses in preparation for four-year colleges.
He was steadfast in holding to what he said were the primary reasons community colleges were created. They were twofold: (1) to provide the finest academic training available to prepare any student who wanted to transfer to a four-year college, and as a foundation for citizenship through more enlightened understanding of society, government and the economy, and (2) to provide practical skills and training that relate directly to the needs of local businesses and, thus, the economy.
An ancillary purpose was to serve as a center for cultural and sports events in which the community could participate, and to provide an opportunity for all who live there, no matter their age, to gain knowledge in a broad variety of subjects.
The community college in California was intended as an open system that had a continuing, dynamic relationship with its local economy and society. It has stimulated those economies and has helped weave the social fabric that unifies communities.
Unfortunately, in the inner cities there are limited numbers of community colleges and community college seats. In north Brooklyn, where I work as an urban planner, there is a population of more than one million, most of whom are poorly educated, lower-income people of African-American and Latin descent, and there is not one community college. The only institution of higher education in north Brooklyn is Medgar Evers College, a four-year institution.
In the neighborhood of Bushwick, there is an opportunity to create a new campus that might include a community college. The site is on approximately 15 acres of vacant, city-owned land unused for more than 10 years. It is adjacent to Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg, and has been the subject of discussion at various levels of government and with nonprofit organizations.
The community college is the missing link in attempts to revitalize poor and working communities of America. Expanding the community college system should become a central element of President-elect Bill Clinton's efforts to strengthen education and rebuild American cities.
It should include coordination of Federal, state and local government budget priorities. Local industries, unions and nonprofit organizations should play an integral role in the planning and programming of these new institutions.
It is not necessary to build new campuses to begin an expansion of the community college system. Public schools can be used at night and on weekends, as now occurs in Bushwick, to start these college programs with extension courses from existing institutions.
