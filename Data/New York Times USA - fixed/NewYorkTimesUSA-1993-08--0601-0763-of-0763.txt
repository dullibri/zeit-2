HEADLINE: A Welcome for Immigrants Turns to Resentment

SERIES: Reinventing California -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Rich and poor, legally or not, they came to Southern California by the millions over the last decade, foreigners in search of a better life or political refuge. The immigrants were mostly welcome at first, filling unwanted jobs in a robust economy, opening businesses and sweetening the good life in sunny California by working cheaply as maids, gardeners and dishwashers.
But today the welcome has worn out. 
 Immigrants are now widely perceived as an economic drag on taxpayers, sucking up health, school, police and other services while spreading crime, dirt and disease. With its economy struggling through the worst slump since the Great Depression, its cities battered, its government services breaking down, California, and particularly Southern California, has begun to say "no" to more immigrants.
"Illegal immigration is the hottest issue in the state," said Assemblyman Bill Morrow, who represents an affluent district stretching through Orange and San Diego Counties. "We've got to say to the Federal Government, 'If you don't close the border, we will.' "
Politicians ranging from conservative Republicans like Mr. Morrow to Democrats like California's two Senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, have been tripping over each other to offer new ideas for controlling immigration. On Aug. 17, the two Senators toured the border near San Diego with Attorney General Janet Reno and saw the capture of would-be illegal immigrants. "We've got to close our borders," said Ms. Boxer in a recent interview.
Some days earlier, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican facing a tough battle for re-election next year, made a three-day tour of Southern California, demanding that Washington reverse what he called "the rewards" for illegal immigrants by ending their medical and education benefits and calling for a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to their American-born children. Because immigration is a Federal responsibility, Governor Wilson says there is little the state can do to stem the tide.
The complaints are based mostly on the assumption that immigrants are lured here by generous public services. In fact, immigration experts and the immigrants themselves say, the main reason they come is that they need jobs and Americans are willing to hire them. And few of the remedies offered so far propose to intensify penalties on Americans who employ illegal aliens.
 
Land of Immigrants
 Nowhere are the complaints more pointed than here in California, which absorbed more than a third of the country's legal immigrants over the last decade, more than half of the refugees, and now has half of the estimated 1.3 million illegal immigrants, mostly in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.
How Southern California absorbs this wave of immigrants, mostly brown or yellow-skinned, and whether the huge flow prompts the kind of anti-immigrant violence seen recently in Germany, France and Japan, are crucial questions. The answers could presage the experience elsewhere as the United States becomes a land of ethnic diversity.
But for now, the argument by many experts that illegal immigrants do work Americans are unwilling to do, contribute more than they receive, and add to the cultural mosaic is heard less frequently as the economy here continues its slump.
Anti-immigrant fever has also taken root in the state legislature. Twenty-one bills aimed at immigrants, some patently unconstitutional, were introduced this year, mostly by conservatives who once favored immigration as good for the economy and a deterrent to unionized labor.
Many of the bills were meant to deny public housing, health care, welfare, education and drivers licenses to illegal aliens, and most either failed or have stalled for now. Hispanic lawmakers and other opponents of such legislation say that while immigrants do use health and welfare services, they come to California for one reason only: jobs. To deny them services, they argue, could cause public health problems that would lead to even greater public expense.
Some of the debate has been tinged with racism. In May, Assemblyman William J. Knight, a Republican from Palmdale, a Los Angeles suburb, caused an uproar in the legislature by circulating a piece of doggerel from a constituent mocking Hispanic immigrants. It read, in part:
Everything is mucho good.
Soon we own the neighborhood.
We have a hobby -- it's called breeding.
Welfare pay for baby feeding.
 
The Economy
A Smaller Part Of a Smaller Pie

As recently as 1985, an Urban Institute study concluded that Mexican immigration was a great boon to the California economy, meaning lower prices for goods and services, low inflation and low unemployment. But today, fewer and fewer Californians agree with that assessment.
"The economy has created the reality and perception of a zero-sum game in which citizens see themselves as pitted against immigrants," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego. "They see the quality of life declining, the state government going bankrupt. They assume it is because too many people are flooding into the state."
The pressures and stress are no less pointed for the immigrants themselves, who find themselves caught between an increasingly hostile host country and a cruel economy in their homelands.
On a recent morning in Santa Ana, the seat of Orange County, immigrants gathered on the corners and the littered parking lotsalong Euclid Avenue, waiting for work, any work -- painting houses, clearing brush, carrying lumber.
"The government is closing around," said one 29-year-old man, who would give only his first name, Francisco. He added that it had become more difficult to obtain real or counterfeit drivers licenses and Social Security cards needed to get work and state medical coverage for his wife and three children.
Still, he said, life is better for him here than it was three years ago when he gave up selling T-shirts to tourists in Acapulco at $7 a day to compete for casual jobs paying $5 an hour in Santa Ana. "There are no jobs in Mexico," he said. "I need a job for living."
Another man, like others along the street, said that there was so little work now that he had been forced to send his wife and children back home to Mexico.
 
A Shift in Thinking
 The huge flow of low-skilled immigrants into a depressed economy has begun to change the thinking among some economists. Among those who has changed his mind is George J. Borjas of the University of California, San Diego. His 1990 book, "Friends or Strangers: The Impact of Immigrants on the U.S. Economy" (Basic Books), concluded that immigrants had not undermined Americans' income or job opportunities. Now, he says there is indeed an effect.
"If we have a huge influx of unskilled immigrants, it's almost unavoidable that the unskilled labor market will be affected," he said in a recent interview.
Even as illegal immigrants are reviled, Southern Californians hire them by the thousands to mow lawns, trim trees and clean and paint their homes, as well as wash dishes and dice vegetables in restaurants. Employers often prefer them to Americans because they work hard and seldom complain.
Indeed, immigrant advocates contend that they are both exploited and blamed. "Immigrants take jobs Americans don't want," said John Palacio of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund office in Santa Ana. "They are not only blamed for economic ills, but exploited for cheap labor. But they contribute much more than they receive."
 
The Numbers
Immigrant Influx Alters a Region
 Over the last dozen years, Southern California has been swept by immigration of a magnitude not seen since New York at the turn of the century. Much of it was legal, a result of the Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986, which conferred amnesty on illegal immigrants resident here since before 1982.
The act also imposed penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants with the expectation that this would limit job opportunities and eventually slow the flow over the border. But lax enforcement and easily obtained false documents have defeated this barrier.
The immigrants have transformed the region: Russians moved to Hollywood, wealthy Iranians to the West Side of Los Angeles, Armenians to Glendale. There were also Israelis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Egyptians, Lebanese, Ukrainians, Palestinians.
But mostly the immigrants have been Mexicans and Central Americans, and in smaller numbers, Asians -- Koreans, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thais, Filipinos, Cambodians, Laotians, Hmong. And so a Little Phnom Penh sprung up in Long Beach, a Little Saigon in Westminster and an affluent, suburban Chinatown in Monterey Park. Two-thirds of the Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the United States are in California, mostly Southern California.
 
Fewer Natives
 In all, the population of California grew by a staggering 6.1 million during the 1980's, and census experts attributed 37 percent of the growth to foreign immigration. Though the state's growth has slowed since the 1990 Census, immigration has not; in 1991-92, the state gained an estimated 303,000 immigrants from other countries even as it experienced a net loss of 41,000 Americans to other states.
Of the 8.9 million legal immigrants admitted to the United States since 1989, 3.2 million -- or more than a third -- came to California. That was more than to New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois combined. More than half the 3 million illegal aliens who claimed the amnesty offered in the 1986 act settled here in California; three quarters were Mexican. And there are about 655,000 political refugees, many from Southeast Asia, nearly half those who have come to the United States since 1986.
And there are the illegal aliens, an estimated 200,000 in San Diego County alone, 9 percent of the population. The Hispanic population of Orange County has doubled in a decade, to nearly 600,000, a quarter of the population. Two-thirds are not citizens, perhaps half of them here illegally.
The foreign-born account for one of every three residents of the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area and one in five in the Anaheim-Santa Ana area in Orange County. Only the Miami area, with 45 percent, has a higher proportion of foreign-born residents; New York's population is 27 percent foreign born.
The influx is unlikely to abate soon. Without tougher controls, an additional 10 million immigrants can be expected to come to the United States during this decade, said George Vernez, an immigration analyst at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica.
 
The Backlash
'They Are Taking Jobs Away'
 Probably nowhere has the backlash against immigrants been sharper than in Orange County, where they are widely seen as having corroded a once-pleasant middle-class way of life. There have been bitter disputes over street vendors, overcrowded apartments and bilingual teaching in the public schools. Santa Ana is more than two-thirds Hispanic.
On a recent afternoon, several members of an anti-immigration group, Citizens for Action Now, gathered in Barbara A. Coe's dining room in Huntington Beach. The group claims 412 members and is one of 15 groups in the California Coalition for Immigration Reform.
"They violate our laws and demand we feed them, clothe them and educate them in their own language," Ms. Coe said. "They are taking jobs away from American citizens." She recalled telephoning seven landscapers for gardening work; most hung up, she said, when she demanded that no illegal immigrants work on her property.
An Anaheim resident named John Cosak, an inspector at a military plant, recalled a recent Sunday visit to downtown Los Angeles. "It was another country," he said. "Hispanic immigrants were having a paseo, walking on the sidewalk, eyeing each other, playing loud music. I felt displaced and alienated. They are on the attack."
To this group, the immigrants are here not just to make a living but to "reconquer" Southern California for Mexico. "The recent migrants are not immigrants," said Richard Alard, an engineer from Fountain Valley. "They are Mexicans living in America."
Hispanic advocates see racist and elitist overtones to all this. "When they say immigrants, they mean Latinos," said Harry P. Pachon, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
"They are not talking about middle-class Asian engineers, but day laborers and gardeners who make life easier for Southern Californians. They are not competing for aerospace jobs. When Hughes and Lockheed move away, those were not undocumented workers. We are looking for scapegoats."
 
The Costs
Seeing a Strain On Services
 As long as California's economy was booming and tax revenues kept pace, little public attention focused on the fiscal burden of immigration. Indeed, his Democratic detractors note that Governor Wilson, as a Senator, sponsored a amendment to the 1986 immigration act that gave permanent residency to nearly a million Mexican farm workers.
Now Mr. Wilson is asking the Federal Government for $1.4 billion that he says is owed to the state for services to refugees and immigrants demanded by Federal immigration laws and policies.
The fastest growing state expense for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare program, is for the American-born children of illegal aliens, and spending for them has nearly quintupled over the last five years. "This is a major demographic problem California has to face at some point," said Professor Borjas of San Diego.
During the 1992-1993 fiscal year, refugees, amnesty applicants, and their citizen children and children of illegal immigrants ate up 18 percent of California's welfare budget, up from 10 percent in 1987-1988. The cost was $1 billion, nearly triple five years earlier.
Under law, illegal immigrants are generally ineligible for public services, but there are many exceptions. They are entitled to "restricted benefits" under Medi-Cal, the state health program for the indigent, for emergencies and pregnancy-related problems. And a 1982 ruling by the United States Supreme Court requires local schools to educate all children, regardless of legal status. A long-standing complaint of local governments is that what taxes illegal immigrants do pay mostly go to the Federal government, leaving local agencies to carry the burden of providing services.
In a study conducted last year, the Auditor General of California put the net annual burden to the state and local governments for the 200,000 illegal aliens in San Diego County at $145.9 million. A similar study by Los Angeles County, where recent legal and illegal immigrants and their children make up a quarter of the population, put it at $947 million a year, or 31 percent of total county expenditures. Immigrants were also found to count for 23 percent of spending by school districts in the county.
Both studies failed to account for the contributions the immigrants make to the larger local economies, and a more recent and more cautious study by the Orange County Administrative Office concluded that it impossible to calculate the costs to the county but called on the Federal government to correct "the fiscal imbalance" immigrants caused.
Many of Orange County's top elected leaders see advantages to the influx of immigrants. "They still contribute as much as they are alleged to take," said Harriett Wieder, a Republican who is chairwoman of the county Board of Supervisors. But she added, "The Federal Government should be assuming more responsibility, because lax immigration enforcement has resulted in an inundation of the undocumented."
And many business people find the immigrants good customers. "They deal in cash and I don't have to worry about checks bouncing," said Chuck Linnert, owner of Linnert Roofing in the city of Orange. Still, Mr. Linnert, who says he uses only legal residents on his crews, says he often loses jobs to competitors using cheaper illegal labor.
That raises the difficult question of whether immigrants are seriously damaging the economic prospects for unskilled and semi-skilled Americans in a depressed economy, particularly for young blacks. Until now, economists have generally agreed, immigrants performed the jobs unwanted by citizens, like dishwashing, but Mr. Linnert's experience is evidence that illegal workers may be in direct competition with Americans.
Unless the United States adopts draconian border controls, there is little to suggest much will soon change. Given the differences in wages between the United States and Mexico, migration will continue for at least a decade even if the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, meant to improve economic conditions in Mexico, is ultimately approved, according to Philip Martin, an economist at the University of California at Davis.
"Regardless of Nafta," he says, "you are looking at a larger number of people coming across the borders as opposed to fewer."

Graph: "Accepting Immigrants"
 California accepted more documented immigrants than any other state for the 1983-1992 fiscal years. Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants vary widely, but some indicate that one million illegal immigrants entered the country in 1992. California was the final destination for 75 percent of all illegal immigrants in 1992. Graph tracks documented numbers of all immigrants to the U.S. and those to California, annually, since 1983.

HEADLINE: U.S. Determines China Violated Pact on Missiles

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has determined that China has violated an international arms control agreement by shipping sensitive missile technology to Pakistan and therefore must be subjected to United States economic sanctions, officials said today.
Officials said that the Administration has yet to decide on the nature of the sanctions that will be imposed on China as a result of the violation of the agreement, the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
 Under American law, the Administration is required to impose varying degrees of economic sanctions depending on the seriousness of the violation. The law also gives the Administration the authority to impose sanctions and then waive them if that is deemed to be in the national interest.
 
Strictest Penalty Not Imposed
 State Department officials met today and decided not to impose the strictest measure of economic sanctions since the intelligence agencies determined that the Chinese had not shipped actual missiles, but rather technology that would allow Pakistan to build M-11 missiles, officials said.
But even if a trade embargo is limited to electronic equipment, space systems or other technology, this could affect a multibillion-dollar market.
The State Department officials would not provide any details on sanctions since China has not been officially notified of the determination. But this evening, they began telling members of Congress of the decision to impose the measures.
And several officials confirmed that a determination had been reached that China's actions were a violation of the arms control treaty. Officials said an announcement of sanctions could come as early as Wednesday.
"I don't have any specific time when a decision concerning sanctions might be made, but I should point out that U.S. law requires us to move expeditiously," said Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman.
Although Beijing did not sign the missile control treaty, it promised last year to abide by its provisions in order to avoid trade sanctions that were about to be imposed by the Bush Administration.
After an extended internal debate over China's record on human rights and arms sales, the Clinton Administration this spring decided to grant China most-favored-nation trade status. But Mr. Clinton outlined a series of concerns, including the missile technology sales, on which he said China would be judged in future consideration of its trade status.
Though reports about the sale of the missile technology have persisted for several months, American intelligence agencies were split over whether evidence indicated a violation by China and Pakistan of the control regime.
The issue was raised by Secretary of State Warren Christopher during a meeting last month in Singapore with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. It was also discussed by Lynn E. Davis, Assistant Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, during a trip to Beijing in July.
In addition, State Department officials have recently met with representatives of Pakistan to see if they could shed light on the transfers of missile technology.
Chinese officials have consistently denied violating the arms control agreement. Last month Mr. Qian said that evidence of the transfer of M-11 technology was a fabrication. The technology in question would allow Pakistan to build the M-11 missile, which is capable of delivering an 1,100-pound nuclear warhead a maximum distance of 186 miles.
The dispute with China is similar to a recent controversy with Russia over the sale of rocket engines and technology to India. Last month, Moscow agreed not to proceed with an agreed-upon sale of rocket motors and technology, which the Indian Government said it wanted for its space program.

A Federal court overturned a law barring telephone companies from providing television programming over their networks. The ruling, which is certain to be appealed, could clear the way for an all-out race between telephone and cable television companies to provide hundreds of channels of television and two-way communications services over fiber optic networks. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Dow Hits New High At 3,638.96

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks resumed their record-setting pace yesterday, encouraged by lower interest rates and prospects for higher corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 32.98 points, to a new high of 3,638.96, surpassing the level of 3,615.48 set on Friday. The Dow set record highs in the last four trading days last week but paused on Monday to consolidate. 
 Yesterday's impetus included higher bond prices, which pushed interest rates down. [Page D14.] Also helping stocks were Deere & Company's report of a surge in third-quarter profits and improved sales figures for the nation's auto makers.
 
Wide-Ranging Advance
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 270.7 million shares, up from 212.5 million on Monday. The number of advancing issues totaled 1,301, while 698 declined.
Traders said the advance was across the full breadth of the market, with investors taking particular interest in consumer stocks and high-technology issues. Also setting highs yesterday were the Big Board composite index, up 2.24 points, to 255.15; the Standard & Poor's 500 index, up 4.54, to 459.77; the American Stock Exchange composite, up 4.69, to 453.20, and the Nasdaq composite, up 4.28, to 735.14.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist for Gruntal & Company, said "the glue that is holding this market together" is low interest rates and "the fact that Congress and the President are on vacation, so they can't possibly do any damage until after Labor Day."
 
Computer Industry Meeting
 He also noted that investor demand for high-tech stocks could have been spurred by a conference of computer networking software and hardware companies in California.
The annual meeting usually generates interest among portfolio managers, Mr. Battipaglia said, which may have been reflected in active trading yesterday in stocks listed on Nasdaq, which has a heavy number of technology issues.
"It's hard to ignore companies that have shown growth rates of 50 to 75 percent annually," Mr. Battipaglia said.
Newbridge Networking, for instance closed up 2 3/8, to 71 5/8, after hitting a 52-week high of 72 1/8. Scientific-Atlanta was up 1 3/8, to 33 1/4.
A big gain in Caterpillar, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial average, provided some of the early leadership.
Caterpillar, which closed up 1 3/4, to 82 3/8, and hit a new 52-week high of 83, accounted for much of the Dow's early advance. The company said it had begun shipping 295 tractors, parts and tools worth nearly $100 million to Russia. It was Caterpillar's largest sale to Russia since 1983, when the United States lifted its embargo of oil- and gas-related products to the former Soviet Union.
Buying in Caterpillar was also spurred by a big rise in Deere, which closed up 5 1/4, to 74, setting a new 52-week high. The farm-machine maker reported strong third-quarter earnings and announced expectations of higher production worldwide.
Deere's earnings surged to $100.1 million, or $1.31 a share, from $9.1 million, or 12 cents a share. Analysts had expected per-share earnings of 80 cents to $1. Many revised their earnings forecasts after the announcement.
General Motors, gained 1 5/8, to 46 3/4; Chrysler 7/8, to 42 1/4, and Ford, 1 5/8, to 51 3/4. The nation's auto makers reported that sales of cars and light trucks built in North America rose 5.2 percent in mid-August, recovering from weakness early in the month and resuming the moderate recovery of July.
Shares of Caldor rose to as high as 28 5/8 but closed unchanged at 28. Thomas Filandro, an analyst at Gruntal, upgraded his rating to outperform select from outperform, according to a report from the brokerage firm.
Albertson'sfell 1/2, to 55 1/2, as Smith Barney Shearson downgraded it to neutral from outperform. On Monday, the supermarket and pharmacy chain posted second-quarter earnings of 60 cents a share compared with 50 cents a year earlier.
Sodak Gaming rose 3 1/4, to 28 1/4, on news that the company had signed an agreement to distribute Innovative Gaming's video blackjack and video craps gambling machines in the United States and Canada. Innovative Gaming rose 1 1/4, to 14.
Wheeling Pittsburgh rose 1 5/8, to 12. Merrill Lynch reiterated its near long-term buy rating.
Intel fell 3/4, to 63 1/2, on reports that I.B.M. was trying to develop clones of Intel's microprocessors. Some analysts said that could put competitive pressure on Intel, which dominates the chip market.
Scientific Games, which went public yesterday with an offering of 2.5 million shares at 14, closed at 18 1/4. The company recently won a contract to supply the New York State Lottery with about $7 million of automated prize validation equipment.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Croats Again Deny A Food Delivery to Muslims

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Bosnian Croat leaders refused again today to allow a United Nations convoy deliver food to an estimated 55,000 Muslims who are reported near starvation in the eastern half of the city of Mostar.
Just hours after giving permission for the 19-truck convoy to deliver some 200 tons of food and medicine to eastern Mostar, the Bosnian Croats reneged, demanding first the return of the bodies of Croatian militiamen killed in the fighting that has raged in the city since early May. 
 "There is a strong desire from the Croats to get the bodies of their troops," the chief political officer of the United Nations force, Cedric Thornberry, said in nearby Medjugorje, where negotiations with the Croatian leaders are being held at a military base. "We thought it was settled."
[The two sides agreed to an exchange of soldiers' bodies, clearing the way for the convoy to reach Mostar on Wednesday carrying aid to both the Muslim-controlled east side and the Croatian-held west side, Reuters reported.]
[In Berlin, United States military officials reported that Air Force planes made the first drop of food to Mostar early Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. Two C-130 transports dropped more than 13,400 military rations into the city that had become the "No. 1 priority" for the food packets in Bosnia, a United States military statement said.]
 
Aid Barred Since June
 The Bosnian Croats have not allowed the United Nations to deliver aid into eastern Mostar since June, except for a token amount of medicine taken in on Saturday by Mr. Thornberry.
"The Bosnian Croats are leading us a merry dance," said Lyndall Sachs, the spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Sarajevo radio reported this afternoon that heavy fighting erupted in Mostar at 5:45 A.M. local time with an artillery attack by Bosnian Croats that claimed the lives of five children and wounded 15 civilians.
Heavy clashes lasted until this afternoon, news reports from the city said.
Sarajevo radio also reported that the Croats shelled the nearby Muslim-controlled town of Jablanica and surrounding villages and that snipers attacked people attempting to flee Mostar over mountain tracks, killing a young girl.
 
Hospital Moves to Basement
 Shelling has reportedly rendered some 60 percent of eastern Mostar's buildings uninhabitable and the makeshift local hospital has moved all its patients to the basement.
Bosnia's Foreign Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said today that changes must be made to a United Nations peace proposal before the Muslim-led Bosnian Government will accept it. The plan divides Bosnia and Herzegovina into a Serbian, a Croatian and a land-locked, Muslim-dominated Bosnian republic.
"The future Bosnian republic, the central republic, is not in my view viable either economically or geographically," Mr. Silajdzic said at a news conference. He clearly indicated that the Bosnian Government would demand that the once predominantly Muslim towns of Bijeljina, Zvornik, Visegrad, Foca, Prijedor, Sanski Most and Kljuc be joined with the proposed Bosnian state, which comprises only about a third of Bosnia and Herzegovina's prewar land area.
The Bosnian Serbs drove out nearly all of the Muslims from these towns in their so-called "ethnic cleansing" campaign during the last year.
"The lines on the map are a victory for nationalism and aggression," Mr. Silajdzic said. "Genocide is rewarded."
If these areas are not returned to Bosnian Government control, he said, the thousands of survivors who fled the attacks "will never be able to return to their homes."
Mr. Silajdzic clearly indicated that the co-chairmen of the Bosnia peace talks -- Lord Owen of the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations -- pressured the Bosnian Government to accept the peace plan but denied that any linkage was made with future deliveries of aid or money for reconstruction.
"The co-chairmen are doing a not-so-clean job for the international community and it is in large part not their fault," he said. "These men are giving the green light for the continuation of the aggression if the Bosnian Government does not sign the agreement. This makes it obviously an ultimatum."
At a meeting of their self-declared parliament in May, the Bosnian Serbs rejected the original peace plan, and there is little likelihood that their forces will abandon the territories the Bosnian Government is demanding, referring to them time and again as "holy Serbian land."
 
Serbs Deliver Threat
 Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, said today that his forces would have no choice but to continue the war if the Muslim-led Bosnian Parliament rejects the peace plan at a session scheduled to be held here on Friday.
"If the Muslims continue to fight for nothing," Mr. Karadzic said, "we will reconsider our offers and withdraw our concessions."
Mr. Karadzic said that his parliament will also meet on Friday to discuss the peace proposal and that he expected it to be approved.
Leaders of the Bosnian Croats have already indicated that they will back the plan.
In Sarajevo today, two people were killed and seven others were wounded when a shell landed on a crowded street in the historic old town, local hospital officials said. Sarajevo radio also reported today that Bosnian Serb forces were continuing an attack on the towns of Maglaj and Tesanj.

HEADLINE: Poor Peru Stands By as Its Rich Past Is Plundered

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOMAS DE LACHAY, Peru

 BODY:
Two hours north of Lima, a dirt road off the main highway runs into the desert, past a chicken farm and up to a series of rounded hills. At the base of the hills, in an area the size of a football field, the ground is pockmarked with holes, some 12 feet deep.
Strewn around are pieces of ancient pottery and fragments of human bones from the Chancay culture, which flourished between 700 and 1400 -- worthless items diggers left behind. In the holes are the remains of passages and burial chambers that have nearly been demolished. 
 Gone are any pieces that can be sold to tourists, antiquities dealers or collectors in Lima. Also gone is most of the archeological evidence that would help scientists better understand this complex civilization.
 
Ceramics Taken Away
 "They pulled some good pieces out of there just yesterday," said a passer-by who would not give his name. "They said they found some big ceramics."
Lomas de Lachay is one of thousands of places in Peru where looters are excavating ancient ruins, erasing archeological evidence, and then selling the country's cultural heritage at an alarming rate, faster perhaps than in any other country in Latin America.
To be sure, grave robbing is not new in Peru. In 1987 the opening by thieves of a spectacular tomb in the north touched off a looting frenzy around the country that archeologists say has increased with Peru's current troubled economic condition.
But new patterns have emerged among those seeking to uncover and sell antiquities. Poorly guarded museums have become a target for those seeking to sell antiquities to international collectors, and there has been a rash of museum burglaries, many involving the theft of priceless items.
And Peruvians can point to the developed countries, like the United States, Japan and those in Western Europe, where rich collectors have created a lucrative market for their antiquities that makes it almost impossible to stop peasants from plundering ancient sites.
Indeed, Government officials say looters working with rich collectors in Lima, who in turn work with international investors, have developed sophisticated trafficking networks for antiquities, illegally exporting an untold number out of the country.
 
No Money to Protect Sites
 Strapped for cash, the Government has abandoned the care of all but the most famous archeological sites and the most valuable antiquities. Officials recently announced that they were studying the possibility of selling the management of Peru's heritage to entrepreneurs.
For Peru, which along with Mexico has the richest archeological heritage in all of the Americas, the plundering of such treasures not only continues a historical pattern set 500 years ago by the Spanish, but is also the product of social and economic problems of the late 20th century.
Conquerors as well as survivors have sought to harvest the golden riches of societies like the Moche, which flourished in the northern coastal desert from about 250 B.C. to A.D. 400; the Nazca culture and its vast complex of mysterious lines etched in the southern Peruvian desert; the Tiahuanaco culture around Lake Titicaca, and the country's most dominating civilization, the Inca, whose empire in the 15th century stretched from Venezuela to Patagonia in Argentina.
After five years of deep recession, which has left 70 percent of Peruvians in poverty, the economy is showing only the first signs of recovery. The economic strain has led the Government and the public to choose development over cultural preservation.
"It's sad to say, but there is no money, and I doubt there will be any money in the future," Pedro Gjurinovic, director of the National Institute of Culture, said in an interview with El Comercio of Lima. "It is now clearly demonstrated that the state has turned its back on the preservation of our patrimony."
 
Incidents Reported Frequently
 News of the destruction of Peru's treasures appears frequently.
For example, in Cuzco, the heart of the Inca empire until the Spaniards came, thieves broke into the archeological museum of San Antonio Abad University in February and stole 58 gold and silver necklaces, pins, figures and other objects. The robbers were caught within 36 hours, but most of the treasures were lost forever. They were melted down for their silver and gold.
In June, residents of a shantytown on the outskirts of Lima, while digging a well, unearthed skeletons from the Ichma culture, 600 years old, destroying burial chambers and archeological information.
In July, officials discovered that the country's national Museum of Archeology, Anthropology and History was missing three ancient textiles of the Paracas culture and possibly several others, and that parts of the Nazca lines had been destroyed by a construction company, which deposited rubble at the site.
"We have seen a big increase in the looting of our cultural heritage in recent years, and a real indifference on the part of the public and the Government," said Elias Mujica, an archeologist and former head of the National Institute of Culture. "International capital consumes our cultural patrimony, and national agents facilitate it. It's almost as profitable as the cocaine trade, but without the risks. And Peruvians really don't care that we are losing it."
 
Bias Against Indian Origins
 The long-held bias of many Peruvians against their Andean origins creates a deep ambivalence toward the Indian cultures that flourished here.
Grave robbing really began during the Spanish conquest, when gold fever led to widespread looting of grave sites. But to the consternation of many of the Spanish, the Peruvian gold was not always what it seemed to be, as artisans often used alloys containing less than 50 percent gold and silver. Such was the case in the items stolen from the Cuzco museum.
Huaca, the Quechua word for burial site, has long been part of the daily argot. A huaco is an object taken from such a site, and huaquerismo is the practice of looting graves. The looters are known as huaqueros.
Huaquerismo became a national issue in 1987, when grave looters in the town of Sipan, 380 miles north of Lima, discovered the richest burial ground known in the Americas, containing the vaults of nobles and priests belonging to the Moche culture.
After a number of gold pieces were discovered, hundreds of villagers spent days digging and sifting the soil, looting almost 100 pieces, until the Government moved in with soldiers and policemen. Now, armed guards stands watch 24 hours a day at Sipan.
"We have problems from time to time, especially when people get wind that we have found some gold," said Walter Alva, chief archeologist in charge of the excavation, who carries a .38-caliber pistol.
 
Driven by International Market
 But in the same way that Peruvian peasants help satisfy the international demand for cocaine by raising coca, huaqueros dig graves because they know that a vibrant, though illegal, international market exists that assures them income.
The foreign demand, said Mr. Mujica, the archeologist, has been the reason for a recent spate of spectacular museum robberies. For example, in February 1992, a 2,000-year-old mantle from the Paracas culture was stolen from the Museum of Archeology, Anthropology and History in Lima. It was found two months later in the basement of Lima's international airport.
"All the robberies in the last three years have been requested from abroad," Mr. Mujica said. "If someone in Japan or Chicago wants a piece, they will ask someone here and the robbery is carried out."
There are big loopholes in Peruvian law on trading in antiquities. Anything in the ground -- oil, minerals or antiquities -- is the property of the state. But once taken from the ground, it ceases to belong to the state and can be passed into private hands.
Collectors admit to financing looters, letting them do the illegal part of extracting the pieces. Once the items are excavated, collectors say they can buy them, register them with the Government and in effect own them legally.
And they argue that private collectors take much better care of the antiquities than the Government does. They note, for example, that in Lima, the ceilings of museum storage rooms are collapsing on priceless ceramic pottery collections.
"If I buy antiquities from huaqueros, I am helping the poor peasants to survive and eat, and I am helping Peru protect its antiquities better than the Peruvian state can," said Enrico Poli, who has one of the finest collections of pre-Columbian and colonial art in the country and has been sued by the Government and jailed in the past for illegal trading in antiquities.
One solution for halting the continuous outflow of antiquities, most archeologists argue, is to teach Peruvians the value of their heritage. But modern Peru has a complex relationship with its history that is reflected in its attitude about treasures from the Incas, Moche and other old civilizations.
"There is a certain shame about our past," said Percy Ardiles, an anthropologist and the director of cultural activities in Cuzco. "We were conquered by the Spanish, dominated for 500 years, so how do you teach pride in our culture? We want to be white, and we are ashamed to remember that our ancestors were Indians. So how do you teach people to protect our Indian antiquities?"
 
Development Over Culture
 In the end, with Peru's economic needs and the demands of the military and Government workers seeming to overshadow the silent treasurers of its past, the Government has decided in favor of development over culture. Thus, there may be no alternative to handing over the management of monuments and antiquities to entrepreneurs.
In the ancient city of Chan Chan, the largest mud city in the world, covering 5.5 square miles near Trujillo, officially sanctioned excavation began in 1964. Because of a lack of resources, only a fraction of the remains have been excavated. Looters are constantly digging in areas of the city. Unique murals are decaying.
The financing from the Government is $5,000 a year, barely enough to pay the salaries of a few security guards.
Mr. Gjurinovic of the cultural institute says letting entrepreneurs charge tourists for visiting Chan Chan, plus organizing events like concerts and other cultural activities related to the ancient city, could bring in enough to prevent further decay and vandalism.
"I would think that many are going to disagree, because there are those who think the tourist is the great destroyer of our patrimony," he said in the newspaper interview. "But you have to realize that if they are coming to Peru, it is to visit our cultural patrimony. No one thinks of coming here to look at skyscrapers."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Yen, With Help of Bank of Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen yesterday after the Bank of Japan reportedly intervened to keep the dollar from falling back toward another postwar record low.
In New York, the dollar ended at 103.70 yen, up from 103.10 on Monday. The dollar was mixed against other currencies. 
 Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery, the most active near-term futures contract, closed at $373.10 an ounce, off 60 cents. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $371.50, down $1.
Angelo Evangelista, a vice president at Bank of Boston, estimated that the Japanese central bank bought almost $1 billion in dollars yesterday.
He said, however, that the market generally remained bullish on the Japanese currency because a Japanese Cabinet meeting last week on the rising yen "didn't come up with a darn specific item to reduce the trade surplus."
Japan's trade surplus increases the value of the yen, since importers in other countries who are buying Japanese goods must purchase more yen to pay for those goods.
The yen traded in a narrow range, however, as some investors feared the Federal Reserve might once again intervene to support the dollar, as it did last week, traders said.
The dollar also fell against the German mark, ending in New York at 1.6785 marks, compared with 1.6835 marks on Monday. Trading in the German currency was cautious as investors waited to see if the German central bank, the Bundesbank, cuts interest rates tomorrow.
"The market is awaiting the Bundesbank's meeting," said Dorit Ronnen, a foreign exchange trader at the Bank Leumi Trust Company in New York. Traders were mixed about the likelihood of a rate cut, which would likely cause the mark to lose some strength since mark-denominated investments would earn less.
The British pound slipped against the dollar, falling to $1.4985 in New York, from $1.5024 on Monday.

Texas Instruments Sees Job Cuts

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Texas Instruments confirmed today that it anticipates work-force reductions in its defense and strategic electronics unit of 4,800 jobs by the end of 1997 because of cuts in military spending.
The unit, which accounts for 27 percent of the company's revenue, now employs 13,500 people, down from a high of 25,000 in 1988. 
 The projections, contained in a memo written by two employees and leaked to The Dallas Morning News, were made in response to a question at an informal session last week between management and employees, said Tony Geishauser, a Texas Instruments spokesman. The newspaper published the memo today.
Mr. Geishauser said that the figures were rough estimates and did not reflect firm plans to eliminate jobs. Should the company receive additional military contracts, he said, or succeed in converting more of its defense production to commercial work, the number of jobs at risk would be smaller.
 
Stock Price Declines
 Texas Instruments' shares fell $1.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading today to close at $82.625, after having steadily risen in recent months.
Company earnings have exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates in recent quarters, partly on the strength of strong demand for computer memory chips, and also from one-time licensing fees from companies using its technology. Analysts say most of the company's businesses are robust.
Mr. Geishauser also said that the military work-force reductions need not mean layoffs because other divisions of Texas Instruments were growing and many employees could be transferred. Other employees might be offered incentives to take early retirement and attrition would account for some further reductions, he said. He added that of 11,500 jobs eliminated since 1988, 26 percent were layoffs.
"That was during a down period, but now we're in a rise," the spokesman continued. "Everything is looking good for T.I., but as everyone knows, defense spending is going down."
 
'93 Orders Are Down
 At the end of the first quarter of 1993, Texas Instruments said, orders for defense electronics were 3 percent lower than in the comparable period of 1992. Second-quarter orders were also lower, down 28 percent. But orders were unusually high in 1992, because the Pentagon restocked missiles that had been used during the Persian Gulf war. These contained Texas Instruments chips.
Millard J. Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, found the defense-unit job cuts logical. "It is understandable that they are going to do this," he said. "It is sort of like saying, 'Hey, Mr. Government, if you don't give us more work, we're going to cut more jobs.' They have a fix on what the size of the company needs to be to remain profitable."
While orders and revenue have declined for the $1.9 billion defense unit, it has been consistently profitable, Mr. Geishauser said. "We've always been a profit-making group for T.I. and we intend to continue to be."
The internal memo also said that the defense group was looking at another "voluntary termination retirement package" that "may not be as lucrative as the one offered in 1991."
In 1991, a buyout plan offered pension benefits as if the employees retiring were five years older and had been employed five years longer. Another severance package that year was offered to employees within five years of retirement.

HEADLINE: The Nicaraguan Tragicomedy

 BODY:
The sad recent history of Nicaragua has turned into a tragicomic opera in the past week. Leftover militants from each side of the civil war of the 80's have taken hostages, and dozens of people are still being detained by both groups.
It started last Thursday when Jose Angel Talavera, the leader of a "re-contra" group calling itself Northern Command 3-80, invited a delegation that included two Sandinista legislators to talk about reintegrating his disaffected followers into civilian life. It was a ruse. Mr. Talavera's group took at least 38 members of the delegation hostage, demanding that President Violeta Chamorro dismiss a prominent Sandinista, army chief Humberto Ortega, from her Government, along with Minister of the Presidency Antonio Lacayo. 
 In response, a group of Sandinista supporters stormed the National Opposition Union headquarters in Managua on Friday and took 34 hostages, including Vice President Virgilio Godoy. Since then, both Mr. Talavera's group and the Sandinista supporters in Managua have released some hostages. Political leaders on both sides have urged the groups to free the rest, and Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, has tried to mediate.
What can American leaders do to ease this latest crisis? Not a lot. Policy makers and Congressional leaders might support Mr. Talavera's goal of removing Mr. Ortega from his position as army chief. Under his leadership the Nicaraguan military has allowed international terrorist groups to operate with impunity in Managua, and the army's role in last month's assault by former civil war partisans on the town of Esteli has been questioned. But if Mrs. Chamorro removes Mr. Ortega, she must not do so as a result of arm-twisting by the likes of Mr. Talavera.
U.S. diplomats have been pressuring Mrs. Chamorro to get rid of Mr. Ortega for a month now, and the Senate has voted to cut off U.S. aid until the military cleans up its act and answers some pressing questions about terrorist activity in Managua. But the U.S. could take two more steps that, while they might not loom large in the short term, could make some small progress toward healing the vast wounds wrought by Nicaragua's recent history.
First, President Clinton and his State Department could acknowledge that many of Nicaragua's problems stem from 12 years of disastrous Reagan-Bush policy in Central America. Treating Nicaragua's tensions as a cold war proxy battle and arming and training its contra rebels caused unnecessary suffering, crippled the country's economy and sharpened its social divisions. Those divisions are largely responsible for the current sorrows.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor his diplomatic appointees can reverse this unhappy history. But his Administration can, at the very least, enforce U.S. law.
Reputable news reports suggest Mr. Talavera is receiving both logistical and financial help from the Nicaraguan and Cuban exile communities in Miami. United States neutrality laws forbid its citizens to abet the overthrow of a government with which the country is at peace; these laws were consistently violated throughout the 80's. The Justice Department can investigate these allegations and prosecute anyone found to be helping the rebels in Nicaragua.
With these steps, Mr. Clinton can send a strong message that the days of tolerating this sort of meddling and adventurism are over.

HEADLINE: Saudis Without Dollars

 BODY:
Remember when economists stayed up nights worrying about how the world would ever be able to recycle Saudi Arabia's huge petrodollar surpluses? Today's worry in Washington, as Times reporters documented in a pair of articles this week, is about the dangers that flow from Saudi Arabia's equally huge deficits.
Financial reserves that less than a decade ago totaled $121 billion have melted away, spent on lavish social programs, eccentric development schemes, subsidies to domestic and foreign friends of the Saudi royal family -- and weapons. Since the Persian Gulf war, the largest share has been going to weapons, especially those bought from the United States. 
 In the short run, this recycling of American dollars spent on oil for U.S.-made weapons is good for the American economy. But in the longer term, it could bring trouble. The rough economic equilibrium that is achieved comes at considerable risk to Middle Eastern stability.
The sad history of America's relations with the Shah's Iran in the 1970's suggests how badly things can go wrong. Weapons can't guarantee domestic tranquillity, nor assure permanent friendship.
Saudi Arabia, a vast but thinly settled country, sits on top of the world's largest known reserves of oil. Even with today's relatively low petroleum prices, oil exports still earn Riyadh more than $40 billion a year.
But in every year since 1983, Saudi Arabia has run both a trade and a budget deficit. When calculated as a percentage of gross domestic product, Riyadh's $7.4 billion budget deficit last year was twice as large as Washington's. Since the Persian Gulf war, about $16 billion in annual Saudi spending has gone to defense.
More than $30 billion in Saudi arms purchases from the U.S. are currently pending, plus $6 billion more in civil aircraft. Last week President Clinton phoned King Fahd to lobby for U.S. aircraft companies as Saudia, the state airline, prepares to order a modernized fleet. The Export-Import Bank is prepared to grease the Saudia sale with more than $6 billion in American taxpayer-backed loan guarantees.
Though it is no longer flush, Saudi Arabia is scarcely bankrupt. There's still plenty of oil underground, and much wasteful spending could be cut. And, as Americans will be particularly infuriated to learn, Saudi citizens still pay virtually no taxes.
Tax-free benefits are doled out to keep Saudis reasonably content with an authoritarian system that offers limited rights and no meaningful opportunity for political participation. Some analysts worry that the kind of austerity policies that now seem to be called for could provoke social unrest.
As long as the U.S. maintains its present thirst for imported oil, it will keep pumping lots of dollars into the Middle East and keep looking for ways to cycle those dollars back into the U.S. economy. When oil dollars go to the lightly populated, autocratically ruled Arab monarchies of the gulf, America doesn't have much to sell them besides weapons.
That tends to lock both sides into an unhealthy, mutually addictive, arms-for-oil relationship. Unless, that is, Congress finally musters the intellectual grit to treat America's addiction by passing a balanced energy tax and endorsing a strategic conservation plan to go with it.

HEADLINE: Hunger On the Farm

BYLINE: By Ray Marshall; Ray Marshall, Secretary of Labor under President Jimmy Carter, is professor of economics and public affairs at the University of Texas.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Even at the height of the harvest season, around one-third of American farm workers are unable to find jobs. Although the Federal Commission on Agricultural Workers reported this spring that there were surpluses of farm workers all across the nation, the Labor Department continues to allow growers to employ about 19,000 temporary agricultural workers from Mexico and the Caribbean. These jobs can and should be filled by domestic workers.
The "H-2A" visa program, which is part of the immigration law, allows agricultural employers to temporarily hire resident foreign workers (although not illegal aliens) when they can't find American citizens for the job. The law also requires growers to offer the aliens wages and working conditions comparable to those available to domestic workers. 
 During the Reagan-Bush era, however, the Labor Department consistently refused to enforce these standards. Many growers began paying these workers substantially less than they do citizens. And in 1987, the Reagan Administration lowered the wages of aliens nationwide by about 20 percent. Farm wages dropped nationwide and thousands of citizens lost jobs.
The H-2A program exempts growers from Social Security or unemployment tax payments. It guarantees a strong, young work force that they can select without regard to anti-discrimination laws. And they can rely on immigration officials to deport workers who are fired for any reason.
Growers can also use any pretext to dismiss domestic farm workers who refuse to work under squalid conditions or who don't meet unreasonable production quotas.
To make matters worse, growers and their lawyers have developed legal tactics to evade the program's meager worker protections. In the East Coast apple areas, the Reagan Labor Department permitted growers to switch from a per-apple pay rate to an hourly wage in order to circumvent a Federal court order that required increases in the piece rate.
In Florida, sugar cane workers are commonly paid up to $40 one day for cutting eight tons of cane (a typical daily quota) and as little as $25 the next day for cutting the same amount. Workers are not told how their wages are calculated, and they have no way of knowing whether they are being cheated. The companies claim the rate system can't be explained in objective terms because the pay depends on conditions in the field that only a foreman can assess.
For the companies' purposes, however, the rate is remarkably predictable. Before the season begins, the companies budget a fixed wage amount per ton of cane cut and year after year they generally come within a few pennies of hitting their target. Still, the Labor Department under Ronald Reagan and George Bush accepted the companies' argument and refused to regulate payment at a per ton rate. The Clinton Labor Department may well take a different stand. It has agreed to decide whether this shell game comports with the law. If it decides against the sugar companies, they may owe their workers tens of millions of dollars in back pay.
The visa program is an object lesson in poor labor policy. As a captive work force, the alien workers can't bargain for decent wages or go to a different employer. To solve this, before resorting to foreign workers, employers should be forced to make good-faith efforts at recruiting American citizens, at decent wages and under civilized working conditions. Employers should not be allowed to establish unreasonable production requirements that can only be met by young foreign workers, who are forced to work scared and hard to avoid deportation.
It would be much better policy to have the Labor Department recruit U.S. citizens for available work. If the Government can locate enough U.S. workers for a given harvest, the grower should be prohibited from hiring aliens for the job.
Unless the Labor Department curbs these abuses, it will contribute to the poverty of thousands of American farm workers. And the problems will spread as employers in other industries learn that they too can hire temporary foreign workers at substandard wage rates.

HEADLINE: In America;
Youth and Optimism In the 90's

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Each decade the memories become more vague, but with the release of new papers on the Kennedy assassination and this weekend's 30th anniversary observance of the March on Washington, 1963 is again in the news.
Roger Staubach, the Navy quarterback, was supposed to have been on the cover of Life magazine that last week in November, but his photo had to be pulled and replaced by a portrait of the slain President. 
 Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader from Little Rock, Ark., recalled in a recent magazine interview that she was the person scheduled to address the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial immediately after Dr. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech.
"They were applauding so wildly," said Ms. Bates. "No one could hear me. No one was listening to me. . . . At the end of my two minutes, I realized that no one heard a word I said."
It was an extraordinary time. The transition from the 50's to the 60's was accelerating but was not yet complete. Miniskirts, flower children, the big Vietnam buildup, black power -- they were all still in the future. In 1963, the baby boomers were in the early stages of their extended adolescence. They would be heard from shortly.
The turmoil was already under way. The civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot to death in Jackson, Miss. Four black girls -- three teen-agers and an 11-year-old -- were killed when the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., was bombed. And Americans were astonished by photos of a Buddhist monk who had set himself aflame to protest the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem in Saigon.
Nevertheless, it was a great time to be young. More youngsters than ever were graduating from high school and going on to college. The economy was surging. Jobs were plentiful. Political leadership was young and exciting and pointing toward a glorious future. We were putting men into space and sending young people abroad in the Peace Corps. Optimism ruled.
Even the bloodshed of the civil rights movement was seen in a positive light. The victims were martyrs, the mourned but necessary casualties of the increasingly successful battle for justice and equality.
When protesters locked arms and sang "We Shall Overcome," there was never any doubt in their minds that they would. You had to be weird in those days to believe that progress was not a permanent state of affairs.
Thirty years later young people still manage to be optimistic, but it's harder now. In 1993, you can come out of college laden with degrees and still have to struggle to find work.
"I have to stay in school because there are no jobs available," says Jack Mortell, a senior at the University of Hartford who hopes to go on to law school.
Nevertheless, when asked if he is optimistic, he replies, "Yes, very."
Sean Downs, a senior at Baruch College in Manhattan, says: "I have it worse than my parents. They got married young, mom didn't work and they bought a house at the age of 25. I doubt I'll even buy a new car by then."
But is he optimistic?
Oh yes. "Because I won't stop until I get what I want."
Optimism may be more essential now than ever. In the inner cities, young people whose futures were supposed to have been assured by the successes of the civil rights movement are faced with the daily bloodshed of life in the neighborhood. As they dodge bullets, fend off drug dealers and attend the funerals of their peers, inner-city youngsters have to draw on exceptional reserves of optimism just to imagine making it into adulthood.
As for political leadership, young people seem profoundly unimpressed. A representative view was expressed by Joanne Dionisu, a 24-year-old financial analyst from Paramus, N.J.: "I feel our political leaders are not competent and that they are out to help themselves and their own careers, forgetting about the major issues facing the country."
Creative approaches to the enormous problems of the 1990's seem to be in short supply. But young people are weird; they don't need reasons to be optimistic.
In the 1960's, it was the young people -- fired by energy and enthusiasm and optimism -- who rose up and took the country in a new direction.
Perhaps it will be the same in the 90's.

HEADLINE: Why the Marines Declared War on Marriage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an experienced civilian counselor and advocate for enlisted members of the Armed Forces, I was surprised to see Gen. Carl E. Mundy, the Marine Commandant, put into writing the longstanding military policy of discouraging marriage or committed emotional relationships by enlisted people, especially males. 
 For women, the message is that pregnancy and children only get in the way of military service, and many branches counsel abortion, adoption or discharge. Recruiters regularly discourage mothers from joining and often require single parents to provide legal documents giving custody of children to others before they qualify to enlist. Once in, women face the dilemma of submitting to constant sexual advances or being baited and targeted as lesbians.
Perhaps Secretary of Defense Les Aspin refused to allow General Mundy to formalize the policy because of the apparent irony of blocking both active homosexuals and heterosexuals from enlisting. Despite the arguments made in favor of such a policy by Bernard E. Trainor (Op-Ed, Aug. 13), most of the difficulties married enlisted members face arise from the sexism, intolerance and unreasonable hostility of the commanders when personal hardships arise.
The comments of Mr. Trainor, a former Marine lieutenant general, fairly drip with these attitudes and condescensions. "Soldiering at the rifleman's level is a single man's game," he states, as if he hasn't heard a word of the debate about the expanding roles of women in combat.
I have seen marriages broken, and children harmed, too often at the caprice of indifferent officers. Meeting family needs or pleading hardship is seen as goldbricking. And woe to the women, enlisted or dependent, who have had to rely on military gynecological services, or whose pregnancies have inconvenienced the mission.
Our military is neither voluntary (drawing most enlistees in through deception, premature enlistment and economic impressment) nor democratic, as Mr. Trainor asserts and then bemoans. It is the last bastion of rigid, white, upper-class male supremacy and the most venal remaining institutional example of sexism, racism and privilege.
Today's young soldiers are trained and reinforced in sexist language and assumptions from basic training to officer school. The Tailhook scandal was not an isolated instance of harassment or rape, crimes that average at least three times reported civilian levels. Young women in the Philippines have brought suit against the United States military to pay for the care of children created in the strained subculture of prostitution that surrounded our bases there. This exploitation is commonly tolerated, even encouraged by military officers. As one ranking officer responded, "Some men drink, some men fight, some men rape -- it's all a release."
Clearly, the military wants to take young, single men and make efficient killers out of them. The complications that come with emotional attachment, human weakness and divided loyalty are too much for some military officers to bear.
Perhaps the real ban in the military is not on types of sexuality, but on human love.

HEADLINE: In Sovereign Georgia, Crime, Civil War and Empty Coffers

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The sound of gunfire is so frequent in one Tbilisi neighborhood that its residents now call it Chicago. Mindful of an audience that long ago stopped going out after dark, the city's theaters and concert halls schedule performances only in the afternoon.
The Metekhi Palace, Georgia's sole luxury hotel, has a sign that politely asks guests to check their firearms before entering -- a request that did nothing to stop a recent visitor from firing off a few rounds as he tried to barge past armed security guards. 
 Even with the yearlong civil war in Abkhazia muffled by a cease-fire, violence continues to torment Georgia, a country of 5.5 million deep in the Caucasus. Two weeks ago, an American identified as a C.I.A. agent was shot and killed on an open highway in what local officials say was a random shooting.
Last week a German woman, a secretary at the German Embassy here, and a companion were stopped at gunpoint by masked men in western Georgia, robbed of their money, jewelry and car and left by the roadside.
Bandits have always been part of the lore of the Transcaucasus, a region described in Russian literature as steeped in both romance and cruelty. Its dramatic mountains and ravines are inhabited by dozens of tribes and clans who over the centuries have been subdued, sometimes only barely, by succeeding empires, the Persian, the Ottoman and the Russian.
"Read Tolstoy," a Westerner said. "It is all in there." Tolstoy served as a young officer in the Caucasus, and wrote about those times.
 
Playing the 'Great Game' Again
 In recent weeks, Tbilisi has been buzzing with talk about a new "Great Game" developing in the Caucasus, a replay of the old British-Russian rivalry that dominated Central Asia at the turn of the last century.
This time, the theory runs, the West, wary of Russian ambitions, has begun to strengthen its presence in this mysterious and volatile region with a mix of high-level diplomacy and old-fashioned espionage.
By focusing more attention on the new nations on Russia's periphery, some Western governments, particularly the United States and Germany, have been sending Moscow the message that it cannot treat the former Soviet republics as its own backyard.
President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister whose personal relationships with Western leaders have helped bring badly needed aid to Georgia, said in an interview this month that the Clinton Administration had shown a new appreciation for the subtle relationships involved in the Caucasus.
"I think the new Administration has a more realistic picture, and sees the important role the Caucasus can play for peace in the world," he said. "They also realize that if the Caucasus is not peaceful, many countries might get involved, and a big fire could start here."
It is practically an article of faith in Georgian politics these days that Russia deliberately stirred up the separatists in Abkhazia, on the Black Sea, to keep Georgia weak and Russia's military presence strong. While hard evidence of such a conspiracy by Moscow is lacking, it seems clear that the Russian military, which has two battalions in Abkhazia, at least supported the Abkhazian side.
Mr. Shevardnadze credited President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany with having personally relayed to President Boris N. Yeltsin their concerns about Russia's activities in Abkhazia. Since then Russia, Georgia and the separatist government in Abkhazia have agreed to a new cease-fire that for the first time includes a role for United Nations observers on the territory of the former Soviet Union.
The slaying on Aug. 8 of Fred Woodruff, the American envoy, in the back seat of a jeep driven by Col. Eldar Gogoladze, Mr. Shevardnadze's chief of security, has helped feed some of the more elaborate cloak-and-dagger theories about the United States role in the Caucasus. An investigation by the Georgian police, who are being helped by a small team from the F.B.I., has been pointing strongly in another direction: last Friday, the police announced that a 21-year-old soldier had confessed to shooting at the jeep after it had failed to stop when he tried to flag it down for a lift.
In an interview in Tbilisi, one of the two women who were in Mr. Gogoladze's Niva, a Soviet-made jeep, said she was certain that Mr. Woodruff's death was accidental. "It was an accident, I am 100 percent sure," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. "It was a blind bullet."
Still, Mr. Woodruff's presence in the region is a testament to Washington's deepening involvement. According to local sources, a team of Georgian security guards have already gone to the United States for training, while a more comprehensive assistance program for the police force here -- as well as in other former Soviet republics -- is in the works.
"A lot of things might be done for training, for military staff in particular," Mr. Shevardnadze said, speaking of American assistance. "This is a legitimate sphere for cooperation. It is absolutely acceptable."
Residents of Tbilisi have already detected some improvement in the local police force. "Now they have uniforms, and they have weapons," said one resident, noting that not long ago the police manning the roadblocks on the outskirts of the city were dressed in jeans and T-shirts, making them indistinguishable from the criminals.
 
Some Obstacles Cleared
 Lawlessness is just one of the problems that confront Mr. Shevardnadze. Another is trying to keep this fierce but fragile country together when its various regional and ethnic clans are in open defiance of central authority in Tbilisi.
"The only thing under Georgian control is really nothing," said a Western observer who, like many others in this capital, fear that without Mr. Shevardnadze, Georgia might fall apart.
In fact, Mr. Shevardnadze recently succeeded in clearing away some of the obstacles to Georgian unity. He managed to outmaneuver two powerful military commanders who had flagrantly challenged his authority ever since he returned from Moscow 16 months ago. He accepted a cease-fire over Abkhazia, which has proved to be more popular than his nationalist critics had expected. And last week he won the Parliament's approval of a new Prime Minister, Otar Patsatsia, whose most significant qualification is that he is from Mingralia, a rebellious region in western Georgia.
"At this stage, we have to think of how to survive, of reconciliation," said Thomas Gamkrelidze, chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, who noted that if Parliament had had its wish, Mr. Shevardnadze would have taken on the post of Prime Minister himself. "Everybody, even the opposition, agrees that Shevardnadze cannot go," he said, "that that would mean chaos."
Some would argue that chaos is already at hand. Not only is crime up, but the justice system has collapsed, leaving people to settle their scores through old-fashioned vendettas. The Georgian economy is in ruins: the coupon issued last April on a par with the Russian ruble as a precursor to Georgia's new currency, the lari, is now worth one-sixth of a ruble or less. At this rate, the average salary is less than $3 a month, and as prices of everything from electricity to fruit rise sharply, people are panicking about how they will survive next winter.
 
Economic Reform Lags
 With the Government's attention on Abkhazia and its internal political skirmishes, economic reform has gone nowhere. Industry and most of agriculture -- including the legendary vineyards of eastern Georgia -- remain state-owned. There are still only a handful of private restaurants in Tbilisi, a paltry offering considering Georgia's reputation for good food and wine and exuberant hospitality.
Crime, too, has had a debilitating effect. Tbilisi, which in the Communist era was a haven for small-time traders skilled at dodging the official ban on private enterprise, has little of the kiosk and cafe culture that has so dominated Russia's post-Communist transformation.
"Opening a restaurant can be a dangerous business," a resident said. "Soldiers coming back from the front in Abkhazia come in, demand to be fed, then demand to be toasted by all the guests for their heroic deeds. And then just for good measure, they'll shoot up the place as they leave."

HEADLINE: $1 BILLION IN SALES OF HIGH-TECH ITEMS TO CHINA BLOCKED

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it would ban American exports of almost $1 billion in high-technology goods to China over the next two years to punish Beijing for selling sensitive missile technology to Pakistan in violation of international arms-control agreements.
An official said the trade restrictions could be greatly widened, to $3 billion to $4 billion worth of goods a year, if intelligence agencies concluded that China had sold Pakistan whole missiles, and not just missile components. 
 The Government said the ban announced today would not affect Chinese exports to the United States or China's preferred trading status, which President Clinton extended in May despite concerns about China's human rights violations.
 
Sanctions on Pakistan
 Michael McCurry, the State Department's spokesman, said the United States would also impose economic sanctions on Pakistan, although the amount of banned exports would be small.
Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that their country has violated the Missile Technology Control Regime, an agreement China has not signed but has agreed to abide by.
Mr. McCurry said the sanctions would prevent American companies from receiving export licenses to sell China advanced electronics equipment as well as technology for space systems and military aircraft. He said the United States now sells China between $400 million and $500 million of such technology each year.
 
A Cost for U.S. Companies
 "They will not be able to conduct that business," he said in a news briefing, referring to American companies. "That's a significant cost that we pay. But it, again, reflects the seriousness with which we look at the issue of proliferation, which we consider one of the, probably the most important, arms control issue in the 1990's."
According to the State Department, the area that will be hit hardest is space satellites, both satellite sales to China and the practice by which United States companies pay China to send their satellites into space. The United States had already barred sales of most military-related high technology items to China after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.
On Tuesday, American officials disclosed that sanctions would be applied to China, but they did not describe them in detail. American export-control laws required the Government to impose the sanctions after it determined that China had shipped components that would help Pakistan build M-11 missiles, whose technology was developed in China and which have a range of 300 miles and can carry nuclear warheads.
One official said American intelligence agencies had concluded that China has sent missile parts to Pakistan, but he added that intelligence officials might yet find that China had shipped complete missiles. In that case, he said, the sanctions could be expanded to restrict Chinese exports to the United States.
The United States imposed the sanctions after China repeatedly rebuffed requests to answer questions about the shipments to Pakistan. In news briefings and interviews today, State Department officials seemed ambivalent about the sanctions, on the one hand saying they were angry about the shipments and China's refusal to own up to them, but on the other hand signaling that they had been pushed into the sanctions by highly specific laws.
State Department officials said President Clinton had reviewed the decision before it was announced.
"It's obviously a serious issue," said a senior Administration official, who insisted on anonymity. "We would not have taken this step if it weren't. We tried to clarify this issue with both China and Pakistan before moving. We reached a point where we didn't get the clarifications needed, and under the law we had no choice but to go ahead."
The official indicated that the United States hoped to move ahead with China on other issues, like human rights and trade.
Hughes Aircraft of Los Angeles is one of the companies that will be hit hardest. It has contracted to sell China one satellite and a ground station for $80 million and was negotiating to sell two other satellites. In addition, China has indicated that it might buy up to 10 satellites from Hughes by the end of the decade.
"Obviously we're concerned about the impact this will have on our business," said David Shea, a Hughes spokesman. He said his company was worried that European manufacturers like British Aerospace or Aerospatiale in France might seek to sell their satellites to China if Hughes cannot.
United States officials said they were concerned that the sanctions would hurt American companies, but Lynn E. Davis, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, said, "When you make this determination, the law specifically states you can't take into account the effects of the sanctions."
She said the European countries, unlike the United States, do not have laws that impose trade sanctions when the non-proliferation agreements are violated. But she said that those nations "share our goals for non-proliferation of missiles," and that the United States planned to urge them not to let their companies take advantage of the American move.
Experts on China called the sanctions moderately tough, since the Administration could have announced sanctions and then waived them. State Department officials indicated that they were seeking a proportional response, in effect banning all exports to the two Chinese agencies responsible for the sale to Pakistan: the Defense Ministry and the Ministry for the Aerospace Industry.
In the Presidential election campaign last year, Mr. Clinton vowed to take a tough stance toward China over its human rights violations. Nonetheless, in May he announced a one-year extension of China's most-favored-nation trading status, with any further extension conditioned on China's improving its human-rights record.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Balkan Aides Explain Why They Quit

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
It was the kind of gut-wrenching cable that came across Jon Western's State Department desk every day for almost a year: a 9-year-old Muslim girl raped by Serbian fighters, then left in a pool of blood while her parents watched helplessly from behind a fence for two days before she died.
"This was pretty indicative of the type of things we were getting on a daily basis," Mr. Western said. 
 It was the kind of cable that led Mr. Western earlier this month to quit his job as an Eastern Europe analyst out of frustration with what he considered America's lack of resolve in solving the Bosnian crisis.
"The whole thing has been very demoralizing and very depressing," said Mr. Western, a soft-spoken man whose boyish features belie his age of 30. "I found myself walking home every night just angry and bitter. My wife could tell you of my large mood swings. You can't read through the accounts of atrocities on a daily basis, add them up and see what's happening and not be overwhelmed. It calls into question your morality."
Mr. Western is one of four mid-level staff members who have quit the State Department in the past year to protest United States policy toward the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, saying they could no longer countenance a policy they feel rewards Serbian aggression.
 
Malaise Over the Balkans
 The four said in interviews today that their actions were symbolic of a larger malaise within the State Department over America's policy on the Balkans.
"The dissent is not confined to the European bureau," said Mr. Western. "I've covered or been associated with the Yugoslav issue since the outbreak of hostilities. In my time, I have met one, possibly two people, in the department below the level of assistant secretary who believe in the policy."
Stephen Walker, the Croatian desk officer who resigned this week, also said that anger with the policy toward Bosnia runs deep. After word swept the building that he too was quitting, Mr. Walker said he was approached by numerous colleagues "who said they agreed with my frustrations with the policy."
Three of the dissidents -- Mr. Western, Mr. Walker, and George Kenney, who quit last year -- spoke in a joint interview today about their experiences at the State Department and about why they oppose current American policy towards Bosnia. A fourth, Marshall Harris, a one-time leader of the dissidents at the State Department, could not attend the group session, but was interviewed later by telephone.
 
'A Certain Luxury'
 The three who quit recently said they feel that others would resign if it were not for family responsibilities. "The four of us are young," said Mr. Western. "That affords a certain luxury of being able to make the jump. We don't have all the commitments and responsibilities to family. We're not 20 years into a career."
"We don't have kids going off to college," said Mr. Walker, 30.
State Department officials reacted testily when Mr. Harris quit, the first of the most recent spate of resignations. Some officials emphasized Mr. Harris's youth and low ranking in the department and suggested that he was quitting because he was not involved more in policy making. Such comments caused anger within the State Department and after the resignations of Mr. Western and Mr. Walker, State Department officials have gone out of their way to say that resignation is an honorable form of protest.
Dissent within the Government's foreign policy apparatus over high-profile and contentious issues is nothing new, and neither are such resignations. Cyrus R. Vance quit as Secretary of State in 1980 to show his disagreement over President Carter's decision to attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran. Anthony Lake, the present National Security Advisor, was one of 10 National Security Council staff members who resigned in 1969 and 1970 over the Vietnam War.
But, virtually everyone at the State Department agrees that there has not been such public protests by those given the task of carrying out a policy since the height of the Vietnam War.
 
Administration Criticized
 "This Administration has used and manipulated the media and public opinion on Bosnia," Mr. Harris said, "and so we should not hesitate to do protest so publicly and make our views heard."
Ironically, the resignations come at a time when even they admit that the State Department under Mr. Christopher has become more open in allowing staff members to express dissenting views than during the tenure of former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who virtually cut out the Department's career professionals from policy making. But the three who just quit say that while they and others who agree with them can express dissatisfaction internally, there seems to be little change in the policy.
"My problems were not with the process, or the access," Mr. Walker said. "I felt that from my position I had sufficient opportunity to voice my opinions, my frustrations; that the Department has tried to give opportunities to the professionals to bring up other options. But despite these opportunities that people have had, it's had little or no affect on policy. And that, I think, has increased the level of frustration within the Department."
The dissidents cited a news conference given by Mr. Christopher on July 21 as the low point. While Serbian forces were intensifying their siege of Sarajevo, the Secretary of State told reporters that the United States was doing all that it could consistent with its national interest.
The next day, Mr. Walker said, Serbian forces lobbed more than 3,700 artillary shells into the capital city. "The signal sent to the Serbs was we're doing everything we can, go ahead, have a good time," Mr. Walker said.
 
A Specific Alternative
 Mr. Kenney was the only one to provide a specific alternative to current policy.
"We should have a clearly stated goal of getting rid of the Serbian government," he said. "Just putting an economic embargo and sanctions on them is not going to do enough. We ought to close our embassy in Belgrade. Cut diplomatic ties. Throw them definitely out of the U.N. Have Radio Free Europe broadcast into Serbia, telling the Serbian people, that, hey, you've got a lousy Government, and until you change it, you're going to suffer."
There were differences in what appeared to be important about American policy toward Bosnia. Mr. Walker spoke often in broad policy terms, saying the Administration's inaction would harm American credibility, undermine United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and lead to a peace settlement that would not hold. He said it would also set a dangerous precedent for the oppression of ethnic minorities elsewhere in the world.
"No matter how you look at it, the policy as it stands right now is wrong," he said. "That's why dissent and frustration is so widespread and consistent."

HEADLINE: With a Boom in the Desert Over, Transplants Are Feeling Stranded

SERIES: Reinventing California -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORENO VALLEY, Calif.

 BODY:
The desert that stretches east from Los Angeles shimmers with mirages: brand-new cities like this one that replicate the Southern California ideal, with miles of identical single-family homes, each with its small green lawn and two-car garage.
Just three or four years ago, riding the California boom, these homes were being built so fast that the newcomers sometimes had nowhere to shop. The area became known as the Inland Empire -- San Bernardino and Riverside Counties -- the most rapidly growing region in the United States. 
 But with the collapse of the California economy and the abrupt shrinking of the military and aerospace industries, the region's growth has come to a halt. And with the Pentagon continuing to close bases, the local economy will be squeezed for years.
 
Search for Housing
 Nearly one million people in search of affordable housing moved in during the 1980's, the forward edge of what seemed an endlessly expanding regional economy in a stifling and often smoggy area about the size of Oregon. Many were employed in the military and aerospace industries of neighboring Los Angeles and Orange Counties, industries that supported the Southern California economy for half a century.
The price they have paid is a bumper-to-bumper commute of as much as four hours round trip. About 300,000 commuters jam the Inland Empire's freeways every day, said John Husing, a private economist who specializes in the region.
Now, many of the settlers have lost their jobs and are stranded with their new homes in the middle of the desert, part of the fading mirage of ever-rising prosperity.
As they hose down their lawns in an endless battle against the desert sun, worrying aloud about the rising crime rate and falling real estate values, they call into question the ideals of continuous expansion and easy living that have fueled Southern California's growth for two generations.
In a dozen interviews at their homes along the quiet streets of Moreno Valley, where the trees are too young to offer much shade, many people said they were looking for a way to sell their new houses and move away. They give various reasons: they are tired of the long commute; they want to look for jobs out of state; it's the smog; it's the crime and the gangs that have followed the population into the desert.
"We're leaving as soon as we can," said Jennifer Wickman, a 23-year-old police officer, who said gang violence was growing in Moreno Valley. "But first we've got to get some equity in our house. We just bought it a year ago."
 
Ills of a Larger Arena
 The rapid growth and uncertain future of the Inland Empire mirror the heady and abruptly stalled growth of Southern California at large.
"It's a microcosm of the ills that are right now affecting the southern half of the state," said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the private Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County.
In addition to the military and aerospace industries, Southern California has been supported by national and international exports, which are also now slumping. At the same time, its population has swelled, attracting people from within the United States and from across its borders.
Like Southern California at large, the Inland Empire is counting on a growth of local manufacturing and other industries to revive its economy. But it, too, is burdened by state regulations like air quality standards and expensive social programs like workers compensation that were imposed when economic costs seemed to be no barrier.
 
Economic Pattern
 As the state's population continues to increase, officials of cities like Moreno Valley are counting on a pent-up demand for housing to help revive the region's growth once the economy begins to recover. And with increased population, they say, will come local industries that could eventually lessen its dependence on faraway commuter jobs.
City officials are hoping to repeat the traditional pattern of expansion in Southern California, in which population is followed by services and small retail outlets, then major stores, offices and manufacturing -- the pattern in Orange County and the San Fernando Valley.
Moreno Valley has been designated by the state as a recycling-market-development zone; once the economy revives, it is hoping to attract manufacturing industries that use recycled material.
For the time being, the city's unemployment rate hovers above 11 percent, compared with a statewide rate of 9.6 percent, said City Manager Norm King. And it could get worse.
Already reeling from the recession, the city will be further hurt by the scaling back of nearby March Air Force Base, with an estimated loss of 4,600 civilian jobs in the region. Both private and government groups are trying to decide how to use parts of the base; base conversion remains among the biggest question marks for a Southern California recovery.
And on June 30, developers abandoned a projected 3,000-acre business and residential center for Moreno Valley, in which they had invested years of planning. It was expected to bring in 21,000 permanent jobs and nearly 8,000 new homeowners.
The developers cited "the unprecedented deterioration and continued faltering of the Southern California development environment."
 
As Varied as It Is Vast
 The vast Inland Empire, stretching more than 200 miles from Los Angeles County to the state's eastern borders, has nearly doubled in population to about 2.9 million, from 1.6 million in 1980. If it were broken off as a separate state, it would rank 32d in personal income, just ahead of Arkansas.
Its character is as varied as its size suggests. The range becomes clear driving from the urban decay of the long-established city of Riverside to the relative success of Ontario, with its airport and warehouses; from the quiet college campuses of Claremont to the resorts of Palm Springs and Lake Arrowhead.
But it is the brand-new cities like Rancho Cucamonga, Moreno Valley and the even more distant Adelanto across the San Bernardino Mountains from here that demonstrate the hungry growth of the region.
A decade ago, the city of Moreno Valley did not exist. About 15,000 people lived in three small towns here, 70 miles from downtown Los Angeles, where farmers struggled to grow potatoes and alfalfa on the baking, scrub-covered land.
The new city was incorporated in 1985, and local residents like Curt Montgomery, a salesman, watched in amazement as the paved roads came in, then the stop signs, then the traffic lights, then the shopping center.
"It just went in instantly," he said. The city's population is now 135,000.
Marty Kunard, an early resident who works for a company that repairs CAT scanners, also looked on as the city expanded around him. "In the last two years the developers were just playing leapfrog with each other," he said. "You could watch them going up the sides of the mountain."
With three-bedroom, two-bathroom detached houses selling for as low as $100,000 -- among the lowest prices in the region -- people like Karen Henderson Kreiss, a music teacher, joined waiting lists and hoped to rediscover the relaxed and affordable way of life that she said characterized Orange County 20 years ago, before it was overtaken by congestion.
It was growth like this that put the Inland Empire in the lead for housing starts as recently as 1990, with 28,658 permits issued, according to U.S. Housing Markets, the research service of Lomas Mortgage USA.
But by the first quarter of this year, the two-county region had fallen to 19th among 53 housing markets around the nation, with just 2,775 permits issued, a 26 percent drop from the previous year.
At the same time, home foreclosures in the region rose more than two-thirds during the first five months of this year over the corresponding period last year, paralleling a similar rise throughout Southern California, according to TRW REDI Data, a Riverside-based market research company.
Not surprisingly in a region that had experienced rapid growth but with relatively few indigenous industries, it is the construction industry that was hardest hit by the slowdown, with a loss of 10,000 jobs in 1991 and 1992, according to a report by the Chapman University Center for Economic Research.
"Because of the geographical size of the area, you see pockets of economic growth versus some areas that are really taking it hard," said Esmael Adibi, the center's director. "You're going from a 9 or 10 percent growth rate to now flat or negative. That's a big variation."
 
Extraordinary Downturn
 What makes this economic downturn tougher for Southern California than any in the past, he noted, was that it is not simply cyclical. With steep and permanent cuts in military and aerospace jobs, the region is left groping for a new vehicle for recovery.
For a city built on the dream of an ideal way of life, Moreno Valley's perfect rows of red-roofed houses harbor considerable discontent, from the college student who complains that there is nothing to do to the man who has taken to praying in his car to keep himself from exploding in rage in the rush-hour traffic.
"It's affordable here; that's all it is, affordable," said Lorie Ringham, whose husband, Kenny, lost his $67,000-a-year job with McDonnell Douglas last year and now works as a security guard for $9 an hour.
Mr. Ringham said he had found a new job near Los Angeles but could not move until he sold their house. It was appraised two years ago at $140,000 and is now worth $110,000.
 
Rise in Social Status
 Bob Roma, a retired engineer who helped build Pershing 2 and Patriot missiles, and his wife Chris have lived the Southern California story.
Newlywed and living in New Jersey in 1951, they decided, "Let's go to California,"and moved to Los Angeles. Like so many newcomers at that time, Mr. Roma found a job right away in aerospace.
Rising into the middle class, they bought a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Gardena when the area was still largely agricultural. As the quality of life deteriorated, they looked elsewhere, and seven years ago they bought one of the first model homes here.
Mr. Roma, who is 65, suffered the two-hour commute until his recent retirement. His daily routine, as he described it, was not unusual. "I leave the house at about 4:45 in the morning, so I have to get up at 3:45," he said. "If I get home at about 7:30, she has the dinner ready. Read the paper. Go to bed at 8:30. Then up again in the morning and on the freeway."
Mr. Roma endured, though he thought of putting a pistol in his pickup truck as protection against angry fellow commuters. "In that bumper-to-bumper traffic every day, people really get irritated," he said.
Now, he said, the only problem is the thick smog. Mr. Roma has heart problems, and his doctor has advised him to move away. But with the continuing economic slump, he does not know when there will be buyers for his house.
"We're stuck here now," his wife said as they stood on their carefully tended lawn, their two-car garage open behind them. "We've been thinking of selling the house, but I'll probably be living in Moreno Valley all my life."

They are remnants of the California boom in the 1980's, when housing was being built for the one million people who moved to the area in search of an affordable place to live. But in recent months, the regions's economy and growth have come to a halt.; "We're leaving as soon as we can," said Jennifer Wickman, a police officer, who said gang violence was growing in Moreno Valley. "But first we've got to get some equity in our house. We just bought it a year ago." With her was her husband, Stuart. (Photographs by Scott Robinson for The New York Times) (pg. B8)

HEADLINE: Avoiding a Values Test, County Cuts All Art Funds

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga., Aug. 25

 BODY:
Facing a proposal to limit arts financing to groups that support "community, family-oriented values," the Cobb County Commision here has voted instead to cut off all money for the arts next year.
The vote on Tuesday, coming after the commission's condemnation of homosexuality two weeks earlier, has turned up the volume again on a dispute over homosexuality and community values that has deeply divided this suburban county of 450,000 people north and west of Atlanta. 
 The clear loser in this dispute is a group of shellshocked arts organizations, ranging from children's theaters to the local symphony, which find themselves suddenly scrambling to make up for the funds they had expected to receive from the county.
"I'm just perplexed by the whole thing," said Kirsten Oxlund, operations manager of the TellTale Theater, which performs plays at local schools on the themes of safety and avoidance of drugs. The company had received about $6,500 of its $100,000 budget from Cobb County. "This is a little company that's making a difference for a lot of kids, and it's hard to see why we're forced to suffer."
This year Cobb County will spend $123,000 of a $142 million budget on nine arts groups. Contributions range from $3,620 for a local children's theater to $40,959 for a critically praised Marietta theater group, the Theater in the Square, which inadvertently set the furor in motion because of a handful of complaints about one of its offerings. The county had planned to spend $110,000 next year.
 
Convention Boycott Urged
 At a news conference on the Marietta town square today, homosexual and citizens' groups critical of the actions called for a boycott of the county's new $43 million convention center, asking those would hold conventions there to take their business elsewhere.
But county commissioners predicted that the economic effect of such an effort would be negligible.
On Tuesday, the five-member board of commissioners sidestepped the most pressing issue -- what kind of art it could support -- by voting unanimously to eliminate all the money it spends on local arts groups. The money will go instead to law enforcement.
Gordon Wysong, the commissioner who has been the most vocal supporter of the measure, said the county had set an example for the nation.
"It was about redefining government's role," Mr. Wysong said. "Government on a local level was told by both sides, 'You can't make these kinds of decisions for the arts,' and we agreed. So we got out."
But angry critics said the move was simply an attempt to deflect moral issues while gutting support for any arts activities that could be even remotely controversial.
"Their vote last night to kill county support for the arts had nothing to do with taxes," said Jon Greaves, head of the Cobb Citizens Coalition, which opposed the anti-gay resolution and the proposal to limit financing of the arts. "It was an act of desperation by leaders who are unwilling to deal with the difficult issues of free speech and intolerance in this community."
Cobb County, which ranges from working-class bedroom communities to upper-income golf course developments, is a largely white, staunchly conservative suburb. Newt Gingrich, the combative House Republican whip, represents 70 percent of the county.
The current dispute had its roots in at least two issues. One was a decision by the City of Atlanta to grant domestic partnership status to the partners of city employees who are homosexuals. A second was a handful of complaints about the fare at the Theater in the Square. One production, "Lips Together, Teeth Apart," was criticized for its references to homosexuality.
Officials at the theater said they had already received an outpouring of support and hoped to make up the lost money through private contributions and memberships. Smaller groups were less confident. And virtually all of them were astonished that their mainstream fare had run into a buzzsaw.
"It's all very ironic," said Thomas S. Holman, executive director of the Marietta-Cobb Museum of Art, which gets $22,000 of its $240,000 budget from the county. "Someone said to me we couldn't be any more apple pie unless we handed out apple pie at the door."
 
'Intolerance of Diversity'
 At the news conference today critics of the resolution, including the Atlanta chapter of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called for an economic campaign against Cobb County. The group advocated diverting convention business from the county and said businesses that are thinking about relocating in Cobb County need to understand they will be moving to "an area which has demonstrated an intolerance of diversity."
But Mr. Wysong said he thought the stand against homosexuality would be more likely to help the county's image than harm it. He said he was not worried by economic retaliation.
"The idea that some fly speck of an economic boycott is going to affect the county is ridiculous," he said. "It didn't work in Colorado and it won't work here."

"It was about redefining government's role," he said. (The Marietta Daily Journal)

HEADLINE: Shipping Company Assessed Largest Election Fine Ever

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25

 BODY:
State and local officials have levied an $895,000 fine against a foreign-owned shipping company that admitted funneling laundered money to dozens of politicians since 1989, including the gubernatorial campaigns of Gov. Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein.
Officials said the fine on Tuesday against the Evergreen America Corporation was the largest for a political ethics violation in the nation's history. The previous record, also in California, was $292,500 in 1988 against William Bryan, a Sacramento County Supervisor, for failure to disclose economic interests. 
 The fine against Evergreen America, the American agent for the Taiwan shipping company Evergreen Lines, one of the world's largest operators of container ships, is substantially greater than previous ones for campaign fraud, which have tended to be $100,000 to $200,000.
Most recently, the Federal Election Commission fined Senator Bob Dole more than $120,000 for election-law violations in his 1988 Presidential campaign; that is the largest fine for any Presidential campaign organization.
The Evergreen fine is seen as part of a crackdown on political corruption at a time of waning public confidence in the political process. Campaign reform became a issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign, in part because Ross Perot was able to tap into a rising tide of public frustration with the status quo.
 
'A Growing Sensitivity'
 "It's an important message that these kinds of violations are going to be treated seriously," said Fred Wert heimer, who heads Common Cause, a public affairs lobby. "I think it reflects a growing sensitivity that is starting to develop all across the country. The campaign finance problem is out of control. It's undermining public confidence, breeding cynicism, and it's demanding responses."
The fine was the result of a yearlong investigation of Evergreen America by the California Fair Political Practices Commission and the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission. Ben Davidian, chairman of the state agency, said the inquiry began when the city agency was reviewing campaign-contribution statements and noticed that many donations were coming from Evergreen employees.
Officials said the investigation uncovered a broad money-laundering scheme in which the company tried to skirt contribution limits and reporting requirements by having employees and their friends and relatives donate a total of $172,000 to state and local politicians. They said the employees were reimbursed by the company.
 
'Gave Money to Everybody'
 Investigators said there was no evidence that the politicians knew the money was coming from Evergreen America. But Mr. Davidian said he found it hard to believe that a company would go to such lengths to make donations and then not make its identity known.
"Evergreen gave money to Democrats, Republicans, and independents," Mr. Davidian said. "They gave money to everybody. They had to expect they were going to get something in return. How they would get something if they had hidden the source of the contributions, I don't know."
Among those receiving money were former Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, who got $10,000; several members of the Los Angeles City Council and Ms. Feinstein, a Democratic Senator from San Francisco who received $42,000 in her losing race for governor in 1990.
Mr. Wilson, a Republican from San Diego who defeated Ms. Feinstein, received $4,000, which he said today that he would return. Ms. Feinstein, whose donation was Evergreen's largest, was traveling today and could not be reached for comment.
 
Fine Is Split
 Under a Los Angeles ethics ordinance, money that went to Mr. Bradley and other city officials must be returned to the city, said Ben Bycel, executive officer of the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission. The city will also receive half the fine, with the other half going to the state because of the joint investigation.
Mark E. Beck, a lawyer for Evergreen America, said the company had paid the fine in full on Tuesday. "The company is acknowledging that its San Pedro office made a mistake based upon advice they had gotten that obviously was in mistake," he said. "The company is taking action to resolve it. As far as we're concerned, it's resolved. There are no other investigations going on."
A spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, Fred Eiland, said he could not confirm or deny that the agency had begun its own investigation of the company.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Intervention By Japanese Central Bank

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and other currencies yesterday after the Bank of Japan intervened on its behalf, catching the market by surprise.
Also supporting the dollar was a report of mild German inflation, which increased the chances of Germany's central bank cutting interest rates today. 
 In New York, the dollar jumped to 105.05 yen, from 103.70 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also rose to 1.6850 German marks, from 1.6783 marks.
Gold prices increased slightly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery, the active near-term contract, gained 60 cents, to $373.70 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted spot gold at $372.00 an ounce, up 50 cents.
The Bank of Japan bought large quantities of dollars in Tokyo at 104 yen when the market had not been expecting action until the dollar fell close to 103 yen. American fund managers and corporations jumped on the bandwagon, pushing the dollar above 105.20 in New York.
"Continued displays of determination by the Bank of Japan have lent significant support to the dollar," Keith Cheveralls, foreign-exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank, said.
 
Waiting for Japan's Trade Plan
 Dealers estimate that Japan's central bank has spent $6 billion on intervention so far in August.
 But the dollar could falter, they said, if Japan does not soon announce a plan to deal with its weak economy and large trade surplus soon. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has not intervened since last Thursday, when its purchases pushed up the dollar nearly 5 percent in three hours.
"Mostly, it's the B.O.J. against the world," Richard Koss, managing director at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said. "Is it willing to do that forever?"
The dollar rose against the mark as only modest inflation in several German states raised hopes for an interest-rate cut today.
"The market's factored in a 25 basis point discount-rate cut," Michael McKeever, a dealer at Fuji Bank, said. The mark also fell against several other European currencies.
Lower German interest rates would make securities denominated in marks less attractive to investors.
The British pound fell to $1.4820 in New York yesterday, from $1.4984 Tuesday. In London, it finished at $1.4820, down from $1.4960 Tuesday.

HEADLINE: House Republican Leaders Assert Health Plan Will Push Taxes Up

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
House Republican leaders today made a preemptive assault on President Clinton's health plan, asserting in a new report that the Clinton approach would lead to major new taxes, burdensome new government regulations and a huge loss of jobs among small businesses.
The document, released by the House Republican Conference, signaled the intensity of the coming struggle over revamping the health care system. Mr. Clinton is not scheduled to release his plan until late September, but the Administration has already begun to campaign for its basic principles with a series of speeches and briefing books. 
 The document, which was not voted on by House Republicans, was released in the name of the conference chairman, Dick Armey of Texas, the third-ranking Republican in the House. It represents one of the first major assaults on the Administration's proposals, and Mr. Armey asserted that it reflected "some basic concerns that most Republicans share."
Republicans in Congress are far from united on the health care issue, and some, particularly in the Senate, have sounded far more conciliatory toward the Administration in recent weeks.
 
'Massive New Taxes'
 But the report declares, "Indications are that the Clinton plan will destroy jobs, burden the economy with massive new taxes, lead to a form of health care rationing and put the best health care system in the world in serious jeopardy, all because the Clinton White House is approaching the health care problem as a monolithic one to be fixed in one fell swoop."
Kevin Anderson, a White House spokesman, responded tonight: "This is such transparent demagoguery that it is laughable. He is throwing every scare tactic in the book at a plan that hasn't even been announced, and not a single bit of it sticks in the face of the facts.
"The President's plan will achieve simplicity and improve quality, savings that will fuel job creation, and, most importantly, the security of health care that's always there, for every American, no matter what."
Like the briefing book the Administration issued to members of Congress a few weeks ago, the Republican report is first and foremost a political document. Titled "Worse Than the Disease? An Analysis of the Clinton Approach to Health Care," it asserts that requiring all employers to contribute to health insurance for their workers -- a requirement that is expected to be a main part of the Clinton plan -- is "a Dr. Kevorkian plan for jobs," a reference to the Michigan doctor who assists in suicides.
 
'Managed Coercion'
 The report continues: "It is an economic axiom that driving up the cost of labor reduces the number of job opportunities. Employers who are compelled to provide employees a certain benefit do not pay for the added cost, they shift it on to employees (by reducing other benefits or the number of employees) or on to consumers (by raising prices.) Either way, employees are harmed."
The document also gives a new name to the philosophy of health care restructuring that the Administration has embraced -- the mix of government regulation and market forces known as managed competition. "To distinguish the pure theory of managed competition from the highly bureaucratic version that is reportedly the heart of the Clinton plan, we will refer to the Clinton version as 'managed coercion,' " it declares.
The report asserts that the Clinton plan, which is expected to revolve around community insurance purchasing cooperatives for businesses and individuals, is ominously bureaucratic and a big step down the road toward a government-controlled system.

In a World of Plastics, Can Yucatan Find a Place?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROGRESO, Mexico

 BODY:
In the steamy villages along the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, a few Maya Indians still grow the long-stalked hemp plants that for more than a century were used to make the twine and rope that once brought great wealth to this part of Mexico.
But the hemp that this area is known for -- it is not to be confused with cannabis, also known as hemp, which comes from a different plant -- has almost disappeared, driven out by the development of plastics and synthetic rope and cheaper production in Africa and South America. 
 Now work and the rhythm of life are very different for Mayans like Samuel Tun Cauich, 32, who earns the equivalent of about $5.65 a day gluing together hand-painted mirrors for shipment to the United States.
The company he works for, Capriccio, is one of several dozen that Yucatan State has helped bring here to fill the gaping hole left by the demise of the hemp industry. In the struggle to find a replacement, the state has worked harder than most others in Mexico to lure foreign businesses and develop local companies. The effort has concerned local critics who see ancient ways of life disappearing.
But many Yucatecans believe that even work in an overheated factory or a gloomy warehouse is better than just dreaming about the past.
 
A Century as King
 "After the hemp shut down the villages were split up and people went in every different direction because we had nothing to eat," Mr. Tun Cauich said. "Now I'm doing all right, I guess, and my father is all right, but we're not earning anything like we did before."
What happened to his family is fairly typical of how the collapse of the hemp industry strained the fabric of life in Yucatan. For more than a century hemp was king. Its spiked leaves were processed into a coarse thread that was shipped from this port city and the nearby port of Sisal all over the world.
In Merida, beautiful white and pink mansions reflect hemp's past glory, just as unrestored mildew-covered mansions nearby show how hard this area has fallen in 50 years.
Mr. Tun Cauich was born in Tahmek, a Maya village 26 miles southeast of Merida. His father grew the hemp plant, called henequen, and sold it first to private middlemen.
In 1964, the industry was nationalized. Mr. Tun Cauich's father sold his hemp to the Government company, Cordemex, at heavily subsidized prices. Mr. Tun Cauich's older brother Alfredo worked at a processing plant, and later at Cordemex.
But no amount of subsidy could keep Yucatan hemp competitive. In 1991 the national Government cut its losses and dissolved Cordemex.
Now most of the hemp fields are gone and many of the steel-sided buildings that housed Cordemex are empty. Mr. Tun Cauich said his father lives off his pension and what hemp he can sell to the local market, where there still is some demand. His brother Alfredo took his severance pay from Cordemex to open a small butcher shop, while Mr. Tun Cauich took a job in a Merida factory.
"It's better now, but there are many, many things that make life here very hard for us," he said.
Without hemp, the state of Yucatan needed to take the unusual step of starting a business development program, said David W. Goff, project director for the state Secretariat of Industrial and Commercial Development. So far it has attracted 29 small assembly plants, called maquiladoras, in which parts are brought from the United States, assembled here and shipped back to the United States. Such plants are numerous along the Rio Grande border but rare here.
The state of Yucatan now has business representatives in Chicago, Coral Gables and El Paso, and advertises its advantages heavily. One advertisement caused a stir this year because in it Yucatan offered American businesses labor costs below $1 an hour.
Critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would lower most border tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada, complained that the advertisement showed how the difference in wages between the United States and Mexico would lead American businesses to flee south of the border. The advertisement was withdrawn.
A local official with the National Indigenous Institute, Christina Pech Cuc, has opposed the maquiladora program because she says it speeds up the migration of campesinos to the city, destroying what is left of traditional culture. But for at least one maquiladora worker, it is the heat, more than the low salary or the loss of tradition, that is hardest to accept.
Every morning the worker, Adam Flores, bicycles two and a half miles from the village of Dzitas to the San Angelo Sports Products Company plant in the Yucatan Industrial Park. His job is to stand between two large ovens operating at around 500 degrees Fahrenheit while pouring molten blue plastic into the mold of a longhorn steer head.
The heads are shipped to Texas, where aspiring cowboys use them to practice lasso roping. San Angelo is owned by a United States company and was relocated from Texas less than three years ago partly to take advantage of lower wages. After two years on the job, Mr. Flores, a 29-year-old father of three, earns the equivalent of about $14 a day.
"Compared to what someone would get in the United States that's very small," he said. "Here, it's O.K., but still, you're always lacking something."

Trade Dispute With China Spurs Drop in Wheat Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wheat prices tumbled yesterday after the United States said it would suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in exports to China because of that nation's reported sale of sensitive missile technology to Pakistan, traders said.
The sanctions, mostly on high-technology equipment, prompted worries that China would retaliate by halting purchases of American grain. China is eligible to buy more than 5.5 million tons of American wheat under a subsidized export program. 
 On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for September delivery fell 4 cents a bushel, to $3.05 1/4.
Traders said wheat futures also came under pressure after the Canadian Government estimated this year's wheat crop at 34.2 million tons, up about 2.2 million tons from the latest estimate by the United States Agriculture Department.
On other commodities markets, cotton prices shot higher as worries about crop damage from insects in the Mississippi fields caused heavy buying.
December cotton rose 1.63 cents a pound, to 58.17 cents, on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Crop experts said Mississippi would see its cotton crop reduced if farmers could not control a heavy infestation of beet army worms.
"This outbreak is the highest we have seen since 1988," said Bob Head, an entomologist and crop consultant.
 
Lower Energy Prices
Meanwhile, oil prices closed lower, despite continuing uncertainty about a possible strike in Nigeria, a big oil exporter to the United States, and a surprising drop of 4.7 million barrels in gasoline stocks in the latest week.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude oil fell 3 cents, to $18.32 a barrel, and September unleaded gasoline lost 0.55 cent, to 53.25 cents a gallon.
Live hog and pork belly prices were higher on anticipation of an American purchase of pork to be donated to Russia.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, February pork bellies closed at 48.775 cents a pound, up 0.425 cent, while October live hogs rose 0.550 cent, to 45.975 cents a pound.
After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department said it would spend $19 million to buy pork carcasses for Russia.

HEADLINE: Nigeria Gas Price Rise Ignites Fury at Government

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, Aug. 25

 BODY:
In an oil-producing country accustomed to having some of the world's cheapest fuel, the decision this week by the military authorities to raise gasoline prices ten-fold has set off anger, anxiety and panic buying.
The move to introduce a new higher-priced grade of gasoline and make fewer pumps selling lower-priced fuel was even seen as part of a diabolical scheme by the military ruler, General Ibrahim Babangida, to foment chaos as an excuse to retain power. 
 "I think some people want to set this country ablaze," said Morgan Anibo, acting general secretary of the Nigerian Labor Congress. "Those who introduced this should be regarded as enemies of the country, not patriots."
And as Mr. Anibo and other analysts pointed out, raising the price of gasoline from about 11 cents a gallon to nearly a dollar a gallon would almost surely ignite a firestorm of protests even in relatively wealthy economies of Western Europe and the United States. But the impact of higher prices is far worse here, where the average worker earns about $27 a month.
Indeed, the desperate search for pumps distributing lower-priced gasoline today tended to overshadow the start of a three-day campaign of civil disobedience called by human rights activists in an effort to press the military ruler to step down and make way for an elected government.
Senior Government officials announced on Sunday that General Babangida would resign Thursday, and hand over power to an appointed interim government. But organizers of the strike insist they will not be satisfied until the military hands over power to elected civilians.
Moshood Abiola, a wealthy publisher and industrialist who is widely believed to have won the annulled June 12 presidential elections, is reported to have gone to Great Britain. Associates say that Mr. Abiola received death threats here earlier this month and that they have warned him against a hasty return to Nigeria.
Here in Lagos, the biggest city in Africa's most populous country, millions of workers stayed home today, as virtually all banks, shops and Government offices were closed. Most public transportation was also shut down.
Unlike a similar protest earlier this month, which emptied the city's usually congested streets, traffic was lighter than normal, but still relatively brisk, partly because of motorists searching for stations still selling gasoline at low prices.
Moreover, the strike's impact seems to have been limited to Nigeria's southwest region, Mr. Abiola's political and ethnic base.
Reuters reported that conditions were normal in Abuja, Nigeria's new federal capital, where a military parade was scheduled to bid farewell to General Babangida on Thursday. The same was said of the northern and mostly Muslim cities of Kano and Sokoto, where people were said to be going about their business, apparently oblivious of the protest.
Nigeria has long been under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to raise its heavily subsidized fuel prices, but has refused to do so until now, local analysts and diplomats say, because of the civil unrest higher prices might cause. Modest price increases last year touched off some of the worst rioting here in recent memory.
The new two-tier pricing system was made effective at midnight last Monday. About 80 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings come from petroleum exports, most of it to the United States.
In announcing its decision, the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said gas stations could still sell the cheaper regular grade, now priced at about 3 cents a liter, or about 11 cents a gallon, but would have to reserve some of their pumps for the new Super Three Star gasoline, costing about 34 cents a liter, or $1.05 a gallon.
The Government added that 35 percent of gas stations would be required to sell both grades, while some would sell only Super Three Star, and the rest would sell the old grade. Many Nigerians believe, however, that the cheaper grade of gasoline will soon be phased out.

HEADLINE: U.N. Counts on U.S. Rangers to Find Warlord

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Aug. 25

 BODY:
After more than two months of guerrilla attacks against United Nations peacekeepers, their commanders say the arrival of 400 elite United States Army troops Thursday will not only help in the capture of a fugitive clan leader but will also be critical in regaining control of the streets of Mogadishu.
The deployment of the Rangers is part of a move by the United Nations to capture Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, who has stymied the United Nations mission here, officials say. 
 In an effort to neutralize General Aidid and begin a reconciliation with his backers, the United Nations has also stepped up talks with members of his clan. But General Aidid has repeatedly turned down the suggestion of quietly going into exile while the United Nations prepares his trial.
The arrival of the Rangers, who will be under United States command, underscores the United Nations' reliance on Washington. They will join more than 15,000 United Nations troops in Mogadishu, most of whom are pinned down in their compounds by several hundred Somali militia.
United Nations officials, who as recently as last month insisted the capture of General Aidid was an isolated operation that would not affect the stability in the rest of the country, now say he must be arrested as soon as possible if the relief mission in Somalia is to be successful.
General Aidid has been accused of masterminding an ambush on June 5 that killed 24 Pakistani peacekeepers. On June 12 the United Nations began bombings and raids aimed at destroying his power base and put up a $25,000 reward for his capture. But his militia has continued its guerrilla war against United Nations troops, with ambushes and daily mortar and rocket attacks on their compounds.
More than 30 peacekeepers have been killed and hundreds of Somali civilians have been killed and wounded, feeding the growing anti-United Nations feeling in this city. The troops have hunkered down.
In the latest phase, General Aidid's militia has focused on United States troops, killing four G.I.'s on Aug. 8 with a remote-controlled mine on a Mogadishu street. There have been three other similar explosions that wounded several other American soldiers.
United Nations officials say General Aidid now may have access to Soviet-made SA-7's, shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles, and therefore the United Nations has closed the airport to commercial flights and has grounded its fleet of huge white Soviet helicopters that ferried its employees from their residences to headquarters.
"Aidid is holding back the economic rebirth and rehabilitation of this country," said Jonathan Howe, a retired United States Navy admiral who is the United Nations special envoy in Somalia. "We're dealing with a terrorist. The sooner he is out of circulation and in a legal process, the happier I'll be."
 
Officers Are Frustrated
 The hunt has begun to frustrate high-ranking military officials, who would have preferred to act in early June. But although the Rangers are trained in urban warfare, night raids and long-range reconnaissance patrols, their success is not certain and the United Nations still faces limited choices in capturing General Aidid. The Rangers will also patrol the city, officials said.
Initially the United Nations relied on military air strikes to destroy General Aidid's power base. These were discontinued when a vituperative international outcry followed a helicopter attack on July 12 that killed dozens of Somalis, and an angry crowd stoned four journalists to death.
United Nations officials say they are concerned about not creating an image abroad of peacekeeping troops turned vicious policemen, but the military has expressed frustration at the criticism.
With bitter sarcasm, the deputy United Nations commander in Somalia, Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Montgomery of the United States Army, said: "It is the unalienable right of the Somali militia to kill and maim United Nations soldiers. But it is treated as a human rights violation if there is any military response against those responsible."

Cable and Phone Companies: Foes or Allies?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The question of who will build and control the "information superhighway" to deliver interactive television, hundreds of channels and telephone service to the consumer's home in the future, has long been regarded as a pitched battle between the giant local telephone and cable television monopolies. But if a Federal court decision on Tuesday is upheld, it is likely to usher in an era of cooperation between the two industries that can be expected to vastly change telecommunications competition.
Such cooperation could accelerate the use of interactive television and other services. It might lower the fearsome price for replacing today's limited-capacity phone system with an advanced fiber-optic network, a price estimated at $275 billion -- more than $3,000 a household. 
 The new competitive lineup might also restrain the rise in cable television rates by giving cable companies new competition from phone companies. "The court ruling was terrific for cable TV consumers," said Kenneth G. McGee, vice president for the Gartner Group, a high-technology research firm in Stamford, Conn.
The decision by the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., will almost certainly be appealed. If it is upheld by higher courts, it could be revised by new laws from Congress. But if allowed to stand, the decision would let telephone companies for the first time own and offer video services in their own territories.
The case for cooperation between the two giant industries is a strong one because they are complementary in many ways. Telephone networks are good at switching millions of phone calls in a flash, but their copper wires do not have enough capacity to carry an acceptable TV picture. Cable networks have high capacity, but are largely one-way transmissions and are not built for switching.
Phone-company billing systems are good at tracking billions of small transactions, something cable companies are not good at, and in which they must develop skill if they are to offer video-on-demand services.
Combining resources would be ease the burden in building new networks. The largest local phone companies, known as the Baby Bells, have annual revenue exceeding $95 billion. The cable industry's annual revenue exceeds $24 billion.
"Any way you look at it, cooperation makes a great deal of economic sense," said Wendell Bailey, vice president of science and technology for the National Cable Television Association. The resentment between the two industries would still have to be overcome. Almost in the same breath, Mr. Bailey added, "But if cooperation means the phone companies own the farm and we're just a field hand, then we don't want it."
Not everyone is sanguine about the possibility of cable and telephone alliances. "It would be the triumph of the monopolies," said W. John Aronson, consumer communications analyst for the Yankee Group, a market research firm. "The phone companies, which monopolize large areas, would cooperate with cable TV companies, which monopolize small areas."
Cable and phone companies are already cooperating in various ways. In February, Southwestern Bell, the local phone company in Texas and Southwestern states, agreed to buy two cable systems for $650 million, both outside the company's service area. In May, U S West agreed to invest $2.5 billion in a Time Warner venture as well as to develop advanced technology for consumer video services. And in Britain, American phone companies like Nynex and U S West are allowed to provide both cable television and telephone service.
Recent state and Federal regulatory and court rulings had given phone companies greater latitude outside their territories, but only to carry video programs -- not to own or make them -- within their areas.
Tuesday's ruling, in which the court said the companies could produce and own the programs, came in a case brought by Bell Atlantic, one of the Baby Bells. The company owns phone carriers from New Jersey through Virginia and is eager to build advanced fiber-optic networks nationwide. Though the ruling applies only to the Bell Atlantic case, it appears to be broadly applicable to any phone carrier, especially GTE and the six other regional Bells.
Nynex's experience in Britain might hint at the future in the United States. The Government there wanted to encourage rapid introduction of cable television services by letting experienced companies offer a variety of communications services. "We are the company that the Bell Atlantic ruling makes possible," said Eugene P. Connell, president of Nynex Cablecomms in England.
As American regulators require more competition in the regional Bells' markets, the Bells fear their efforts to provide universal service will be undermined. Businesses and long-distance companies like A.T.& T. have been charged high fees to use the regional Bells' networks, subsidizing service in rural areas. "Assuming the Bell Atlantic ruling is upheld, video could be an important source of revenue," said Robert C. Fuehr, a US West vice president.

HEADLINE: Strong Yen May Bring Operating Loss at Toyota

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation, the strongest of Japan's automobile companies, may suffer its first operating loss ever this year if the Japanese yen stays at its current high level, officials said today.
"That means we are faced with the most serious potential crisis in our company history," Ryuji Araki, the general manager of Toyota's financial division, told reporters. 
 The rise of the yen, which makes cars produced in Japan more expensive and therefore less competitive on world markets, is only the latest problem. The Japanese economy is in a stubborn slump, and the European Community's car market, where Japan's market share is restricted by a voluntary agreement, is rapidly contracting. In the United States, Japanese companies have lost market share in the last year because the yen's appreciation has forced them to raise prices and because the Big Three auto makers, which have improved the quality of their vehicles, have become more competitive.

 Toyota, which was founded in 1937, is Japan's No. 1 auto maker and is the world's third-largest, after the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company.
The company's prognosis, a testament to the new troubles of Japan's once nearly invincible auto companies, was made as Toyota officials, including its president, Tatsuro Toyoda, announced financial results for the last fiscal year, which ended on June 30. Sales were flat while net income fell 25.8 percent, the third consecutive yearly decline.
The company made it clear that a fourth consecutive decline was on the way. While the company is forecasting a thin operating profit for the parent company for the year that began in July, the projection is based on an exchange rate of 110 yen to the dollar. If the yen stays closer to 100 to the dollar, officials said, the profit may disappear.
Analysts are not seriously worried about Toyota. The company has huge financial reserves that could tide it over a temporary loss, and it has what rivals consider the strongest balance sheet of any auto maker in the world. It is regarded as perhaps the most efficient, tenacious and resourceful of Japan's auto companies. Toyota also controls two-fifths of Japan's domestic passenger car market and is in a position to gain share from its Japanese rivals, particularly Nissan and Mazda, which are in much more serious straits.
But the travails of the company that created the "lean production" system that is widely emulated is a sign of the trouble spreading through Japan's auto industry.
"If things are this bad for Toyota, they must be much worse for the other companies," said Benjamin Moyer, an auto industry analyst for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
On a consolidated basis, meaning the results of its subsidiaries are included, Toyota reported net income of 176.5 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, based on the June 30 conversion rate of 107 yen to the dollar. That is down from 237.8 billion yen, or $1.9 billion, a year earlier.
Operating income fell 16.8 percent, to 181.9 billion yen, or $1.7 billion. Net sales rose five-tenths of a percent, to 10.21 trillion yen, or $95.4 billion, from 10.16 trillion yen.
 
 
Sales Plunge in Japan
 The company's worldwide sales of motor vehicles dropped 1 percent, to 4.46 million units. But in Japan, the company's biggest market, sales fell 7.4 percent, to 2.16 million units. The company's exports rose 1.6 percent, to 1.72 million units, with growing shipments to Southeast Asia and Latin America offsetting drops in exports to North America and Europe.
Toyota provided forecasts for the year that began in July for only its parent company. According to those projections, production of vehicles in Japan, net sales and net income are all expected to drop.
Each fall of 1 yen in the dollar's value costs Toyota about 10 billion yen, or about $100 million, in lost income annually. The company is projecting an operating profit of only 70 billion yen for the new fiscal year and only 10 billion yen for the first half. But that is at an exchange rate of 110 yen to the dollar. By those calculations, if the dollar is below 103 yen, the forecasted profits would be wiped out. Yesterday, the dollar rose in New York trading to close at 105.05 yen.
"We intend to pursue every opportunity in that regard to avoid a loss," Mr. Araki said.
 
 
Fewer Models
 Toyota is trying to cut costs by designing fewer and simpler cars. It is also trying to reduce its white-collar work force by 30 percent. To do so, it has taken 30 percent of white-collar workers off their normal jobs and assigned them to cost-cutting. Officials said there was fat to cut, because the company had become somewhat bloated during Japan's "bubble" boom in the late 1980's.
Asked if the company would resort to layoffs, breaking the tradition of lifetime employment, Mr. Araki said, "Unless we resort to price increases, it will be difficult to avoid that."
The company is expected, however, to resort to price increases. Reports here have said Toyota plans to raise prices about 5 percent, on average, on 1994-model cars to be sold in the United States. That might be followed by another increase later in the model year.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Is Endorsed by Speaker of City Council

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, seeking to rebound from the unwelcome glare of his deposition on the Crown Heights violence, won the endorsement yesterday of the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and announced the hiring of one of the Speaker's top aides for his campaign staff.
The announcement on the steps of City Hall was part of a broader strategy to reach out politically to the city's white middle-class neighborhoods -- a constituency that Mr. Vallone represents -- where support for Mr. Dinkins is weakest. 
 That the Democratic Speaker endorsed the Democratic Mayor was not surprising despite some ideological differences and frequent institutional frictions between Mr. Vallone and Mr. Dinkins.
 
Added Significance
 But the endorsement took on added significance with the announcement that Mr. Vallone had relinquished one of his chief aides, Kevin R. McCabe, to join the Dinkins campaign as its director of political operations.
Senior officials hope that Mr. McCabe can provide the Mayor's campaign with organizational skills and strong ties to predominantly white, politically moderate and conservative sections of the boroughs outside Manhattan, where enthusiasm for Mr. Dinkins appears to be lagging and where his Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is considered strongest. In his campaign, Mr. Giuliani yesterday released his plan for improving the city's school system. [Page B3.]
Of Mr. McCabe's joining the Dinkins team, a campaign aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: "This gives us a good balance. It shows we're a campaign for everyone." Mr. McCabe is likely to give the Mayor's campaign greater access to local political organizations in Council districts throughout the city.
Mr. McCabe's title on the City Council staff is director of the operations division, but he is also steeped in the complex politics of the Council's 51 districts.
Both Bill Lynch, the former deputy mayor who is the Mayor's campaign director, and Mr. McCabe said they had been talking for some time about his joining the campaign.
But the announcement yesterday came at an opportune time for Mr. Dinkins, who has been reeling for a week under the weight of a city investigative report that criticized how senior administration officials handled the awarding of a lucrative Parking Violations Bureau contract and the embarrassment of being questioned in a legal deposition on his handling of the 1991 Crown Heights disturbances.
The second all-day session of the deposition is scheduled for today at Gracie Mansion.
 
Liaison in Queens Talks
 Mr. McCabe, who lives in Forest Hills, played a major role last spring as the liaison in private talks between the Dinkins campaign and the Queens Democratic leader, Representative Thomas J. Manton.
Mr. Manton endorsed the Mayor, which was a major blow to the mayoral hopes of Andrew J. Stein, the Council President who was then planning to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic mayoral primary. Within a week of the endorsement by Mr. Manton, an old friend of Mr. Stein's, the Council President dropped out of the race.
Mr. Lynch said Mr. McCabe would have broad responsibilities in the Dinkins campaign, helping in everything from the media campaign to relations with local, state and national elected officials. His prime job will be to coordinate the Dinkins campaign's citywide political efforts with its more local concerns, Mr. Lynch said.
Mr. McCabe, who is a respected figure at City Hall as an all-purpose troubleshooter for Mr. Vallone, said he hoped to be helpful to the Mayor in areas of the city where Mr. Dinkins is perceived to be weak politically. While acknowledging implicitly that the Mayor was unlikely to actually outdraw Mr. Giuliani in votes in many predominantly white, conservative neighborhoods of the city, Mr. McCabe said he thought that there were ways to improve Mr. Dinkins's standing.
 
'A Step Back'
 He said he thought the campaign could persuade some skeptical voters "to take a step back and re-evaluate where they really are."
"I'm not talking about dramatic 20-point jumps in any places," Mr. McCabe said. "I'm talking about an aggregate, in which you pick up people who think and understand how difficult this city is to govern, how good the Mayor really has been on certain issues."
Mr. Vallone, in endorsing the Mayor, acknowledged that they have often disagreed on issues, but he said they had reached a consensus on most of the important matters, including the city budget and the expansion of the police force.
The Speaker compared the last four years, when the city was striving to withstand a deep recession, to a turbulent airline flight.
"I want an experienced pilot at the helm," Mr. Vallone said. "We have an experienced pilot at the helm now. We've been through a lot of rocky air together, and I think we'll have a much better future with David Dinkins."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Faulted on Education Plans

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Offering his vision of how to improve New York City schools, Rudolph W. Giuliani formally endorsed the breakup of the central Board of Education yesterday, but then came under attack for what one political opponent called a "180-degree flip-flop" on the issue.
His proposal appeared to be a reversal of his previous stance that breaking up the central board would only increase the bureaucracy. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, a Democrat who has proposed a similar breakup of the board, accused the Republican-Liberal candidate of reversing views that he offered as recently as July. 
 Mr. Giuliani said in a more recent radio interview that he supported breaking up the Board by creating boards in each of the five boroughs; in yesterday's speech he again endorsed the idea during a broad address on educational issues.
Seeking to offer incentives to improve educational quality, he also urged raises for teachers and others who deal directly with students, but he did not say how he would pay for the increases. The Mayor has resisted raising teachers' salaries, and the teachers' union is currently working without a contract.
 
Interest Groups for Adults
 Mr. Giuliani's proposals, made during a speech at the Roosevelt Hotel, at 45th Street and Madison Avenue, formed the core of what he called a broad "agenda for reform." That agenda stressed increased policing in and around city schools coupled with a return to the basics in education and a move away from what his briefing paper typified as "the interest-group politics which engulf the central Board of Education," a focus his paper described as serving the interests of adults instead of students.
Taken together, his proposals both adopted some ideas already under consideration and at the same time drew the broad outlines of a school system in which discipline and performance are given priority over social concerns. Harking back to his vocabulary as a prosecutor, he said he wanted the police to "secure the perimeter" of city schools while giving principals more control over their students, teachers and custodians.
Yet both his speech and a 19-page briefing paper provided little detail of how the changes would be made. Though Mr. Giuliani decried everything from decrepit school buildings to out-of-date textbooks and said he would give teachers a salary increase "as an incentive to elevate the proficiency of teaching," he did not outline where the money for those improvements would come from.
Ms. Messinger's plan, devised with Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, backs a decentralization of power and the transfer of decisions on such matters as policy, supplies and where to develop experimental schools to the district level.
 
Reversing Position
 In adopting parts of that plan, said Ms. Messinger, Mr. Giuliani reversed himself on comments made before the Education Priorities Panel on July 13. In that meeting, Mr. Giuliani said he was leery of creating borough boards because he feared that it would cause a proliferation of patronage and perhaps increase the city's bureaucracy. He repeated that concern yesterday but said he hoped to deal with it by requiring a cut in the overall level of bureaucracy.
More troubling to Ms. Messinger was Mr. Giuliani's statement that he would require at least half of all school board members to be parents of children in the school system, a requirement he could not meet himself, since his two children go to Catholic schools within the city.
Ms. Messinger said she backed that idea herself, but added that that in the course of researching her plan, she had discovered that such a requirement would be unconstitutional.
"If Giuliani knows that but went ahead and said it anyway," said Ms. Messinger, "then that is really pandering. You know, the guy is running for mayor and there aren't too many details and one of the few details he has won't work." Ms. Messinger is a longtime supporter of Mayor Dinkins.
 
'Fiasco,' Dinkins Staff Says
 Leah C. Johnson, Mayor Dinkins's campaign press secretary, responded to the speech yesterday with a statement that the Republican-Liberal candidate "goes 0 for 2 on so-called policy plans." Ms. Johnson said halving the Board of Education's bureaucracy would cut only 1.5 percent of the budget and would not save much.
"With this education fiasco," she said, "Rudolph Giuliani falls into the same trap he fell into with his economic plan: His numbers simply do not add up."
Among Mr. Giuliani's other proposals were these:
* A commitment to allow principals more control over staff hiring and firing decisions and the supervision of the work of custodians in a manner that would not conflict with overriding state and city laws.
* Creating a two-block crime- and drug-free zone around city schools, and giving police the responsibility of training school security guards and running background checks on those employees.
* A shift to grade promotions based on merit instead of "benevolent" promotions driven by social priorities.
* And a commitment to limit board terms to eight years and schedule school board elections at the same time as general elections.
 
Would Call on Specialists
 Mr. Giuliani spoke generally about the troublesome issues that dominated discussion in the school board last year. He did not define who would decide such difficult matters as condom distribution in the schools, AIDS education or sex education relating to homosexuality. And he did not mention the much-criticized "rainbow curriculum."
Instead, he offered to bring a wide array of specialists together.
"Once elected, Rudy Giuliani would immediately meet with the five Borough Presidents, educational specialists, key legislators, state education officials, union representatives and representatives of educational interest groups and develop a strategy for resolving unanswered questions," his briefing paper promised.
That group would have its work cut out. Tucked among the candidate's proposals were promises to create more innovative schools, increase cooperation between city schools and local colleges and universities, study the possibility of having local school boards take over the city's Head Start and day care system, expand evening, weekend and summer programs and "look to the use of schools as service centers for adult literacy and English courses; health and child care programs; and social events for students and parents."
Money for those improvements would presumably come from the state. Mr. Giuliani said he would fight for more money.

HEADLINE: Operation Match: Donate Pint, Then A Meets O-Positive

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARAMUS, N.J., Aug. 23

 BODY:
"You look kind of familiar; you're sure we haven't met somewhere before?" Familiar words, but the scene is not a singles bar; it's the recovery room at the Bergen Community Regional Blood Center.
This is singles' donor night, and the cover charge is a pint of blood. Short, white-haired Frank has just sat down next to Amy, a petite woman who, like Frank, is wearing a tag identifying her by her first name. 
 After an animated few minutes during which Frank and Amy find that they have the same blood type, A-positive, the twosome, arms bandaged, leave to find sandwiches in the refreshment room and continue their discussion.
This is the eighth singles' blood-donor evening at the center since the promotion began in August 1989.
"We'd need four drives to get this many donations in one night," said Rita Polchin, director of donor recruitment for the center. She's busy this evening running around and making sure everyone mingles.
 
Each August and January
 Ms. Polchin explained that singles' blood drives are held each August and January, when blood supplies are low because people are on vacation and schools have shut down. Tonight was a godsend, she said; about 90 pints, or units of blood, were collected, which went a long way toward meeting a shortage of 300 units.
The center has been hard-hit by all the corporate layoffs, which have cut into bloodmobile collections at offices. "This economy has hurt us so badly, I can't tell you," Ms. Polchin said. The Regional Blood Center, which employs Ms. Polchin, is a private nonprofit organization supplying blood to hospitals in four counties; the blood donors are volunteers.
For weeks the center has been running ads in the singles' sections of newspapers saying, "Come meet your type" and, "Blood donors are the right type." Food, prizes and fun were promised. About 45 singles' groups sent fliers, and some of them, like Volunteer Ventures and Parents Without Partners, are on hand to help with registration and games.
Most of the participants have given blood before. Many affect an air of nonchalance; they just happened to walk in and were surprised to find a singles' event taking place. Nonetheless, they are game to play games and see what develops socially.
 
Jackpot for a While
 Paul Oliver, a blood donor, says he hit the jackpot last year: he won the door prize of a gift certificate to a local restaurant and he met a nurse that very evening to share his prize with. The couple has broken up.
About 15 percent of the 112 participants who have come tonight will find out that they can't give blood this evening, Ms. Polchin said. Low or high blood pressure, colds, allergies, even a recent visit to the dentist are the most common reasons they will be eliminated.
"Can you believe it; here I am a first-time donor and I've been turned down because of low blood pressure," a woman named Cindi tells Hank Horowitz, who is from Fair Lawn. He makes her a poodle out of a balloon to cheer her up. He works in the shipping department of a large company, but moonlights as a clown at birthday parties on the side, he explains.
"Don't worry about it, be like me: I'm here to party," Mr. Horowitz says, smiling.
Meanwhile, Allan Susen is feeling a little out of it. A banker from Haledon, he is giving blood in a corner of the donor room. "I'm married and I just came over to make a direct donation for my mother," Mr. Susen explained. "My wife is waiting for me out in the parking lot; that is, I hope she's waiting for me."
 
A Game of Pictionary
 A staff member walks over to Ms. Polchin to say that the parking lot is filling up and that traffic should be directed to the Grand Union lot. Ms. Polchin agrees.
Eventually, a game of Pictionary begins in the refreshment room.
"Hi, my name is Dennis; do you all know how to play this?" asks a volunteer, dividing the room into two teams and pulling tall, embarrassed Celeste to the front of the room and over to a blackboard, to draw a mug representing the word "brew" that her team will try to figure out. They guess ice cream soda and root beer, but can't get it. It doesn't matter, though; this game is an ice-breaker and it's accomplishing quite a lot.
Dave Rotondella, a ponytailed contractor from Cliffside Park who is wearing a pink baseball cap and two earrings, walks in and several women give him the eye.
"I donate four times a year and I just happened to come over tonight," Mr. Rotondella says as he reaches for a soda. "Lucky me; this is a definite bonus."

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 13.13 to Reach Another High

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks traversed record territory yesterday for the second consecutive day, fueled by gains in cyclical issues, which are among the first to benefit in an economic recovery, and lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 13.13 points, to 3,652.09. It was the sixth time in seven trading sessions that the Dow closed at a new high. 
 Most other stock indexes also closed at record highs yesterday, withstanding a bout of selling near the end of trading. Buying momentum from Tuesday, when the Dow gained 32.98 points, supported prices, analysts said, but some profit taking tempered the carry-over.
 
Nasdaq Index Off
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was strong, with 301.7 million shares traded, up from 270.7 million on Tuesday. The number of advancing issues led decliners by 1,108 to 865.
The Nasdaq composite, the only major index to decline, was off 1.48 points, to 733.66.
Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc., sounded a cautionary note on the market advance.
"With industrials, utilities and bonds all at new highs, the market has gotten overbought and could pause to digest recent gains," he said.
He saw the high-technology sector as an example of overbuying, saying that while prices could still move higher, "time is running out on this cycle and investors are urged to move to seats near an exit."
"But if investors must buy," he said, "they might consider oil and telephones as a somewhat defensive position."
Bond prices were initially weakened by a report that sales of existing homes improved in July. But bonds rallied and interest rates fell after the July report on durable goods orders showed weakness in manufacturing. Low interest rates make the potential returns from stocks more appealing to investors.
"The bond market says the economy is dead and the stock market sees it recovering by buying cyclicals," David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said. "It will be interesting to see how this all plays out."
 
Effects of Cable Ruling
 Airline and cable-television equipment stocks were among the bright spots yesterday.
Shares of cable-equipment makers surged amid expectations of ballooning sales to telephone companies, which were freed by a Federal court ruling on Tuesday to enter the cable television business.
Broadband Technologies was up 6, to 40 3/4. Scientific-Atlanta rose 3, to 36 1/4; DSC Communications was up 4 3/8, to 65 3/8, and General Instrument climbed 3 3/8, to 49 1/2.
Delta Air Lines gained 2 1/4, to 55 1/2, on an upgrading of its stock by Paul Karos, an analyst at First Boston, to buy from hold. AMR, parent of American Airlines, was up 1 3/4, to 67 5/8; UAL, parent of United Airlines, gained 2 3/4, to 149 1/8, and USAir rose 1/4, to 16.

HEADLINE: Luxury-Tax Refunds Start

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service is ready to begin refunding several million dollars to retailers who collected the now-repealed luxury tax on expensive yachts, jewels, furs and planes.
Most customers who paid the tax on those items since Jan. 1, 1993, should get in touch with the merchant for a refund, the I.R.S. said today. But a person who paid the tax directly to the I.R.S., as on a purchase from a merchant abroad, for example, would need to claim a refund from the I.R.S. by filing Form 843. 
 Though Congress repealed the tax on yachts, jewelry, planes and furs, it remains in effect on luxury cars. The $30,000 threshold above which the car tax applies, however, will be raised each year to account for inflation.
The repealed tax applied to jewelry and furs costing more than $10,000, yachts above $100,000 and planes over $250,000. The tax was imposed as part of a deficit-reduction plan enacted in 1990. It produced $305 million in Federal revenue during the 12 months ending last Sept. 30, the most recent period for which figures are available. About 90 percent of the money was paid on expensive cars.
In general, refund claims must be filed within three years after the due date of the original tax return, or two years after the tax is paid, whichever is later.

HEADLINE: American Vanguardists Find Audience in Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VASSIVIERE EN LIMOUSIN, France

 BODY:
The 1960's and 70's were the golden age for American performers to find work in Europe. Conservative American arts institutions stifled the vanguardists, while the underdeveloped American regional opera scene forced singers abroad.
Now, even with the lingering recession at home, American singers can find work with American companies and the evolution of trendy performance spaces around the United States has created a network for contemporary musicians, theater directors, choreographers and performance artists.
At the same time, the recession in Europe, combined with the development of local talent and an increasingly nativist attitude, has curtailed job offers here for Americans. Yet Americans still do get overseas, and not just high-profile directors like Robert Wilson. Two interesting, veteran New York performance artists, Connie Beckley and Joan Jonas, appeared in France and Germany in June, while all season long Mr. Wilson has been busy with new European projects. 
 Ms. Beckley is also a composer and sculptor. She has long been active in New York, but never quite so prominent as Laurie Anderson, whom she in some respects resembles. Ms. Beckley's is a quieter, subtler, more introspective art than Ms. Anderson's. It doesn't seek a broad audience, nor has it attained one.
 
Alone but With Help
 Typically, she works alone, as Ms. Anderson did before she got record-company support and hired a backup band. In both cases, to be sure, "alone" means onstage alone; there are eager helpers for the sound and lights, so this remains a collaborative process.
Ms. Beckley's piece "Melody on a Curve" was presented in mid-June at one of the many vanguard performance spaces that now dot the European landscape, in this case, the Kunstlerhaus Mousonturm in Frankfurt as part of a series of New York-related performance events. If opportunities in Europe for American artists have declined, interest in American novelties remains strong. Ms. Beckley's performance was an offshoot of a two-month stint she spent at the University of Giessen near Frankfurt, teaching about vanguard theater.
Typically of Ms. Beckley, her piece had all the ingredients of an opera with none of the brash assertiveness that form implies. She laid out what might have seemed like a dogged series of tasks, then executed them in a way that evoked all manner of emotions, some more purely esthetic, others sweet or moving or troubling.
As one entered the room, one found a circle of black, helium-filled balloons huddling close to the floor. In the course of an hour, Ms. Beckley crawled around the circle, freeing each balloon to float upward to the length of its tether. Each tether was slightly higher than the last, making a gradually unfolding upward curve of balloons. (Ms. Beckley said afterward that it took four hours to tape the balloons in place for each performance.)
As she liberated the balloons, she sang songs or recited fragments of text or assumed poses. Some passages involved memory, real or imagined; all flowed together into an artwork that felt coherent even if one could never quite figure out how the coherence was achieved.
If Ms. Beckley represents New York Minimalist cool surviving through the hot 80's into the practical 90's, then the 1960's-flavored performance style of Joan Jonas has survived an even longer journey. In late June, as part of a tour that included indoor performances in Berlin, Ms. Jonas offered "Variations on a Scene," a piece seen in an earlier form at Wave Hill, overlooking the Hudson in Riverdale, the Bronx. It is hard to imagine it indoors, even with video evocations of its outdoor setting, since it so much relied on the charms of nature, and in particular the spectacular setting of the Arts Center on the Ile de Vassiviere here.
 
A Socialist Legacy
 The island sits in the middle of an artificial lake created to supply hydroelectric power to this central French region and now a popular vacation setting. On the island is a sculpture park with a striking post-modernist building, complete with a slim, conical tower, designed by Aldo Rossi, the Italian architect. This Arts Center houses a regular series of exhibitions and workshops, but is itself worthy of a pilgrimage, one of the finest legacies of Socialist arts construction in the Jack Lang era.
Ms. Jonas is an important figure in the history of New York performance art, one of the first to use video in live theatrical pieces. She has also long been concerned with women's issues in a way that has encouraged other female artists and arts writers to incorporate that agenda into their own work.
Unfortunately, this latest piece seemed more fragmentary and self-involved than communicative. It consisted of a sequence of scenes in different locations on the center's grounds, with the loyal audience traipsing along dutifully. Some of the scenes commanded one's attention: performers appearing over a low rise signaling and semaphoring mysteriously to one another, or a striking German performer, Geno Lechner, hurling herself brutally across the wide lawns. Alvin Curran's music, which blended with Ms. Jonas's own sound collages, was characteristically haunting. But the setting, both natural and architectural, outshone this particular performance decisively.
Mr. Wilson's work can be seen occasionally in his native United States, as can that of Ms. Beckley and Ms. Jonas. But unlike them, he gets by far the majority of his opportunities abroad.
 
Wilson's 'Alice' and 'Orlando'
 The two most notable Wilson events this season (this fall there will be Wilson stagings of Susan Sontag's play "Alice in Bed" at the Schaubuhne in Berlin and of Puccini's opera "Madama Butterfly" at the Bastille Opera in Paris) were "Alice" at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg and "Orlando" at the Theatre Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland.
"Orlando" was Mr. Wilson's French-language restaging of a monologue, originally adapted by the director and Darryl Pinckney, the American writer, from Virginia Woolf's novel. First seen in 1989 in German with the remarkable Jutta Lampe of the Berlin Schaubuhne delivering the two-and-a-half-hour text, the Lausanne version was redone for Isabelle Huppert, the French stage and film actor.
Miss Huppert is eager to expand this "Orlando" into a feature film, shot on location. That would be a first for Mr. Wilson, and perhaps Miss Huppert would shine on screen, although one has to wonder how much money is available, in the wake of Sally Potter's "Orlando," for two artsy movies on the same theme; Mr. Wilson's office claims not to be concerned about that. On the stage, however, Miss Huppert was no match for Miss Lampe, lacking the German's range and technical command of this most demanding of theatrical showcases.
"Alice" is a sequel to "The Black Rider," which was also a product of the Thalia Theater and which at long last is set to reach the Brooklyn Academy of Music this fall. With alternately quirky and touching songs by Tom Waits, who was also Mr. Wilson's collaborator on "The Black Rider," "Alice" examines Charles Dodgson, who under the pen name Lewis Carroll wrote the beloved tales of Alice and her curious entourage of Wonderland creatures.
The text by Paul Schmidt, an American, sensitively explores Dodgson's curious relationship with young girls, and principally with Alice Liddell, the main model for the literary Alice. Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Waits and Mr. Wilson do not shy from the queasier implications of this obsession, which Dodgson expressed in photography as well as prose. But they also honor him and the art he produced. As acted and sung by the same fine ensemble that appears in "The Black Rider," in the same quaint and curious mixture of German and English, "Alice" is both entertaining (Mr. Wilson's evocation of the Wonderland phantasmagoria) and moving, with the Wonderland scenes used to evoke Dodgson's inner demons.
Perhaps it is more moving for English-speaking observers who grew up on the "Alice" books than for Germans; the German critics were cooler to "Alice" than they had been to the campier, funnier -- and more German -- "Black Rider." But the final scene of "Alice," with Annette Paulmann as Alice Liddell in extreme old age reminiscing fondly about her loving mentor, is the stuff of great art.

Three-Division Playoff Format Likely Next Year

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Negotiations between baseball owners and players for expanded playoffs and three-division play very likely will be brief and successful, given the public positions of the two sides, and the new format should be implemented for the 1994 season.
Boston's John Harrington, chairman of the owners' schedule format committee, said today that the owners are prepared to move quickly to realign the National and American Leagues from two divisions each to three divisions each. The Players Association has indicated it would approve an additional round in the pennant playoffs if the owners took that step. 
 "Absolutely, we're all for three divisions," Harrington said by telephone from Boston. "It's not an impossibility to do it for next season. One of the reasons we were proceeding slowly was to make sure we had given the Players Association adequate time to consider it. We didn't want to create the notion that we were trying to ram something through. We felt it was better to phase in these changes -- expanded playoffs one year, three divisions the next."
When the owners approved the additional round of playoffs for next season, they said they wouldn't consider going to three divisions before 1995. Then Monday, Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association, said that the players opposed expanded playoffs that would include two non-championship teams but that they would consider the new round if each league's playoff included three division champions and the second-place team with the best record.
"I was pleased to hear Don say that with certain conditions they would favor three divisions," Harrington said.
If any element could bog down the negotiations, it would be agreement on how the players would be paid for the post-season games.
"The difference between this year and years past is a new element -- the form the television package takes," Eugene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said, declining to discuss the subject further.
Harrington, Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies and Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, will meet Thursday in New York with Orza and Lauren Rich, also a union lawyer, to begin negotiations on the changes. Fehr is on vacation.
"We'll show them why we want to do it, show them the fan survey showing why the fans want it," Harrington said. "We'll go over the economics, what it means for the game with more races. Then it's a matter where if everybody wants to do it, we'll have to get ownership to sign on when they meet in Boston next month. We'll make certain schedule adjustments and impleent it for 1994."
The owners will meet Sept. 8 and 9. If negotiators for the owners and players agree to the new format, some teams would have to be persuaded that the placement of their teams is important to the overall effort of making the leagues more attractive.
If any National League team is to change divisions, it must give its approval. The Atlanta Braves would prefer to be in the Eastern Division instead of the Central, but, Harrington said: "I think they've looked at it and can adapt. I don't think any National League team would raise their veto power if they're moved to a different division."
The American League has no veto provision. Approval of the change would require 10 votes from among the 14 clubs.
The Detroit Tigers appear to be the A.L. team that likes the three-division alignment the least because they are scheduled to be in the Central Division, separated from their old A.L. East rivals New York, Boston, Cleveland and Baltimore.
 
A Delicate Balance
 The Texas Rangers, Harrington said, don't want to be in the Western Division unless the teams play a balanced schedule under which teams would play the same number of games against each team regardless of which division they are in.
"We'll have to talk it out with those guys to be fair," Harrington said, "but I'm confident we can resolve it at the meeting next month."
Fehr, in a letter to Ravitch on Monday, said an unbalanced schedule "clearly deserves serious scrutiny," but if time made it impractical, "we would be willing to consider a three-division, balanced schedule for 1994."

HEADLINE: Film Festival '93: An Emphasis On the Epic, as Seen Personally

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
The New York Film Festival, now in its 31st year, will lead off on Oct. 1 with Robert Altman's "Short Cuts," a three-hour panorama of life in contemporary Los Angeles that is based on the short stories of Raymond Carver, and close two and a half weeks later with "The Piano," Jane Campion's bizarre love story set in 19th-century New Zealand. The Campion film, to be shown on Oct. 17, shared the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in May with Chen Kaige's "Farewell, My Concubine," which will also be shown here.
The festival comprises 32 films, which will be shown at Alice Tully Hall. About half the films are from the United States, France and Britain. In a departure from past festivals, Eastern Europe and Latin American film makers are barely present, their place usurped by film makers from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
 The films range in length from Tim Burton's 11-minute animated film "Vincent," to Mr. Altman's 189-minute epic, which is just 9 minutes longer than Ray Miller's "The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl," one of six documentaries in the festival. There are familiar names from past festivals, like Ken Loach, the Taviani brothers, Ms. Campion and Chantal Ackerman, and newcomers like Pierre Yameogo of Burkina Faso.
 
A Guitry Retrospective

 
 As in past years, the festival will present a retrospective program; this fall the subject will be the French director Sacha Guitry. Seven films by Guitry, who was an important influence on Orson Welles, Alain Resnais and Francois Truffaut, will be shown at the Walter Reade Theater from Oct. 1 through 7. Guitry's best-known film, "The Story of a Cheat," will be shown at Alice Tully Hall as part of the main festival program.
Richard Pena, the chairman of the festival's selection committee and the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, said the festival did not organize its program around any particular theme. "It's a way of seeing world cinema that comes with a vision of where things are now and where they are going," he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Pena did point to trends and currents that are reflected in the 1993 festival program. "You'll see several films that could be called, for lack of a better term, personal epics," he said. "These are film that take an ambitious look at a broad swath of history but filter it through one person's experience."
Examples include "Farewell, My Concubine," which covers the most recent half-century of Chinese history through the story of two men who meet as apprentices at the Peking Opera, and "The Puppetmaster," set in Taiwan under the Japanese occupation during World War II. "The Night," a Syrian film, looks at the struggle of Arabs in southern Syria to establish a sense of identity in the 1930's and 40's, when the country was under French rule.
Tran Anh Hang, a Vietnamese living in France, lovingly recreates the day-to-day life of a household in Saigon during the late 1950's and early 60's in "The Scent of the Green Papaya."
 
Trend Toward Emotion

 
 Mr. Pena also said that many of the films in this year's festival reflect a more emotive approach to film making than has been shown in past years. "A number of films really require the kind of personal involvement we tend to associate with the older, classic films, but without the romanticism and sentimentality," he said. " 'Shades of Doubt,' for example, deals with a case of incest and the emotional breakdown of an entire family." The film is the work of the French director Aline Issermann.
The festival will include four British films. Two are bleak portrayals of working-class life in contemporary Britain: Ken Loach's "Raining Stones," about an unemployed Manchester man who becomes involved with loan sharks, and Mike Leigh's "Naked," about the tenants of a London house. In "The Snapper," a comedy, Stephen Frears picks up the story of the same fictional lower-middle-class Dublin family that was portrayed in Alan Parker's "The Commitments." In "Blue," the director Derek Jarman, who has AIDS, bares his soul in a monologue while standing against a blue screen.
One of the more unusual films in the festival is "It's All True: Based on an Unfinished Film by Orson Welles." The documentary reconstructs a turning point in Welles's creative life, his ill-fated attempt to film a multi-part epic in Brazil in 1942.
At the center of the documentary is 50 minutes of film that scholars thought had been lost by RKO, the studio that sent Welles to Brazil and then pulled the plug on the project. The film that Welles sent back, all of it unedited rushes, was rediscovered in the mid-80's and edited by Richard Wilson, Welles's assistant in Brazil, relying on shooting scripts and other documents, as well as his own recollection of conversations with Welles.
The reconstructed episode from the uncompleted epic tells the story of fisherman from northwest Brazil who traveled by raft to Rio de Janeiro to present a list of grievances to the president. The incident was taken from the newspapers, and Welles used the actual fishermen as actors.
"In formal terms, the film looks very much like what the Italian neo realists would do about six years later," said Mr. Pena. "Here you have Welles, in one of his most fertile creative periods, right after 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' embarking in an entirely new direction."
 
A Return to Poland

 
 On rare occasions, unsolicited films make the final cut. This year, the festival's jury chose "Birthplace," a Polish documentary about a Polish-born American Jew who returns to his hometown to find out what became of the relatives he left behind when he fled the Nazis.
The oddball in this year's lineup is "Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas," a stop-action animated film directed by Henry Selick and produced by Mr. Burton, the director of the Batman movies and "Edward Scissorhands."
The festival will also include "Ruby in Paradise," the first film by Victor Nunez since "A Flash of Green' in 1985, and "The War Room," a documentary by D. A. Pennebaker that follows the activity at Democratic campaign headquarters during last year's Presidential campaign.
In addition to Mr. Pena, the judges for this year's festival were Wendy Keys, the film society's executive producer for programming; David Ansen, the film critic for Newsweek; Stuart Klawans, the film critic for The Nation, and Joan Juliet Buck, the film critic for Vogue, who is a new member of the committee.

Seeing the Bright Side of Castro's Cuba

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
In the dear, dire days when there were two sides to the cold war, journalists of a certain bent ranged the world and brought back rhapsodies to countries like Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China and Sadinista Nicaragua. When one such People's Paradise fell into disfavor, there was always another to celebrate. Among the minor side effects of what tonight's offering in the "P.O.V." documentary series delicately calls "the collapse of the socialist camp" has been the drying up of that once rich vein of inspiration to television documentary producers. But take heart: Cuba remains.
"Miami; Havana" begins with snatches of interviews on attitudes of Cuban-Americans in Miami toward their motherland and of Cubans in Cuba toward the United States. Hard political lines and softer personal feelings are expressed on both sides. The program's point of view is represented by Wayne Smith, a former State Department official in Havana and a longtime critic of American policy. He wants an end to the economic embargo of Cuba and a resumption of normal relations. 
 But that issue, eminently worth discussing on television, is forgotten as the program, part of the "P.O.V." series, gives way to severe Castrophilia both in pictures and in words. The United States is blamed for Cuba's current economic difficulties, but the narrator reports in what used to be Tasstalk that "great efforts are being made in agriculture" and there are "great advances in science." She does not fail to mention the free health care and the free education; less attention is paid to free elections or a free press. If you think you have heard this sort of thing before, you have, about every people's democracy that ever existed.
There are a few muted criticisms of Havana, but the dominant theme is pounded in by young Cubans shown saying "Si!" to Fidel Castro; elderly Cubans shown dancing ("We're quite happy here"), and a man who declares that his return home after living miserably in the United States for a while made him feel like "the happiest man on earth." This repatriate is interviewed on a lovely beach ("The beach belongs to the people"), in the company of children enjoying ice-cream cones. The hour ends with visit-Havana tunes accompanying pictures of some Cubans who have been evicted from the United States returning joyously to Cuba and, it says here, to freedom.

Mets Need Man With a Green Thumb

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
THE last time I saw Dallas Green before yesterday was four summers ago, down on the farm. George Steinbrenner had sent him there, with pay, to finish out the 1989 season.
One of Steinbrenner's concocted reasons was a kid named Roberto Kelly, who was nursing his separated shoulder in the Cincinnati Reds' clubhouse yesterday when the subject was raised. 
 "Oh yeah," said Kelly, the Americanized Panamanian who now goes by Bobby. "Dallas put me in center field, told me I'd be hitting ninth, not to worry about driving in runs. Told me, 'Just put the ball in play.' "
By August, Kelly, a minor league .260 hitter, was batting .340. Steinbrenner's "people" were wondering why Green refused to bat the speedy Kelly second or third. "The whole point was that he was learning how to hit in the major leagues," Green said yesterday.
For his banishment from the Yankees, Green actually had a choice of farms, neither in Columbus, Ohio. One was outside Philadelphia, another in a place called Conowingo, Md., a sprawling acreage with an old country house and a slew of cows grazing contentedly like so many veteran Mets shagging late August pre-game flies.
Proudly showing off the Conowingo grounds atop his tractor one afternoon, Green said that the only challenge he could imagine for his old-fashioned self in this economics-driven sport would be the game's equivalent of a field in need of a plowing, a planting and the caretaking of someone with the proverbial green thumb.
"With expansion coming, that's what I'd be interested in," he said. He meant as a general manager, with the kind of control he once exerted over the Chicago Cubs. But expansion came, and Green's phone didn't ring. When the Mets called last spring and asked him back to the dugout wars, he was 59 years old, his Conowingo fields were whipped into shape and, what the heck, it wasn't as if he was returning to the South Bronx.
He had no idea that Shea Stadium was so dysfunctional a neighborhood. Four months into a three-year contract, Green has a team less competitive than expansion level and works a field that must not only be plowed but fumigated as well.
"There's not a damned thing I could do with some of the people that were here, the Colemans, the Murrays," Green said yesterday before the mooing Mets lazed their way to a 4-1 defeat.
The imminent departure of Vince Coleman will merely be a first step toward changing the perception of the Mets as a team collapsing to one that is rebuilding. When that process is further along, the Mets will be fortunate to have the look of the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins, teams with training wheels, Green's field of dreams team. Unfortunately for him, his job won't be to build it.
With Joe McIlvaine returning, Green doesn't even know if he'll be back to manage the Mets. Among the questions he can't answer is whether McIlvaine wants to work with a strong-minded veteran he didn't hire.
More important than Green's status is how McIlvaine will position the Mets. Does he finally admit to New York that 1986 may as well be 1936, that this team must start from scratch? Or does he cling to the flawed policy of the last two years, the position that the Mets are a winter of manipulation from sneaking off with a divisional title.
"It's not impossible to go last to first in today's baseball, and no team proves that better than the Phillies," said Green.
Green and, better yet, McIlvaine, should know that the Mets can't be next year's Phillies. Bad as they were last season, the Phillies had cornerstone players in their lineup, like John Kruk and Lenny Dykstra. They had pitchers with huge upside potential. The Mets have little of either.
After his team's 83d defeat yesterday, Green reiterated that all he is concerned about now is "trying to keep the young kids going to where we can look forward to 1994." Barring some wild and crazy free-agent spree, next year's Mets should rightfully belong to Jeromy Burnitz and Jeff Kent and Ryan Thompson, among others, and they will need a teacher who is honest and unafraid enough to do the planting right.
"If they're smart, they'll let Dallas at least get them going in the right direction," said Kelly, who took his .319 batting average to the disabled list a month ago.
He said he had been depressed because he was on his way to his best season in the majors. "Best for average since '89," he said. "Even though that year, I didn't finish so good."
That year, Kelly was moved from ninth in the order to third the day after Green was replaced by Bucky Dent. He finished at .302.

HEADLINE: Economy Of Stops And Starts

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
In this stop-and-go economy, as soon as one engine starts to rev up, another seems to sputter.
That was borne out in new data released today: Sales of existing homes spurted 5.4 percent in July to the highest level since December, the National Association of Realtors said, but the Commerce Department reported that factory orders for big-ticket items like cars and planes fell an unexpectedly hard 3.98 percent last month. The drop was the sharpest in 19 months and indicated that manufacturing, stuck in a rut for months, was not near a rebound. 
 Factory orders are volatile, and July's drop followed a sharp rise in June. But Charles Waite, associate director for Economic Programs at the Bureau of the Census, said, "The bottom line is that nothing much has been happening to orders since the surge at the end of last year."
 
Orders Up for Capital Equipment
 One bright spot in the orders data was a second consecutive monthly rise in business orders for capital equipment -- now more than 11 percent above the level of a year earlier.
Today's reports suggest that the lowest long-term interest rates in three decades are beginning to stimulate interest-sensitive parts of the economy like housing and investment. But they also suggest that the stimulus may not be enough to overcome the drag from weak export markets, slow job growth and consumers' dismal mood.
"Until you get job gains and a boost in confidence, you're just not going to get robust numbers," said David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "Low interest rates are the only game in town and they're certainly not enough."
The orders report raised the possibility that forecasts by the Clinton Administration, the Federal Reserve and most private economists, all predicting growth of around 3 percent in the second half of the year, may be too rosy.
"The Administration is being way too optimistic," said Brad Roller, president of Swyger Coil Systems Inc., a Cleveland supplier of parts for electric engines. "Business in general stinks, and when I tell people it's pretty good for our company, they always say they're not hearing much of that."
Still, economists are not changing their forecasts yet, saying they will wait for next week's jobs report before tinkering with the numbers, if then. As one Treasury official said: "It's summer doldrums. The data are kind of cloudy right now and we'll have to wait until after Labor Day just to know what the economy is doing now."
For one thing, while the orders report was clearly bad news, most economists said it did not signify that manufacturing was shrinking.
A sharp drop in aircraft orders accounted for more than half of the $5 billion decline in all orders. But because it takes so long to get planes into production, today's low orders are a better indication of production a year or two from now than of production later this year.
A large decline in car orders may not mean much for future production, auto analysts said. Car "orders" really mean showroom sales, which did weaken in July and early August but edged up recently. Inventories are relatively lean and the Big Three are all planning to increase production now and in the fall, even if by less than they said a couple of months ago.
Excluding transportion equipment, orders edged up 1.3 percent. If car production rebounds as expected, economists said, factory output should continue to grow very slowly.
Economists took special comfort in the fact that orders for capital goods other than aircraft edged up in July for the second consecutive month, to an $83 billion annual rate. Such data hint that businesses are continuing to invest, even if at a slower pace than the double-digit rate of the spring.
 
Existing-Home Sales Strong
 Things look better in the housing market, especially in the West and even in the Midwest, where the long-lasting flood was expected to weaken home sales. Sales of existing homes -- which dominate the housing market -- rose to a 3.88 million annual rate in July. Though a bit shy of last December's 4.0 million rate, that's one of the strongest monthly rates since 1979. The Northeast was the only region of the country where sales weakened.
The spurt in home sales, the fourth in a row, is likely to help the economy a bit because new homeowners tend to buy appliances, furniture, drapes and even second cars.
But existing-home sales do not imply gains in home building as they used to, when older and more affluent couples vacated older houses for newly built ones.
"The trade-up guys have taken out big home equity loans and watched housing prices soften, said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, "so existing- home sales have been consistently stronger than new-home sales."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 28, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about the economy's performance in July, as well as a separate article about the credit markets, misstated the decline in factory orders for big-ticket items like cars and planes. Orders for such durable goods fell 3.8 percent last month, not 3.98 percent.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR INDUSTRY SEEKS INTERIM SITE TO RECEIVE WASTE

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
After decades of pushing for a permanent repository for radioactive wastes from power plants, the nuclear industry is reluctantly concluding that a central temporary storage site will be needed before a permanent one can be ready, and that a pile of money is waiting for anyone who provides the land for it.
The industry, with 110 plants producing electricity across the nation, is paying hundreds of millions of dollars a year into a fund managed by the Department of Energy that can be used for an interim site. 
 Some operating plants are running out of storage space and running into opposition when they try to store more spent fuel. In addition, as plants are retired, utilities are faced with costs of up to $21 million a year for each plant to maintain storage pools for waste at the reactors.
And although the Department of Energy plans to open an underground repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., in 2010, the utilities have little faith that it will open then.
 
$3.8 Billion Fund for Storage
 Financial experts who study the industry estimate that an Indian tribe or county willing to rent a patch of dry land about half the size of Central Park in Manhattan for temporary storage could collect $50 million a year, and expect a lease of at least 20 years.
In recent years, 29 tribes, counties and other jurisdictions have applied for small grants from the Department of Energy to study whether they would like to enter negotiations to provide a site. But in the last month two tribes, the Mescalero Apaches in New Mexico and the Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians in Utah, applied for grants of $2.8 million each and said they would like to begin negotiations.
The fund, now with a balance of $3.8 billion, brings in hundreds of millions more each year. The money is primarily intended to pay for a permanent repository for nuclear waste but would be available to pay for interim storage. In addition, the utility companies that own the nuclear plants have strong economic and political reasons to engineer a solution, even a temporary one.
From the Yankee Rowe plant in Rowe, Mass., to the Rancho Seco plant near Sacramento, Calif., shuttered nuclear power plants must spend tens of millions of dollars a year to maintain pumps and emergency systems and to pay control room and security staffs -- costs that would be avoided if the spent fuel were stored somewhere else.
The cost can run as high as $21 million a year for each plant, and dozens of plants are expected to close in the next decade or two.
 
Easing Political Pain
 A central storage site would also spare the industry considerable political pain. In Minnesota, the Northern States Power Company, having wrung conditional permission from the public service commission to build its own cluster of storage casks at its twin Prairie Island reactors, must seek special legislation from the state legislature in February.
In Michigan, the Consumers Power Company fought a bruising battle with environmentalists to be allowed to build casks at its Palisades plant, but the utility still faces a Federal lawsuit trying to stop the making of more casks.
And later in this decade Consumers Power may have to repeat the process at its Big Rock Point plant, which is the oldest operating reactor in the United States.
No one sounds enthusiastic about taking nuclear waste for a few decades, especially since it is not now clear where the waste would go at the end of the period. But the money that is likely to be available is turning heads.
"I've come to the conclusion that the Federal Government and the industry are ready to pour a huge bucket of money over any community that will take the monitored retrievable storage," said Miller N. Hudson, the negotiator for the Mescalero tribe.
The amount of money would be set at a reverse auction envisioned in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Under this plan, the Government would attach a higher and higher price tag to the waste, until somebody agrees to take it.
 
Faustian Bargain

Some environmentalists deride the process as a Faustian bargain, but the transaction is ostensibly a rental, not a permanent sale. Among the details to be worked out is what would happen if Washington is no closer to establishing a permanent dump 50 years from now than it is today. In the meantime, though, a lot of money is at stake.
Mr. Hudson, a former telephone utility executive and former state legislator, said $50 million a year would be reasonable. Executives in the nuclear industry described that figure as steeper than what they had in mind but not out of the question.
"I would think $25 million to $50 million shouldn't be a problem, if they'd accept fuel from all the utilities," said Mark D. Luftig, an analyst at Kemper Securities Inc. who specializes in utilities.
At the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, Julie Jordan, the program manager for an interim waste repository, said such a site could result in "a few hundred million savings to the whole system" over 40 years.
The casks store waste in a dry environment cooled by air, sharply limiting the possibility of corrosion or mechanical failure. Most waste is now stored in pools, which require equipment to circulate water. Such casks already operate in South Carolina and Virginia, and the industry has taken representatives of several Indian tribes to tour plants there.
Because the casks are considered leak proof, the land on which they are temporarily stored would not be contaminated and could be used for any purpose after the waste is shipped to a permanent site.
The pileup of waste is attributed to these unforeseen circumstances:
*Uranium has turned out to be far more plentiful that anyone imagined, while utilities have canceled about half the nuclear reactors they once ordered, destroying the financial incentives for reprocessing spent fuel.
*President Jimmy Carter banned reprocessing to limit the spread of plutonium, a byproduct of nuclear power generation and a bomb fuel.
*Delays in finding a permanent place for the fuel.
As a result uranium pellets in pencil-thin metal tubes, bound together in bundles, are stacking up in storage pools. As long as a nuclear plant is operating, much of the upkeep is simply routine work that must be done anyway. That changes once a plant is shut.
 
Costs of Storing Waste
 For example, the Yankee Rowe plant, in Rowe, Mass., retired in 1992 after 32 years, the longest that any plant has run so far. But the plumbing for the spent fuel pool must be kept running. That means maintaining filters, pumps, cooling systems and water tanks in good repair, keeping the building secure, lit and ventilated, staffing the control room, and paying for a dozen other tasks that were taken care of when the plant was working but are all extras now. The owners plan to decommission the plant, but they cannot do so until they get rid of the fuel; on the current Energy Department schedule, that would be in 2018.
Yankee Rowe will cost $247 million to decommission, William McGee, a spokesman, said, and nearly $60 million of that is to build casks to store the wastes until 2018. Much of that could be avoided if the waste could be shipped away.
Not all utilities are eager to get rid of their fuel. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which closed its Rancho Seco plant, near Sacramento, in June 1989, eventually plans to put its fuel into casks and leave it there. One reason, said David Freeman, the general manager, is the problem of shipping.
"There is a lot of public anxiety that has a touch of reality to it about shuttling the casks across the country," he said. "I think it's time to reassess this issue, to see if it isn't best to leave it where it's created, at the power plant site."
Mr. Freeman, whose utility is building windmills and solar plants, said: "We're doing well without nuclear fusses. I don't want to waste my time fooling around with this issue."
 
More Plants to Retire
 Rancho Seco's fuel is still in its pool. The costs for keeping a plant active just to run the pool can be $7 million to $21 million a year, according to the Edison Electric Institute. The number of retired plants is expected to grow steeply in the next few years, as repairing older reactors becomes too expensive.
And some utilities want to ship the fuel away so that they can tear down the plants and dispose of the land. In addition, some environmentalists think the fuel would be more secure in one central location that was designed for permanent storage rather than in scattered places across the country, the pattern that is now developing.
The nuclear industry and the Department of Energy have focused on Indian reservations because many have available land and might reach a consensus more easily than, say, a county government. Public officials in New Mexico strongly oppose that use of the Mescalero Apaches' reservation there, although the Energy Department asserts that under Federal law the decision rests with the tribe.
But Government and industry officials close to the search for a site expect that some of the money, whatever the total, would be given to neighboring local governments or spent in ways that would benefit the economy of the area, thereby softening the opposition.
They also anticipate that much of the money would go into a trust fund. There are 3,200 Mescaleros on the reservation, which means that if the money were paid directly to individuals, it would come to more than $15,000 each. One executive in the nuclear industry suggested, however, that if the tribe came into that much money, "You would find a lot of Mescaleros with roots they hadn't acknowledged before."


GRAPHIC: The nuclear power industry, facing dwindling storage space for spent nuclear fuel and escalating costs for new storage solutions, is working with the Department of Energy to find a temporary storage site that would be shared by scores power plants.
 
THE ORIGINAL PLAN HAD PROLEMS . . .
Chart: "What to Do With the Wastes?"
 Civilian power reactors operate or have operated at 73 sites in the United States, most designed with their own temporary storage for spent fuel. The plan was to cool the fuel rods in pools for five years or so, then truck, them to a reprocessing plant. But reprocessing proved to be uneconomic and was banned by President Carter to prevent the spread of nuclear bomb fuel, a byproduct of reprocessing.
 
. . . A PERMANENT SOLUTION IS YEARS AWAY . . .
 The Department of Energy would like to open a permanent storage site at Yucca mountain, Nevada, in 2010, but the utilities have little faith that it will open then, if at all. Even if it does, it will take many years to truck the spent fuel there.
 
. . . SO INTERIM STORAGE HAS BECOME MORE URGENT
 A tax on electricity generaged by nuclear plants is bringing hundreds of mmillions of dollars annually into a fund intended to finance storage solutions. Industry experts say that an Indian tribe or county that volunteers to take the wastes may be able to collect $50 million a year in rent for a least 20 years.
 Two tribes, the Mescalero Apache tribe of New Mexico and the Skull Valley band of Goshute Indians of Utah, are beginning the third stage of a four-phase project intended to lead to final negotiations with the Energy Department for an interim solution.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Novell Leads Stock Selloff In Software

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Novell Inc.'s announcement of an earnings decline pushed its stock sharply lower today, putting pressure on the shares of other networking software companies and depressing the Nasdaq market.
Novell's stock fell $2.125, to $19.125, in reaction to its release after the market's close on Wednesday of third-quarter results that fell below Wall Street's expectations. 
 More than 13.6 million Novell shares were traded, the most on the Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.27 points, to 731.39.
Nine of the 10 most active Nasdaq issues were software or computer-related companies, and they all fell in price for various reasons. The group included the Oracle Systems Corporation, down $4.375, to $50.375; Sybase Inc., down $6, to $60; Cisco Systems Inc., down $2.625, to $50.375, and the Informix Corporation, down $1, to $20.
Sybase and Oracle fell after William H. Shattuck, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, had lowered his ratings on the stocks from "buy" to "hold." Mr. Shattuck said he felt the data base companies would come under pricing pressure from the Microsoft Corporation, the biggest software maker.
Novell's results for the third quarter included several special charges that caused a net loss. But even without the charges, earnings fell, marking the first time the Provo, Utah-based company's earnings had fallen on a year-to-year basis since the third quarter of 1989.
Adding to investors' concerns was Novell's announcement earlier this week that its chairman and chief executive, Ray J. Noorda, would now share executive duties in an office of the president with Mary Burnside, executive vice president of operations, and James R. Tolonen, senior vice president and chief financial officer. The issue of a successor to Mr. Noorda, who is 69, has been a concern at Novell, but analysts said the latest move did not resolve it.
For its third quarter, which ended July 31, Novell reported a loss of $255.4 million, compared with earnings of $66 million for the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose 12 percent, to $272.8 million from $243.3 million.
The results for the 1993 quarter included special charges totaling $320.5 million from the acquisitions of Unix System Laboratories, Software Transformation Inc., the Serius Corporation and Fluent Inc. Excluding the charges, net income for the third quarter was $62 million, or 20 cents a share, down 6 percent from the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of about 24 cents a share.
Novell said the third-quarter results included $11 million in revenue from the recently acquired companies, while expenses associated with these companies were $17 million.
On July 26, Novell said earnings would not meet analysts' expectations because of weak European sales. The next day, its shares fell to a 52-week low of $17.625. The shares had touched a 52-week high of $35.25 on March 12.
 
Lower Inventory Requirements
 Paul Johnson, an analyst with First Boston, said the weak European economy was only partly responsible for Novell's reduced earnings. He said the company had moved to lower the traditionally high inventories it required its distributors to carry, and that this had reduced sales growth. Recent consolidation in the distribution channel means that fewer, but more powerful, distributors will not take on large inventories, he said, adding that an anticipated shift to electronic distribution of software requires a rethinking of strategy.
"Novell is waking up and saying, 'We need to get our hands around this,' " he said.
Analysts also said that Novell management, in a conference call after the release of its results, had not been encouraging about near-term growth.
"They gave very little guidance on the call and have not been very available to analysts," said Doug Whitman, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.
"I believe this is the trough and we will see a gradual uptrend for the company," he said.
Analysts were divided over the significance of the creation of an office of the president. Some anticipated that Mr. Tolonen and Ms. Burnside would be named chief executive and chief operating officer, respectively, while others said a successor to Mr. Noorda could be one of Novell's division heads. These division leaders include Kanwal S. Rekhi, who assumes new responsibilities as executive vice president for corporate technology and continues as general manager of the Unix Systems Group. The post could also go to an outsider, analysts said.
"Ray decides," Mr. Johnson said. "He's the chairman; he's still the largest shareholder. It's his company."
Both Mr. Tolonen and Ms. Burnside "are very qualified," Mr. Johnson said.

HEADLINE: General Details Altered 'Star Wars' Test

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
A retired general who helped oversee a disputed 1984 "Star Wars" test says the target missile in the test was artificially heated to make it a bigger target for a heat-seeking sensor on an interceptor missile, and thus easier to hit, but he denies that the action meant the test was rigged.
The retired Army major general, Eugene Fox, then the deputy program manager for the test, also denies that Congress was misled about the experiment, in which the interceptor missile hit the target missile over the Pacific. The experiment was a crucial technological milestone for the fledgling missile-defense program, which had been under attack by scientists and skeptics since its inception in 1983. 
 At the time of the test, Pentagon officials said it was proof that a missile could hit another missile in mid-flight. The former Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger, said on Wednesday in a written response to questions on the subject that the test was intended to be "as realistic as possible."
But General Fox said in an interview on Wednesday that the artificial heating made the target 10 times more visible to the interceptor than an actual Soviet warhead would have been, citing a report to Congress on the test published in 1988 by the Office of Technology Assessment, an analytical branch of Congress.
 
'People Can Argue'
 "Clearly, we heated it because we wanted to see it," he said. "People can argue about that, and that's fair. That didn't mean that we were trying to cheat. In the entire concept of this test, people could fault us. My point is what we did was a normal test event." He said he was unsure whether the artificial heating was disclosed to Congress in 1984.
General Fox conceded it was possible, but unlikely, that something more was done to rig the test behind his back. "Could something have happened around me?" he said. "Yes, that's obvious. But I don't think so. I think that test was done fairly."
General Fox said an explosive charge had also been placed on the target missile. "We put a charge on it so that if we just happened to nip it we could see it, and so that visual devices on the ground could see it, and so that visual devices on the ground could pick it up," he said. "It looked like a nuclear explosion."
John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists and a critic of the missile-defense program, said the general's description made it appear that "the test was rigged at least two different ways." He added, "The debate is now not whether the test was rigged, but how it was rigged."
 
Who Made Accusations
 The veterans of the missile-defense program who brought their test-rigging assertions to Congressional investigators this summer said the 1984 test was manipulated when the target missile was equipped with electronic devices that helped the interceptor locate and destroy it. General Fox said he knew of no such device.
These officials also said the manipulation of "Star Wars" tests was part of a deception campaign, intended to fool the Soviet Union, that overstepped its bounds and wound up misleading Congress about the progress of the missile-defense program.
The accusations, first reported in The New York Times last week, outraged senior members of the Reagan Administration, who saw the assertions as a partisan political attack by Democrats in Congress.
Mr. Weinberger called the accusations fairy tales. He said nothing was done to deceive the Congress or the Soviets about the program or the disputed test. Mr. Weinberger also said comments he made last week about the frequent use of deception programs by the Pentagon were not meant to confirm the existence of any deception campaign connected with the program or to suggest that the disputed test had been deceptive.
 
Weinberger's Statement
 "The test was not enhanced in any way," Mr. Weinberger said in his written response. "Various aspects of the test were designed to make it as realistic as possible given the fact that obviously an actual Soviet re-entry vehicle could not be used to test our interceptor."
The charges, brought to Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat and a critic of "Star Wars" contracting practices, led Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to order an investigation last week. On Wednesday, William J. Perry, the Deputy Defense Secretary, asked John M. Deutch, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, to write a report in time for Mr. Perry to "resolve the issue in the next two weeks," a Pentagon official said.
Senator Pryor asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to examine the charges three weeks ago. Both teams of investigators lack a crucial piece of evidence: the missiles used in the experiment, which destroyed one another in what appeared to be a scientific triumph.
 
No Evidence to Examine
 "They are in pieces at the bottom of the ocean," General Fox said.
The goal of the $30 billion "Star Wars" program, which began in 1983, was to build systems that could shoot down an enemy's intercontinental ballistic missiles. After 10 years, it produced little in the way of a working system, although its defenders say it contributed significantly to the downfall of the Soviet Union by accelerating Soviet defense spending and thus damaging the Soviet economy.
In May, Mr. Aspin announced "the end of the 'Star Wars' era" and a scaling-back of the missile-defense program.
The accusation that the 1984 test's target and interceptor were "interactive," as one of the accusers put it, was a serious, though not unprecedented, challenge to the scientific integrity of the program. General Accounting Office investigations have confirmed past charges that military officials misled Congress about aspects of the missile defense program.
Last year, the General Accounting Office audited seven "Star Wars" tests between 1990 and 1992. The auditors found that three of the tests were accurately described to Congress. Those three tests were complete or partial failures. The missile-defense program's officials told Congress the other four tests were successes. That was untrue, the auditors said.
 
What an Inquiry Found
 The inaccurate claims included the success rates of experiments, the progress of the programs, the sophistication of the tests, the ability of interceptor missiles to distinguish between a target and a decoy and the missiles' achievement of accuracy and altitude goals, the G.A.O. reported.
"They have lied about certain functions that their missiles are supposed to perform," said a Federal investigator who agreed to speak only if he was not identified. "They've used things to enhance the target. The fact is that you've got something up there solving your guidance problem. And you've got an incentive to deceive. That's how you keep your program going."
A former Reagan Administration official, a nuclear physicist who closely studied the missile-defense program in the 1980's, said it was characterized by "secrecy, greed, self-deception, deception of the Congress and actually even of the President." The former official, who remains a Pentagon consultant and who spoke on condition of anonymity, is not among the accusers in the debate.
Other Reagan Administration officials and Pentagon documents confirm the existence of deception plans attached to the missile-defense program.
 
Top-Level Memorandum
 An April 1987 Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum entitled "Special Plans Guidance -- Strategic Defense," says the Pentagon should improve and update deception plans covering the missile-defense program's cost and abilities. The memorandum was distributed to the joint chiefs, their top commanders and the director of the National Security Agency, the nation's largest intelligence organization.
Mr. Weinberger said that to the best of his knowledge and memory there was no such program. He would not comment on the memorandum.
The question of whether Congress also was misled has been raised before. In March 1986, the trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology, reported that the Pentagon had long-standing disinformation programs covering the most expensive weapons programs, including "Star Wars." Quoting Defense Department officials, the journal said that the deception programs were intended to trick the Soviets but that disinformation might be transmitted to Congress.
It remains unclear whether anyone in Congress, including Mr. Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Service Committee from 1985 to 1992, was informed of the overall deception program, or whether anyone in Congress was deceived by progress reports on the missile-defense initiative. Also unanswered is a question put to Mr. Aspin by Senator Pryor: whether "this disinformation campaign may have laid a faulty foundation for what ultimately became a $30 billion program."

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Asks for End to Haitian Oil Embargo

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the Security Council today to lift a trade embargo it placed on Haiti in mid-June in an attempt to force the Haitian military rulers to return the nation's exiled President to power.
The Secretary General's recommendation followed by a day the Haitian Parliament's approval of a new Prime Minister, Robert Malval, who had been the choice of the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 The Security Council could end the sanctions Friday, after Mr. Malval is sworn in, or by early next week.
By cutting off oil to Haiti and freezing overseas assets of Haitians, the embargo has had a devastating effect on Haiti's already shattered economy. The United Nations embargo was superimposed on an earlier hemisphere-wide embargo called by the Organization of American States.
The Parliament's ratification of Mr. Malval, along with his program and his cabinet, came almost eight weeks after Father Aristide and Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military leader who ousted Father Aristide in September 1991, agreed to the priest's return to power on Oct. 30.
After his approval by Parliament, Mr. Malval appealed to the Security Council to lift the embargo.
The United Nations sanctions include a ban on all sales of military equipment. Food and medicine were exempted.
Suspending the sanctions does not end them. Under terms of the so-called Governors Island Agreement, worked out in New York in June between Father Aristide and General Cedras, the sanctions will be formally abolished only when President Aristide, who was the country's first freely elected president, is formally restored to power.
Shoring up the Aristide administration will be a United Nations presence dedicated to modernizing the Haitian armed forces and creating a new police force independent of the Army.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali estimated that more than 1,000 United Nations technicians would be employed on the Caribbean island, training the military and monitoring the new civilian police. Washington has already volunteered to provide many of the technicians. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Premier Flies to Washington
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 26 (Special to The New York Times) -- Prime Minister Malval flew to Washington today for talks with Father Aristide and is expected to be sworn in at the Haitian Embassy in Washington on Friday, officials said today.
The oil embargo, which was placed on Haiti on June 23 after the military refused to agree to restore Father Aristide, hit what was already the Western Hemisphere's poorest country extremely hard, creating gasoline shortages that forced cars off the streets and caused businesses to close, essential services to deteriorate and communications to break down.
Although experts say it will take at lest five days before oil and gasoline supplies reach consumers once the embargo is lifted, there was a noticeable rise in activity today.
Haitians, many of whom supported the embargo as the only way of getting Father Aristide back, said they were pleased the embargo would be lifted but remained noncommittal about the political future.
Optimism is prevalent overseas. International donors have promised to provide Haiti with $1 billion in aid.
In addition to advisory work in areas like road-building and construction, the technicians to be supplied by the United Nations are to help streamline the justice system and retrain the notoriously harsh police force.
The separation of the police and the Army is one of the laws that must be passed before Father Aristide's return. With Parliament adjourning for three months in early September, however, legislators face a race against time to get that and several other bills through, and preparations for Father Aristide's return could be set back.
"It is not going to be easy," the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Antoine Joseph, said, adding that it may be necessary for Mr. Malval to call an extraordinary session.

HEADLINE: PROGRESS IS HINTED FOR MIDEAST TALKS

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 26

 BODY:
When the Middle East peace talks resume in Washington on Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to discuss mixtures of new and old ideas that have senior officials on both sides speaking optimistically about a possible breakthrough.
Perhaps the most talked-about new plan would quickly give the Palestinians authority over the tumultuous Gaza Strip and the quiet West Bank city of Jericho, with Israeli forces pulling back from those areas. More sensitive questions of control over the rest of the West Bank and -- thornier yet -- the future of Jerusalem would be left for later. 
 The "Gaza and Jericho first" idea has been embraced by Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and has qualified support from Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel. But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is said to be highly skeptical, and in the end he holds the only opinion in the Israeli Government that counts.
Aides say Mr. Rabin feels that the Gaza-Jericho concept is too broad. One apparent reason is that Mr. Rabin is focused on limited Palestinian self-rule for the two areas, without full Israeli withdrawal, while Mr. Arafat has in mind a "mini-state," a Gaza-Jericho foothold for eventual full statehood throughout Israeli-occupied territories.
 
Hints of Secret Meetings
 Nonetheless, Israeli officials have dropped broad hints of secret meetings with the P.L.O. to produce the outlines of a possible deal. Without spelling out details, Mr. Peres said this week that an agreement was within reach. "I think we have worked out a package deal which is accepted more or less by the Palestinians and us," he said.
Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, also speaks hopefully about "a new course of events," including the Gaza-Jericho idea, that could breathe fresh life into stutter-start negotiations that have gone nowhere for two years.
But she plays down prospects for an immediate breakthrough. Other Palestinians and Israeli officials caution that the idea of Gaza-Jericho is still only that: an idea, not a formal proposal on the table.
Moreover, while the plan looms large for the Palestinians, it is only one of several themes forming Mr. Peres's "package deal." Other elements are not new, and agreement on them has eluded negotiators in previous rounds.
Under the basic formula for the talks, the two sides are supposed to focus on creating interim Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank over the next five years, while Israel retains ultimate control. The territories' final status -- matters like Israeli withdrawal under United Nations land-for-peace resolutions, and a possible Palestinian state -- are to be delayed.
 
Looking for Shortcuts
 But with the talks seriously stalled and with many Palestinians afraid that an interim stage could drag on for many years, negotiators have begun looking for shortcuts.
One idea that the Israelis are promoting hard, dubbed "early empowerment," would hand the Palestinians responsibility almost right away for a range of public services in the territories. But Palestinians view the plan coolly, worrying that it will leave them with routine functions while preserving Israel's military occupation.
Another suggestion, "Gaza first," would rapidly provide Palestinian self-rule in the impoverished coastal strip even while details are still being ironed out for the more complicated and emotionally charged West Bank. (As far as Israel is concerned, Jerusalem's status is not negotiable at all.)
Although offering few details, Israeli officials leave little doubt that their forces would be significantly pulled back from Gaza. The proposal has broad appeal among Israelis who want to get rid of the strip right away, seeing it as a violent anti-Israel maelstrom, strategically insignificant and economically burdensome.
Now, "Gaza first" proposals have turned into "Gaza and Jericho first."
For Mr. Arafat, mired in a P.L.O. leadership crisis but still president of the Palestinians' hoped-for state, Jericho would give him a West Bank stronghold and make clear that he will not settle only for Gaza. In return, he has said he is prepared for now to put aside claims to East Jerusalem and demands for an immediate Israeli pullout from the rest of the West Bank.
 
Arafat Would Move
 A senior adviser to Mr. Arafat, Nabil Shaath, said in Cairo today that the P.L.O. leader would move from his Tunis headquarters to Gaza or Jericho -- a prospect that would probably deepen Mr. Rabin's skepticism.
While officials here suggest that the Prime Minister has not slammed the door on the idea, they say he questions Palestinian seriousness and also fears that with Jericho, the Palestinians would have unacceptable control over bridge links to Jordan.
Many Palestinians in the territories also have qualms about the plan. It may give Mr. Arafat territory to preside over, they say, but they fear that Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank will stop at Jericho. And many of them, including Palestinian delegates to the talks, are not as ready as the P.L.O. to defer negotiations on Jerusalem.
Delegates warn that support for the talks has waned in the territories and that Mr. Arafat's leadership crisis does not help. Still, it seems certain that the P.L.O. and Arab states involved in the negotiations -- Syria, Jordan and Lebanon -- will show up in Washington.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Doctors to Be Offered Data on Patients Who Have Sued

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Philadelphia doctors will soon be offered a new service that may have been inevitable in a society in which both lawsuits and computers are commonplace: For $80 a month, they can find out whether a prospective patient has ever filed a malpractice suit against another doctor.
The service, Courtscan, is to begin direct-mail marketing to Philadelphia-area doctors next week, said William J. Benedict Jr., president of Courtscan Services in Greenwich, Conn. 
 Mr. Benedict said the service would be expanded to New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Miami within six months. He also said that he planned to offer a similar service to employers, landlords, insurers and others who may be leery of litigation.
Courtscan will offer doctors "litigation histories of patients in 60 seconds or less," Mr. Benedict said. The company's advertisements counsel doctors to "screen new patients you think might be 'malpractice-prone,' so you can adopt necessary defensive cautionary measures."
Litigation records have always been public, but until the advent of computers it was extremely cumbersome to search court records for a person's legal complaints. But now, Mr. Benedict said, his company has a data base of all 802,000 lawsuit and judgments filed with Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas since 1982.
While there is nothing illegal in compiling or selling such data, some doctors and consumer advocates worry that such a service might do more harm than good, smearing individuals who had filed claims in good faith and creating an increasingly hostile relationship between doctors and patients.
Indeed, the Pennsylvania Medical Society recently refused to run an advertisement for Courtscan in its monthly magazine. "We are concerned about anything that would possibly prejudice a physician against caring for a particular patient," said Dr. Donald Ferguson, the president of the society.
David Vladeck, the acting director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a Washington consumer advocacy group, said he was disturbed that singling out those who sue might discourage people from exercising their right to use the courts. Moreover, he said, he is worried that people who had filed several lawsuits might be denied medical care, housing or insurance.
"You can assume that once people purchase the information, they're going to use it as a screening device," Mr. Vladeck said. "I'm horrified by the notion that doctors might start screening patients on the basis of their litigation history."
Many doctors said the whole idea of trying to identify patients who had previously filed a malpractice suit was wrongheaded.
"This fosters an adversarial relationship," said Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a California internist who is chairman of the American Medical Association. "If you view every patient as a potential litigant, you're doomed before you start. I think most doctors realize that the only real protection against litigation is a good doctor-patient relationship."
The idea of helping doctors identify patients who have previously filed a suit is not new. In the mid-1980's, the Docket Search Network, a Chicago-based group, offered a similar service in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles, charging doctors a yearly fee of $150, plus $10 a search.
That effort, Physicians Alert, so irritated the trial lawyers in Los Angeles that they retaliated with a service allowing patients to call and find out their doctors' litigation record. Neither service lasted long.
 
'Wasn't Very Useful'
 "Doctors really weren't interested in whether their patients had sued other doctors," said a spokesman for the county medical association. "And the information you could get wasn't very useful: it told you every lawsuit they had filed, including personal injury cases and business disputes, and every thing else that had nothing to do with medical malpractice."
Mr. Benedict, who has spent the last six years working on information-service businesses, said he was not discouraged by the Physicians Alert experience.
"The economics were completely different," he said. "They operated on a mainframe, and it was largely a manual search. The cost of computer equipment and information storage has gone way down since then."
Furthermore, he said, he believed the demise of the earlier business was caused by management problems rather than lack of demand.
But Dr. Steven Sondheimer, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said he would be surprised if many of his colleagues bought the service.
"The right approach is to concentrate on providing good patient care, and that's what most doctors do," Dr. Sondheimer said. "I really find it upsetting that people would think litigation is such a big issue in doctors' minds."
 
Potential Clients
 Mr. Benedict said he was convinced that there was a large market for the service, although he said he had not yet signed up any clients.
"Our focus groups and our market research show a lot of interest," he said. "We all know that some people are more litigious than others, and if someone has sued six people already, the odds are much greater that he'll sue a seventh.
"We think landlords will be interested in knowing if prospective tenants were litigious, and employers will be interested in finding out about prospective employees, or employees they were thinking of terminating."
For now, though, doctors are the company's prime targets.
Mr. Benedict said he did not expect that doctors would necessarily treat patients with extensive litigation histories differently from others.
"Not in a million years is a doctor going to make a decision on how to treat a patient solely on this," Mr. Benedict said. "It's just one more piece of information. We're not making judgments for people. We're just providing information that is public."

HEADLINE: Honda's Star Gets Another Sequel

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Since January, when the Ford Taurus eclipsed the Honda Accord as the nation's best-selling car model, the auto industry has been waiting for Honda's counterpunch, the new Accord.
The first public demonstration of that model takes place Wednesday at a Honda assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Even rivals concede that the Accord has been the benchmark against which family sedans are measured, raising this question: Can the Accord do it again? 
 Honda says its goal is not to surpass the Taurus in sales but to bring out an improved vehicle that will win acclaim from buyers. The current Accord was initially criticized for unimaginative styling and was ignored by some buyers because it offered only a four-cylinder engine, while the Taurus, Toyota Camry and others offered six cylinders.
 
 
Engine Leader Tries Again
 Though the Accord will have an optional six-cylinder engine within a year, Honda is attempting to persuade buyers that its four-cylinder power plant is exemplary. It will underscore that assertion this year by offering, in some new four-cylinder Accords, a sophisticated fuel and exhaust-control technology called VTEC, which yields greater power while improving fuel economy. Those types of improvements have earned Honda a reputation as a leader in engine technology.
More significantly, though, the new Accord's reception by American car buyers may ultimately answer a larger question: whether expanding automobile production in the United States and buying more parts from American suppliers, as Honda has done, can resolve disparities in pricing and value caused by a strong Japanese currency.
The rise of the yen, to about 104 to the dollar, from 245 yen in 1985, has forced Japanese car makers to raise prices faster than their American rivals have had to. The Toyota Motor Corporation said this week that it may suffer its first operating loss ever in the current fiscal year if the yen stays strong.
Honda's profits are under pressure, too. But to a greater degree than other Japanese auto makers, Honda has built factories in the United States and sought to buy more parts from American suppliers, thereby holding down costs. The company saves money by buying parts with dollars rather than the more expensive yen.
 
 
Holding the Line on Prices
 The new Accord will have more American components than the first three Accord models produced in Marysville. Perhaps because the new model is less costly to build in terms of yen, Honda has been hinting that it will try to hold down price rises, after three increases in the last year. That could help narrow its price gap with American models. Compared with 1989, when a $15,905 Accord LX cost $910 less than a similarly equipped Chevrolet Lumina, the $18,780 Accord LX now costs $1,413 more than a similar Lumina.
"Honda wouldn't be specific, but their people implied that the price of the new Accord would be close to the current model," said Jerry Paul, automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, who attended a preview of the car two weeks ago with about a dozen Wall Street analysts.
Mr. Paul and several analysts who drove the Accord said they were quite impressed. They described a car that is a bit wider than the current model and is roomier and quieter. The interior has been redesigned and improved, they said, with refinements like those offered in Honda's Acura line of luxury cars.
"I was pleasantly surprised," said John Casesa, automotive analyst for Wertheim, Schroder & Company in New York. "The styling is very distinctive among Japanese entries, very muscular."
Analysts were also impressed by Honda's assertions that many of the Accord's parts were carried over from previous models or borrowed from other Hondas, thereby saving engineering costs. "Some people in Detroit may be surprised that Honda has managed, through intelligent design, to blunt much of the yen's appreciation," Mr. Paul said.
Joseph S. Phillippi, the auto industry analyst for Lehman Brothers, said, "It may be that because of carry-over parts and the fact that factories already have been built at low cost of capital, expected price increases on some models may not happen."
If Japanese car makers manage to hold down pricing, they will almost certainly face more hostility from Detroit; Big Three executives have been complaining that Japanese vehicle prices should be raised higher in conjunction with the yen's appreciation. In February, the Ford Motor Company spearheaded a campaign to file complaints charging that Japanese auto makers were selling cars at illegally low prices; the effort was called off at the last moment when the General Motors Corporation declined to join. The Government bars foreign manufacturers from selling products in this country for less than the manufacturing cost.
 
 
Technically Advanced Engine
 The Accord's price will attempt to recover the cost of, among other features, perhaps the most technically complex and sophisticated multivalve engine ever offered in a standard family sedan. Honda was among the first car makers to promote multivalve engines, which have three or more valves for each cylinder, rather than the conventional two. The innovation can increase power or fuel economy, depending on adjustments. The two intake valves control the intake of air that is mixed with fuel; the two exhaust valves control the release of exhaust fumes.
 Honda then introduced the first VTEC, which stands for variable valve timing and lift electronic control, in 1988 in the Acura NSX sports car and has offered subsequent VTEC engines in certain Prelude and Civic models.
By varying the timing and extent that valves open and close on engine cylinders, depending on how fast the engine is running, Honda's VTEC engines can achieve above-average power, torque and fuel economy from a relatively small four-cylinder engine.
So far, Honda will say only that the Accord's VTEC engine will improve fuel economy by about 10 percent, compared with last year's engine, and increase horsepower and torque by an unspecified amount.
"This engine works very nicely," said Csaba Csere, the editor of Car and Driver magazine and a former Ford engineer. "It isn't a quantum leap, but it's another little step, one more cut."

GRAPHIC: Photo: The new Honda Accord will have more American components than previous models, making the car less costly to build and helping to narrow the price gap with American competitors. The car is shown on a test track; auto makers often alter the appearance of test cars to disguise design features.

HEADLINE: China Calls American Sanctions Unjustifiable

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 26

 BODY:
China today branded as "entirely unjustifiable" the Clinton Administration's decision to impose economic sanctions over the sale of ballistic missile technology to Pakistan.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, asserted that "China has never acted in violation of the principles or parameters of the Missile Technology Control Regime" and added that the Chinese Government "will formally announce its response" to the American decision "very soon." 
 The decision announced in Washington on Wednesday to ban the sale of $1 billion in high-technology equipment for space and military programs at first did not draw any higher level response other than the statement from the Foreign Ministry spokesman.
Still, the sanctions decision together with the continuing American military surveillance of a Chinese freighter in the Persian Gulf believed to be carrying a cargo of chemical weapon ingredients destined for Iran, have increased tensions between Washington and Beijing at a time when China's leaders are preoccupied with internal matters, including an overheated economy and jitters over the health of Deng Xiaoping, the major leader, who is 89.
Evening news broadcasts in China reported on the American sanctions, but the Government's reaction was conveyed in remarks by the Chinese Embassy in Washington, restating China's longstanding contention that its sales to Pakistan do not violate international agreements intended to control the spread of ballistic missile technology.
Mr. Wu's remarks were somewhat understated compared with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's reaction to similiar accusations last month, which he termed "entirely without foundation" and "simply fabricated."
The Chinese statement today acknowledged that the United States was acting on intelligence reports, but asserted Washington had "reached erroneous conclusions based on its own faulty intelligence."
Pakistan's Ambassador in Washington, Ali Sarwar Naqvi, told The Associated Press that Pakistan had acquired missiles and was trying to convince the Clinton Administration that these acquisitions did not warrant the imposition of sanctions because they did not violate the missile agreement.
From the standpoint of China and Pakistan, the dispute is over the interpretation of the agreement, which bans the sale of missiles and associated technology with a range of more than 186 miles, and payload capacities of 500 kilograms, or 1,100 pounds.
The Chinese M-11 missile, whose technology China has been selling to Pakistan, according to a series of reports from American intelligence agencies, has a range of slightly less than 186 miles, but American officials argue that the missile and its technology should be covered for a number of reasons, including the fact that Pakistan can use M-11 technology to produce longer range missiles with payloads capable of delivering a nuclear, chemical or biological weapon.
American officials have not asserted that Pakistan is developing a capacity to put a nuclear warhead on a missile, which would be a categorically different development in the arms competition between Pakistan and India.
This week's action by Washington represents a diplomatic indictment of Beijing that will test the effectiveness of the missile control policy.

HEADLINE: Stocks Wind Up Mixed on Profit Taking

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed in moderately heavy trading yesterday, as profit taking in blue chips weakened the Dow Jones industrial average and a big decline in technology issues hurt Nasdaq trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.91 points, to 3,648.18. It was only the second time in the last eight trading sessions that the index failed to reach a new closing high. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, heavily influenced by technology stocks, dropped 2.27 points, to 731.39. Nine of the 10 most actively traded Nasdaq issues were technology stocks.
 
 
New Highs
 The only indexes that continued to set new closing highs -- barely -- were the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, up 0.91 point, to 461.04, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index, up 0.48 point, to 255.83.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 254.07 million shares, down from 301.6 million on Wednesday. Gaining issues outnumbered decliners by 1,029 to 914.
Although interest rates fell again yesterday -- something that had helped stock prices in recent days -- the effect was not evident.
"It is perhaps a mistake to assume the bond market can continue to push the stock market higher," Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for the Kemper Securities Inc., said. "There is a limit to how high the bond market can go. And it is possible that the bond market is testing its limits right now."
A drop in Novell, down 2 1/8, to 19 1/8, undermined the Nasdaq and touched off declines in other companies in the networking software business. Novell is considered the bellwether for this group because of its size.
 
 
Earnings Estimates
 Analysts slashed the company's earnings estimates after the release of a disappointing third-quarter profit report. Analysts said the computer software company was trying to make a transition from selling file and print servers to individual departments of corporations, to selling new network software to entire corporations.
Traders said the heavy selling in major data base companies was prompted in part by William H. Shattuck, a Montgomery Securities analyst who lowered his ratings on two of them. Sybase, which plunged by 6, to 60, and Oracle Systems, down 4 3/8, to 50 3/8, were both lowered to hold from buy.
Another factor that may have damped investor interest in the high-tech sector was the Clinton Administration's intention to ban United States exports of $1 billion in high-technology goods to China as a protest over arms sales to Pakistan.
In other market activity, Autoimmune declined 3/4, to 6. The biopharmaceutical company was told by Schering-Plough that it would not exercise an option to develop the company's arthritis products worldwide. In addition, the companies ended their collaboration on rheumatoid arthritis treatments.
 
 
Philip Morris Is Down
 Philip Morris fell 7/8, to 48. It was the volume leader on the Big Board at 6.3 million shares. The stock of the consumer products company continued to weaken amid disappointment that it did not raise its dividend.
British Petroleum rose 1 5/8, to 58 3/4, and was the second most heavily traded issue on volume of 4.5 million shares. The stock has benefited from dividend-related trading, and favorable oil market fundamentals. Also, British stocks have generally been attracting United States investors.
Texas Instruments fell 1 7/8, to 80 3/8, after announcing that it would redeem 3.7 million of its $2.26 depository shares not previously called.

HEADLINE: Boris G. Moishezon, Columbia Professor Of Math, Dies at 55

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Boris G. Moishezon, a mathematics professor at Columbia University who defected from the Soviet Union in 1972 and came to the United States five years later, died Wednesday. He was 55 and lived in Leonia, N.J.
Dr. Moishezon had a heart attack while jogging and was pronounced dead in Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J., said his wife, Natalia. 
 Dr. Moishezon was among the foremost experts in algebraic geometry. He began his career 30 years ago in Moscow, tutored by the Soviet mathematician Igor Shafarevich at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. But he made his international reputation at Tel Aviv University and at Columbia.
Born in Odessa, Ukraine, he received a doctorate in physical and mathematical sciences from Moscow State University and became a senior scientist at the Central Institute of Mathematical Economics in Moscow.
 
Emigre Driven by Frustration
 Dr. Moishezon belonged to a growing contingent of young intellectuals who felt their Jewishness barred them from the top echelons, especially in mathematics and physics. He and nine peers signed a public statement in 1972 decrying the high fees for exit visas imposed on holders of doctoral degrees. The fees, as much as $25,000, were intended by the Soviet Government as repayment for the emigres' education.
By then the 10 were in the midst of the complicated process of seeking passage to Israel during the Soviet drain brain of the 1970's. Dr. Moishezon got his exit visa in 1972 and took the post of professor of mathematics at Tel Aviv University. He came to the United States as a visiting professor at the University of Utah in 1977, the year he was appointed a professor of mathematics at Columbia.
Besides his wife, Dr. Moishezon leaves a daughter, Hanna, of Tel Aviv; a son, Tsvi, of Leonia; and a half-brother, Friedrich, of Yalta, Ukraine.

HEADLINE: Key Jobs Report Is Positive

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Fresh signs of an improving employment market emerged today as the Labor Department released weekly jobless figures that showed substantial improvement in a key employment measure.
Although the department said that the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits for the first time rose 8,000, to 332,000, in the last week, the running four-week average, a less volatile gauge, dropped to nearly a four-year low. This average fell 4.5 percent, to 331,500 claims, for the four weeks that ended Saturday. That was down from 347,250 as recorded the preceding week, pointing to a strengthening job market, experts said. 
 "We're running at levels consistent with recovery," said James Glassman, money market economist at Chemical Securities.
The overall unemployment claims for the week compared with a revised count of 324,000 for the previous week and exceeded expectations by private economists, who had forecast a total of 329,000 claims.
In another positive sign, the number of people staying on jobless rolls for state benefits declined for the third week. The Labor Department said 2.78 million people filed for continued benefits in the week that ended on Aug. 14, the latest period for which that data is available, down 33,000 from the previous week.
Despite improvement in the jobless picture, however, economists said the monthly employment report for August -- due out next week -- would show relatively subdued payroll growth. "It's not going to be gangbusters," said Anthony Chan, senior economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities.

HEADLINE: Up From the Computer Underground

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The bustling Interop computer-network trade show, running here through Friday, was once the sole province of hackers in jeans interested in fashioning ways to make the gear of different manufacturers work together.
But in recent years, marketing vice presidents in suits have become a reliable staple, demonstrating how the Internet -- a global collection of computer networks on which the show is based -- has transcended the techie underground to become one of the world's largest computer exhibitions. 
 Like the personal computer industry, which left its hobbyist roots for venture capital and corporate board rooms a decade ago, the nerdy world of computer networks has finally arrived on Main Street.
The first Interop Workshop, attended by 300 people in 1986, was run almost entirely by volunteers, many with ponytails, who rolled out the cables and programmed the specialized computers that are the backbone for modern data networks.
 
Doubling in Size
 But the exhibition has doubled in size each year since that first gathering. This year, it attracted 65,000 people, few of them with long hair. The show, now a remarkably successful commercial venture, is a forest of green and yellow cables dangling from the high ceilings, linking more than 6,000 computers on the floor.
"Interop is the plumbing exhibition for the information age," said Tom Hargadon, an industry analyst at the Inside Report on New Media in Redwood City, Calif.
Next year the exhibition will have grown too large for San Francisco and will move to Las Vegas, Nev., the site of the nation's largest trade shows.
Interop has exploded, driven by the once-radical notion of its founder, Daniel C. Lynch, that all the industry's data networking gear should communicate. By breaking down the walls between proprietary vendors and forcing them to adhere to a single industry standard known as TCP/IP -- the common language spoken by all computers connected to the Internet -- Mr. Lynch, 52, has helped pave the way for the commercial Internet. An arcane specialty when he started, Internet is now sweeping through new markets ranging from the telephone to cable television.
The service providers and hardware manufacturers that have created Internet make up a $2 billion business, Mr. Lynch said. The Internet itself, which has approximately 15 million users and 1,776,000 computers in 137 countries, has become a powerful political and economic force.
Mr. Lynch sold Interop for an undisclosed sum two years ago to Ziff-Davis Communications the nation's largest publisher of computer magazines, which will merge it with a rival show, Network World, next year. But Mr. Lynch still manages the show as founder and chairman.
When Mr. Lynch founded the show, he was an unemployed computer network engineer. In the 1970's, he managed the computer network connections for SRI International Inc., a Government-oriented research center in Menlo Park, Calif. SRI was one of the original sites for the pioneering ARPAnet, the forerunner of today's global Internet.
On his first day at SRI, Mr. Lynch said, he caught a glimpse of the potential of computer networks, a vision of a national data highway that has since captured the attention of millions of Americans, including President Clinton.
"It gave me a chill," Mr. Lynch said. "I saw computer networks as something that could make society dramatically different."
But in the 1970's and 1980's, networking was expensive and a specialty accessible to only a few computer hackers dedicated to managing the networks.
When Mr. Lynch found himself without a job in the mid-1980's, he struck on the idea of an exhibition as a way to assemble all the data networking companies in one location so that he could look for a job as a marketing vice president.
By the final day of the first conference, he was visibly worried because no one had offered him a job. Then, at one session, he said, someone stood up and said, "We know what you're trying to do, but what you should do is run this conference for the whole industry." Everyone in the room cheered. Mr. Lynch agreed, starting the annual conference with a Mastercard, a Visa and a loan of $50,000.
 "He's a wild man," said Geoff Goodfellow, chairman of the Radio Mail Corporation, a San Mateo, Calif., company that offers a wireless electronic mail service. "He's like a maypole around which all the companies weave their spider web networks."
At this year's Interop, the big news involved some of the nation's largest high-tech companies. The Sprint Corporation, for example, announced that it would begin offering a new high-speed data protocol designed to provide support for future multimedia applications.
In control rooms cluttered with dozens of computer terminals and work stations above the show's floor today, Mr. Lynch acknowledged that Interop had changed dramatically in seven years.
"It's true," he said, as he watched the volunteer engineers maintaining the network he created. "This is the only place at the show where you find people in T-shirts anymore."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Shift in the Psychology of Inflation

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Interest rates continued to plunge yesterday, sending a strong signal that the stubborn inflation expectations of millions of Americans are falling with them.
Expectations that higher prices are lurking around the corner -- a hard lesson of the double-digit inflation era -- have been difficult to shake, despite the fact that inflation has averaged 3.8 percent the last 10 years and could wind up below 3 percent for both 1992 and 1993. 
 But with the yield on the 30-year bond at 6.09 percent yesterday, down from 6.17 percent on Wednesday and off more than a half of a percentage point in just four weeks, attitudes seem to be changing.
 
A Driving Force
 "The most obvious and plausible explanation is that the bond market is telling us that inflation expectations have come down and are still coming down," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence.
Inflation is a driving force in the fixed-income market because price increases erode the returns for investors. So even a sniff of higher prices can send prices falling and yields rising. Prices and yields move in the opposite direction.
The change in inflation expectations is a theme that Mr. Yardeni has been pressing, even earlier this year when the monthly jumps in the Consumer Price Index seemed to indicate that prices might rise more than 3 percent this year.
But data for the last two to three months have painted a different picture, and the Consumer Price Index is now rising at an annual rate through July of just 2.8 percent, a notch below the 2.9 percent pace for all of 1993.
"The economic environment for the past couple of years is not just a transition period" to higher inflation, Mr. Yardeni said. "It is the way things will be for a while."
For the bond market, if Mr. Yardeni is right, there would still be room for interest rates to move lower. With a traditional calculation that real interest rates -- rates adjusted for inflation -- are 3 percent, a 6 percent yield on the 30-year bond is within sight. And given the unexpectedly sluggish growth of the economy right now, the rate of inflation could move toward 2.5 percent, as Mr. Yardeni is is now forecasting, and pull long-term rates toward 5.75 percent and below.
 
Looking at 1994
 Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities, was predicting that inflation would rise this year above last year's rate and that would keep Treasury yields well above where they are now. But he has adjusted his outlook.
"There is just nothing to stop it," Mr. Fine said. "Obviously, the bond is going to 6 percent."
On inflation, he said, the important calculation now for expectations is not what will happen this year but what will happen in 1994. "Given the pace of the economy and all the uncertainties around the Clinton Administration and the impact of its programs, like health care, the market is telling you that inflation won't be higher in '94 than '93," Mr. Fine said.
The other force at work in the Treasury market yesterday was portfolio managers and investors taking cash on hand and putting it to work. Some were seeking higher yields than they were getting on short-term investments. Others were hurriedly investing the money that they got back as other investments, like mortgage-backed securities, were paid off early because of home mortgage refinancing sparked by the fall in interest rates.
And there may have been a little extra pop yesterday because the big Treasury auctions of August ended with the five-year note sale on Wednesday and no major new auctions are in sight for another month.
"When you get all that cash coming into the market with relatively light supply, it kind of feeds on itself," said Gregory Erardi, the head of government securities trading at Salomon Brothers.
This buying, and the confidence about inflation, pushed up prices across the board. So short-term interest rates are now at or near their lows for the year. The five-year note, with a yield of 4.78 percent, is at the lowest level in about 25 years.
 
Moves by Brazil
 Another factor that appears to have contributed to higher bond prices yesterday was the rumor that Brazil was buying Treasury bonds for use in the complex debt-reduction deal it has reached with its commercial bankers.
There was also a sharp jump in the price of the 30-year bond futures contract, which often can lead the cash market higher. But much of the buying, which pushed the price up a point, may have been set off by a technical market twist that is forcing investors who sold the bond futures for hedging reasons to buy them back at much higher prices.
In trading in the secondary market, the 6.25 percent 30-year bond due in August 2023 was up a full point, to 1025/32 . The yield on 6.09 percent issue is the lowest since Treasury securities with 30 years to maturity were yielding an average of 5.82 percent in January 1973, according to Salomon Brothers. The Treasury has only regularly sold 30-year bonds since May 1977 and no yield on those bonds has even been this low.
The price of the 5.75 percent 10-year note jumped 18/32 as its yield fell to 5.41 percent, from 5.49 percent the day before and a half percentage point below the July 23 level. The yield is now at its lowest level since 1968.

HEADLINE: Buchanan Joins the Foes Of Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The tangled politics of the North American Free Trade Agreement became enmeshed in Republican Party politics today, as a former conservative Presidential aspirant, Patrick J. Buchanan, denounced two fellow Republicans who support the agreement and who are seen as front-runners for the party's 1996 Presidential nomination.
Mr. Buchanan, a hard-line rightist, offered an unexpectedly strong challenge to President George Bush last year. Today, he announced that he would form a group to distribute essays and other criticism of the pact. 
 At a news conference this morning, Mr. Buchanan assailed the recently completed labor and environmental side agreements, condemning them as infringements on American sovereignty and unnecessary foreign aid for the Mexican Government.
While criticism of the free-trade agreement by labor and environmental groups has attracted more public attention, conservative criticism worries the Clinton Administration, too, because it is counting on overwhelming Republican support to win Congressional approval of the deal. Among the Democratic majorities in the Senate and especially in the House, there is substantial opposition to approval of the treaty.
 
Buchanan Sees Illicit Alliance
 Mr. Buchanan accused the two other Republicans, Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, of betraying conservative ideals by siding with Mr. Clinton in supporting the trade agreement.
The accord, if approved by majorities in both houses of Congress, would gradually eliminate import tariffs and other barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. The side agreements would create three-nation secretariats in an effort to make sure that each country enforced its labor and environmental laws. Mr. Buchanan condemned these bodies as an unwarranted intrusion on American liberty.
The United States and Mexico also tentatively agreed this month to spend at least $6 billion to clean up their heavily polluted border region, a plan Mr. Buchanan denounced as an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer.
The money would be raised by issuing Government-guaranteed bonds. In addition, the World Bank is considering several billion dollars in loans to Mexico for environmental cleanup near the border, where hundreds of factories have been built and operate with little enforcement of environmental regulations.
"Why should the American people be responsible for cleaning up the pigpen that the Mexicans have made on their side of our common border?" Mr. Buchanan asked.
His influence on Capitol Hill is unclear. Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, a conservative whose district includes the border area with Mexico, issued a statement at Mr. Buchanan's press briefing echoing the concerns about national sovereignty.
But several influential moderate Republicans, including Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, who had some of the same concerns, offered support for the pact after the side agreements were completed Aug. 13.
Mr. Buchanan's comments underlined the extraordinary political diversity of the accord's opponents. The consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., find themselves on the same side as Ross Perot and a group of libertarian commentators who accompanied Mr. Buchanan today.
Mr. Kemp, Mr. Dole and Mr. Buchanan have all been mentioned as possible candidates in 1996. But while Mr. Buchanan assailed Mr. Kemp in particular several times today, he insisted that he was addressing a national issue rather than maneuvering for personal political advantage.
"It's all going to be decided years before 1996 arrives," he said.
In a joint statement on Monday with other Republicans, Mr. Kemp said the trade agreement would create millions of jobs for American workers and increase American exports. Mr. Kemp is on vacation in California, and his aides said he could not be reached for comment today.
Mr. Buchanan, echoing some Perot concerns, warned, "I think the Republican Party is letting Ross Perot walk off not only with our constituency, but with a variety of our issues."

HEADLINE: 12 School Districts Selected for Work Programs

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Seeking to address concerns that public schools fail to prepare students for the workplace, the New York State Education Department announced today that it has chosen 12 school districts, including 4 in New York City, to develop pilot programs that make work a part of classroom study.
In announcing grants for the pilot program, state officials said they were motivated by growing evidence that high-paying careers were available only to college graduates while most high school students were qualified only for low-paying, low-skilled jobs. 
 "Years ago our education system was well suited for the low-skill, mass-production economy of the industrial age," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in announcing the grants. "But in today's highly competitive, global marketplace, we not only have to change the way we do business, we have to change the way we teach our kids to meet the economic challenges facing this state and the nation."
 
Scaled-Down Version
 The pilot programs represent a scaled-down version of an ambitious plan rejected earlier this year by the State Board of Regents that would have required all high school students to work before graduating.
That proposal had been developed by a commission led by Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine and was strongly endorsed by Mr. Cuomo, the State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, and business groups.
The Regents rejected the broad proposal largely because they thought many schools would be unable to find meaningful jobs for students. But they left the door open by approving pilot programs to study the idea.
The 12 pilot programs are to receive grants of between $25,000 and $100,000 to develop or expand programs that teach about careers, provide training in workplace skills and require many students to work as part of their classwork.
The four New York City schools that received grants are Intermediate School 218 in Community School District 6 in Washington Heights in Manhattan; Public School 115 and Intermediate School 68 in Canarsie, Brooklyn; the City-as-School High School in Manhattan, and eight schools in Community School District 9 in Highbridge in the Bronx.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slips as Bundesbank Fails to Lower Interest Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark and other currencies yesterday after the German central bank defied market expectations and kept its key interest rate unchanged.
The dollar dropped to 1.6675 marks in New York trading, from 1.6843 marks a day earlier. 
 Leaders of the Bundesbank decided yesterday to maintain its discount rate at 6.75 percent. "The Bundesbank came back from vacation and cracked the whip," said David De Rosa, a foreign-exchange director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
 
Propped by Corporate Buying
 Higher interest rates lift a currency since investments in that currency earn more. Germany has maintained high interest rates to rein inflation.
Belal Khan, a senior dealer at Bank of Tokyo in New York, said the dollar would have fallen further except that American corporations active in Germany sold marks. "They are really doubting the strength of the German economy" and expect the currency to weaken in the future, he said.
The dollar retreated against other European currencies because of its weakness against the mark and concern about the American gross domestic product figures coming out next week, traders said.
The British pound was particularly strong, following a rumor that an index of business expectations due out Friday would be more positive than expected, traders said. In addition, there were rumors that a large foreign investor was selling gold for pounds, traders said. In New York, the pound traded at $1.5090, up from $1.4819 late Wednesday.
 
Dollar at 104.40 Yen in New York
 The dollar also slid against the Japanese yen, ending at 104.40 yen in New York, down from 105.05 yen on Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 105.15 yen, up 0.60 yen from late Wednesday.
Mr. Khan said that while the official Bank of Japan was supporting the dollar in Asian trading, no central bank was actively buying it during the later New York session. Investors therefore pushed it down, testing how far it could go before the Federal Reserve would intervene.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.4719 Swiss francs, down from 1.4815; 5.8345 French francs, down from 5.8475; 1,590.00 Italian lire, down from 1,599.50, and 1.3158 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3115.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Reaches 2-Month Low On News of Eased Demand

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Gold prices were pounded in a heavy selloff by speculators yesterday and fell to two-month lows amid reports that demand is slackening.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery in October, the active near-term futures contract, dropped $4.70 an ounce, to $369. Gold for December, the most actively traded contract, also lost $4.70, settling at $370.80 after hitting a low of $367 around midday as speculative funds began to sell steadily. 
 Traders said the selloff followed a report by Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd., an industry consultant, that in the first half demand by jewelers and other gold users had dropped 5 percent from a year earlier.
Adding pressure was the recent surge in stocks and bonds, which have become more attractive than precious metals as concerns about inflation have abated.
Since soaring to a high of about $414 an ounce on Aug. 2, gold prices have fallen more than 10 percent.
Trading has been very choppy recently as more traders become suspicious that the soaring gold demand for jewelry out of East Asia, which helped feed gold's surge earlier in the year, was running out of steam.
But while some analysts said the recession in Europe and other factors were weighing on demand for jewelry, others saw flat or slightly better demand.
"There's still a good base level of China-related buying," said Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisers, adding that there are signs that excess inventories in Hong Kong are being worked off.
 
Pork Contracts Advance
 On other commodities markets, pork bellies closed up their 2-cent limit after the Government announced late on Wednesday that it would buy $19 million worth of pork carcasses in the fall for donation to Russia.
Pork bellies closed up the daily limit in the February-through-May contracts, with February settling on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange at 50.775 cents a pound. October live hogs rose 1.05 cents, to 47.025 cents a pound.
Also on the Chicago Merc, lumber futures jumped the daily limit for the third straight day, as commercial users continued to replenish stocks, providing support to futures. Lumber for September delivery closed $10 higher for a thousand board feet, to $291.30. Today daily limits will be expanded to $15 for a thousand board feet.

HEADLINE: Community Reinvestment Is Right and It Pays

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Fresh Money for Poor Communities" (editorial, Aug. 13) promotes several harmful myths about community reinvestment lending.
First, low-income borrowers are not necessarily "credit-risky." Available data from private mortgage insurance companies suggest that low-income homeowners are far less likely to default on mortgages than high-income borrowers, in part because low-income borrowers view homeownership as shelter, rather than investment. And, after a decade of record losses on speculative investments in commercial real estate, we have yet to see a bank or savings and loan institution go belly up because of too much lending to poor people. 
 Second, notwithstanding a dangerous campaign for "regulatory relief" by the banking industry, the Community Reinvestment Act is not a source of massive paperwork burdens for banks. The act has only three minor technical requirements, and the policy of bank regulatory agencies is that lenders need not keep any special documentation for the act's purposes. A 1991 Office of Management and Budget survey found the act to be the least burdensome consumer protection law on the books.
Finally, the act is not the utter failure you portray. Nearly $35 billion has been lent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods as a result of the act. Many lenders, working with the very community development organizations you praise, have developed precisely the expertise in community lending whose lack you bemoan. And the best Community Reinvestment Act performers have found that community reinvestment lending is not just good social policy, but good business as well.
Clearly, the act has not met its potential to revitalize neighborhoods. But the real problem is a scandalous record of enforcement by the four Federal banking agencies under 12 years of hostile administrations. Nearly 90 percent of lenders get "satisfactory" grades, and less than a dozen merger applications have ever been denied because of this law, despite abundant evidence of redlining.
As Senator William Proxmire, the author of the act, observed several years ago: "Regulators seem to think that we're all living in Lake Wobegone. Like the children of the fictional village, United States lenders are all above average. Almost all get high ratings year after year, and almost none is ever held back. . . . And I ask myself, how is it that so many neighborhoods are continuing to fail, while so many lending institutions are continuing to pass?" Perhaps the Administration's review of the act will reverse this outrageous record.
Your suggestion that banks be allowed to "buy out" of the act through contributions to community development banks is seriously wrongheaded and smacks of the creation of a "separate and unequal" banking system, one for minorities and the poor, and another for everyone else. Turning the tide of despair in low-income neighborhoods requires more than token charitable contributions from the banking industry. We need mainstream lenders to view community reinvestment as a business proposition and to put the ingenuity of the market to work there.
The Federal Government confers on lenders a host of advantages -- public charters, taxpayer-backed deposit insurance at a discounted price and access to the discount window at the Fed. After having spent hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out these lenders, we have learned that all this public largess is not without fiscal consequence. Surely, the least we can expect in return is a banking system that fairly serves the needs of all Americans.

HEADLINE: Nor Will Trade Pact Aid Mexicans Much

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"The Trade Pact Is Our Best Deal" (Op-Ed, Aug. 17) by Carla A. Hills makes highly questionable assertions in support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ms. Hills says that we sold almost $41 billion in goods to Mexico last year and that per capita purchases from the United States amounted to $477 in 1992.
She must know that Mexican trade data, more detailed than our own, paint a totally different picture. Their data show United States exports to the Mexican consumer market constituted less than 20 percent of the total reported exports. 
 Of the $40.6 billion in reported United States exports to Mexico in 1992, according to Mexican data, $14.1 billion were shipped to the "maquiladora" programs of United States plants on Mexican soil, employing Mexican labor at Mexican wages. Details are lacking for the share that went to free trade zones, which perform the same assembly and processing functions as the "maquiladores." More complete Mexican 1990 data show these two account for more than 50 percent of reported United States exports to Mexico. None of the products they produce are allowed to enter Mexico's consumer market.
Mexico also reports that 35 percent of 1992 United States reported exports to Mexico were capital goods. The overwhelming share of these went to United States plants, which assemble United States-made parts. The finished product is re-exported to the United States. Thus, more than 80 percent of reported exports to Mexico represented United States companies trading with themselves.
Mexican trade data for 1992 show that less than $9 billion in United States exports entered the Mexican consumer market. Dividing that figure by 90 million Mexicans shows per capita Mexican imports of consumer goods of less than $90, not Ms. Hills's $477.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Dinkins: Attempting to Build Bridges

 BODY:

ON THE SCREEN. Images of Mayor Dinkins being sworn in, working at a desk, meeting in a conference room, talking to campaign volunteers dressed as police officers on a stoop. Then pictures of children being examined in a clinic, playing baseball, pulling a library book off the shelf. Near the end, Mr. Dinkins is seen leaning forward over a chair, his fists clenched intently, and walking down the street with black, white and Asian campaign volunteers. In final image, he cuddles a baby and flashes a broad smile as a facsimile of his signature appears on the screen with the words "One city. One future."
PRODUCER. Doak, Shrum, Harris, Carrier, Devine Of Washington. 
 THE SCRIPT. Narrator's voice: Along with the oath of office, they gave him a massive deficit, a hostile administration in Washington, and a city at the boiling point. He's balanced four budgets, cut waste, and in a recession, saved jobs by persuading companies like CBS and Prudential to stay in New York City. His community policing has put three thousand more police on the beat - more than at any time in two generations. The New York Times said: "As the plan took hold, crime reports began to fall in . . . nearly all categories."
Strapped by the Reagan-Bush budget cuts, he's launched innovative programs like Communicare -- health centers in 13 neighborhoods. Beacon schools, open at night, to keep kids off the streets and provide counseling and job training for their parents. "Fields of Dreams" -- vacant lots turned into 40 ballfields across the city. Public libraries will soon be open six days a week, for the first time in almost half a century. He's told us the hard truth when our city couldn't afford all we wanted. And in dangerous moments, walked the streets and worked his heart out to hold us together. Mayor David Dinkins. It takes more than tough talk to run a tough city.
ACCURACY. Mr. Dinkins has granted tax breaks and other considerations to keep several big companies in New York, although CBS acknowledged that it had never actually threatened to leave. The Mayor has kept the budget balanced as required by law but state fiscal monitors have repeatedly criticized him for not making deeper cuts to bring spending in line with available revenues. Crime has declined but any correlation between that and more police officers is speculative.
SCORECARD. This ad is full of glossy production values, elaborate graphics, and throbbing music of synthesized strings and bells. It begins with an elliptical swipe at the world, saying "They gave him a massive deficit," and other problems. But who are they? The Koch administration? New Yorkers? Republicans? Whites? People in general? Different listeners will undoubtedly hear that line in different ways. The Mayor's strongest supporters may well agree, and Mr. Dinkins inherited many problems. But since the point of the ad is to list Mr. Dinkins's accomplishments in the face of very tough budget times, this line risks painting him as a bit of a victim, before he even gives his own vigorous defense. By ending with images of Mr. Dinkins walking the streets with an interracial group, it seeks to take advantage of his reputation as a healer, which was a key to his victory last time. The tag lines are both implicit attacks on Rudolph W. Giuliani, suggesting that the Mayor's rival indulges in tough talk and could not lead a united city toward the future.

HEADLINE: Good Will and Its Limits in Somalia

BYLINE: By Michael Maren; Michael Maren, a New York writer, just returned from a three-week trip to Somalia.

 BODY:
Four hundred U.S. Army Rangers arrived in Somalia yesterday, bolstering the 25,000 U.N. troops already there as part of a peacemaking effort that will cost more than $1.5 billion this year. At the same time, the U.N. and private development groups are scaling back handouts of free food, replacing them with food-for-work projects that will in turn be replaced with cash-for-work projects.
On the surface, this seems very positive: The food emergency is over. The harvest, largely sorghum but also other produce, looks good. Charity is being phased out. 
 Yet these well-meaning policies will only help to re-create the situation that led to the food shortage in Somalia in the first place. The food that Somali workers will be receiving from agencies like CARE and the Red Cross will be imported wheat, rice and other commodities. And when workers are paid, the funds will have been raised by selling donated food on the open market.
The U.N. euphemistically calls this process "monetization." Whatever it is called it will have the effect of undermining agriculture, hobbling commercial distribution networks and keeping the country dependent on imported food. CARE alone has sold $5 million worth of wheat flour on the Somali market.
A CARE spokesman in Mogadishu told me that wheat is not grown in the country and therefore does not compete directly with the crops grown by Somali farmers. But someone whose belly is full of wheat flour is not likely to spend money on local sorghum. The spokesman conceded that CARE would do better to use cash to pay Somali workers, but he said it's much easier to get donations of food than cash. Food is plentiful and in surplus around the world. Cash is tight. As he was explaining this, U.S. Blackhawk helicopters thundered overhead. The price of one flight: about $2,000.
In 1980, I began one of the earliest food-for-work projects in East Africa. After a year it was obvious the project didn't work. Because the food is free to the donors, its value is debased. Such projects tend to be make-work excuses for giving away food. This seems to be the case in Mogadishu today where food-for-work consists of giving people empty garbage bags and then trading a bag of food for a bag of trash. Much of Mogadishu has been reduced to rubble, but it's fairly clean -- Somalis don't waste much. The project is likely to turn into a scavenger hunt with people looting garbage trucks as they once looted food convoys.
Donors putting up their own cash would probably put more effort into designing projects. They might tend to see their projects as investments, and create enterprises that would produce real income and eventually become self-sustaining -- saving money in the long run. And once the workers themselves see that the projects produce income, they would have a stake in continuing them, even after the donors leave.
CARE now has 5,200 Somalis receiving food and involved in public works projects. None of the projects will lead to full-time employment or become self-sufficient, and none will survive if new fighting cuts off food supplies and forces aid workers out of the country again. Africa is littered with the ruins of such projects. Somalis are paid to do them but have no personal stake in them.
Unfortunately, relief groups are more adept at delivering charity than they are in building institutions. Groups looking for a model of successful development in Mogadishu might take a closer look at the port where they go to collect food from the ships. Eddie Johns, a former chief warrant officer in the U.S. Army and now employed by the U.N., is trying to run the port solely from fees paid by shippers. Mr. Johns employs 450 Somali workers, paying them in cash. His goals are modest: to hand over a self-sustaining enterprise to a Somali government -- someday.
Unfortunately, commercial development in the rest of the country is being crippled by the continued dumping of surplus commodities, adding economic destabilization to the political crisis. And while the U.N. is raising billions for its military operations, it is investing nothing in building Somalia's economy.

HEADLINE: Security for All of Europe, In Seven Tricky Steps

SERIES: STRATEGIC ALLIANCES: First of three articles

BYLINE: By Ronald D. Asmus, Richard L. Kugler and F. Stephen Larrabee; Ronald D. Asmus, Richard L. Kugler and F. Stephen Larrabee are senior analysts at the Rand Corporation. This article is excerpted from an essay in the September-October issue of Foreign Affairs.

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif.

 BODY:
Whether Europe unravels for a third time this century depends on whether the West summons the political will and strategic vision to address the causes of potential instability and conflict before it is too late. A new U.S.-European strategic bargain is needed, one that extends NATO's collective defense and security arrangements to those areas where the seeds for future conflict in Europe lie: the Atlantic alliance's eastern and southern borders.
The end of the cold war wiped away the strategic distinction between Europe's center and periphery. Whereas the potential locus of conflict in Europe in the cold war was along the old inner-German border, Europe's new strategic challenges exist almost exclusively along two arcs of crisis: the eastern arc, the zone of instability running between Germany and Russia from northern Europe down through Turkey, the Caucasus and middle Asia; and the southern arc, running through northern Africa and the Mediterranean into the Middle East and Southwest Asia. 
 While these circumstances are seemingly located safely on Europe's periphery, for a number of reasons conflicts along either arc are in fact central to European security.
First, conflicts in the arcs are increasingly generated by antidemocratic and anti-Western ideologies that threaten the liberal-democratic foundations of Western Europe and the nascent democracies of the former Soviet bloc.
Second, conflict and insecurity in the twin arcs are unlikely to be neatly isolated or contained. Spillover, in the form of political and economic instability and refugees, is a real danger.
Third, while local conflicts may escalate into regional wars, instability in such geopolitically sensitive areas also threatens to draw in one or several major powers who see their own interests threatened.
Finally, and perhaps most important, instability along the arcs threatens to reactivate old fault lines and dormant historical rivalries -- geopolitical competition between Germany and Russia along the eastern arc, or a conflict between the West and Islam in the south.
Western policy makers have been slow to recognize these new dangers and the security needs of these states. Many still cling to cold war distinctions between Western Europe, which is implicitly defined as a vital interest, and Eastern Europe, which is seen as a secondary or peripheral concern. East-Central Europe's lack of a stable security arrangement has already helped to undercut progress toward democracy and economic reform. Now the spread of instability or violent conflict threatens to destroy even that progress achieved thus far.
East-Central Europe's democrats well understand that democracy will succeed only if their states belong to a secure European and Western political, economic and military community. The West, too, previously understood this link -- as demonstrated with the case of West Germany. That nation might never have become a stable Western democracy had it not been accepted into NATO's fold. Similarly, NATO membership helped stabilize democracy and stem authoritarian backsliding in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey.
The obvious tool for this new Western strategy is NATO. The Persian Gulf war and the Yugoslav crisis have shown the European Community incapable of taking on such a task. The remark of Foreign Minister Mark Eysken of Belgium during the gulf crisis -- that the European Community was an economic giant, political dwarf and military worm -- sadly remains true.
The kind of NATO that could respond to Europe's new strategic challenges would bear little resemblance to the NATO of the cold war. It would be based on a new bargain between the United States and Europe, a different set of political and military understandings, as well as a new relationship with the East. This bargain would simultaneously expand the alliance's strategic horizon geographically and find new ways to share responsibilities and burdens. NATO's rationale and mission would be defined anew.
Politically, six steps are necessary to forge a new trans-Atlantic bargain. The first and in many ways most important step is to transform NATO from an alliance based on collective defense against a specific threat into an alliance committed to projecting democracy, stability and crisis management in a broader strategic sense.
The second step must be a new understanding between the U.S. and its European allies that harmonizes the interests of both sides. Europeanization of the alliance is as much in the interests of the U.S. as it is of Europeans. Washington must be willing to accept a stronger European identity, including in security affairs, and relinquish its residual ambivalence toward European integration.
For its part, Europe -- which in this case means France -- must abandon its exaggerated fear of American hegemony. The real issue regarding the future United States role in Europe is not whether Washington will be hegemonic, but whether the trans-Atlantic relationship can be turned into a partnership that fully engages the U.S.
Without French backing to transform NATO, the alliance will crumble. France would then find itself forced to go it alone in a Europe characterized by increasing instability along both its eastern and southern flanks, with an independent Germany and an aloof America.
Franco-American rapprochement can set the stage for the third step -- Germany's strategic emancipation. Germany must finally resolve the confused debate over its role in Europe and beyond. To be sure, residual fears concerning German power still exist. But only a strong Germany can facilitate European integration and NATO's strategic transformation.
While Germany remains preoccupied with the staggering challenge of the political and economic reconstruction of its eastern half, the need to stabilize its eastern flank is Bonn's number one security concern.
Reorganizing the West will set the stage for the fourth step in this process -- a coherent and coordinated Western strategy for the integration of Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and possibly Slovakia) into both the European Community and NATO. Opening the E.C. to the East is the best guarantee against a rival of anti-Western nationalism and of stabilizing the process of political and economic reform.
NATO should create the preconditions for the eventual integration of these countries into the alliance by expanding defense cooperation. Such cooperation need not initially imply a full-fledged defense commitment. Conceivably, "association agreements" could spell out the criteria for membership, but not provide explicit security guarantees. This arrangement would give the countries of Central and Eastern Europe the clear perspective they are looking for. It would also provide them time to adapt their military and defense establishments to meet NATO standards.
The fifth step in the new trans-Atlantic bargain concerns Russia. The West has been reluctant to move toward the East more quickly for fear of offending Russia's strategic sensibilities. But it is hard to understand how supporting democracy and stability in Eastern Europe can undercut democracy in Russia.
As it transforms and expands relations with Central and Eastern Europe, the West should also expand and deepen its security dialogue with Russia. Whether NATO's eastward extension becomes a new offer for partnership or a move toward an anti-Russian alliance rests almost entirely on the outcome of Russia's own internal transformation. This process is likely to take years. To hold the future of NATO hostage to the outcome of Russian politics is a recipe for the demise of the alliance.
The sixth step in the new trans-Atlantic bargain requires the West to develop a constructive Ukrainian policy. An independent Ukraine is one of the most important features of Europe's new strategic landscape; it acts as an important strategic buffer between Europe and Russia.
In light of the uncertainties surrounding Russian democracy, it represents the best guarantee against Russian imperial restoration from the point of view of Eastern Europe, especially Poland. The reincorporation of Ukraine into a Russian-led confederation would transform the geostrategic equation in Europe as a whole.
As a final, seventh step, extended collective defense and security means that the alliance must be reorganized militarily. NATO's basic problem is the mismatch between its old mission and Europe's new strategic challenges. It is no longer possible for NATO to concentrate on the strategic luxury of territorial defense. The dividing line between "in area" and "out of area" crises, so clearly drawn during the cold war, has become ambiguous and artificial.
Redefining alliance commitments in both areas, and finding the proper balance between the two, is the fundamental issue facing the alliance. Any new balance, however, must greatly improve NATO's capability to conduct military operations beyond its borders, and eventually allow it to expand its full security guarantees.
American leadership must secure the gains of the cold war and build a new U.S.-European partnership that can project democracy and stability. What is required is political will and strategic vision. By showing both, President Clinton can lay the foundation for a new partnership between the United States and Europe.

HEADLINE: U.S. FORCES TO STAY IN SOMALIA TO END WARLORD VIOLENCE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
American troops will remain in Somalia until violence is quelled in Mogadishu, Somali faction leaders give up their heavy weapons and the country has a national police force capable of keeping the peace, Defense Secretary Les Aspin said today.
Mr. Aspin's remarks were the Clinton Administration's most extensive explanation of its strategy in Somalia, what it views as its successes and shortcomings, and its plans for future action. In effect, Mr. Aspin said there will be no quick or easy way out of a mission that began nine months ago as a relief operation but has turned into a more difficult and ambitious effort to rebuild a devastated country. 
 About 3,100 American troops now operate in Somalia under United Nations command as part of an international force of 24,000. Some 1,600 more are under American control in support of the international effort.
 
Bench Marks for Somalia
 Although Mr. Aspin laid out bench marks that must be achieved, he did not say when or exactly how the United Nations-led force in Somalia might accomplish the objectives.
The objectives themselves are already raising concerns among some in Congress who fear an open-ended American military commitment on the Horn of Africa. But by laying out the Administration's agenda, Mr. Aspin sought to quiet these fears and give critics in Congress and elsewhere specific standards for measuring American success.
While Mr. Aspin did not specifically say that a goal was capturing or killing Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, a fugitive faction leader who is blamed for the attacks on United Nations troops, Administration officials say quelling the violence in Mogadishu means removing General Aidid.
 
Goals Hinge on Restoring Order
 They said that advancing any broader political or economic goals in Somalia hinge on restoring order in the Somali capital.
"The danger now is that unless we return security to south Mogadishu, political chaos will follow the U.N. withdrawal," Mr. Aspin said in the speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research and policy organization here.
Indeed, accompanying the 400 Army Rangers that President Clinton dispatched to Somalia this week are elements of Delta Force, an elite counterterrorist unit whose task is widely believed to be to seize General Aidid.
Mr. Aspin sought today to shift attention away from the continuing violence in Mogadishu to some of the operation's successes. The Defense Secretary said, for instance, that the original mission to insure the delivery of food and other aid had succeeded and that emergency food deliveries to Somalia are scheduled to end this month.
But the bulk of his 20-minute address focused on conditions that must be met to restore order in south Mogadishu and to rebuild the country's shattered economy and political structure.
In broad terms, Mr. Aspin listed six steps to reach those goals:
*The United Nations needs to add about 4,000 more troops to reach its authorized level of 28,000. India has pledged to send 4,000 troops, but they are not expected to arrive in Somalia until early October.
*The United Nations must help establish credible police forces in large cities and towns. Currently, about 4,000 Somalis are serving in auxiliary police forces in their hometowns, but these forces are clan-based and subject to rivalries. United Nations officials say they are working to help train, equip and pay a national police force.
*Faction leaders must relinquish their heavy weapons. State Department officials suspect that many of the leaders are still smuggling weapons from Ethiopia and Kenya. "Most of the clan leaders say they will turn in their weapons so long as the others do," a State Department official said. "Even if we could get 70 to 80 percent of the arms, we'd be doing well."
*The United Nations must develop an overarching plan to pull together its economic, political and security activities.
*The United Nations should borrow from the example set by peacekeeping units in Cambodia to form a core group of African nations, and other countries, to speed the economic and political recovery in Somalia.
*The United Nations and the Organization of African Unity should work together to put back on track the national reconciliation process that aims to rebuild Somalia's political framework.
"On economic and political reconstruction of the country some progress has been made but more work needs to be done," Mr. Aspin said. The secretary said some small shops, school and orphanages had reopened in central Somalia, but he said the overall economic condition in the country remain "dire."
A United Nations spokesman agreed with Mr. Aspin's assessment. "The U.N. and the Secretary of Defense see pretty much eye to eye on his six points," said Fred Eckhard, a United Nations spokesman in New York.
Mr. Aspin said the withdrawal of American troops hinges chiefly on the security aspects of these goals. "When the three conditions are met -- south Mogadishu, heavy weapons and police forces in the major population centers -- then I believe that the U.S. quick-reaction forces can come back."
 
G.I.'s May Come Home in Fall
 The Administration initially said the 1,200-soldier Army force might return this summer. Administration officials now say the optimistic goal is for the forces, which include the Rangers, to return later this fall. Mr. Aspin carefully avoided setting any date.
The Defense Secretary said the United States will begin withdrawing the 3,100 American logistics troops under United Nations command when the security situation in Mogadishu permits the large-scale hiring of civilian contractors to replace the soldiers.
The Administration's goal has been to reduce the number of logistics troops to 1,400 by Jan. 1, but officials refused to say again today whether they would be able to meet that target.
"We went there to save a people and we succeeded," Mr. Aspin said. "We are staying to help those same people rebuild their country."

HEADLINE: Low Birth Rate Is Becoming a Headache for Italy

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Beyond its woes of bombs and corruption, strikes and recession, Italy is slowly coming to acknowledge a far more insidious challenge that will remold society by the turn of the century, creating a land where the old outnumber the young and the big, close families of myth and tradition are gone forever.
The reasons are simple: Italians live longer than most other Europeans, statistics show, and despite the pervasive presence of the Roman Catholic Church and its dogmatic stance against birth control, Italian women now have fewer children than women in any other nation. 
 And so, Italy has moved from a time when the land bred a mom-and-pasta stereotype of large families and frolicking bambini to the present, when figures released this month by the United Nations showed Italian women bearing a statistical 1.3 children each compared with 2.1 in the United States and a world average of 3.3. Overall, Italy's population of 56.7 million has virtually stopped growing.
Behind the figures is a web of demographic shifts -- from countryside to city, from poor south to rich north -- in a postwar period that brought industrialization and dislocation, yielding both wealth and a reappraisal of the family values Mussolini once advocated as part of his drive to build a fascist empire.
Some analysts even argue that Italians no longer dote on children the way they did when mama and papa packed an unruly brood in a 1950's Fiat 500 and headed for the beach.
"There's a cultural hostility toward children," said Giulia Paolo Di Nicola, a sociologist at the Gabriele d'Annunzio University in Pescara. "They aren't wanted in the condominiums, in public places where they can disturb, even in churches."
The statistics, moreover, foreshadow a time when there will be more retirees seeking benefits than younger people working to finance them. The Agnelli Foundation, a research organization run by Fiat, has projected that in the first third of the next century there will be two people drawing pensions for every person paying contributions.
 
Not Enough Pupils
 Two weeks ago, the Government announced that the Italian education system will drop 56,000 classes in schools around the country this year because of the decrease in pupils.
And a survey earlier this month by a private financial services company said Italy's work force of 20 million had already been overtaken by the number of pensions being paid out: 21 million pensions to 15 million retirees, some of whom legally draw more than one.
Italy is not the only European country confronting the repercussions of an aging of society.
But, according to Italian Government figures, the strains are already greater here than elsewhere on the Continent: for every retiree drawing a pension in Britain, for instance, there are 2.3 active workers. In France, the figure is 2.5. In Italy, by contrast, the ratio of contributors-to-beneficiaries has already slipped to around 1 to 1.3, and it is destined to slide further.
 
A Long-Term Problem
 "By the year 2000, Italy will have five million fewer children under the age of 15 than it did in 1970, and five million more people aged 65 and up," said Massimo Livi Bacci, a sociologist who bases his assessment on figures released by a private research institute. The trend, he said, was "manageable in the short term, but untenable in the long term without a profound and traumatic change in the rules" covering social services.
While overpopulation is one of the major problems facing the poor nations of the world -- women in the developing countries bear nearly twice the number of children as women in industrialized countries, 3.6 to 1.9 -- the opposite could become true for the richer nations.
But why the flight from large families?
Some have suggested that, like laboratory specimens, Italians have responded to their ever-more-crowded-suburbs and cramped apartment houses by curbing procreation. Fabrizio Menchini Fabris, a medical specialist at the University of Pisa, said the stresses of modern society have created widespread infertility.
Many more, though, see the reduction of family sizes as the result of an assertiveness among women who, having tasted independence by going out to work, do not want to lose it.
 
Money Over Machismo
 By this account, the men -- who once equated procreation with virility, but now prefer cash in their pocket to children in the crib -- have simply gone along with the women's decision.
What it all boils down to, said Franca Fossati, editor of a feminist magazine called Noi Donne -- We Women -- is that "the women have changed very quickly" after the expansion of schooling and urbanization while "the men haven't" in certain ways.
"So there's very little division of domestic work between men and women," she said. "Working as well as looking after the house makes it virtually impossible to have a family. Having few children is a form of female self-defense."
Angelica Alexander, a 33-year-old married schoolteacher who waited 10 years to have a child -- Ricardo -- six months ago, said much has changed since the days when she grew up.
 
Grandmothers Work Too
 "There's less family support," Mrs. Alexander said in an interview. "The houses are smaller." She noted that grandmothers, who once shared child-tending, work these days too and "there's no one else to look after the children."
As a child, she said, she had her own playroom. Now, although her husband is a highly-qualified computer specialist, they live in a small apartment in Rome that does not offer Ricardo a bedroom of his own.
While Italy's postwar prosperity had played a part in her calculations about having a child, she said, her Catholic upbringing had not.
In Italy, some 97 per cent of the population are baptized Catholics and thus exhorted by Pope John Paul II and other clerics to eschew artificial birth control, an exhortation that many priests privately recognize as futile. Not only is birth control easily available, but Italy has also had legalized abortion since 1978, and an attempt to repeal it in a national referendum in 1981 failed by 2-to-1 ratio.
"Not many of our friends worry about the church," Mrs. Alexander said. "They get married in church and have their children baptized in church, but it's out of tradition, not belief."
 
Travel and Leisure
 Thus, for the first years of her marriage, she and her husband preferred to spend their money on travel and leisure rather than on raising children.
Some Italian women bemoan such materialism among a whole generation that grew to adulthood in the boom years of the 1980's.
"Daughters these days don't want to get married and have children," said Arria Clerici, a high school teacher of Greek and Latin who raised three children. "They'd rather buy a car than make sacrifices."
Tina Anselmi, a veteran legislator and head of the Italian Parliament's commission on sexual equality, tends to agree. "I think there's a culture among many young couples, just to have one child," she said.
"This is a central phenomenon of the greater presence of women in the workplace which has not been accompanied by an adequate creation of services" to support working mothers.
The shift to small families has been going on for three decades. After World War II, Ms. Anselmi said, one out of every two Italians lived in rural societies.
 
Baby Boom Peaked
 In the postwar era, Italy's baby boom peaked, with figures for 1964 showing Italian women having twice as many children as they do today -- a statistical peak of 2.7 children.
Then came the growth of the northern industries that drew millions of Italians to the cities.
Today, only one in nine Italians lives on the land, predominantly in the south where, it seems no coincidence, family sizes are still higher than in the north.
At the same time, however, the cost of living went up, too, and as more women than ever before went to work, so, too, their earnings were needed to support the home budget.
Some contend that what has really changed is not so much Italian women as their myth.
"It's difficult to explain to a foreigner that the Italian woman, seen as a fertility goddess, probably never existed and certainly doesn't exist any more," said Ms. Paola Di Nicola. "The culture of procreation has changed and we are the least prolific nation in the world. So much for cliches."

HEADLINE: Brewing Efficiency in Argentina

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZARATE, Argentina

 BODY:
At the heart of this new brewery, owned by Quilmes, the largest beer maker in Argentina, is a maze of mirrorlike stainless steel pipes and vats, run by only a handful of workers with little more than computer terminals.
From the blending of the malt, rice, corn and water into hot wort at the brew house, then adding the hops and yeast, to the 15 days of monitoring in the giant fermentation tanks, the clean floors, fresh paint and workers in white frocks create an image of efficiency and competitiveness. 
 After more than two years of economic recovery here, and attempts by Argentine companies to become more competitive, Quilmes Industrial S.A. is the company to emulate.
"Quilmes has the most enlightened management, the strongest balance sheet and is probably the most modern company here," said William F. Truscott, the portfolio manager for the Argentina Fund, a Scudder, Stevens & Clark mutual fund that invests in Argentine stocks.
 
A Narrower Focus
 Christopher Ecclestone, a securities analyst in Buenos Aires, added, "We make no bones about our view that Quilmes is the best company in Argentina."
Unlike many industrial companies here that have bought businesses that seemed only tangentially related to their core businesses, Quilmes has narrowed its focus to beer, soft drinks and, potentially, bottled water.
Analysts have welcomed the company's low profile and lean management, absence of debt and a willingness to take risks. Before the return to a civilian Government in Chile in 1990, for example, Quilmes entered the beer market in Santiago. And despite guerrilla violence in Peru, it has been looking to buy a brewery there for more than a year.
An investor who bought Quilmes stock two years ago at $20 a share, when it first traded on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, could hardly disagree. It is now trading at around $290 a share, for a market capitalization of almost $1 billion.
That reflects an explosion in the company's earnings, which have risen 240 percent since 1989, to $44.1 million last year, from $13 million.
The success of Quilmes is not only the product of good management. It also reflects an economy in Argentina that has grown almost 9 percent annually and pushed up per capita beer consumption by 50 percent, to about 8 gallons a year.
Norberto O. Morita, the chief executive of Quilmes, said he saw almost unlimited potential growth in Argentina, where beer consumption is a third of that in the United States, and the rest of South America.
"We are experiencing beer shortages in the summer we cannot fill," Mr. Morita said in a recent interview. "When we inaugurated the Zarate plant, we already knew we needed more capacity and were planning a doubling of the plant."
After investing $72 million in the Zarate plant here that produces more than 1.8 million barrels of beer a year, the company last month broke ground on a $56 million sister plant alongside that will double the production capacity to 3.7 million barrels a year. That would bring the capacity of the company to more than 8 million barrels a year, or roughly 20 percent of the beer made last year by the Anheuser-Busch Companies.
Mr. Morita said the company had invested $300 million in Argentina and the region in the last five years, and would invest another $150 million this year.
"And it's all out of our earnings stream," he said. "We have not gone to the markets to borrow money."
Moreover, it represents an investment by a wealthy Argentine family company that had all its properties, including Quilmes, appropriated in the early 1950's.
In 1953, amid surges in nationalistic and anti-Semitic feelings, Gen. Juan D. Peron , the founder of the Peronist Party, seized the holdings of the Bembergs, which included Quilmes, 3.8 million acres of farmland and the family's houses, driving them from Argentina.
Though most of the assets, including Quilmes, were returned two years later after a coup unseated General Peron, the seizure remained a symbol of the capriciousness of Argentine politics and the beginning of decades of industrial decline, corruption and uncontrolled inflation.
The Bembergs control the Quilmes holding company, Quinsa.
The inauguration of the Zarate plant on April 6, almost 40 years later, was a day of symbolic vindication for the Bembergs. The Argentine President, Carlos Saul Menem, whose political patron saint was General Peron, was on hand to give his approval of the industrial progress.
 
New Competition
 While Quilmes has ridden the wave of economic expansion, the boom has attracted competition that some analysts said could cause trouble for the company.
Last year, Brahma, the largest brewer in Brazil, moved into the Argentine market. Miller Brewing imports its canned beer and sells it at discount prices. The Chilean brewing giant, Companias Cervecerias Unidas is discussing investment plans in Argentina, as are Anheuser-Busch and Coors, according to a recent report by Oppenheimer & Company.
Such competition and the recent run-up in Quilmes stock moved Mr. Ecclestone, the securities analyst, earlier this month to recommend against buying the stock.
"We are not losing our admiration for the long-term prospects of Quilmes, nor do we retract our view that the company has the best managment team" in Argentina, he wrote in his weekly newsletter. "However, we have strong suspicions that the stock has been pumped up beyond the potential in the short term to meet expectations."
 
A Four-Part Strategy
 But Mr. Morita, a Japanese Argentine who ran the French subsidiary of Corning Glass before joining Quilmes in 1985, said he was not that concerned, adding that he had a four-part strategy to keep Quilmes ahead.
One part is to take advantage of the declining wine consumption in Argentina and tout the fact that his company's beer has a quarter the alcohol content of wine.
"We think we can appeal to the younger, athletic group by offering a drink that has only a small amount of alcohol," he said.
A second part of the strategy is to continue regional expansion, particularly into Brazil, Peru and Bolivia.
 
Diversification Planned
 He also said he planned to diversify into more soft drinks, bottled water and a nonalcohol beer, and seek alliances with what he called "world class partners," such as Heineken, the Dutch brewing giant. Quilmes imports Heineken into Argentina.
Given the efficiency of the spanking new Quilmes brewery in this city about 60 miles north of Buenos Aires, the strategy seems plausible.
The brewing of beer here requires eight workers a shift. In the bottling operation, there are 34 a shift.
Quilmes has been so successful in appealing to foreign investors that the stock is tightly held by institutions like the Argentina Fund, and often no more than 2,000 shares trade a day.
"Our investment bankers are now saying we should register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and list on the New York Stock Exchange -- no A.D.R.'s," he said, referring to American depository receipts, the certificates that substitute for shares for many foreign companies. "We would be the first Argentine company to do that. They say it would give us added prestige. But we haven't made a decision on that yet."

Aerospace Industry Seeks Weaker Sanctions on China

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Aerospace industry officials said today that they would press the Clinton Administration to soften the blow of trade sanctions announced on Wednesday that bar the sale of American satellites to China.
The officials argue that the satellite sanctions -- part of a broader ban on high-technology exports that the State Department ordered to penalize China for shipping missile parts to Pakistan -- unfairly punished the satellite industry and would stop it from selling goods to China that would not be used for military purposes. 
 One industry official said he hoped the Commerce Department would push the State Department to show some flexibility in banning satellite sales, adding that some Commerce officials told him in private that they were not enthusiastic about the decision to impose sanctions. But department officials insisted today that they were "fully supportive" of the decision to impose sanctions.
"The basic problem is once they determine that China sold parts of a missile, they have no choice but to impose sanctions," said Joel Johnson, vice president for international affairs for the Aerospace Industries Association. "The industry doesn't like unilateral actions and doesn't like sanctions that provide the executive branch with no flexibility."
Several industry officials said they would urge the State Department to find "some wiggle room" to ease the ban. But State Department officials insisted that the satellite ban was specifically required by an overlapping series of export laws.
These officials said satellites were included on the list of sensitive technologies because they contain some sophisticated components that could be used for military production. But officials of the Hughes Aircraft Company, the world's largest producer of satellites, said Chinese engineers never gained access to these components because the satellites remained in Hughes's physical control until they were launched.
David Shea, a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Hughes, said the company feared China would start buying satellites from manufacturers in Britain and France unless those nations imposed similar sanctions. Hughes was negotiating to sell two satellites to China, and China has expressed interest in buying 10 more Hughes satellites by the end of the decade.
 
No Move Against Imports
 Aerospace industry officials criticized the State Department for deciding to punish American exports rather than imports from China. Chinese exports to the United States are not affected by the sanctions. But State Department officials said the law under which sanctions were imposed does not allow for restricting imports from China when missile parts were found to be shipped in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The law, however, allows for imports to be restricted if the Government concludes that China shipped complete missiles to Pakistan.
On Wednesday, the State Department announced that it would impose trade sanctions that would ban $400 million to $500 million in high-technology trade with China over each of the next two years. State Department officials said exports of American satellites would be hit hardest because most military-related exports to China were already restricted after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.
Satellite exports were also restricted after the Tiananmen crackdown. As a carrot to encourage China to abide by the missile control accord, Washington agreed to grant special waivers to allow satellite exports. In this way, satellites became the main category of sensitive exports still allowed to China. But now State Department officials say they will no longer grant such export waivers for satellites.
 
Confusion Over Restrictions
 Staff members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said they had asked the State Department for a briefing because they were unsure what high-technology equipment was covered by the sanctions.
Industry officials were also confused. Commerce Department officials said that equipment destined for China that had already received an export license could be shipped. The Government, however, would most likely bar equipment that does not have an export license, even if an American company has a contract to sell it to China.
That means Hughes's contract to sell a satellite and ground station to a Hong Kong company controlled by the Chinese is expected to go through because Hughes already has an export license. CNN plans to lease transponders on the satellite so its broadcasts can reach more of Asia.

HEADLINE: Contract Furor May Stall Efforts To Do New York's Work Privately

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
New York has done less than other cities in turning municipal services over to private companies, and its efforts may be further slowed by the recent trouble involving the Parking Violations Bureau, say city officials and government analysts.
Compared with New York's vast municipal bureaucracy and budget, the work that has been transferred to private companies under Mayor Dinkins has been modest: managing 330 centers for the elderly, custodial services at 99 public schools, and boiler inspections at the city's commercial office buildings. A wide spectrum of New Yorkers say more should be done, from contracting out clerical work to hiring private businesses to run bridge tolls and handle water treatment. The issue unites some members of Mr. Dinkins's staff with business executives and critics of city government. 
 But officials in and out of the Dinkins administration say that the political maelstrom created by the problems at the Parking Violations Bureau may have created new barriers to private work. Mayor Dinkins has scrapped the city's contract with Lockheed Information Management Services, which was to have received at least $150 million to run the parking bureau for five years.
 
Trying to Improve Efficiency
 "Whenever there is a political scandal, people adopt a bunker mentality, and it saddens me," said Harvey Robins, the director of the city's Office of Operations. His office is seeking ways to improve the efficiency of more than 150 city agencies and public services.
"We have not taken a philosophical position that everything should be privatized, but it ought to be part of the package," he added. "Now people are gun-shy; they are risk-averse."
Union officials, among the most vocal opponents of privatization, said city officials had good reason to balk at future proposals.
"How many scandals will it take for the city to learn that privatization is no panacea?," said Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, New York City's largest municipal employees union. It has for decades opposed almost all attempts to contract out city services.
Although privatization has become a "fashionable buzzword," he said it too often enables businesses to "behave like pigs at the public trough."
More than a dozen services now provided by city workers would be turned over to private companies for the first time under the proposed budget for the 1994 fiscal year. The city would seek a private contractor to replace 85 maintenance, switchboard and vistor transportation workers at the Rikers Island jail, hire a private company to manage a domestic violence shelter, and contract out some clerical work in the Department of Social Services.
Donald D. Kummerfeld, a Manhattan publishing executive, says he is concerned that the problems with the parking violations contract could affect the work of a committee he works on. It is to report to Mayor Dinkins in September on ways the city can streamline its operations.
"There is enough resistance to privatization among public officials already," he said.
Among the recommendations under study by Mr. Kummerfeld's committee are those made in June by the New York City Partnership, a business group, which wants the city to seek competitive bids from private companies to manage the city's water treatment system.
 
Bidding on Buses and Garbage
 Under the Partnership's plan, private companies would also bid on running the city's buses and garbage collection, and the East River bridges would be turned over to a private company that would use electronic toll collection systems. If all its privatization proposals are accepted, the group said, the city could save $16 billion over the next 10 years.
"It would be a tragic loss" if the parking violations furor "delayed New York City from doing what cities like Chicago and Philadelphia have already started -- using competition to improve the delivery of municipal service," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the Partnership.
In July 1992, Philadelphia reached a new contract with its municipal workers, giving it greater freedom to contract out city work. Since then, it has signed a dozen contracts to have bueinesses remove sludge from its water treatment plant, provide museum guards, do landscaping and clean City Hall, among other help.
Privatization "is precisely the kind of thing taxpayers are looking for when they say they want to see the city run like a business," said Dianne E. Reed, director of the Pennsylvania Economy League, a research group that has monitored Philadelphia's campaign to contract out public work under Mayor Edward Rendell, who took office in January 1992.
The result, she said, has been "major public relations dividends."
There have been more tangible dividends as well. So far, the city said, its private contracts are saving it $15 million a year. It plans to privatize 20 to 30 more types of work, and estimates that its total annual savings would be $40 million to $50 million in a city whose general fund budget is about $2.3 billion.
Chicago and Boston are among dozens of cities that have parking violations fines collected privately.
Chicago turned over its collections in 1990 to Electronic Data Systems, a company founded by Ross Perot. It said the company, which it is paying $17 million a year, took in $64 million in 1991, its first full year on the job, almost triple the $22.7 million collected by city workers in 1989.
Boston has contracted with Lockheed Management Information Systems since 1981, when the company was called Datacom. It says it now collects on 85 percent of the city's parking tickets, compared with only 17 percent when city workers did it.
Experts say that smaller cities have the most experience with private contracts because they have simpler budgets and smaller bureaucracies. Private work is greatest in cities in the South and Southwest, in part because their public workers have weaker unions than those in industrialized northern cities.
In San Jose, Calif., a wide variety of public services have been managed by private companies for decades. They include the city's garbage collection and disposal systems, parking violations bureau, street sweeping, airport shuttle and custodial work.
 
Not Without Problems
 Officials there said San Jose's heavy reliance on outside contractors had not been without problems.
"Cost alone should not be considered a sufficient reason to contract out city services, because there will almost always be hidden costs to pay," said Greg Larsen, San Jose's deputy city manager.
Among the "hidden costs," he said, are the expense of monitoring private contractors to guard against overbilling and assure that the work they promise is done. And in tight economic times, cities may find themselves locked into contracts for services they might otherwise reduce. "You do lose flexibility," he said.
Advocates of private contracts say their benefits sometimes spring more from the threat of competition than from actually turning over city work to private companies.
Phoenix, which began contracting out many services in 1980, uses competitive bidding to pit its own agencies against private companies.
 
City Competes, Also
 "When we first got into it, the city agencies lost most of the bids, but we stole the companies' ideas, streamlined services and won much of the work back," said Mark Hughes, a city spokesman.
Despite criticism that it has not moved quickly enough, New York is far from inexperienced in the use of private contractors.
According to a study by the New York City Partnership, more than half the budgets of the city's Human Resources Administration and Departments of Employment, Aging and Mental Health were allocated last year to pay private companies and professionals.
And in one recent experiment, the Department of Parks and Recreation, which has responsibility for pruning and cutting trees on residential blocks, decided last November to compare the work of its crews with that of private companies.
In the end, the department said, its own crews won by a wide margin, cutting down trees at an average cost of $117, compared with the $211 paid to the private concerns.
 
Inching Toward Businesses
 According to advocates of privatization, New York City was inching toward a far greater use of private companies -- or at least the more aggressive use of competitive bidding for public services -- before the parking violations problem, whose impact, if any, is unknown.
"There will always be a built-in tension between the need to protect the integrity of government and the desire to privatize services," said Mr. Kummerfeld, who declined to say what, if any, proposals for privatization his committee would make to Mayor Dinkins in September.
But he added that the troubles with the parking violations contract would remain part of the issue whenever privatization is debated.
"The extent to which this incident dramatizes the danger to government officials cannot be helpful," he said. "It will add to people's fears."
 
 
 
GOVERNMENT: Public Work Done Privately Around the United States
 New York City has been slower than others others in shifting some of its operations to private companies or agencies. The few operations that have been contracted out to private companies has been modest at best. Following is a list of several cities and what services they have contracted out to private companies.
 
New York City:
For decades, has contracted out more than half its social services operations to not-for-profit groups, private counselors and professional firms. Since 1990, it has contracted out management of 330 senior citizens centers, custodial services at 99 schools, and boiler inspection at private office buildings. In fiscal 1993, the city has budgeted $2.8 billion, or 9.5 percent of $29.5 billion budget, for private sector contracts.
 
Chicago:
Since 1990, has contracted out parking ticket collections. Nearly tripled its parking violation revenues, to $64 million in 1991, while paying $17 million a year to its outside collection concern. Also contracts out custodial services, sewer cleaning, landscaping and management of alcohol treatment centers and towing of abandoned vehicles. Estimates its savings at least $10 million to $15 million a year. Mayor Richard Daley has pledged to consider private contracts for every new city service.
 
Philadelphia:
Negotiated new contracts with municipal workers in July 1992, to allow greater privatization. Since then it has contracted out custodial work at City Hall, sludge removal, museum guard services and management of its water transfer stations, a print shop and a warehouse. Mayor Edward Rendell plans to contract out 20 to 30 more services, and says the city will save $40 million to $50 million a year, about 2 percent of its $2.3 billion general fund budget.
 
Pheonix:
Since 1980, has sought competive bids for most city services and encouraged competition betweeen private companies and city agencies. Has privatized trash collection, water bill processing, landfills, water meter repairs, public defenders, dead animal pickup, custodial services, park concessions and landscaping. It estimates it has saved $23.9 million since 1980.
 
San Jose:
For decades, it has contracted out garbage collection and disposal, parking ticket collection, street sweeping, airport shuttle bus service, food services and building maintenance to private companies. No estimate of cost savings is available.

GRAPHIC: Photo: New York has been slower than most cities in turning to private companies for municipal services. Although the pace has been slowed by the city's own difficulties in finding suitable contractors, some critics contend that that is for the best. They cite a study showing city crews were more efficient in cutting down and pruning trees. Workers were on the job Wednesday on 166th Street in Flushing, Queens.

HEADLINE: BOSNIANS CONDEMN U.N.'S PEACE PLAN

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 27

 BODY:
With almost all of their Croatian and Serbian colleagues on the opposite sides of this country's criss-crossing battle lines, members of the Bosnian Parliament, mostly Muslims, today overwhelmingly advocated rejecting a United Nations peace plan. They said formerly Muslim-majority districts must be joined to a proposed Muslim-dominated Bosnian republic.
The peace plan, drawn up in Geneva earlier this month by two international mediators, Lord Owen of the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations, would reorganize Bosnia and Herzegovina into a loose union comprising a Serbian, a Croatian and a predominantly Muslim republic. 
 But in the eyes of most Muslims, the plan would reward the Serbs for "ethnic cleansing," create a landlocked Muslim-dominated country with grim economic prospects and pave the way for erasing Bosnia and Herzegovina from the map of Europe and linking the Serbian and Croatian republics in Bosnia with Serbia and Croatia.
 
Vote Scheduled for Saturday
 Parliament is scheduled to vote on the peace proposal on Saturday. At the session today, only one speaker gave the proposal unambiguous support.
"The document we have in front of us is not an agreement but an ultimatum from the strong to the weak," said Ivan Straus, an architect. But he added, "I tell you personally to sign this ultimatum because it will end the war."
President Alija Izetbegovic was one of those speaking to the legislators and several hundred academics, writers, army officers and other public figures who were invited to take part in the debate.
He said the United Nations peace plan could be used as a basis for further discussion but could not be accepted because it rewarded the Bosnian Serbs with at least eight districts that had Muslim majority populations before nationalist Serb militiamen brutally drove them out last year.
"We are experiencing great hardship," said Mr. Izetbegovic, who is scheduled to return to negotiations on the peace plan in Geneva starting Aug. 30. "But this is no time for defeatism."
Mr. Izetbegovic called on the mediators to grant the proposed mostly Muslim republic an outlet to the Adriatic Sea near the town of Neum, which has been a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina since World War II.
The President also called for guarantees, including a United Nations resolution and a show of support from the United States and NATO, that the proposed Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina would remain an internationally recognized country and United Nations member.
 
World Indifference Condemned
 One after another, the speakers took the podium in a stifling hot Holiday Inn banquet hall and condemned the world for turning its back on Bosnia by refusing to lift a United Nations arms embargo that guaranteed Bosnia's nationalist Serbs a vast weapons superiority.
"The international community has decided that in place of law here, the law of the jungle should rule," said the religious leader of the Bosnian Muslims, Mustafa Ceric, who sat in the front row next to the Roman Catholic Archbishop, a Serbian Orthodox priest and a representative of Sarajevo's dwindling Jewish community. "We need unity now as never before."
At a meeting of its own this weekend in the Serbian stronghold at Pale, the self-declared Bosnian Serb parliament is expected to vote to accept the peace plan, even though it requires the Serbs to roll back from part of the 70 percent of Bosnia's territory that they have overrun since beginning the war here 17 months ago.
A similar parliament of Bosnian Croats is scheduled to meet on Saturday in the town of Grude. Miro Lasic, a Croatian member of the Bosnian collective presidency, said no vote by the Bosnian Parliament would be binding on the country's Croatian people.
The Bosnian presidency today ousted Prime Minister Mile Akmadzic, a Croat, after the main Croatian party, the Croatian Democratic Union, withdrew its representatives from the Bosnian Parliament.
The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, threatened earlier this week that the Serbs would press on militarily unless the Bosnian Parliament accepted the peace plan.
The debate today was held in the Holiday Inn because Serbian shells destroyed the Parliament building across the street and none of Sarajevo's other large meeting halls have a secure power supply. Nevertheless, from time to time the electricity went off, leaving the meeting hall nearly pitch black.
 
'A Requiem for Bosnia'
 "This meeting is a requiem for Bosnia," said Stjepan Kljuic, a Bosnian loyalist who led Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union until he was ousted by the Bosnian Croats' present leader, Mate Boban, who has worked with the Croatian Government's backing to break the Bosnian state apart.
"Izetbegovic and the others can't sign this plan," Mr. Kljuic said during a recess. "It will force the Muslims to cleanse their territory of minorities. What will they do with all the refugees forced from other parts of the republic and out for revenge?"
Just over 100 of the original 240 regular members of the Bosnian Parliament have not withdrawn from the body. About 70 showed up for the meeting today.
The Bosnian Government is seeking the inclusion in the Muslim-dominated republic of eight districts that had Mulsim majorities before the Serbs began to drive them out last year with a campaign of killing and rape known as "ethnic cleansing."
These districts include Visegrad, Zvornik, Foca, Bratunac, Sanski Most, Bijeljina, Kljuc and Bosanska Krupa, said Deputy Foreign Minister Suleiman Sulic.
"Inclusion of these districts in the Muslim state would create the conditions for the return of thousands of refugees," Mr. Sulic said. "I know the Serbs will not give this up. But someone should force them to, because they carried out genocide there. We cannot in principle drop these demands."
But he clearly indicated that the Bosnians would have to accept some version of the peace plan sooner or later.
"The continuation of the war would mean the continued destruction of the Muslim people," Mr. Sulic said.
 
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
 In SARAJEVO yesterday, members of the Bosnian Parliament, mostly Muslims, urged that a United Nations peace plan be rejected, saying formerly Muslim-majority districts must be joined to a proposed Muslim-dominated republic.
In MOSTAR, Muslims trapped on the east side of the NERETVA RIVER prevented a 19-truck United Nations convoy from leaving for a second day, but peacekeepers were able to evacuate five wounded children. After arriving in MEDJUGORJE by road, they reached SPLIT by helicopter en route to a United States medical unit in ZAGREB, capital of CROATIA.
On Thursday, the trucks brought 175 tons of food and other aid to 55,000 Muslims, some of whom have blocked the convoy's departure in the hope that Serbian forces would hold their fire. But the Bosnian radio reported three people had been killed by tank shells today, and two by snipers on Thursday.
In BELGRADE, the national bank of YUGOSLAVIA announced that it was issuing a 1 billion dinar banknote (or about $3 at the current exchange rate) in an attempt to keep pace with runaway inflation.

HEADLINE: China Protests U.S. Trade Sanctions

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 27

 BODY:
China summoned the American Ambassador to Beijing today and delivered a blistering protest against the Clinton Administration's decision this week to impose sanctions over China's sale of missile technology to Pakistan.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and the official New China News Agency said the resumption of sanctions on high-technology exports would cause China "to reconsider its commitment," as the agency put it, to abide by the Missile Control Technology Regime. Under that 1987 accord, the United States and other major powers have been trying to stem the spread of ballistic missile technology. 
 Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu summoned the United States Ambassador, Stapleton Roy, for what was described as "an urgent meeting" in which the American was told that his country had ignored "repeated clarifications made by the Governments of China and Pakistan" on their missile technology cooperation and sales.
 
Sanctions Strongly Denounced
 Mr. Liu termed the sanctions a "naked hegemonic act" that "has brutally violated the basic norms governing international relations. "
China did not sign the missile control agreement but has pledged to follow its provisions. The Ambassador and the American Embassy had no immediate comment on the Chinese protest, and Western officials here said it was too early to gauge whether China's threat to disavow the agreement was more diplomatic bluster than genuine threat.
The Chinese press agency said Mr. Liu had emphasized that "China has all along adopted a positive and serious approach toward preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems."
China and Pakistan have argued that any Chinese sales of parts or technology for M-11 missiles to Pakistan do not violate the missile proliferation accord because the M-11's range is less than the minimum of 300 kilometers, or 186 miles, covered by the agreement.
But the United States and other industrial nations that monitor the agreement have amended the rules by which they interpret it. In July they briefed China on the changes in the interpretation and asserted that sales of M-11 technology Pakistan, which they say have been going on for at least two years, constituted a violation.
In a separate statement, Foreign Minister Qian expressed near-indifference to the Clinton Administration action, arguing that the sanctions would do more harm to the American economy than to China's by preventing up to $1 billion in equipment sales from American companies.
In an interview with The Asian Wall Street Journal, Mr. Qian said: "The Chinese market is open. If the United States is restricting itself, we cannot offer it any help."
Western analysts said any attempt by China to disregard international concerns about the spread of advanced weaponry would further isolate Beijing and incite the United States Congress to demand the withdrawal of China's favorable trade status, a move the analysts said would adversely affect as much as 30 percent of China's exports and disrupt the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
"Clearly they would become an international pariah if they started shipping missiles all over the place," said Douglas Paal, who was a National Security Council aide in the Bush Administration.
Speaking by telephone, Mr. Paal, now the director of the Asian Pacific Policy Center in Washington, argued that the Clinton Administration had boxed itself into a negative relationship with China. He said today's statement showed that "China is trying to get our attention" to say "enough is enough" in hopes of opening a more constructive dialogue with Washington.
 
China Charges Double Standard
 Mr. Liu, in his remarks to the United States Ambassador, and Mr. Qian, in his interview, accused Washington of a double standard with regard to controlling arms sales. Mr. Qian, citing a United States Congressional report, said the American global arms trade dwarfed China's, with a value of more than $13 billion annually compared with $100 million.
The Chinese officials said Washington had been unable to explain how it could comply with a decade-old United States-China joint communique sharply restricting arms sales to Taiwan while also carrying forward last year's decision by President Bush to allow the sale of 150 General Dynamics F-16 fighters to Taiwan. The Chinese said the sale violated the terms of communique, which calls for an annual $20 million reduction in American arms sales to Taiwan until they reach zero.
Mr. Bush's decision, made in the midst of the presidential campaign, violated the communique, United States officials conceded, but was consistent with the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act, which recognizes the need to maintain Taiwan's defensive capacity.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks to 'Fix' Mining Provisions of Sea Treaty

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has joined more than 60 countries in a drive to renegotiate a complex and bitterly disputed section of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a treaty that has been in legal limbo since President Reagan rejected it more than a decade ago.
Negotiators at the United Nations, some of them veterans of the grueling Law of the Sea talks of the 1970's, say there is a widespread feeling that failure to resolve the lingering dispute could seriously undermine future application of the pact, which covers virtually every aspect of human activity on, over and under the ocean. 
 Legal scholars regard the treaty as a milestone in international law. But its density and sheer breadth -- it comprises 320 articles and 9 annexes on everything from navigation and fishing rights to environmental protection and scientific research -- have made it an exotic and rather forbidding subject for the public.
Moreover, its underlying premise -- that the high seas and the deep-seabed are part of the "common heritage of mankind" that must be shared through "a just and equitable economic order," with special regard for the needs of developing countries -- has been a lightning rod for clashes between rich and poor nations. It is also at the heart of the dispute at the United Nations.
 
Share of Mining Benefits
 The talks, which included five days of closed-door consultations here that ended on Aug. 6, are focused on the one part of the treaty that Mr. Reagan refused to accept, and about which developed and developing nations still heatedly disagree: Section 11. It would create a global collective to allow developing nations to share in the benefits of mining the deep-sea floor for minerals like manganese, cobalt, nickel and copper.
Developing nations regard the idea of a global mining consortium not only as a source of funds to help their economies, but also as a symbol of good will by the industrialized countries.
But the concept was rankling to President Reagan and many members of Congress, who at the height of tensions with the Soviet Union, saw the mining provisions as an effort by developing nations to impose Soviet-inspired market restrictions on American efforts to mine strategic metals. The Administration also denounced the idea that the United States would have to share not only its profits, but also its seabed mining technology.
Thomas A. Clingan Jr., the American delegate when the Law of the Sea was opened for signature in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on Dec. 10, 1982, had instructions to sign a companion document recalling the history of the negotiations, but not the pact itself.
 
Hoping to Fix Section
 Administration officials caution that President Clinton shares many of the same reservations about the wisdom of the mining provisions as his Republican predecessors. But they believe that if the seabed section can be "fixed," as one put it, a universally recognized treaty that balances the needs of all countries would be in the best interests of the United States -- especially from a military perspective.
Pentagon officials like Rear Adm. William L. Schachte Jr., the Defense Department's representative for ocean policy, say the treaty's provisions upholding the right to conduct high-seas military maneuvers and freedom of passage through strategic sea routes are vital to United States security. Moreover, he and other experts say, the treaty is itself a readily recognizable symbol of international order.
"If you look at the Persian Gulf situation, for example, we didn't have problems with Iran or Oman in using the Strait of Hormuz, because they recognized that the language of the treaty was clear," Admiral Schachte said. "By the same token, we don't deal with Spain or Morocco when we go through Gibraltar."
Although a total of 159 nations -- most of them developing countries -- have signed the Law of the Sea, the agreement has yet to come into force, largely because 45 nations, including industrial powers like Britain, Germany and Italy, decided to follow the American lead and refused to ratify it.
Despite this, the Law of the Sea has been widely treated as if it was legally enforceable, or "customary" under international law. It is, for instance, the basis for decisions by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which handles many maritime disputes.
 
Guarantee Against Changes
 Administration officials and nongovernmental experts on the Law of the Sea assert that while the treaty is useful in its present form as customary law, an agreement approved by the United States Senate and a broad mix of industrial and developing nations would be far preferable because it would be impervious to sudden changes in the international political and economic landscape.
Former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson, who served in the Kennedy, Nixon and Ford Administrations before he became President Jimmy Carter's chief sea-law negotiator in 1977, said the Pentagon's most compelling reason for favoring universal application of the treaty has been the tendency of many coastal nations -- most of them friendly to the United States -- to impose unilateral restrictions on navigation in their territorial waters, a phenomenon he and other experts call "creeping jurisdiction."
"The reason the Pentagon is so concerned that the Law of the Sea be universally set down is not because we lack the military muscle to force our way through waters that have become subject to exaggerated jurisdiction of territorial seas," said Mr. Richardson, who has been promoting acceptance of the treaty. "It is because most of these waters are controlled by friendly countries, and we don't want to have to use muscle to exercise our rights where friendly countries are concerned."
Negotiators from both developed and developing countries say there is no better time to discuss revisions in the mining provisions. With the Soviet Union gone and world metal prices in decline, there is recognition that the treaty language on mining, which includes a call for a global mining collective, needs to reflect the global shift toward market-driven economies.
They also acknowledge that the issues are more abstract than ever, since the seabed mining business -- which seemed like a multi-trillion-dollar boom waiting to happen when the treaty was being negotiated two decades ago -- is unlikely to make any economic sense until well into the next century, when land-based sources of strategic minerals like nickel and manganese are expected to dwindle.
 
Urgency Is Seen
 There is an element of urgency surrounding the talks, diplomats say. With the treaty just 4 short of the necessary 60 ratifying nations, the Law of the Sea may finally become legally binding sometime in 1994. But if there is no agreement on the seabed provisions before then, the disputed mining section will become law as it stands, and the task of ever finding a compromise on Section 11 will become trickier, since the procedures for altering a treaty in force are far more difficult.
Moreover, without a seabed mining compromise, control of the process involved in altering the treaty would be in the hands of developing countries -- some of them, like Iraq and Cuba, openly hostile to the United States.
Many diplomats say they are optimistic that agreement can be found when the talks resume in November. "I think we are headed for a satisfactory solution," said Satya N. Nandan, a Fijian whose consensus-building during the earlier talks has helped make him a key figure again two decades later.

HEADLINE: Banks Said To Be Freer In Lending

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
In a strong sign that the credit crunch may be easing, banks have become noticeably more willing to lend to businesses, including small companies, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Bank executives surveyed by the Fed said they had relaxed their terms and requirements for a wide variety of loans. Even as standards for commercial real estate loans stayed restrictive, the bank executives reported what the Fed called a "fairly significant net easing" of standards and terms for commercial loans.
 
A Broad-Based Shift
 About a fifth of the respondents in the August survey eased standards for approving loans for medium and large businesss. And about 12 percent eased standards for small borrowers. 
 What is more, banks lowered the cost of loans to businesses, according to the Fed's quarterly survey of lending officers at 78 domestic and foreign banks with branches around the country. From 30 percent to 40 percent scaled back the cost of credit lines for medium to large companies; 15 to 20 percent did so for small ones.
Banks' lending to businesses shrank sharply toward the end of the 1980's and has stayed low, a trend that many experts cite as one reason for the sluggish recovery from the recession. While bankers generally said that they had had little demand for loans in a soft economy, business executives, especially those in New England, contended that credit had been hard to get since tough lending standards took hold after the banking industry's difficulties in the 1980's.
 
'An Enormous Change'
 "We've been sitting on the edge of our seats waiting for this to happen, and it's finally happened," Harvey Rosenblum, research director at the Dallas Federal Reserve, said of the survey's findings. "It's an enormous change."
Noting that the survey in May had suggested a change in attitudes was under way, Frank N. Newman, the Treasury's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, said, "Having a second quarter confirming a general direction in lending attitudes is important."
Federal Reserve officials attributed the shift in bankers' psychology to changes in the economic and banking environment.
"The economy is on a slow upward track, property values have stabilized and there's more equity available for small businesses to make the hurdles," said Marvin Goodfriend, research director at the Richmond Federal Reserve. "Also, bank capital positions have improved, and they are no doubt in a better position to take on new loans."
When interest rates were coming down, banks poured billions of dollars into government securities. That has become one catalyst for the attitude shift, Mr. Rosenblum said, because a pending rule will require banks to use market-value accounting for their investment portfolio, forcing them to revalue their assets frequently to reflect changes in the value of bonds.
"It makes the true underlying risk of investing in government securities manifest," Mr. Rosenblum said. "As a result it narrows the perceived risk spread between lending to a small-business customer on the one hand and investing in a 7- to 10-year Treasury note on the other."
The other striking finding in the Fed's bank lending survey is that the White House initiative in March to break the credit crunch, the Credit Availability Program, seems to have had little to do with the shift in lending attitudes and practices.
"The survey responses suggest that the C.A.P. has not had a substantial effect on the supply of credit to small and medium-sized businesses, although many respondents expect it to do so in the future," the Fed reported.
One reason: Just 4 banks out of 48 eligible to participate in the initiative's so-called minimal-documentation loan program have done so thus far.
 
Other Influences Cited
 The apparently tepid response to the overall program came as no surprise to the many analysts who maintained that the weak economy, the fragile capital position of banks and the poor financial condition of many small businesses -- rather than overzealous regulation -- was to blame for the lack of business lending.
But Mr. Newman, who worked with the Federal Reserve last spring to draft the initiative, said: "The great impact of this program is still to come. Some of the important regulatory revisions weren't issued until June. It takes time for bankers to receive them, analyze the changes and put them into effect."
Most banks have not yet gone through a bank examination cycle under the new regimen, Mr. Newman noted. "As each bank gets its examination report, it will see a reflection of the revised regulations in concrete terms," he said. "In the real world, that's got to be part of the psychological effect."

HEADLINE: Stabbing, a Motorcycle Crash And a Young Murder-Suicide

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARFIELD, N.J., Aug. 27

 BODY:
He was 20 and she was only 17, bound together by a friendship that started in Poland, their native country, and grew into a trans-Atlantic romance.
Only hours before the young woman was to return to Poland to resume her high school studies, the relationship ended, the authorities say, in a murder-suicide early today. 
 Did the deaths grow out of sorrow or anger over the young couple's impending separation? "We have no idea what the motive was," said Frank Puccio, the First Assistant Bergen County Prosecutor.
What they do know, he said, is that Renata Bioas was stabbed to death in a converted apartment above the garage at her boyfriend's home. Mr. Puccio said she was stabbed several times in the neck and upper body, between 1 and 2 A.M. today.
 
Motorcycle Slams Into Wall
 About 2:30 A.M., her boyfriend, Tomasz Szczech, died instantly when his motorcycle slammed into the brick wall of a two-story apartment house on a curve on River Street about a mile from his home.
Mr. Puccio said county detectives believed that Mr. Szczech killed his girlfriend and then intentionally crashed the motorcycle into the wall.
No suicide notes were found in the apartment where Ms. Bioas was slain or in the home of Mr. Szczech's parents on Orchard Street, he said. Mr. Puccio also said the authorities were trying to learn about their activities in the hours before their deaths.
Ms. Bioas had been visiting at the Szczech home in this blue-collar city in southwestern Bergen County since July 14, Mr. Puccio said. It was the second trip she had made from Poland to see Mr. Szczech after his family moved here in early 1991, Mr. Puccio said. Mr. Szczech had traveled to Poland to see her once, he said.
Mr. Szczech graduated from Garfield High School in June. He was unemployed and planned to seek a job after the summer, Mr. Puccio said.
The young man's father, Eugene, discovered Ms. Bioas's body shortly after 6 A.M., after he awoke, noticed the door to the garage apartment ajar and went to investigate, Mr. Puccio said. She was found in a bedroom off the apartment's living room. Two kitchen knives believed to be the murder weapons were found in the apartment, Mr. Puccio said.
At that point, Mr. Szczech was unaware his son had been killed in the motorcycle crash a few hours earlier, Mr. Puccio said. Moments after he called the Garfield police headquarters to tell them of the murder, other officers arrived at his home to tell him of his son's death, Mr. Puccio said. His son's identity had been traced through the motorcycle's registration.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines as Traders Test Fed's Will to Support It

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen yesterday as investors tested how far the American currency would drop before the Federal Reserve intervened in the market.
The dollar also fell against the German mark. 
 In New York, the dollar ended at 103.85 yen, down from 104.40 yen on Thursday. It also ended at 1.6640 marks, down from 1.6675 marks.
Gold prices recovered somewhat from Thursday's losses. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery, the active near-term futures contract, gained $1.30 an ounce, to $370.30. It had fallen $4.70 on Thursday. In New York, the Republic National Bank quoted spot gold at $369.25 an ounce, up $1.25.
The dollar weakened against the yen during Asian trading despite intervention by the Bank of Japan to try to halt the yen's rise. Later, the dollar strengthened in New York trading after David Mullins Jr., the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, said the American central bank would not let the dollar slide sharply.
"That got the market all excited," said Mike McKeever, assistant vice president of Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. But, he added, investors soon realized that Mr. Mullins was speaking in general terms and was not indicating any imminent action. They began to sell dollars again and buy back yen.
Traders said the dollar was being sold because investors were testing how far it could fall, and because many traders were looking to get rid of dollars because of weakness in the American economy.
The dollar continued to fall against the German mark a day after the Bundesbank of Germany surprised the markets by not cutting its key interest rate. The mark was pushed up yesterday when the Bundesbank's chief economist, Otmar Issing, said he foresaw no change in German monetary policy.
Al Jirkovsky, managing director of Continental Bank in Chicago, said, "It got people feeling, 'Well, all right, in the short term the marks are strong.' "
The dollar did strengthen against the British pound as investors sold pounds to lock in profits from the currency's rise on Thursday. In New York, the pound slipped to $1.5035, from $1.5090 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Consumer Optimism Reported Up Slightly

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Consumer optimism about the economy rose slightly in August from July, according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey, released yesterday. But the gain was small -- from 77 in July to 77.3 in August -- and economists said it did not represent the beginning of a trend.
William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the rise did not mean "the cloud covering the economy has been removed." 
 An increase indicates consumers are becoming more optimistic about the economy. Two weeks ago, the university reported a preliminary August reading of 75.4.
Last December's index was 91. The base is 100, set in 1966. The record high, 101, was set in March 1984 and the record low, 51.7, in April 1980.
The university also reported that its August index of consumer expectations, which measures how people feel about their future, rose to 65.8 from 64.7 in July. The early reading was 64.5. But the August index of current economic conditions fell to 95.1 from 96.2 in July. The preliminary reading had been 92.5.
Through the first two quarters of this year the economy was growing at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent; last year's average quarterly rate was 3.1 percent.
Economists expect the Commerce Department next week to revise second-quarter gross domestic product growth to about 1 percent from 1.6 percent reported earlier.

HEADLINE: Wetlands: Will Clinton Be Bush?

 BODY:
Land-use issues are always contentious, none more so than that of wetlands. The Clinton Administration's new wetlands policy is not without unnerving flaws, including a misguided provision to turn some enforcement duties over to the Department of Agriculture. That needs to be reversed, but otherwise the new policy makes good sense on both environmental and political grounds.
It keeps most of the important protections for the 100 million or so wetland acres that scientists agree are genuinely worth saving. And by striking a reasonable balance between preservation and economic growth, it is likely to remove some of the heat from an issue that led to doctrinal warfare within the Bush Administration and nearly made a liar of Mr. Bush himself. 
 "Wetlands" is a broad term applied to ecosystems ranging from prairie potholes to vast tidal marshes. For most of America's history, wetlands were treated as disposable assets to be diked, drained, drilled and turned into cropland, shopping malls, subdivisions and oilfields. The result was the destruction of more than half the 230 million wetland acres that the first settlers found in the 48 contiguous states.
In 1972, Congress finally got the message scientists had been sending for years: Wetlands are valuable, virtually irreplaceable biological systems deserving protection. They filter pollutants, replenish water supplies, nourish organisms vital to the food chain and provide habitat for wildlife. The Clean Water Act, passed that year, required anyone seeking to fill a wetland to obtain a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers and submit to review by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The law slowed the loss of wetlands. But it suffered from indifferent enforcement and the failure of various agencies to agree on what a wetland was. In 1987 Government experts finally arrived at a common definition: A wetland is any ground that has mucky or peat-based soils, nourishes specified plant life and is saturated at least seven days a year. Mr. Bush pledged in the 1988 campaign to stick with that definition, and actually improved on it with a slightly stricter definition in 1989.
At which point the farmers, developers and oil interests rose up in protest and dispatched their lobbyists marching to the White House. Facing re-election, Mr. Bush caved in, allowing Vice President Dan Quayle's slapdash Council on Competitiveness to issue a definition of wetlands that, taken literally, would have removed parts of the Florida Everglades from protection. Only the resistance of William Reilly, the E.P.A. chief, saved the day.
The Clinton policy reaffirms the 1987 definition. If administered uniformly and strictly -- always a big if with the Corps of Engineers -- that should be enough to hold the line against further erosion until the National Academy of Sciences produces a comprehensive definition next year. Sensibly, the White House has also reversed a last-minute Bush order exempting 1.7 million acres of fragile Alaskan wetlands from protection.
Meanwhile, the plan preserves a Bush Administration exemption for 53 million acres of wetlands that were drained and converted to farmland before 1985. Much of the political uproar came from legitimately aggrieved farmers who feared they would be forced to give back to nature lands they had already cultivated.
But that's enough of a bow to agricultural sensibilities. One dangerous part of the Clinton proposal makes the Soil Conservation Service the lead Federal agency for identifying wetlands on agricultural acreage. The service's specialists do know a lot about soil, but the department they work for, Agriculture, has a bumpy environmental record. The department's Forest Service, for example, has only now begun to control its appetite for ravaging the national forests. Mr. Clinton should redirect the responsibility for agricultural wetlands to the Corps and the E.P.A.
The package includes an Executive Order pledging "no net loss" of wetlands. Those were George Bush's words, too. Let's hope Mr. Clinton's resolve is more durable.

HEADLINE: 'The West' Is Only a Flag of Convenience

SERIES: STRATEGIC ALLIANCES: Second of three articles

BYLINE: By Owen Harries; Owen Harries is editor of The National Interest. This article is excerpted from an essay in the September-October issue of Foreign Affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Recent proposals that NATO should make guarantees or grant membership to the new states of East and Central Europe reflect a philosophical inertia, an unwillingness to jettison old concepts and modes of thought in the face of utterly changed circumstances.
Proposals for what amounts to a new NATO are based on a most questionable premise: that "the West" continues to exist as a political and military entity. Over the last half century or so, most of us have come to think of "the West" as a given, a natural presence and one that is here to stay. It is a way of thinking that is not only wrong in itself, but is virtually certain to lead to mistaken policies. 
 The political "West" is not a natural construct but a highly artificial one. It took the presence of a life-threatening, overtly hostile "East" to bring it into existence and to maintain its unity. It is extremely doubtful whether it can now survive the disappearance of that enemy.
The countries of the West share vast commonalities: history, culture, and political values and institutions. It is in this -- the glory that was Greece and grandeur that was Rome, Christianity, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the French and Industrial revolutions, representative democracy, the rule of law, the market economy -- that many find the basis of Western unity.
But all these common features had existed long before the cold war, yet they had never created or sustained a united West before the appearance of a shared and formidable enemy. A common civilization is one thing, political unity is another. In fact, relationships among the countries of the West have been marked by division and by particularly bloody internecine conflicts throughout their history.
Something approaching a united "West" has been spoken of only three times in modern history: in 1917-18, 1941-45 and the cold war years. In the first two instances, the term is a complete misnomer, since the enemies -- Germany and Austria-Hungary in the first case, Germany and Italy in the second -- were full-fledged members of the West. The conflicts could more accurately be described (and sometimes have been) as Western civil wars.
But if one stretches the point and allows all three as examples, it becomes clear that the notion of a political "West" is one that has been attractive to Europeans only when some or all of their countries have been in great and imminent danger. Desperation and fear have been its parents, not natural affinities. They have been the forces that have driven Europeans to unite among themselves and to associate with the U.S. under the banner of "the West."
In the absence of an overriding threat that one is incapable of handling on one's own -- and sometimes even in the presence of such a threat -- the inclination on both sides of the Atlantic has been to emphasize not unity, but the difference and incompatibility of Europe and America. Thus, even before final victory in 1945, the prevailing model of the political world had become that of the "Big Three," with Franklin Roosevelt more suspicious of Britain and its empire than of the Soviet Union. Immediately after victory, Harry Truman abruptly ended lend-lease aid to Europe without any obvious concern for the overall well-being of "the West."
As it was at the beginning of the cold war, so it was at the end. Two years ago, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, what we immediately started to hear propounded on both sides of the Atlantic -- and what we were still hearing from President Clinton during the July Tokyo summit -- was a tripartite or tripolar version of the world, with Europe, the U.S. and Japan. Once free of a Soviet threat many Europeans immediately began anticipating, often with ill-concealed glee, a post-Maastricht United Europe that would supplant the U.S. as the dominant economic, and ultimately political, force in the world.
Subsequently, of course, the momentum toward European unity has faltered and Maastricht has become a divisive rather than uniting symbol. The European economy has gone into what looks increasingly like a prolonged structural recession.
As all these things have happened, and as Europe has proved embarrassingly incapable of dealing with the Bosnian crisis, European confidence that it can dispense with U.S. leadership and operate as an independent force has drained away, and we have been hearing more, again, of "the West." But if and when things improve significantly for Europe, we should anticipate another reversal.
If European needs and insecurities constitute one condition for the continuation of "the West," there is also an obvious second condition: U.S. willingness to respond to those needs. That, too, has in the past required a deep sense of danger -- danger to American interests -- to overcome America's moralistic distaste for European power politics.
In 1917 it took a lot of German provocation before the New World finally did come in to redress the balance of the Old. In 1941 it took Pearl Harbor and Hitler's foolish declaration of war on the U.S. to produce a decisive, if involuntary, intervention. And from 1946 to 1949 the rapid spread of Soviet power into Central Europe provided the incentive, after the U.S. had initially responded to the end of World War II with instant and comprehensive demobilization. Absent a sense of danger, America's aloofness has been as marked as Europe's assumption of independence.
The most powerful argument for substantial American withdrawal from the kind of serious, sustained and expensive participation necessary to maintain "the West" as something more than a reassuring fiction is the urgent pull of domestic matters, long neglected or relegated to subordinate status during the cold war. One does not have to be an isolationist or a "declinist" to believe that the time has come to alter the country's priorities in favor of domestic concerns.
To the extent that such attitudes prevail and such advice is taken, they are inimical to a united and purposeful "West," which requires an active, outgoing and engaged America. There is good reason to believe that in the Clinton era such attitudes will prevail. President Clinton has an ambitious domestic agenda and little interest in or feel for foreign policy. He has equipped himself with a team that, to put it mildly and politely, is unlikely to press him hard to adopt ambitious, activist policies abroad, except in the area of trade.
If Bosnia is any indication, one can expect that in Mr. Clinton's Washington "the West" and the U.N. will be used as devices not to facilitate action but to justify inaction. The U.S. wants to take decisive action, it will be claimed in various situations, but it must be multilateral action and a proper international mandate must be given. If these conditions cannot be fulfilled, then the U.S. will, regrettably but justifiably, do nothing.
In practice, whenever it has looked remotely as if the Europeans might agree to a U.S. proposal on Bosnia, there has been a rapid backing off on Washington's part. After the character in Dylan Thomas's "Under Milk Wood," this rationalization of passivity might be labeled the "Nogood Boyo" approach to foreign policy: "I want to be good, but nobody'll let me."
The concept of "the West" is likely to revert to what it has been for most of the past: a concept of last resort, held in reserve for when things go seriously bad and individual countries or restricted alliances are unable to cope on their own. One must assume -- unless one has come to accept the fatuous nonsense that war as an institution is dead -- that such circumstances will again return to haunt us one day, perhaps sooner rather than later.
If those who speak of the "Clash of Civilizations" (Samuel Huntington) and of "the West and the Rest" (Kishore Mahbubani) are right, the idea of a political "West" may achieve greater authenticity in the struggles of the future than it did even in the days of the cold war. But meanwhile the notion has lost much of its definition and raison d'etre.
W. H. Auden once wrote of Brussels, the city that subsequently became the headquarters of the European Community and NATO, and thus of the West:
Its formula escapes you; it has lost
The certainty that constitutes a thing.
For the time being, at least, these words can properly be applied to the West itself.

HEADLINE: Barneys Bets the Store

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr; Steve Lohr is a business reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Gene Pressman is like an expectant father, anxious but proud, as he threads his way through the construction activity at his family's new store in uptown Manhattan. Platoons of workers are lugging Sheetrock and lumber, power tools whine and electrical coils hang every few feet. On a crisp June day, less than three months before the scheduled opening of this new Barneys on Sept. 8, the nine-floor store is still very much a work in progress. But as he climbs an unfinished staircase here, or ducks under a workman's ladder there, Pressman is familiar with every floor, every fixture, every piece of furniture that is on its hurried way.
On the first floor of the women's department, perfumes will be in the back instead of the front. "I hate it when you get spritzed when you walk into a store," he says. Pressman likes aquariums, so there will be three big ones. He's a boxer, and the store's ninth-floor health club will have a ring. He's also a golfer, so maybe the putting green will come later. 
 The look of the store, at Madison Avenue and 61st Street, will be modern, open, spacious with large windows on every floor. Whites, grays and beiges will be the dominant colors, set off by forests of exposed wood -- 40 varieties, from beech to sycamore. Most of the furniture will be custom-made. Each selection, each judgment of taste, is personal. Gene Pressman, the 42-year-old eldest son, made many of the choices, but seven other members of the family -- parents Fred and Phyllis, brother Robert, sisters Liz and Nancy, wife Bonnie, and Robert's wife, Holly -- has his or her personal imprint. "We're doing this like it's our home," Gene Pressman says. Some home. More like a $100 million shrine for a family of workaholics.
The Pressmans' Madison Avenue showcase, sheathed in French limestone, occupying much of a city block, is the largest new specialty store to be built in Manhattan since the Depression -- one of the most ambitious retailing ventures in the history of New York. Its arrival comes at a time when people are questioning the future of big stores, especially in New York, and when the weakened economy makes selling pricey, high-fashion merchandise a struggle. For the Pressmans, one of the last family dynasties in American retailing, the uptown store is their biggest bet since the business was founded in 1923, as a small men's shop at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street.
Is this a shrewd against-the-grain move, or an act of hubris?
The answer will not be known soon, probably not for a year or so after the Madison Avenue store opens, as the novelty of a major new shopping destination wears off. And its success will be measured largely by how much pain the Barneys Madison Avenue store inflicts on its main rivals in the uptown retailing hub -- Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's.
For years the Pressmans, from their downtown enclave, looked with envy at retailing's Gold Belt, the uptown Manhattan shopping district, roughly running from 50th Street into the 60's, and extending from Fifth Avenue east to Bloomingdale's on Lexington Avenue. "We've had this underdog mentality, of not really being appreciated by the establishment uptown," Gene Pressman explains. Talk to the Pressmans, any of them, and you soon hear the family doctrine. Uptown, the stores get much of their business just by being there, but downtown, Barneys had to be something special, to get people to go out of their way. "It's made us better merchants," Gene says.
Indeed, the ethos of the merchant is another tenet of the family faith, the merchant as retailing's artisan skilled in the selection, production and display of goods. They believe that the best merchants win in fashion retailing, and that they are the best merchants, sticking to their last when others strayed. During the 1980's, many stores turned from their merchant roots, distracted by the financial shenanigans of that decade -- takeovers, leveraged buyouts, fast-buck rascals. The legacy, the Pressmans say, is too many corporate-style homogenized stores with look-alike merchandise. "Of course, there are a lot of stores uptown. But there'll be only one Barneys," Gene says. "We're different."
The daily spectacle of consumption in uptown Manhattan, the lucrative heart and showcase of the nation's fashion business, is probably unmatched anywhere in the world. Every day, the area teems with affluent tourists, well-heeled New Yorkers and suburbanites who make their way past the beggars and the dirt outside into the soothing opulence of the designer boutiques and specialty stores, replete with uniformed greeters and personal shoppers.
As a business, fashion retailing is a high-wire world, where the risks are almost always great but so are the rewards for the successful. It is part commerce and part theater because, after all, no one needs designer clothes or luxury baubles. They have to want them. If they do, the high prices -- and hefty profits for the retailer -- don't matter much. If not, the stuff can scarcely be given away. Success is highly profitable; failure is devastating, and there is not much middle ground. That is the challenge of fashion retailing, and it is in this context that Barneys is taking the $100 million gamble.
"If they get it right, the Pressmans will have a huge winner on their hands -- the store where everybody goes," says Bud Konheim, chief executive of Nicole Miller Ltd., a fashion apparel maker, with a boutique on Madison Avenue. "But if it's not perfection, if people can take it or leave it a year later, they'll be in trouble."
THE RISE OF THE PRESSMANS IN American retailing is a family saga, and the Madison Avenue store embodies the course chosen by the third generation, Gene Pressman, and his younger brother, Robert, 39. Their vision of the business is a long way from its roots as the humble shop at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street, selling cut-priced men's suits, started by their grandfather Barney Pressman, who died two years ago at age 96. Barney's grubstake was his wife Bertha's engagement ring, which he pawned. (She volunteered it, according to family legend.) His discount-pricing tactics were made for the lean economic times when he was building his business. His son, Fred, added more costly suits and eventually abandoned the discount philosophy as rising incomes and changing life styles translated into higher spending on men's clothes.
Fred's sons, Gene and Robert, are pursuing a more aggressive agenda. Under Gene, the fashion merchandiser, Barneys plunged into women's clothes with abandon. He started with a few insurgent racks in 1976, and built it up steadily. Today, the women's sections are half of the company's sales -- only 40 percent in the downtown New York store, but nearly 60 percent in the satellite stores. Women's offerings are intended to be 55 percent of the Madison Avenue store's sales.
The move into women's lines, everyone agrees, was a wise strategic decision, allowing the business to grow, but how well Barneys is doing in women's fashions is widely debated in the industry. As a private company, Barneys can disclose as little as it likes, and it is all the gospel according to the Pressmans. The negative case is mainly anecdotal, derived from a designer whose goods aren't moving at Barneys, from deep markdowns on some merchandise, or from a consultant's noticing a shortage of customers when he tours a few stores. Any conclusions are necessarily tentative. "My sense is that they are not doing as well as planned in women's apparel," says Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a newsletter.
Robert, the family finance and management expert, is the architect of the company's recent expansion in the United States and Japan. He is the one who put together the crucial deal with the Isetan Company, a big Japanese retailer, which is providing most of the $250 million in expansion funds.
So Barneys has invested and grown, even as many other fashion retailers, saddled with debt or pressed by corporate owners, have retrenched. In the last five years, the family business has opened 15 stores, in Chicago, Houston, Seattle, Tokyo, Yokohama and elsewhere. The Pressmans say that sales of the branch stores are running 13 percent ahead of last year, and that every Barneys store in the chain is profitable. Outsiders are skeptical. "I can't believe they don't have a dog or two in the manger," observes Alan G. Millstein, a New York retail consultant.
The new Madison Avenue store is much bigger and more costly than all the others. Fred Pressman, the 70-year-old patriarch and chairman, sums up the stake: "Our whole future."
IF THE UPTOWN GOLD BELT IS among the most lucrative of the world's shopping districts, it is also one of the most competitive and aggressive, crowded with specialty stores of every kind. "Barneys is going to come in with guns blazing," says Arie L. Kopelman, the president of Chanel Inc. "And there is no question it will be an all-out battle for market share."
To gird for the fray, the established stores have been sprucing up for a year. Bergdorf Goodman overhauled the fifth floor of its women's store and stocked it with slightly less expensive clothing intended to appeal to younger, trendier people -- the kind for whom the Barneys formula has worked. Saks Fifth Avenue has just completed a renovation of its men's store here. And the Bloomingdale's flagship store has installed a shiny new set of white marble steps. By the end of the year, the five women's bathrooms in the store will be redone. "That hasn't happened in 20 years," notes Michael Gould, the Bloomingdale's chairman.
The uptown doyens insist that these improvements were planned all along and have nothing to do with Barneys. But all of them are wary. "There will be an effect when a new guy comes into the neighborhood," says Burton Tansky, Bergdorf's chairman. "But the real question is how long it will last -- how well Barneys will do six months or a year after the store opens, once the curiosity factor subsides."
The competition will probably be fierce in store hours as well. Breaking ranks with many of the uptown stores, Barneys will be open from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M., Monday through Friday; 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. on Saturday, and noon to 6 P.M. on Sunday. This could well make shopping a greater part of uptown night life.
The stars of fashion retailing are the leading designers, and Barneys has engaged in a campaign of stroking, threats and even legal action to try to get the designers it wants uptown. Relations between designers and major stores are always tricky, a blend of personalities, money and fashion trends, which explains why the business is so volatile. When designers are hot, stores court them shamelessly with parties, trips and favors. When sales slip, designers have to beg store presidents to carry them for another season.
Barneys is known for sharply "editing" its purchases from designer collections, meaning it might buy a handful of dresses from a designer one season and racks upon racks the next. Designers, of course, would prefer more consistent buying. Downtown the designers had almost no choice but to deal with Barneys. But uptown they do. One designer, who is not selling to the Madison Avenue store, explained, "Barneys's purchases have been so small compared to Bergdorf's." So some well-known designers -- Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, Isaac Mizrahi and Karl Lagerfeld, for example -- will not put their collections in the new Barneys store. But others -- Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Hermes, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Jil Sander, Azzedine Alaia among them -- will.
There is no love lost when a designer defects. In a transparent reference to Ralph Lauren, who has also pulled out of the downtown Barneys, Gene Pressman declares, "Our notion of classic isn't to bottle the WASP ethic and throw every English thing you can lay your hands on into the store. You know who I mean, don't you?" The heads of other stores sound the same when it happens to them. Barneys cut an exclusive deal with Azzedine Alaia, who had sold for years to Charivari but won't for the fall season. Of Alaia, a French designer of figure-hugging tube dresses, Jon Weiser, president of Charivari Ltd., says, "He's very 80's . . . and had not been selling well in the last few years."
The heated words come after what are inevitably coldblooded decisions. Ralph Toledano, president of Karl Lagerfeld S.A. in Paris, is one who balked at going into the new Barneys store, and his reasons are not untypical of the others. Lagerfeld already sells to Bergdorf's, Saks and Henri Bendel. Selling to a fourth store uptown, Toledano figured, would spread the line too thin, undermining its exclusive image. "And right or wrong, we are loyal," he explains. "You can't drop a store just because Barneys is opening a store uptown." Toledano describes Gene Pressman as a "personal friend." But when Toledano made his decision known, Barneys stopped purchasing Lagerfeld clothes for its downtown store. "Friendship is one thing, and business is another," Toledano observes philosophically.
The most celebrated conflict was between Barneys and the Italian designer Giorgio Armani, whose full men's collection was first brought to the United States by the Pressmans in 1975. Armani is already carried at Bergdorf's, Saks and Bloomingdale's, and the designer also has his own store in the neighborhood. So he has been adamant about not wanting to sell his top designer label to Barneys uptown as well. But he will, reluctantly, because a Swiss tribunal has ruled that, under the terms of a 1979 contract, he must. Touring the uptown store, Gene Pressman gestures toward the 6,000-square-foot area given to the Armani collection, with the largest Armani men's space of any store in the world: "It seems only fitting," he says, pointedly. "We were the first to bring him to this country."
All this made for high drama in the rag trade. And an Armani adviser thinks the matter is not entirely settled, noting that after the Swiss ruling the Italian designer stopped selling his top line to the stores in Dallas and Houston: "If Armani really doesn't want to sell to Barneys uptown, all he's got to do is ship it late." Welcome to the trench warfare of the fashion business, behind the forced smiles on the runway.
IN APPEARANCE AND STYLE, GENE Pressman and brother Robert seem worlds apart. When you meet for the first time, Robert may be wearing a navy blue suit (Barneys private label), silk tie, French cuffs and tortoise-shell glasses. He presents you his business card, English on one side and Japanese on the other. Gene offers no card. "I don't have one," he says, as a point of honor. He wears jeans, a white button-down shirt with no tie, penny loafers and white socks. His blazer is thrown over a chair. The odd couple of retailing. The Gene and Bob Show.
Robert Pressman, who shares the title with his brother of co-president and co-chief executive, has an M.B.A. He loves to explain financial details by scribbling formulas on napkins, and rarely goes anywhere without his Apple Powerbook laptop computer, the executive status symbol of the moment. When he talks he speaks in terms of sales-per-square-foot, debt ratios and market research. Gene went to film school and worked as a gofer in Hollywood before joining the family business. When Gene talks -- which is most of the time -- it is about creativity, energy and passion. "Fashion is Hollywood -- it really is," he says.
Gene Pressman is the self-made star of Barneys, and he is the driving force behind the Madison Avenue store. Ever since he pushed the family business into the fast-moving, high-risk realm of women's fashions, the move uptown into the heart of the fashion district was all but inevitable, with only the timing in doubt. Gene Pressman is both charming and quick-tempered, flamboyant and at times wildly profane. He often bullies suppliers, in between his jabs of charm and humor. His tirades can reduce subordinates to tears. And he has a notoriously short attention span. "My eye's drifting off the ball now," is his way of saying he's tired of a discussion.
With men, Gene Pressman is arm-round-waist, pat-on-the-back, looking for macho camaraderie that seems a bit strained. "C'mon, let's get loaded together," he says over lunch. But loaded he has no intention of getting. He had only two light beers with his man-of-the 90's salad.
The glamour and style of the women's fashion business clearly appeals to Gene Pressman. But he also likes women, and says so in ways not likely to endear him to feminists. Admiring the sidewalk traffic alongside the Madison Avenue store after lunch, he said, "God, there's a lot of beautiful women in New York" -- one of his tamer renderings of that sentiment.
"Gene is one of the few straight guys in the business," says Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, "and he enjoys it."
Much of retailing, it is said, boils down to understanding life styles and spotting trends. Over the years, Gene Pressman has certainly done plenty of field research. He is by nature a participant, trying what was hip and trendy ever since Woodstock in 1969. "I got so wasted," he recalled fondly. "And wasn't the music great?" Later, he sampled Manhattan night life, knew the Andy Warhol crowd, took in the scene of Studio 54 and the like.
He lives in Bugsy Siegel's former house, a Tudor mansion in Westchester County, overlooking Long Island Sound, which he redid to accommodate a 14,000-bottle wine cellar and a garage with vintage cars. Guests, also clearly a carefully edited selection, get tours past the '62 Aston Martin in the garage and the expensive wines in the cellar. Gene is married these days with two children. He drives fast, but the rest of his fast-lane life may simply be a fond memory.
Though he's wealthy and surrounds himself with expensive toys, he clings to his version of 60's counterculture values. He pulls his white shirt away from his neck to show that it is monogrammed, but on the inside. "How about that for reverse snobbery?" he says.
Just how his eclectic interests and appetite for the good life have fostered an instinct for what the youngish, fashion-conscious customer wants is unclear. But friends and colleagues insist that he has it. "Because he has all these sides, he's not just a retailer," observes Peter Marino, the designer-architect and longtime collaborator with the Pressmans, who is doing the Madison Avenue store. "Gene's the trend setter in the family. Isn't that the future of Barneys, being the trend setter?"
Pressman burnishes his image as a laid-back, rebel executive. One line making the rounds at Barneys is that Gene will conduct business from the ninth-floor health club. Probably not. Those who know him best says that, despite the image, he follows the sales figures closely, receiving the "readings," store-by-store reports throughout the day, even on weekends, just as his father Fred and Robert do. Gene's wife, Bonnie, a former model, whom he met after spotting her on the runway and who now runs shoes, accessories and cosmetics, adds: "Much as Gene might pretend that he's more interested in golf or boxing, the business is his life. It's the family's life."
IN 1986, GENE PRESSMAN lured Simon Doonan, a young Englishman who had done design work in films and for Diana Vreeland's "Costumes of Royal India" fashion exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum. Doonan created Barneys's edgy, attention-grabbing windows, from Christmas trees with condoms as ornaments to the store's signature celebrity spoofs of Madonna and Margaret Thatcher, in studded black leather. "It's not so much to be shocking or daring," Doonan explains, "but to turn the windows into sort of a magazine with ideas, entertaining ideas."
"I have an aversion for the kind of preppy ideology -- the absolute lack of any twist," he says.
Gene Pressman shares that view for the most part. But theirs is a partnership of complementary skills, with Doonan the sophisticate and Pressman the arbiter. "Gene's strength is gut-level responses," Doonan says. "He's a great yardstick for whether things -- a window, an ad, a look -- are communicating."
Pressman's eye for the avant-garde was evident in designers he brought to America in the early 1980's like Rei Kawakubo's Comme des Garcons, known for its austere all-black "funereal look" and, later, for eccentric fabric combinations and oddly cut clothes from Japan, and Azzedine Alaia from France. Moving with the times again, he will put nearly two dozen cutting-edge designers in the Madison Avenue store like the Belgian deconstructionists Martin Margiela and Dries van Noten, and the Italians Demetra and Keila Jedrik. Margiela and van Noten spearheaded deconstructionism in fashion, with its signature unfinished seams, a blatant revolt against the showy luxury of the 80's, and Demetra and Jedrik incorporate similar elements of simplicity, austerity and minimalism -- except the price tags, of course.
How well this will pay the rent in a big store uptown is uncertain. Donna Karan's collection will be in the uptown store but she concedes: "Gene has really reached the avant-garde customer. The Barneys style is modern, artsy, downtown. It's a very strong point of view. It's not for everybody."
Nothing is, of course, but will the appeal be wide enough? As a guide, Barneys hired a consultant to study the differences between uptown and downtown customer tastes. The March 1992 study indeed found that the Barneys downtown customer is younger (median age: under 40) than the customer at Bergdorf's and the other big stores uptown (over 40). The uptown-downtown split, again, confirmed the conventional wisdom that the uptown crowd buys a greater percentage of classic styles. So "Barneys is fine-tuning their mix of merchandise to reflect the differences uptown," says Walter K. Levy, who did the study.
Fine-tuned perhaps, but Gene Pressman insists the distinctive Barneys look, minimal, unadorned, austere, will travel uptown essentially intact. "People say there's not a lot of color in Barneys's women's clothes, that it's all black, brown, navy and beige. Well, isn't that what women want?"
The downtown store will be pared a bit, mainly consolidating, but, the Pressmans insist, it will not be cut back dramatically or shut down. The Pressman theory, soon to be tested, is that uptown and downtown are remarkably separate markets. So its downtown store, which generates impressive sales of $650 a square foot -- well above the national average for specialty stores but below Saks, Bloomingdale's and Bergdorf's New York sales -- should not suffer greatly from opening another big store 40-some blocks north. Uptown, tourists alone account for roughly one quarter of the shoppers. And market research shows that only a small share of the downtown Barneys store's customers venture there from above 42d Street. This, the Pressmans interpret as opportunity rather than any lack of appeal to the uptown crowd. "That means uptown is a huge untapped market for us," Robert Pressman says. "And that's the reason for the Madison Avenue store."
THE FINANCES BEHIND the expansion are designed to give the family business staying power. It was Robert Pressman's handiwork. In 1988, sensing the limits to Seventh Avenue and 17th Street, the family decided to explore beyond. The decision to proceed was made with a studied disregard for economic cycles. It came right after the stock market crash in October 1987, which hurt Barneys, as it did other luxury retailers.
Robert came up with a plan with two key elements: avoid debt, which proved the undoing of many expansion-minded retailers in the 80's, and find someone else's money. That meant finding a joint-venture partner, and Pressman hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to look. Goldman Sachs came up with a list of some 30 potential corporate investors from America, Europe and Japan. Pressman quickly winnowed them down to a few. He wanted a strategic partner, not an arms-length investor, and he turned to Japan, which has companies that take the long view and retail markets Barneys wanted to crack.
In November 1988, Robert, Gene and Fred went east with a 60-page prospectus. The Pressmans quickly settled on Isetan, Japan's sixth-largest retailer, then headed by Kuniyasu Kosuge, a member of the fourth generation of the founding family. Kosuge wanted to move into specialty retailing. "As a cohesive family with a private company, the Pressmans take a very long-term view of the business, and Isetan wanted a truly long-term partner," says Masanori Mochida, a Goldman Sachs partner based in Tokyo. "It was a good fit." The two sides agreed to meet again.
The Pressmans and a few top Isetan executives gathered the following March at a Hawaiian resort. Robert carried in his briefcase the outlines of the Barneys blueprint for expansion, and an estimated price tag, $250 million in capital. In keeping with Japanese business customs, the group first repaired to the nearest golf course. Gene was in his element, but Robert was distinctly not. A water-hazard par-3 hole was particularly memorable. "After I hit about 20 balls in the water, I literally picked the next ball off the tee, ran forward and threw it over the water hazard toward the green," he recalls. "The Japanese thought that was the funniest thing they had ever seen. They couldn't stop laughing."
That night, in a meeting with Isetan's top finance executive that lasted until 2 A.M., Robert Pressman negotiated the deal that is now financing the new Madison Avenue store and others. Isetan puts up the majority of the money, and Isetan and the Pressman family form a 50-50 real-estate partnership. Both sides are paid a fixed rent from the store, and collect a set percentage of the sales. The sales provision means the investors receive a return that moves up or down with the store's fortunes.
It is an equity investment, so the Pressmans aren't beholden to bankers. And Isetan certainly can't be accused of taking a fast-buck attitude: the partnership on the Madison Avenue store is a 499-year agreement. "Now that's long-term," Robert says.
The recession in Japan has battered Isetan, like other big Japanese retailers. Its profits have dropped sharply, and, under pressure, Kosuge has relinquished the presidency though kept the office of honorary chairman. But analysts say that Isetan remains a strong company and that its deal with Barneys does not seem in doubt.
FRED PRESSMAN STANDS IN the first-floor men's department at the Barneys 17th Street store, hunched over an Italian silk tie, stroking it gently. He launches into an instructive monologue about how the high thread count accounts for its velvety feel, the intricacies of the madder dyeing process and the silk mills in Como, Italy, he had just visited. A small, slender man with errant hair and rumpled sport coat, Pressmen has the air of a disheveled elf as he strides purposefully over to the shoe section. "I love English shoes, they have such character," he says, picking up a $300 pair of English brogues and then describing the fine points of last making, the choice of skins for the uppers, the hand finishing and stitching.
Retailing, he says, is "products and merchandise, not merchandising from ledger books, but from the feel of fabric and instinct." In specialty retailing, the big stores all try for exclusive deals with designers, and press manufacturers and craftsmen for custom-made goods. Fred Pressman, by all accounts, has been doing it longer and more skillfully than just about anyone in the men's business -- and his family is following the same approach in the women's departments.
For decades, he has toured the mills and factories in America, England, Scotland, Italy and the Far East, badgering suppliers and cutting deals. "Yes, dealing with Barneys can be difficult," says Walter B. D. Hickey Jr., chairman of the Hickey-Freeman Company, whose men's suits sell for $900 and up. "But their fashion instincts are excellent and they're known for stocking fine merchandise, so our association with Barneys has been good for us."
The new store will feature an additional round of special arrangements with suppliers. A half-dozen English shoemakers, for instance, are doing exclusive collections for the men's department. The Barneys penchant for working closely with suppliers is key to the growth of its private-label business, which has doubled in the last five years, to one third of total sales. For its private-label goods, Barneys buyers often go to the same mills and factories used by designers for men's and women's clothing, shoes and accessories.
"We work with manufacturers to pass more value on to the customers just like Wal-Mart or Ikea do, except we're applying the formula to high-end fashion merchandise," explains Peter Rizzo, the senior vice president for men's merchandising. It enables Barneys to sell high-quality goods for far less than designers, and make a handsome profit, with sales at the downtown Manhattan store and the branches reported 13 percent ahead of last year's levels. With the addition of the Madison Avenue store and a Beverly Hills store, the Pressmans expect the revenues in the next financial year to rise 60 percent to more than $400 million.
Few know the financial plans as well as Charles Bunstine, the chief operating officer, recruited last year from a major accounting firm, Coopers & Lybrand. He describes the target numbers for the Madison Avenue store -- direct selling expenses, sales people per unit of floor space and the like. He then adds, "Hey, all these numbers are neat, but what this is really about is a bet on the instincts of this family."
Win or lose on their new $100 million gamble, the whole family is committed to the business. Phyllis, Fred's wife, runs housewares and gifts; their daughter Liz Pressman Neubardt buys children's clothes; daughter Nancy Pressman Dressler buys women's designer clothes, and even Holly, Bob's wife, who has an M.B.A. and was a banker, now runs the boys department. They all live within several miles of each other in Westchester County and Greenwich, Conn. They often dine, play tennis and sometimes even take vacations together.
"I have no idea what other families talk about," says Phyllis.
"We talk about business."

When Art Becomes A Public Spectacle

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
In Phoenix, the old order has fallen by the wayside. In this vibrantly adolescent city, where people dine al fresco in shopping malls beneath clouds of mechanically created mist, a fertile new vision is reshaping the land and the roads that pass through it. Here, highway and landscape have begun to enter into a new civic partnership, one that fuses their traditional roles. Roads, enriched with landscape and art, have become empathetic. Land has begun to function as an engineer: a force from which the city's builders take their cues.
What gives this vision such pivotal importance is the renewed prominence of public works on the national agenda. It's been scarcely a year since the Presidential campaign plucked the word "infrastructure" from relative obscurity and propelled it into popular consciousness. Yet, sadly, in this brief time the word has passed from being a symbol of hope to a synonym for pork. 
 The cynicism is not misplaced. Throughout the country, local officials have responded to the prospect of Federal financing by dusting off old projects or basing new ones on old ideas.
But next month, when the American Public Works Association gathers in Phoenix for its annual congress, officials from around the nation will see how public works can become a vehicle for transforming the public realm.
The catalyst has been art. Or, more accurately, the Phoenix Arts Commission and its dynamic director, Deborah Whitehurst. Together with Gretchen Freeman, director of the city's public art program, Ms. Whitehurst has turned public art into something worthy of the legendary W.P.A. Like many other American cities, Phoenix has adopted "percent for art" legislation, which specifies that a portion of the budget for government-sponsored buildings must be set aside for art. But Ms. Whitehurst has developed an unusually ambitious vision of her city's "percent for art" program. Instead of focusing resources on individual buildings, Ms. Whitehurst has conceived of public art as a tool of urban planning.
In 1988, she commissioned a master plan from William Morrish and Catherine Brown, the architecture and urban design team who direct the University of Minnesota's Center for New American Landscape. The plan proposed that the "percent for art" program focus on the city's infrastructure: not only highways and neighborhood streets, but also airports, canals, bus stops, water and waste treatment plants.
With 68 projects completed or in the works, Phoenix has shown that public art can be a way to coordinate public works.
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT "the pots." Mags Harries's polychrome, vessel-shaped sculptures have been controversial since they were installed in 1992 along a mile stretch of the city's Squaw Peak Parkway. With all the talk about America's infrastructure going to pot, Harries's vessels became an instant target for bad jokes. And her cheerfully rotund containers do make you laugh. Their artsy-craftsy shapes speak, softly, of an era that hadn't discovered mechanized speed; of women trekking through the desert bearing jars of water; and of the tacky tourist souvenirs decorating the den. Some of the pots, perched atop the parkway's sound barrier, have the scale of pies set out on a ledge to cool. One of them is already cut into slices. And these almost-homey images awaken the highway from its kinetic trance to a fleeting awareness of place.
Further down the road, there's an even more ambitious project. At the Thomas Road Overpass, the artist Marilyn Zwack did not just ornament the infrastructure; she helped shape it. Instead of the usual "golf tee" columns, six giant, stylized lizard forms rear up on their hind legs to support the parkway's triple-span overpass. A collaboration between Ms. Zwack and the structural engineer Jerry Cannon, the columns expanded the original idea of placing artwork beneath the highway, though "art" is here, too. Stylized bear claws stalk the sides of the overpass. Desert landscaping, by Angela Die, and large adobe panels, their earthy surfaces inscribed by local residents under Zwack's supervision, extend the project up and down the highway.
Ms. Zwack adapted her biomorphic forms from motifs found in archeological remains of the Hohokum civilization that flourished here for 1,600 years. The canal system that now provides the city with water, and also shapes its grid, was built on the traces of Hohokum canals. And at Thomas Road Overpass it is as if this vanished pre-Columbian people has reached up from the earth to channel the traffic through the modern city.
Of course this is just a conceit. The Hohokum civilization (the name translates as "all used up") is long dead, and the modern city can be brutal even to the living. Indeed, that brutality, or at least the desire to mitigate it, is what brought the Squaw Peak Parkway projects into being. As one of the adobe panels recounts, the people living near Thomas Road didn't want this eight-lane highway to cut their neighborhood in half. And though the art was conceived to recognize the community's voice, that voice went largely unheeded. The highway went through anyhow, even if the art helped reconcile people to it.
And this has been one of public art's recurring quandaries. Though it often purports to represent the public, it is often just a fig leaf over the public's fundamental powerlessness to shape its own destiny. Ms. Whitehurst has described public art as a "change agent," but on Squaw Peak Parkway the changes are largely metaphoric. Even the Thomas Road Overpass has not deterred the highway from gouging its way through the land, though it has altered the symbolic relationship between road and environment.
With its newest public art project, the Phoenix Solid Waste Management Center, the program has moved out of the realm of metaphor and begun to alter reality.
The $18 million transfer facility is the true modern Hohokum, the citadel of "all used up." Here, newspapers, soda cans, pizza boxes, pantyhose and toaster ovens mass together in an automated orgy of discarded plenty.
Ordinarily, a facility like this would not qualify for art funds, because the public wouldn't get to see it. This is where municipal sanitation trucks unload household trash onto larger trucks that then cart it off to landfills. Initially, the center had been designed, by the engineering firm Black & Veatch, as a respectable-looking utilitarian shed.
The brilliant leap that set this plan in motion came with the recognition that this was precisely the kind of place that needed to be brought into the public realm. Joining Ms. Whitehurst and Ms. Freeman in making that leap was Ron Jensen, director of the Phoenix Department of Public Works. When the three met in 1989 to discuss prospects for creating public art for projects under Mr. Jensen's supervision, the waste management center was not initially on the agenda. But Mr. Jensen, a former president of the American Public Works Association, has long championed the idea that the public should be more educated about the gears that make cities turn. As the officials talked, it occurred to them that the "percent for art" program could be a key to achieving that goal.
A panel assembled to choose an artist for the project instead picked two and made the unusual recommendation that they collaborate. Then Mr. Jensen made the even more outlandish suggestion that the artists run the entire project. Black & Veatch's original scheme would be set aside, though the firm would remain as project engineers. The artists, Michael Singer and Linnea Glatt, were asked not only to come up with designs, but also to devise ways to put the public into the picture. In effect, the 1 percent for art found itself in charge of the other 99 percent.
This radical extension of the artists' control has rankled some members of the architectural establishment, who fear the prospect of artists taking work away from architects, or at least diluting their authority. These objections fall wide of the mark. Mr. Singer and Ms. Glatt were not hired to design a building. They were invited to imagine a place, and they were highly qualified for the job. Though the two artists had not worked together before, each had previously collaborated with architects and designers on public art projects. Mr. Singer, who lives in Wilmington, Vt., is known for outdoor works that integrate sculpture with landscape. Ms. Glatt, who lives in Dallas, has created sculptural installations on an architectural scale. The two share a belief in the capacity of art to fulfill a social mission.
Ron Jensen wanted to see that belief translated into public works. In his view, one of the problems with infrastructure is its segregation from the community. Though we can't live without it, we'd prefer not to live with it. We don't want to see the "dirty work" infrastructure performs. We're a nation of Not in My Back Yards. Or we say to public projects, pretend you're something else. At the new Riverbank State Park in Manhattan, for example, there is scarcely any connection between the park and the waste treatment plant on which it sits. Though this arrangement reflected community desires, an opportunity was nonetheless lost to rethink the way a public place can enlighten us about the way our city works.
Phoenix's waste management facility is a fulfillment of Mr. Jensen's dream to turn "nimby" into "yimby" -- Yes, in My Back Yard. If we're willing to troop up to the American Museum of Natural History to look at the shattered pots of ancient civilizations, why should we profess revulsion at the sight of our own archeology in the making? At a time when people recognize the critical need to establish more harmonious relations with the earth, why shouldn't there be a place where we can go to see how that goal might be attained?
The waste management center is such a place. It's about a 10-minute drive from downtown Phoenix, heading south across a flat industrial landscape, with the South Mountains stretching across the horizon ahead. As part of the highway culture, the center naturally needs a sign, and it has a beaut. A gigantic open-steel truss, crowning the building, can be seen from miles away. Pulling onto the 24-acre site, visitors drive alongside a looming, loaf-shaped landfill. This, too, is a sign: a symbol of "all used up." It says why this place is necessary: landfill can't go on forever. A civilization built on expansiveness must now reckon with limits.
Though the landfill was not initially created as a formal piece of landscape, it has now become one. As artificial as anything created by Olmsted, the mound of earth-covered trash conveys a similar message about the longing of industrial society for an arcadian escape. But here society faces the less-than-arcadian consequences of its own industrial strength. The center isn't a park, precisely. In fact, its designers resisted proposals to create playgrounds or sports fields here. A more apt analogy would be an aquarium or a zoo: a place for special trips.
AS IN THE ORIGINAL SCHEME, the center's most conspicuous feature is a spare horizontal shed, but its utilitarian forms have been shaped toward more poetic purpose. Walls of gray cement block rise in shallow tiers planted with desert vegetation. The stepped effect is vaguely Mayan -- a deliberate echo of the fabulous Arizona Biltmore Hotel, a 1929 landmark on the other side of town, designed, in part, by Frank Lloyd Wright. Like Taliesin West, Wright's winter home, the Biltmore speaks of an era when Phoenix beckoned to those who wished to exchange civilization for open spaces. The center updates that ethos as it reckons with the hordes of happy campers who have moved to Phoenix since.
The heart of the center is the shed's vast, open-span interior, a space the size of two football fields. Though now used primarily as a depot for the trucks that transfer trash to landfills, this space contains sorting and recycling equipment that will eventually cut landfill shipments by 30 percent. Visitors can watch these operations from catwalks and from an exterior amphitheater that looks into the interior through large glass windows. This is an operating theater for environmental therapy.
The design details throughout the complex are excruciatingly refined. Windows are carefully aligned with dramatic vistas within and without. Huge machines are installed with the precision of classical statues. Translucent panels and skylights bathe the interior with Gothic light. The effect is not pretty. Instead, the artists have reached for awe. Like the great Galerie des Machines at the 1889 Paris Exposition, the center extracts from industry its aura of holy terror, fusing it with the American landscape tradition of the pitiless and the sublime.
Here, the end of the road has become a beginning. Though we may have run out of room for physical expansion, Phoenix has shown that our capacity for invention is far from all used up.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
With Business Weak, Stocks Are Strong

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AFTER the Mississippi flooded and New York boiled in July, August has finally produced a summer rally. And not just on Wall Street. Europe also is clanging along. The economies may not be growing much, meaning that there is no great need to build plants or buy equipment. But cash has to go somewhere, and now it is going into stocks and bonds.
Every major U.S. stock index moved to a new high last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average topping 3,600. But it is hard to find much joy among investors. Perhaps that reflects the fact this rally has not been like the barnburners of old. "We have crawled higher," says Hugh Johnson, the strategist at First Albany. 
 The tradition of summer rallies is a great one. And if it has often been hyped by brokers trying to sell stocks, that does not obscure the fact that some of the great market turning points have occurred in hot weather. On July 8, 1932, the stock market hit its Depression low. Two months later, it was up 94 percent. The great 1980's bull market began on Friday, Aug. 13, 1982.
And six years ago this week, on Aug. 25, 1987, the Dow peaked at 2,722.42. It was the 55th, and last, time that the index hit a new high in 1987. The crash came in October.
Six years ago, the Dow was ridiculously overvalued. Now it is about one-third higher. The economy is larger, but by some standards, stocks are almost as overpriced. At the peak, the Standard & Poor's 500 index had a miserly dividend yield of just 2.6 percent. Last week the figure was 2.7 percent. Historically, markets with yields much below 3 percent are hazardous to wealth.
But a case can be made for stocks. "The valuation of the market is not strained," said Byron Wien, the Morgan Stanley strategist, pointing to indicators based on interest rates. Mr. Wien was one of the few on Wall Street to forecast a good summer rally, in part because he thought the yield on 30-year Treasuries would fall to 6 1/2 percent. At the time, that forecast seemed bold. Now Treasuries are below 6 1/4 percent. In 1987, he recalled, interest rates were moving up, a fact the stock market managed to ignore for only a limited period.
Last week's rally was ignited in part by lower interest rates, and in part by a recovery in this year's big losers, the consumer products and health stocks. "If the market were to have a strong run here, it would surprise most observers," Mr. Wien said. "But it is quite possible, especially if the laggards keep performing." He thinks a Dow peak of 3,800 to 4,000 is possible, but adds that he doubts more than that is likely without a correction.
Intuitively, stocks ought to do best when the business climate, and thus the profit outlook, are the brightest. But that is not always the case. Perhaps the stock markets here and in Europe are destined to do well until healthy economic growth returns, providing alternative uses for capital. Rising short-term interest rates would be a sign that is happening, but that sign is not here yet.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
Currency Crisis In Europe Lifts Dollar

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr

 BODY:
Europe's latest bout of currency turmoil should mean that American travelers will get a little more for their dollars in Europe.
This month the European Community finance ministers and central bankers agreed to let their currencies rise or fall as much as 15 percent above or below target rates -- far wider swings than in the past. For European nations, the move means governments now have more leeway to lower interest rates to try to lift their economies out of recession, and that should reduce the value of European currencies against the dollar. 
 "It's good news for American travelers," says Nick Sargen, an international financial adviser. "Europe should be a bit less horrifically expensive for Americans than it has been."
The August currency crisis was Europe's second in less than a year. Last September, under pressure in the currency markets, Britain and Italy pulled out of the strict European exchange-rate linkage. Later Spain, Portugal and the Scandinavian countries allowed their currencies to float more freely.
The effect: the dollar has already rebounded sharply from a year ago, when the American currency was near its postwar lows in Europe. At the end of August 1992, for example, it took $1.99 to buy a British pound. In mid-August this year a pound cost $1.47.
In Italy a dollar bought 1,616 lire recently, versus 1,070 lire a year ago. In Germany a dollar bought 1.72 marks compared with 1.40 marks a year earlier. In France a dollar was worth 6.02 francs, up from 4.78. In Spain it bought 142 pesetas, up from 91. (The exchange rates offered consumers are typically at least 5 percent more expensive than these market rates, which is the rate given to currency dealers who trade millions at a time.)
When the dollar is likely to increase in value, travelers may wish to consider putting more of their spending on credit cards. The big card companies tend to get a favorable exchange rate and, if the dollar is rising, any delay between the time a purchase is made and when it is recorded works to the advantage of the purchaser.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Multifamily Mortgages;
The Federal Role in Refinancing Perks Up

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A SUBTLE SIGN of the times in housing has emerged on the East Side of Manhattan. The Federal Government has signed a commitment to insure new long-term financing on two apartment buildings, Regency Towers at 245 East 63d Street and Ambassador East at 330 East 46th Street.
Both are unsubsidized rentals built with conventional financing by Carlyle Construction Corporation of Manhattan in the 60's. Both, when it came time to refinance the mortgage debt, took advantage of the Government's Section 223f multifamily mortgage insurance program, available for the purchase or refinancing of buildings that are at least three years old. 
 A year ago the multifamily programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development were found to be vulnerable to losses of as much as $11.9 billion through loan defaults across the country. The total liability under various programs was $43.5 billion last Sept. 30, the end of the Government's 1992 fiscal year.
But as the experience at the East Side buildings indicates, the time is opportune, in principle, for the Federal Government to crank up its insurance programs. The programs can benefit not only those projects that are already insured but carry high mortgage rates, but also those that were never insured but would get better terms and rates once a Federal insurance commitment was obtained.
One of the major housing policy initiatives of the Clinton Administration involves the multifamily mortgage insurance programs. The idea is that the Federal Government would share the mortgage risk in refinancing existing privately owned rental housing serving moderate-income tenants. The sharing partners would be local housing agencies or other lenders to moderate-income housing, such as the Community Preservation Corporation in New York City. A building improvement program would probably go along with the refinancing.
The Administration also wants to streamline processing, a long-standing issue in certain H.U.D. officies and one that will come to the fore in the risk-sharing approach.
Attention to mortgage insurance for multifamily housing is logical at a time when lending policies have grown unusually restrictive at many private institutions in the wake of the market turndown, the savings-and-loan upheaval and the exceptional default rate on many conventional loans made in the 80's.
On the other hand, long-term bond rates have come down. For a property owner who can refinance an existing building under the Section 223f program, it is sometimes possible to take profit out of a building (assuming it has been well maintained and a success on the market) while obtaining a 35-year fixed-rate loan at about 8 percent.
The fiscal stability that such a loan provides indirectly benefits tenants as well. In the Section 223f program, the Government typically insures a loan amount equal to 85 percent of appraised value (or 70 percent if the owner is planning to pocket cash from the deal, one of the attractions of the 223f program to owners). It also demands regular contributions to a reserve fund for capital repairs. This may involve an initial deposit that can be substantial, especially if maintenance has been deferred.
"WE'RE insuring a mortgage for 35 years so we're looking for a level of comfort," said Beryl Niewood, deputy director of housing development in the regional office of H.U.D. in New York.
The reserve requirements may be a lesser impediment to the use of the Federal program than the fear of getting bogged down in bureaucracy and paperwork. But processing time these days is no slower than it is in most private institutions, according to Bert M. King, president of King Mortgage Corporation of Bethesda, Md., which last November won a commitment on the 568-unit Colony Park garden-apartment project in Ronkonkoma, L.I. It took five months. King is also planning to file for insurance on the 30-year-old, 158-unit building at 160 Parkside Avenue in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
Mr. King said that it usually takes three to four months to win a loan commitment and that "today the private sector is so cautious that there's not much time difference." A typical range in the New York office of H.U.D. is three to seven months, depending on the issues that arise.
The Federal program has been used not only for rentals but also for financing the underlying mortgages of co-op buildings. Three years ago, the 1,800-unit Clearview Gardens co-op in Whitestone, Queens, which was built as a co-op in the early 50's, was refinanced in this manner.
Mortgage bankers say there is widespread ignorance of the H.U.D. program among owners of multifamily buildings. "People think it's for low-income housing, or that the Government will select the tenants or control the rents or profits," Mr. King said. "That hasn't been H.U.D. policy for years."
Ignorance perhaps contributes to the sparse use so far of a newly updated Federal program known as Section 223A-7, designed to let borrowers pay off an old mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration and get a new one, with no equity withdrawal but at a lower interest rate.
IN New York no loans have yet closed under this program but pre-application meetings have been held. One factor that restrains activity is that in multifamily loans, unlike one-family loans, there are typically big penalties for prepaying an existing loan.
Loan applications have been submitted in the Newark office on behalf of two nursing homes in New Jersey, Bay Lea Village in Toms River and Regent Care Center in Hackensack, by a Jersey City firm, WMF/Huntoon, Paige Associates. Murray Kipnis, a principal in the firm, said that mailings had gone out across the country to try to drum up business for the program.
Helen Dunlap, the newly appointed deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing programs at H.U.D., emphasized the agency's interest in establishing a risk-sharing program and also said the agency wanted to streamline the application process in mutifamily insurance.
"We're exploring ways to contract pieces out," she said. The goal is to be able to get firm commitments, on average, within six months.
Nationally, much of the insured portfolio needs physical upgrading and repair, H.U.D. officials said. For example, 36 percent of the mortgages listed as vulnerable to default -- $4.3 billion of the total $11.9 billion -- were written for new unsubsidized housing built under the Section 221d-4 program. Much of it is 20 to 30 years old.
The next largest category potentially subject to loss are those loans written under the co-insurance program of the 80's, in which the Federal Government under President Ronald Reagan farmed out the mortgage underwriting to private firms. The loss potential there is $3.7 billion, H.U.D. officials say.
Processing issues notwithstanding, "You are going to see a tremendous amount of H.U.D. closings," said Irwin Shapiro, director of F.H.A. mortgage financing at New York Urban Servicing Company, which arranges loans with insurance companies and pension funds once a Federal insurance commitment is obtained. The reason is the drop in the rate on long-term Government bonds over the last 18 months, he said.
The underwriting standards used by H.U.D. are similar to those of private institutions, mortgages bankers say.
Irving Wharton, president of I. Wharton & Company of Great Neck, L.I., a mortgage banking firm, noted that in lending to co-op buildings the typical private institution required that at least 70 percent of the apartments have been sold for owner-occupancy, with the balance rented out on a self-sustaining basis.
"H.U.D. wants that also," he said.

HEADLINE: Your Home: Caveat Emptor;
Buying A New House

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
SEVERAL years of recession and a weakened marketplace have created a host of critical but unfamiliar concerns for buyers of new and yet-to-be-built homes.
For one, it may be dangerous to assume that only the good guys are left and all the shoddy builders went under. "Some of the quality builders were hurt badly too," said Barry Warren, a real estate lawyer in Smithtown, L.I. "It's not necessarily a safer place than it was when real estate was booming." 
 For another, the definition of what constitutes "new construction" has changed. Years ago, when anyone talked of a brand-new home, the assumption was that the construction itself had taken place without letup during the prior six or nine months.
Not any more. The home might have sat half finished for a year or more, waiting for a buyer, which could have left it vulnerable to termites or rot, among other woes. Or it may have been part of a larger development taken over by a lender from a floundering builder or developer, and the lender may have hired someone else to finish the job.
This may be revealed only if the buyer asks about the history of the project or does some research at the local public records office, warned Bill Selsberg, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn. Should this be so, he said, the buyer must have the property professionally inspected the way an older home is, since many of the same problems could show up.
The need for professional inspection has also become critical because the temptation to cut corners and short-change the customer now looms so large.
David Coprio, former president of the Home Builders of Fairfield County and a construction consultant in Weston, Conn., said this has been caused, in part, by the recent spike in the cost of raw materials, especially lumber, plus the difficulty of making a decent profit in today's market. For example, he said, a builder might substitute particle board for more expensive plywood or substitute a cheaper heating or air-conditioning system than the one promised.
One way buyers can make sure that what was promised in the contract is being delivered is to hire a professional to monitor the construction or at least have an expert go through the home just before the closing.
Relying on the certificate of occupancy issued by a municipality may be misguided, lawyers say, since the document is concerned with building code compliance, not with making sure that all representations were fulfilled.
Norman Becker, president of Universal Home Inspections of Pomona, N.Y., a licensed professional engineer who inspects homes for buyers, recalled going into a new house in Putnam County a few months ago and finding an upstairs thermostat turning on the heating downstairs and vice versa. "The wiring was all wrong," he said. "But the buyer may not have noticed until after the closing."
Once a builder has been paid it can be a hassle (and sometimes impossible) to get him to come back and fix even a small defect.
Another dangerous assumption is that it doesn't matter if something is amiss because the comprehensive construction warranties offered by a growing number of builders are protection enough. The widely used Home Buyers Warranty program, for example, allows "consumers to buy with confidence," according to its promotional literature.
A suit filed by David and Mary Kay McPherson in state court in Fort Worth, Tex., against Home Buyers -- after the couple's new home in Mansfield developed a host of problems -- asserts that the company rarely pays up.
Statistics filed as part of a previous case against Home Buyers with the Texas courts, they maintain, show that the company rejected 80 percent of the 969 claims for structural defects in its Southwestern region from 1990 to mid-1991 as outside the scope of the warranty. The company has denied any wrongdoing and some home inspectors say homeowners expected too much from these policies.
MOREOVER, if the new home was bought directly from a lender who had taken it back from an ailing builder in a foreclosure sale it may be offered "as is" with a "quit-claim deed," meaning no representations are made concerning its condition now or for the future, Mr. Selsberg said.
The home-inspection companies that check out older homes will make this sort of an inspection (find them in the Yellow Pages or call the American Society of Home Inspectors at (800) 743-2744 for a referral). But since this can be a tad more technical it may be prudent to narrow the choice to a company that uses only licensed professional engineers.
Another good source of construction expertise are other builders and contractors, many of whom also do consulting. They can be found by word of mouth or through a local chapter of the National Association of Home Builders. Expect to pay about $350 for a final inspection and about $1,500 if the construction expert is asked to review the specifications and regularly monitor ongoing construction.
In addition, it may pay to visit the site regularly. That's what Paul Munick and his wife, Nancy, did while their four-bedroom colonial was being built in Berkeley Heights, N.J., earlier this year. "Where that door or electrical outlet ends up will make a difference to your life, not theirs," Mr. Munick said.
Mr. Munick also visited neighboring houses built by the same builder and asked the buyers about any problems they had. "That's where I learned to stay on top of the construction myself," he said.
Alan and Denise Fields, two young writers, felt they had plunged into such a minefield when they bought a neo-Victorian house being built in Monument, Colo., two years ago that it spurred them to write "Your New Home" (Windsor Peak Press, 1993), a book of cautionary thoughts.
Among its tips: When the builder offers a lump-sum allowance for such auxiliary items as major appliances or carpeting, find out what these will really cost before accepting the figure; if it is too low, negotiate a higher allowance.
The book advises asking about every item in the model home; often many of the most appealing features are "extras" that have an annoying way of not being included in the sticker price.
Finally, a weaker market makes a builder more disposed to toss in some extras or customized changes at no additional charge, especially if he is reluctant to lower his asking price. These could include larger closets, extra electrical outlets and hardwood floors instead of carpeting.

HEADLINE: Saving Taxes and Open Spaces, Too

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
JULIE ZAYKOWSKI and her family had a novel response when she learned last year that, because of a radical change in how assessments are calculated, the property taxes on the 77-acre swath of woods and wetlands that her family has owned for 42 years in North Haven on the East End of Long Island would soar by 1,300 percent.
They gave away most of their development rights. 
 "We knew that taxes were going to be looked at and reassessed, but this was a shock," Ms. Zaykowski said.
Leo Borkoski of nearby Water Mill had a similar reaction when he realized that his family's 25-acre farm would be subject to staggeringly high estate taxes.
He carved up the property into open space, an agricultural preserve and four building lots.
"The estate taxes are astonishing," he said.
Financial self-interest was the primary motivation for the actions of Ms. Zaykowski and Mr. Borkoski. Their decisions, however, have also helped preserve large tracts of developable land for the public.
In fact, large landowners, working with private land preservation groups, are increasingly using creative and complicated tax strategies, like conservation easements and limited development plans, both to cut their tax bills and help save the dwindling supply of open space.
"More and more, we are doing this because of the scarcity of public funds," said John van Heusen Halsey, president of the Peconic Land Trust in Southampton, L.I., which assisted both Ms. Zaykowski and Mr. Borkoski.
Conservation easements entail a landowner's signing away forever the development rights on all or part of his or her property, but retaining the right to live on, use and even sell the land. The landowner is then allowed to take a substantial charitable gift deduction on Federal income tax returns.
More important, though, their exposure to inheritance taxes and local property taxes is reduced because the potential development value of the land, which is the basis for most tax assessments, is diminished.
"In many ways, it's a win-win proposition," Mr. Halsey said.
Limited development plans, sometimes known as lower or reduced density plans, are similar. Landowners reduce their property taxes and inheritance taxes by cutting the potential development value of their land by lessening the number of subdivided lots on their property that can be used for development.
Limited development plans, which often include conservation easements, can also make a property more appealing to developers, as a project with a lower maximum density is likely to have fewer problems passing the scrutiny of growth-weary local planning and zoning boards.
"You are creating something that is easier to market in a tough real estate market," Mr. Halsey said. "As a developer, you not only get through the process faster, but your infrastructure costs are often lower -- streets, utilities, drainage."
Back in the booming 80's, when land was expensive and tax coffers overflowed, state governments often took the lead in open-space preservation. In 1988, for instance, Connecticut allocated $100 million to be spent over five years to buy private land for parks, forests and preserves.
BUT such largesse is almost unthinkable in today's fiscally conservative climate, even though land prices have fallen by as much as 30 percent because of the severe real estate recession in most of the Northeast. In 1990, for example, New Yorkers, in a surprise vote, rejected a $2 billion environmental bond issue that would have provided state funds to buy open space.
Moreover, local governments concerned about preserving land have cut back their assistance, sometimes because the declining real estate market has led not only to the availability of cheaper land but also to lower assessments that result in a smaller stream of tax revenue.
In some other cases, such as with Suffolk County on Long Island, the county government -- long regarded as a leader in land preservation -- is burdened by the high interest rates it is paying on bonds that have already been issued for land acquisition.
"There is money for acquisition, but not as much," said Alice A. Amrhein, the county's Deputy County Executive for Finance.
Some state and local governments, however, are continuing their efforts to buy land for preservation, although the projects are less ambitious than they were a few years ago, or they require using new sources of revenue.
In Suffolk, for instance, efforts to protect Long Island's 100,000-acre Pine Barrens, a pristine wildlife area and source of drinking water for over 2 million people, were given a boost earlier this month when the state approved a $500,000 grant so the Pine Barrens Commission can start its planning work.
The Pine Barrens Protection Act defines a 50,000-acre preservation core in which localities can impose strict development controls.
Elsewhere, in 1990 voters in New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the nation, approved a $345 million bond issue for various environmental projects, including open-space preservation. And last month the state allocated $2.5 million to acquire land around Barnegat Bay, on the central Jersey Shore. The funds came not from the bond issue but from a $54 million settlement paid by the Ciba-Geigy Corporation of Toms River, N.J., for the illegal storage of pollutants.
State governments also occasionally get donations of land from corporations. Last December, for example, the International Paper Company donated 22,000 acres of evergreen forest and white-water river in the northwest Adirondacks under a plan that included the largest gift of land in the 100-year history of the Adirondack Park. The state once planned to pay as much as $6 million for the land, much of it wilderness.
The tract, along the Raquette River near the village of Tupper Lake, was at the top of virtually every list put together by state officials and environmentalists of areas that should be protected for future generations.
But donations, either by corporations or private individuals, are few and far between nowadays, at times because land values are so low. More often, land is preserved with the aid of private land trusts and preservation organizations using conservation easements and limited-development plans. These groups, though, have also been damaged by the economic downturn in the region.
This has made it difficult not only to raise funds but, because of the dearth of widespread development, also to arouse a sense of urgency about the need to preserve undeveloped lands.
"THERE is still tremendous development pressure out here all right," said Mr. Halsey of the Peconic Land Trust. "There has been an easing of that recently, but it will come back, though probably not like it was in the 80's."
Heather Lehman, a field representative for the Trust for Public Land, a private, nonprofit conservation organization based in San Francisco with an office in Manhattan, added: "You think no one is coming in and building luxury condominiums on the hillsides, but people do come in and build homes sometimes."
The trust helped with the state's acquisition of a 1,088-acre, 29-mile hiking trail, the Taconic Crest Trail, along the border of New York, Massachusetts and Vermont, using mostly conservation easements granted by W.J. Cowee Inc., a small wood-products company in Stephentown, N.Y.
Ms. Lehman said the state had obtained the recreational and development rights to the land by buying conservation easements for $192,225 and some parcels of land directly for $64,350. She said that the company also could have sought a reduction in its property-tax assessments because the use of the land had changed, but had not done so.
"The company has realized some of the cash value of their land while being able to continue operating," she said.
Similar deals are often struck with individual landowners, although cash payments are less likely to be part of the package. Ms. Zaykowski, for example, gave the Peconic Land Trust an easement over 60 of the 77 acres her family has owned since 1951.
The trust also set up a limited-development plan that identified seven future home sites, in addition to the two existing residences on the property, that the family would retain for future equity. Without the easement, the property, under current zoning restrictions, would have been able to be subdivided into 18 lots.
"The Peconic Land Trust was a life-saver -- we had four months to come up with all this money" Ms. Zaykowski said. "If we hadn't done this, I don't know how much money we would have had to pay, tens of thousands of dollars. Or, we would probably have had to sell the land."
She said she did not know how much, precisely, in property taxes the plan would save her since she won't get her new tax bill until December.
The special reassessment in 1992 that prompted her arrangement with the Peconic Land Trust stemmed from the invalidation of Southampton's policy of reassessing properties upon sale; both North Haven and Water Mill are in Southampton. The policy had resulted in instances in which people who had recently bought property were being taxed at a higher rate than long-time owners. The policy had been supported by the town as a way to minimize the impact of property taxes on raw land and thereby lessen the chances it would be sold to developers.
"It was kind of like a slap in the face," Ms. Zaykowski said. "We were being penalized by the taxes and the taxes force you to develop the land."
"The land had no income, and the whole community benefited by leaving it natural," she added. "It's not like we were making a living off the land."
Ms. Zaykowski, who works as a church secretary, said her property had now been reclassified for the land's present value at highest and best use.
"Our taxes will still be higher than they were prior to the special assessment," she said. "They may be double still."
Although conservationists usually prefer donations and conservation easements to limited-development plans, they say that it is necessary these days to be pragmatic.
"YOU can't just walk into a farmer's kitchen as say 'Hey, why don't you give us your land?' " said Timothy J. Caufield, assistant director of the Peconic Land Trust. "It doesn't work."
The world of land conservationists these days more often resembles that of an estate or tax attorney. "It's so much a part of what's going on," Mr. Halsey said. "Most of the land that has been lost here has been because of tax policy, inheritance taxes, especially."
"Land is so expensive out here, and many people are land-rich and cash-poor, and then they hit that inheritance tax, and there is not a lot they can do," he added. "And they generally have nine months to come up with the money, and if they don't, someone will buy it and want to make the most use of the property financially."
Inheritance taxes are particularly problematic for large landowners. Mr. Halsey noted that land values, though stable or declining in the last few years, were, in most areas, exponentially higher than 20 years ago, and properties are often classified for tax assessment purposes at their highest and best use, regardless of how a landowner is actually using the land.
Mr. Halsey said that, for estate tax purposes, even farms could be taxed as if they were being developed for housing projects. He added that that it was not unusual for a small farm to be assessed at more than $1 million even though its current value to the owner was much less.
In such cases, Federal law grants an exemption of $600,000 for inheritance taxes upon the death of the surviving spouse. Above that amount, though, the tax rate rapidly rises to at least 40 percent and as much as 55 percent. Further, there is a New York State inheritance tax on the entire amount.
Mr. Halsey said the estate tax bill on a family inheriting a farm with land that had a developable worth of $1 million would be $173,300.
"A lot of your properties are worth substantially more out here, so you're looking at substantial bites," Mr. Halsey said, noting that a $2 million property would face a Federal and state tax liablity of $634,900.
THE specter of a such a large estate tax is what has spurred Mr. Borkoski and his family to work with the Peconic Land Trust. After Mr. Borkoski's father died in the mid-80's, his mother, Joanne, and her other children, set about the task of lessening the impending liability.
"None of the kids are really interested in farming," said Mr. Borkoski, a computer network planner who lives in Long Branch, N.J. Even if they were, he added, the estate taxes are so high that they would probably sell about half the property to pay them.
Instead, the family granted the Peconic Land Trust an easement that defines 6.5 acres along Lake Nowedonah, also known as Mill Pond, as open space that cannot be developed. The easement also reduces the potential development density on the rest of the property to four units from 12 units on about 7.5 acres. The balance of the property, about 10.5 acres, will remain farmland.
The family is also seeking to sell either the individual lots or the entire property, as it will now have to pay higher property taxes than when the entire parcel of land was zoned for agricultural use; active farmland was exempted from Southhampton's recent special reassessment and, for the purposes of property taxes, is not assessed at its best or highest use or developable potential.
"Being a farm family, we are sensitive to environemtnal concerns," Mr. Borkoski said. "And this plan helped us meet our needs and also preserve the land."

HEADLINE: Subtle Forces And Racism

 BODY:
Robert Leikind, director of the Connecticut Anti-Defamation League, attributes what he sees as the rise in racism and anti-Semitism to such things as competitiveness brought on by a declining economy and the difficulty of adjusting to people who are different ("Working to Combat the Messages of Hate," Aug. 1). While these are undoubtedly contributing causes, Mr. Leikind does not address the much more subtle forces at work.
In the first place, the increase may well be illusory and due to a distortion of definitions. Racism is defined by Webster as "An excessive and irrational belief or advocacy of the superiority of a given group . . . on the basis of racial difference and having no scientific validity." 
 How far we have wandered from this definition was shown recently when a remark that "a black athlete can actually outjump a white athlete on the average" brought charges of racism! Few basketball fans would argue with the truth of this statement and, in any case, it is the black athlete who is deemed superior.
In the same process of broadening a meaning to fit a political agenda, defamation, which dictionaries define as "slander" -- a false statement -- has become equated with any criticism, however true or factual, and personal opinion, however sincere.
Members of minority groups tend to deflect any criticism of themselves as individuals onto the broad shoulders of "racism" and "defamation." In other words, the individual is never guilty of odious behavior. He is a victim of the "racism" of his critic.
This state of affairs, which has come to be called politically correct, cannot fail to exacerbate the very resentment which the Anti-Defamation League deplores. There is a Big Brother aspect to organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, its antennae scrupulously searching for slurs and ready to pounce on even thoughtful opinion which seems derogatory. Freudian psychology teaches that repressed feelings tend to emerge, often in subtle ways, and as we become less and less able to express our true sentiments for fear of incurring unpleasant epithets, it will not be surprising if the attitudes of all but the most liberal tend to harden.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: Central Park's 'Hooverville';
Life Along 'Depression Street'

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
PERHAPS the character of shantytowns, and the homeless who occupy them, change little over generations. But the episode of the encampment at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge, demolished by the city on Aug. 17, recalls the "Hooverville" of shacks housing more than a score of homeless people in the emptied Central Park Reservoir in 1931-1933.
The stock-market crash of October 1929 occurred just as the large rectangular reservoir in Central Park north of Belvedere Castle was being taken out of service. In early 1930, the reservoir was drained, preparatory to its transformation into what is now known as the Great Lawn. But a slowdown in construction and excavation made clean fill scarce. 
 According to "The Park and the People: A History of Central Park" by Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar (Cornell University Press, 1992), by late 1930 a few homeless people had set up an informal camp at the reservoir site, but were evicted by the police.
As the Depression set in, public sentiment became more sympathetic. In July 1931 a judge suspended the sentences of 22 unemployed men sleeping in Central Park -- apparently in various locations -- and gave each one $2 out of his own pocket.
In November the Municipal Lodging House set a record in sheltering 3,853 men in one night. Other accounts indicate that the homeless colony had again established itself in the empty reservoir, and in December a New York Times reporter described six shacks, one with a stove, housing nine men.
"We work hard to keep it clean, because that is important," said one man. "I never lived like this before." The next day seven of the men were arrested as vagrants, but the charges were dismissed.
In September 1932, 29 men were arrested "with apologies and good feelings on both sides" in what the Parks Department itself described as "Hoover Valley." At the time, there were 17 shacks along "Depression Street," all with chairs and beds and some with carpets. One was even built of brick with a roof of inlaid tile by umemployed bricklayers who called it "Rockside Inn."
"They repair in the morning to comfort stations to shave and make themselves look presentable and keep their shacks as clean as they can," reported The Times. A health official said that "unless the city should see fit to install running water and sewerage facilities, the camp will have to go."
But it was still open Oct. 3, when Patrick McDermott, an unemployed bricklayer, was given six months in jail for dancing and singing along the top of the reservoir wearing "less clothing than deemed proper." He earlier reported that he had collected $47 from 3,000 visitors who had come to see the shantytown.
"The Park and the People: A History of Central Park" says there were 1.2 million Americans homeless in the winter of 1932-1933; 2,000 of these were New Yorkers who managed as best they could on the street. Ted Houghton, a spokesman for the Coalition for the Homeless, says 25,000 people a night are now in similar circumstances.
The reservoir settlement could not have been popular with the tenants of the new Fifth Avenue and Central Park West apartments, but they mounted no protest. There were other such settlements in New York -- one with 80 shacks between Ninth and 10th Streets on the East River. But the Central Park shantytown was the most famous. It disappeared sometime before April 1933 when work on the reservoir landfill resumed.
The issues raised in the the 30's are like many replayed in our own time. Millions were raised privately in relief funds, and there was great sympathy for those without homes and jobs. But this was tempered with concern that perhaps they were just "hoboes" -- a term describing vagrants.
THE shantytowns simultaneously attracted admiration and censure: people admired the resourcefulness of the individual inhabitants and the extent of their efforts and yet were threatened by the implicit disorder of such colonies.
Government could seem benign but also cruel. When the East River colony was cleared in 1933 (with 10 days' notice) "old John Cahill" told a reporter: "Nobody's askin' us where we're goin'. There's not a soul thinkin' about us."
Then, as now, there were many homeless people who refused to accept the officially sanctioned help. When their camps were broken up, they moved peacefully on, with only mild protest and certainly no revolt. And in the end, as everyone else seemed to hope, they just sort of disappeared.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut;
Fairfield's Large-Space Market Revives

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
FOR the first time in more than three years companies from Manhattan, Westchester and Connecticut are looking for large blocks of office space in Fairfield County.
To meet the demand, office buildings that had been constructed as corporate headquarters but have been mostly vacant in recent years are shedding their white elephant skins and entering the competition. 
 Two recent leases are considered a giant step toward a resurgence of the one-large-floor market. Instead of the 2,000- to 20,000-square-foot leases that have been the norm in the last three years, the Witco Corporation of Manhattan took 258,000 square feet in Greenwich and Dun & Bradstreet, also of Manhattan, took 94,048 in Westport.
Those two deals alone, signed in June, did much to break a persistent mid-to-high-20-percent vacancy rate countywide, knocking it down to around 22 percent.
And following three years of zero office construction in Fairfield, Duracell, which rents several buildings at the Berkshire Industrial Park in Bethel, will break ground there next January for a $60 million, 300,000-square-foot corporate headquarters. It is the first single-occupant venture the real estate community has witnessed in a decade and the only one on the immediate horizon.
Variances have been obtained from Bethel's Planning and Zoning Commission and site plan approval will be sought within the next few months. Construction is expected to be completed by the fall of 1995, accomodating 650 employes and 700 cars on 43 acres.
"With the limited availability of major blocks of Class A space," said John Rostenberg, partner at Rostenberg Doern Realtors in Stamford, "sooner or later a company will not be able to find a building and it will build to suit itself. We won't see the same kind of extravagance, but we will find corporations building with more function and productivity in mind."
As for a renewal of demand for large spaces, "I'm seeing over a million square feet of active prospects in various stages," said Jay Hruska, a Cushman & Wakefield broker who represented the landlord, Greenwich-American Center, in the Witco lease, "and I'm considering this a trend."
The refrain was repeated by the Manhattan real estate marketing firm of Delmhorst & Sheehan, which represented Nyala Farms, landlord in the Dun & Bradstreet lease.
"We specialize in large properties," said John E. Sheehan, a partner, "and we have a number of large users looking for space."
CONNECTICUT is working hard to attract that business, with money, in-kind assistance and concessions.
"We looked in New Jersey and Westchester," said Carl Soderlind, vice president of corporate affairs at Witco, which makes chemical and petroleum products. "We saw comparable locations at comparable prices, but we got an $8 million grant from Connecticut and a reduced rate for utilities. The Governor's staff was there for us. It was refreshing and it made all the difference."
Renovations begin in November for completion next April.
"Dun & Bradstreet got a $7.2 million grant and a utility-rate reduction," said Joseph Cohen, spokesman for the State Department of Economic Development. "There is a two- or three-year payback to the state in personal and corporate income taxes and general spending through hundreds of new jobs these companies bring in."
Job training, loans below market rate, and what Mr. Cohen described as "a smorgasbord" of incentives are available.
"After ignoring economic development for the entire decade of the 'Who, me worry?' 80's, we have come around 180 degrees to improve the business climate," he said.
Witco's 20-year lease at Greenwich-American Center, formerly Primerica, is believed to be the largest in square footage since 1983. The 605,000-square-foot building on 154 acres was built in 1970 by the American Can Company, with numerous amenities to compensate for its location in an isolated, rural corner of Greenwich.
With several dining areas, a guest house, a manmade lake for fire protection and recreational and service facilities for up to 3,500 employes, it set the stage for the wave of office construction that overwhelmed the county in the 80's. Around 290,000 square feet are still available at asking rents of $20 to $25 a foot a year, less than half 1988 levels.
Witco will close its headquarters in Manhattan and an office in Woodcliff, N.J., but retain manufacturing sites in several other states. About 600 of 800 employes invited to relocate are expected to do so, with the shortfall to be hired locally. The headquarters will employ 800 people.
Dun & Bradstreet's move to Nyala Farms, the former Stauffer Chemical Company headquarters on 54 acres in Westport, is scheduled for October. The two-year lease will end concurrently with the completion of renovations of its 129,000-square-foot permanent headquarters in Wilton.
Nyala Farms will have 16,000 square feet vacant out of 378,000 when the lease begins.
To prevent increased traffic and urbanization, Greenwich and Westport zoning officials for several years refused to allow more than one tenant at Nyala Farms and three at Greenwich-American Center. Unable to attract tenants to such large quarters, the owners appealed to the State Supreme Court in 1988. Settlements reached in 1991 allow 20 tenants at Nyala Farms, and an unlimited number at Greenwich-American provided the number of employees does not exceed 18 per acre, or around 2,700 people.
What remains of Union Carbide's complex of 1.2 million square feet and 650 acres on the outskirts of Danbury has been less successful in attracting tenants. It was sold in 1986, with Carbide taking a 20-year leaseback of the 15 buildings and 100 acres.
BUT because the company requires less space than anticipated, 150,000 square feet of vacant office space in 1986 has grown to 450,000 square feet today, of which 9,000 square feet was leased in July by Comstock/Spie Group, an international construction firm.
A major inducement to relocate to Fairfield County was and still is that many company executives already live there. Recently, an executive who lives in Greenwich and works in Manhattan was scouting Greenwich locations for his company.
"An office site he liked was near his home," said James Sandy, Greenwich's town planner. "He is an inveterate equestrian, and he was intrigued with the idea of going to work on horseback."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Auctions;
An Old Way of Selling Takes on New Respectability

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
ON Sept. 20, people from all over the world will gather at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and bid on commercial properties scattered across New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. They will get a chance to buy a couple of warehouses, an office complex, an apartment complex, a research building, even a department store on Brooklyn's Fulton Mall.
Some of the properties are for sale, others have potential for lease takeovers. They have just one thing in common: Their owners, the International Business Machines Corporation and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, think they have a better chance to get a decent price for those properties at auction than through a conventional sale.
"An auction brings all the buyers together in one room and that gives you a definite read on the market," said John Gorham, vice president of equity investments for the Prudential Realty Group. 
 Commercial property auctions, common for centuries in England, are finally taking hold in the United States. Kennedy-Wilson, an auction company based in Santa Monica, Calif., and Jones Lang Wootton, a London-based concern, have auctioned off $750 million worth of commercial properties in the last three years in joint-venture auctions in the United States. Grubb & Ellis/Ross-Dove has moved about $1.5 billion in commercial properties since 1989. And Sheldon Good & Company, the Chicago-based concern that will run the Sept. 20 auction, has moved $3.5 billion in commercial properties since 1964 -- the bulk in the last few years.
"Just like residential auctions became routine in the 1980's, commercial auctions are becoming routine in the 1990's," said Steven L. Good, president of Sheldon Good.
One reason for the lag has been bureaucratic fear. Unlike most residential buildings, commercial properties are usually owned by banks, pension funds, corporations or other institutions. Traditionally, institutions would rather hold onto a cash-draining property than reflect a loss from the sale on their books or face criticism that they used an unproven method to unload it.
"Prudential has not done many auctions because we didn't know how people would react to a traditional company using this newfangled method," Mr. Gorham said.
But the many property auctions that the Resolution Trust Company and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have held over the last few years has lent respectability to the process. Moreover, desperation for buyers has emboldened portfolio managers to try new techniques, while growing sophistication on the part of buyers has made them more comfortable bidding for properties on an as-is, no-recourse basis.
Those factors, combined with the insistent prodding of commercial auction houses, have induced more institutions to test the waters. Over the last couple of years Chemical Bank, Citibank and Metropolitan Life have all auctioned commercial properties. And auctioneers say real estate executives who once did not return their calls now call them.
"It takes something major to make an institution change, but the depression in the real estate market over the least few years has been major enough," said Simon Milde, who just left Jones Lang Wootton to become president of Kennedy-Wilson.
Corporate pressure on occupancy costs has also boosted auctions' popularity. Corporations have often auctioned off plants and equipment, so the concept is not new to them. And many are recognizing that unneeded real estate can be a nice source of cash.
I.B.M., for one, concluded that it was better off selling a three-building office complex it owns and occupies in Dayton, N.J., and leasing it back for five years or so. Recognizing that such a short leaseback period might put off conventional buyers, I.B.M. is trying the auction route.
"IF we don't get our price, it won't be a disaster," said Anthony Canonaco, an I.B.M. real estate manager, who says the property is carried on the books at less than $10 million. "We really are checking to see if the auction process works well."
Auctioneers say that a growing number of new clients are citing similar reasons.
"Sellers get frustrated when buyers sit on the sidelines trying to figure out when prices are going to bottom," said Charles N. McKinney, an executive of Grubb & Ellis, which will try to auction off 71 properties from 25 owners, with a value of about $500 million, in Dallas on Oct. 7. "In an auction, both buyers and sellers know that the other party is committed to closing the sale."
Not surprisingly, brokers, who lose a potential sales commission every time a building is auctioned, are looking for ways to cash in on the trend. Edward S. Gordon, for one, has gone in with Sheldon Good as a split-fee partner in the Sept. 20 auction.
"Sheldon Good has the marketing distribution network, but we provide the client access, the institutional relationships and the real estate expertise," said Stephen B. Siegel, Edward S. Gordon's chief executive.
No one suggests that auctions are appropriate for all properties. Tiny properties are not likely to glean a high enough selling price to justify the auction house's fee (usually 2 percent to 5 percent of the sale price). And the field of buyers for huge, expensive ones is so small that an auction does not make sense.
Moreover, most buyers willing to pay top dollar for a property want to negotiate financing and other deal terms behind closed doors. On the rare occasions that a large property is put up for bid, it is usually through a sealed-bid process, as was the case when Morgan Stanley successfully bid $176 million for 1585 Broadway, the 41-story tower near 48th Street, this month.
But companies looking to unload properties in the $5 million to $15 million range are finding auctions worthwhile, especially in a real estate market like this one, where no one is certain whether an uptick is imminent.
"It's a psychological thing," said Barry F. H. Graham, vice president-investments for Toronto's Confederation Life Insurance Company. "When you're in a real estate market that's seen better days, you just don't want to make an offer without knowing how others value the property."
Mr. Graham should know: He had tried, without success, to sell an asbestos-laden office building in Calgary for about $200,000. At an auction last November, four bidders bid the property up to $250,000.
"Part of it was the reassurance of seeeing three other guys who also felt the property was worth something, and part of it was the sheer love of the chase," he guessed.
BUYERS say he probably guessed right. After fiercely competitive bidding, Anthony E. Malkin, president of the Manhattan-based property management firm W&M Properties, bought a 70,000-square-foot block of retail space on East 9th Street at auction in March, for $19.527 million.
"We probably paid more than we would have had to pay in a conventional sale, but the auction forces you to pay what the market thinks the property is worth," he said.
For sellers, auctions offer other financial boons. For one thing, auction houses offer marketing economies that few companies could duplicate on their own. Many have offices throughout the world -- Jones Lang Wootton alone has offices in 23 countries. Most distribute glitzy brochures describing the properties and hold preauction previews to answer questions.
Because the auctions generally include buildings owned by several institutions, the cost of the marketing -- normally about half a percent of the lowest price the company will accept for the building -- is distributed among the companies.
"These properties wouldn't merit such marketing attention if we were selling them on our own," said Prudential's Mr. Gorham.
The wider reach, coupled with satellite technology that enables foreign bidders to participate without flying to the auction site, has certainly attracted buyers. A Taiwanese group bought the Minneapolis Doubletree Club Hotel at auction from Chemical Bank, and a group of Mexicans bought the San Diego Kona Kai Inn from First Interstate.
"An auction is not just a sales forum," said Mr. Milde, who estimates that foreigners bought half of the properties that Jones Lang and Kennedy-Wilson have auctioned. "It is a global exchange for real estate."

HEADLINE: Is Economic Integration A Constitutional Right?

 BODY:
With regard to your article on the Yonkers Housing situation ["Years After Bias Ruling, Yonkers Still a House Divided," Aug. 15], no one has as yet addressed the most important point of the housing issue: Is economic integration a constitutional right? If it is, why do not all Americans have the same right? If it isn't, why are some Americans afforded this as a right while others are not?
Some people have called attention to the fact that these Americans have suffered greatly and have been severely wronged and so we are making an exception to make amends. 
 That answer is not satisfactory. Besides the fact that I do not believe an exception can be made to the Constitution without a constitutional amendment, I do not recall any ethnic group that has come to America, that has not been subjected to persecution, prejudice, bias and many other ills. Somehow they have all managed to overcome the bias and have earned their way to acceptance in American society, in some instances still fighting against existing prejudices.
Can anyone contend that it is legal for a "minority" family with an income of up to $67,000 a year to be subsidized, while a white family with the same income, is not?
It has always been my belief that anyone who can afford to live in any community is entitled to purchase a residence there without any problem. Despite the many charges made against southeast Yonkers (I have lived here for 34 years), our community is totally integrated. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Indians, Arabs, Irish, Italian, Jewish -- all live side by side. We have never had any cross burning or other hateful incidents.
With the introduction, however, of 200 units of low-income housing and an additional 800 units of subsidized housing, I am very much concerned with tipping the community, with the resultant middle-income family flight, as occurred in southwest Yonkers, thereby creating the segregation we do not now have. Since we are already racially integrated, it is obviously not racial integration but economic integration that is the motivation.
I would appreciate someone justifying the continuing of an action that most people would consider unconstitutional and, in effect, reverse discrimination, since the economic integration only applies to so-called "minorities."
I personally would be enchanted to live on Sutton Place or on some magnificent estate up north and to be subsidized to live there.
It is beyond comprehension why Judge Leonard B. Sand has refused to recognize the tremendous racial integration of this community since 1980, since ostensibly that was his goal.
One further thought -- social acceptance cannot be legislated. It must come about gradually and naturally through mutually earned respect.

HEADLINE: At Work;
The Employee Side of Health Care

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON no doubt bowed to political reality two weeks ago when he announced that employers would be the linchpins of health care reform. His alternatives were to ask people to buy health insurance on their own, a turkey sans wings, or to institute a national health plan, which surely would have snapped back into reality anyone who thought anti-Communism was dead. The "employer mandate," as the plan is known in its current form, simply makes the current voluntary system a mandatory one, bringing into the fold employers who, for whatever reason, decline to pay for "fringe" benefits like health care.
No one can say how many policy mutations will occur before the Administration delivers a proposal next month, much less how nibbling by Congress will reconfigure it. The debate will likely be driven by the anxieties of small-business proprietors, who have learned the value of paying dues to leather-lunged organizations that bear their standard in Washington. Companies of all sizes are helping to float the impression floating over the debate -- which resembles a raucous graduate-school seminar -- is that employers will simply eat the cost of increased benefits and deduct the total from the bottom line. Bad for profits, bad for competitiveness and bad for growth, if true. 
 Companies could just quietly absorb the cost, and monkeys pecking randomly on keyboards could eventually write "The Bridges of Madison County." But they -- the companies, not the monkeys -- would violate the First Law of Economic Self-Interest: costs that can be passed on will be. Once the dust settles and the chickens roost on reform, employees will almost certainly feel a nip and tuck somewhere in their compensation packages. Some experts think there will be out-of-pocket costs; some are simply expecting higher taxes. But no one thinks the burden will fall alone, or even most heavily, on companies. "Employees will have to pay," said Arthur Drechsler, a senior vice president at the Segal Company, the benefits consultant.
That may be fair or unfair. There is no shortage of experts who think consumers don't pay enough for their health care choices. The tooth fairy, who has emerged as a major policy player, doesn't pay for health care. As Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told a House subcommittee earlier this year, employees are under the impression they don't pay much for health care. They're wrong. A C.B.O. report last fall put it succinctly:
"At first glance, the employment-based system seems to provide workers with insurance at exceptionally low costs, since employers generally pay most of the premium. But a careful analysis shows that in the long run employers' costs are largely shifted back to workers in the form of lower real wages and reduced nonmedical benefits."
The fact that many companies pay 80 to 90 percent of health benefits looks like generosity but is in reality just good business. Both employers and employees receive tax incentives for benefits -- employers in the form of deductions, employees in the form of untaxed income. (The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates the Government is letting $138 billion in revenue slide this year by not taxing benefits. About $43 billion of the total figure is for health care.)
Wages and benefits have been the twin threads in total employee compensation packages for decades. During the World War II-Korean War era, when wage increases were controlled by the Government, companies used benefits to compete for workers. The strategic decision by the labor movement, even after wage controls were lifted, to muscle pensions into the collective bargaining arena cemented the employers' role as the conduit for certain social benefits provided by government in other countries.
OVER the years, benefits have become an increasingly important part of compensation, rising, according to data from the United States Chamber of Commerce, to 36.2 percent of wages and salaries in 1987 from 17 percent in 1955. The rise has occurred as wages have stagnated, in part because of increases in the cost of health care itself. Since 1973, the higher cost of health care and other benefits absorbed about half of the real gains in compensation for full-time employees, according to the C.B.O. report.
"This squeeze on real wages, of course, has meant that workers have less to spend on everything else, and have felt their circumstances quite strained," the C.B.O.'s Mr. Reischauer told the House Ways and Means health subcommittee in March.
There is no question that employers have absorbed some of the increased costs of health care, but they have also gained flexibility by containing salary costs, which become institutionalized, while increasing benefits, which can be adjusted more easily. In the 1980's, the growth in benefits slowed, and increasingly companies are requiring their employees to make a direct contribution to help pay for their insurance.
The fact is that even in the downwardly mobile America of the future, where we can all expect to huddle over Sterno cans, companies will still need to compete for workers, and they will probably do it mainly on wages and benefits. But companies have been pushing the competitive baseline back for a decade now. It seems likely that the cost of health care reform will erode the baseline further, a point being lost in the predictable cacophony about assaults on small business and an American way of life.
 
 
 
WHITHER THE LOW WAGE?
 EMPLOYERS unable to pass on the costs of health care to workers -- that is, employers who now pay the minimum or near-minimum wage -- are not without options. They could, for example, rethink their low-wage strategy. "If firms face higher wages, they are forced to raise the productivity of workers. That's good," said Edith Rasell, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Employers have raised productivity recently by paring workers, but they could do it by reorganizing work or buying new machinery. "Employers are not helpless," Ms. Rasell said.
Much is not known about the details of the Clinton health care reform plan, but it is clear that the wounded cries of low-wage businesses are having an effect. Federal money for benefits may be available, which means that in effect the Government will be subsidizing the low-wage strategy that traps many workers in poverty.

HEADLINE: Woman, Computer Nerd -- and Proud

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER; Katie Hafner, a writer living in Austin, Tex., is co-author of "Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier" (Simon & Schuster).

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
INTRODUCTORY computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is called 6.001, or "double-o-one" for short. It is to aspiring computer scientists what anatomy is to first-year medical students. One of M.I.T.'s most demanding courses, 001 is the initial filter for students bold enough to embark on electrical engineering/computer science, the most popular major at what is arguably the most difficult science school in the nation.
The class, which starts again when M.I.T. opens next week, frightens many students, women in particular. Indeed, fields like computer science and engineering have never attracted many women. 
 But 001 and classes like it didn't intimidate Stephanie Winner, Ellen Spertus or Megan Smith. They breezed through M.I.T. and have since gone on to promising careers in computing. Ms. Winner, 29, now designs custom chips that allow the creation of three-dimensional graphics on a computer. Ms. Spertus, 25, is a graduate student at M.I.T. who writes programs that translate code into language a computer can understand. Ms. Smith, 28, is a mechanical engineer who has helped design the new generation of hand-held computers.
The three are not female Einsteins. But they represent a new generation of talented women who are being taken seriously in a field dominated by men. In their undiluted sense of who they are rather than who society says they ought to be, they have spent their lives turning a stereotype -- that women don't belong in technical fields -- squarely on its head.
While the three women differ in many ways, they share at least one thing besides smarts: Each was bolstered early on by family and teachers who instilled in them a sense that they could do anything.
But in the end, they remain the exceptions in a pile of discouraging statistics. While women receive more than half the bachelor's degrees in the United States, they are awarded fewer than a third of the degrees in science and engineering disciplines, and still fewer advanced degrees. In 1990, 13 percent of the Ph.D.'s in computer science went to women. And though women make up nearly half the nation's work force, they account for just 15 percent of employed scientists and engineers.
For a nation increasingly obsessed with its economic competitiveness, these are distressing numbers to ponder as the new school year begins. In effect, the computer industry never sees nearly half its potential talent pool.
Here are the stories of three women who have defied the odds.
 
Stephanie Winner
 Stephanie Winner never had any doubts about what she wanted to become.
She was a natural at math and science. In the eighth grade, she had her father sign a contract agreeing to send her to M.I.T. or Harvard. Her father, Edward Scheidler, is an electrical engineer turned physician. He had two girls and taught them things he would have taught a pair of boys. He showed them how to wire a house and fix the plumbing. Their mother, Bobbie, a homemaker, taught them to cook. On a trip abroad, he gave 10-year-old Stephanie the job of tracking the currency exchange, calculating mileage and devising a budget.
Throughout high school in Traverse City, Mich., she competed with her boyfriend, another math whiz. When she arrived at M.I.T. in 1981, she couldn't help thinking she'd been accepted because she was a female from the Midwest, or worse, that that's what everyone else was thinking about her. The smart, cocky kids from high schools like Bronx Science and Stuyvesant intimidated her. She was terrified of 001, but she did well in the course.
She knew early that she would major in electrical engineering, which focuses on the computers themselves, as opposed to computer science, which focuses on the software. Specializing in the hardware is unusual for a woman. But being outnumbered by men never bothered her. Petite, freckled and strawberry blond, she got a lot of attention -- and enjoyed it. "There was never a problem finding a lab partner," she says.
After she got her master's degree she married another M.I.T. graduate, Jeff Winner, and they settled in Silicon Valley. Ms. Winner started out designing custom chips at Schlumberger, then was hired by Apple Computer.
She works in Apple's Advanced Technology Group, made up of 180 or so researchers. She designs three-dimensional graphics chips, the engines driving some of the hottest areas in computers: virtual reality (computer simulations of real-world environments), computer-aided design (for molecular and industrial modeling, for example) and medical imaging. Blowups of her chip designs, resembling colorful and intricate maps, cover Ms. Winner's office wall like so much found art.
Ms. Winner designs a computer chip much as an architect might conceive a house, or a poet a poem. She starts with a general sense of what it should look like and what its function should be. "I'll know the high level, the chip's overall character or personality," she says. Then she maps its details, figuring out where to place the hundreds of thousands of transistors so that they do their job most efficiently. It is a task that requires an extremely ordered, systematic and patient mind -- and the creativity to find new ways to improve the product.
Designing computer chips doesn't have the immediate feedback that working on software has. If there's a debilitating bug in software, the programmer knows about it pretty quickly. It takes months to produce a chip design, and after that it has to be "taped out" -- sent for fabrication and testing. It's a tense two-month wait. Just when her most recent chip was due back, Ms. Winner went into labor with her second child. As soon as she was out of delivery she called the office to see whether the chip worked. (It didn't -- but the problem was easily fixed.)
Her time at Apple has been revelatory. She has been mistaken for an area associate -- Applespeak for secretary. If she has a meeting with engineers who don't know her, she makes a point of wearing her Brass Rat, the M.I.T. class ring.
Now she has two children, Erin, 2, and Zoe, 1. Like a lot of women who choose to have both a career and children, she has had to change the way she works. She doesn't necessarily work less, but she definitely works more efficiently.
Ms. Winner attributes her success to two factors: her competitiveness and her perfectionism. "Good engineers are always striving to find the best, most innovative solution," she says. "Mediocre engineers just find a solution."
 
Ellen Spertus
 In her scuffed jacket and T-shirt that says "Masochistic Institute of Technology," Ellen Spertus easily fits the "nerd" mold. She is the first to admit that she isn't like a lot of women. She can program circles around most M.I.T. students, and for that she has gained a lot of respect in a male-dominated community where people are judged not by how they look, what they know or who they know, but by the sophistication of the code they can generate.
Ms. Spertus loved 001. She got an A. Handily. She also loved 004, a course in which students build a computer from a "nerd kit" of circuit boards and chips.
It is for people like Ellen Spertus that Gerry Sussman, an M.I.T. computer science professor who lectures in 001, has nurtured the Nerd Pride movement at M.I.T. While outsiders use the word nerd in a derogatory sense, at M.I.T. the generally accepted definition is someone interested in absolutely everything, except dress. It definitely isn't your Doc Martens crowd.
Professor Sussman had thousands of Nerd Pride buttons made and gave them away. "My idea is to present an image to children that it is good to be intellectual, and not to care about the peer pressures to be anti-intellectual," Professor Sussman explains. "I want every child to turn into a nerd -- where that means someone who prefers studying and learning to competing for social dominance."
Ms. Spertus had been intrigued by M.I.T. for a long time. Her father went there and he encouraged her to apply. Growing up in Glencoe, Ill., a Chicago suburb, she admired the institute for its legendary hacks -- technical pranks that usually had nothing to do with computers but that gave computer hackers their name. Great hacks at M.I.T. have included placing a functioning telephone booth atop the campus's Great Dome and fooling students at a Harvard-Yale football game into holding up giant cards that spelled M.I.T.
Philip Spertus describes the day his daughter was accepted at M.I.T. as "the happiest day of our lives."
Ms. Spertus spent her formative years oblivious to words like "barriers" and "discrimination." That she has come as far as she has says as much about her tunnel vision as it does about her brilliance. She gravitated to computers when she was 6. Her father, who runs a picture-frame manufacturing business, kept a computer terminal in the recreation room that was connected to a computer at his office. (Her mother, Sylvia, was a homemaker at the time.) Ms. Spertus ignored the Playskool kitchen in favor of the ungainly piece of hardware. She started out programming in Basic language, and when she got to junior high school she learned Pascal.
She was bored at regular summer camp, so when she was 12 her parents sent her to a computer camp. She was unfazed by the fact that seven out of every eight campers were boys. Quickly singled out as one of the most gifted young coders, she programmed mystery games and music-generating software.
The person who influenced her most was her older brother, Michael, whose mathematical gifts are legendary at New Trier High School. He taught her math when he was 12 and she was in kindergarten. But more important than the math itself was the love of math and computers he conveyed. He told her stories of Archimedes and of the supercomputer designer Seymour Cray. He took her out to play video games. He taught her to play Adventure, a computer-based world of mazes, dragons and trolls. He introduced her to the math club. And like him, she scored a perfect 800 on the math part of her S.A.T.
For a long time, Ms. Spertus assumed that girls were, for the most part, pretty stupid, that she was a genetic accident. So she made friends with boys. It was boys with whom she competed in math class, and on the math team. She gauged the difficulty of a class by looking around the room: the fewer the girls, the more rigorous the class must be.
Her way of interacting with others is perhaps best described as unfiltered. She seems untouched by concerns -- generally associated with females -- of making certain not to offend or of worrying about whether people will like her. Some might say her spontaneous honesty is antisocial. But there is also something fearless about her.
During her undergraduate years, Ms. Spertus again found that she fit in better with the guys, this time at Tech Square, home to M.I.T.'s computer science department. But gradually she came to see that women weren't intellectually inferior at all. Much of this realization came from attending a class taught by a sociology professor, Sherry Turkle, on women in computing. Ms. Spertus saw for the first time that there were barriers to women excelling in science that had nothing to do with intelligence.
Indeed, being a female nerd is far more difficult than being a male nerd. As early as junior high school, girls who pay no attention to their appearance are pariahs. "Appearance is more central to a girl's self-esteem," says Myra Sadker, dean of the School of Education at American University and co-author of "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls," due out next year. "Girls get self-esteem by being pretty. You don't open Seventeen Magazine and see nerds. Boys can get away with it more easily by being considered just wacky, or weird."
Few American girls receive the encouragement, either from teachers or from parents, to nurture a scientific bent. Social scientists argue that in adolescence girls lose any sense of being gifted at math or science.
In dozens of ways, teachers unwittingly collude in this. Math and science teachers have been found to seek more eye contact with boys, to call on them more often. If a girl gives the wrong answer, it's wrong; if a boy does, the teacher coaxes out the right one.
For Professor Turkle's class Ms. Spertus wrote a paper on the obstacles women face in getting into computer science. She expanded her paper into a 100-page study titled "Why Are There So Few Women in Computer Science?" The research opened her eyes. Women told her of bias both subtle and not, of difficulty in finding a mentor, of sexual advances that had to be fended off, of problems in getting men to take their work seriously.
Ms. Spertus's paper caused a small stir around Tech Square. It encouraged M.I.T. to take a harder look at courses like 001. Critics of the course say that its aggressive, competitive approach to programming is more geared toward male students, that women prefer more teamwork, less one-upsmanship.
Ms. Spertus is taken seriously because of the quality of her work. Her specialty is the compiler, a program that translates code written by a human into language a computer can understand. The goal is to generate the most streamlined machine-executable code. Ms. Spertus first became interested in compilers in junior high school.
At M.I.T. Ms. Spertus writes compilers of new languages for a novel computer called the M.I.T. J-Machine, which uses many processors working in parallel to compute. She has spent several summers working at the Microsoft Corporation, most recently on compiler research. Once she receives her Ph.D., she'd like to remain in research, either at a company or as a professor.
People who know her agree that what makes her a true computer scientist is her passion for the computer as a thing in itself, as opposed to a mere tool, a means to an end. She considers herself a hacker, in the time-honored Tech Square sense. "A hacker, as opposed to J. Random Programmer, knows the ins, outs and idioms of the machine and languages," she explains.
Ms. Spertus is now in a "tenure-track relationship" with another software engineer. Things are going well. They've yet to encounter the "Two Body Problem," an allusion to a phenomenon in physics called the N Body Problem, which discusses the motion of bodies in a field of force. In academic circles it's a way of describing the problem of a couple looking for jobs in the same city.
 
Megan Smith
 Since Megan Smith was 4 and her mother saw her in the back yard building an ornate scarecrow from sticks and tin foil, her life has been a succession of creative adventures.
In grade school in Buffalo, her role model was Harriet the Spy, the consummate tomboy of children's literature. She and her sister organized a Spy Club. In the seventh grade she and her friends played "Star Trek." Which is not to say she shunned dolls. But young Megan had a lot of other things she wanted to do. She was science-fair champion several years in a row. As a senior she got the school's top prize in math and science.
Encouragement from her parents counted for a lot, Ms. Smith says. Her father, Merle, a public-housing consultant, built science-fair projects with her, and he encouraged her to do a lot of watching, to see a bicycle being repaired, to observe a construction crew at work. (Her mother, Joan, is a teacher.)
By far the biggest influence was her teachers at City Honors, a school for gifted children. Ms. Smith recalls their names the way a gourmand recalls the date, location and menu of a memorable meal.
And they all remember her. Vividly. "Megan was a student who possessed a joy of learning that you read about, and actually see every 30 years," says Barry Soffin, Ms. Smith's favorite math teacher. "She always had this humongous smile on her face. Nothing discouraged her. If you said, 'I don't know the answer,' she'd go dig it up."
After taking Woodie Flowers's mechanical design course at M.I.T., Ms. Smith knew she wanted to be a mechanical engineer. Her obsession was with building objects, especially objects with moving parts.
She may have the brains of a nerd, but she carries herself with an easy grace. There is nothing tentative about her. She is tall, with an athlete's limbs. In fact, she is an outstanding athlete.
Ms. Smith has a way of looking spaced out and thoroughly engaged at the same time. Anything the wind blows her way, Ms. Smith thinks is "cool." Her enthusiasm prompts those around her to want to have something to do with whatever she is doing.
Sports, she thinks, played a large role in building her confidence. She ran cross-country track in high school, and at M.I.T. she rowed and swam competitively. Athletics taught her fortitude and discipline, and the ups and downs that come with competition.
Her computing talent came in handy when she started working at the M.I.T. Media Lab. While there, she completed her master's degree with a project on tactile simulation. She designed a joystick with motors underneath to produce a variety of tactile sensations -- bumpiness, slickness, grittiness. While getting her master's she decided to sit in on the infamous 001 course. "It was cool stuff," she says. "I think I wouldn't have been intimidated like other people."
That is, if she had stayed in town. Instead, she and other M.I.T. students built a solar-powered car and raced it across Australia.
Soon after she completed her master's in 1988, Ms. Smith went to work for Apple Computer's office in Tokyo. Two years later, she joined General Magic, a new company in Mountain View, Calif.
General Magic isn't just any start-up in Silicon Valley. It's the start-up. A spinoff of Apple, it was conceived to build a wireless, hand-held device that combines a computer, fax, beeper and phone. General "Magicians" talk about making history. But there is so much talent at General Magic -- its top engineers supplied the brains behind the original Apple Macintosh -- that one is inclined to forgive them their arrogance.
Ms. Smith thinks General Magic is doing "a really cool thing," but not any cooler than, say, building a solar car, winning a swim meet or working with a bunch of local high school kids. Her first job there was to lead a small team in designing prototypes for the device. Ms. Smith was in charge of the device's human interface -- everything the user would see, hear and feel, such as the touch screens and the speaker.
Ms. Smith and her team sawed, drilled and milled their way through three dozen prototypes. But after that initial design phase came what some of her colleagues describe as her drift away from engineering. She thought it might be fun to work with General Magic's corporate partners -- Sony, Motorola and Philips -- in more of a management role. She now spends weeks at a time in Japan and Europe, working with top executives at the partner firms to coordinate the final design and function of the device.
General Magic cultivates a certain techno-machismo, and Ms. Smith finds it disheartening at times. Engineering a way through a problem often involves confrontation and intellectual jousting. She becomes furious when male engineers at General Magic refuse to include her. "You shouldn't have to become a boy to be an engineer," she says.
She occasionally feels guilty for leaving the technical fray. "It's really, really difficult to let it go because you're a pioneer, an example for younger women, and you need to stay in it," she says. "But then you feel drawn into this other stuff."
 
Beyond the Pioneers
 Sheila E. Widnall is living proof that getting drawn into the "other stuff" can bring great rewards. Dr. Widnall was one of 20 women in a class of 900 when she entered M.I.T. in 1956. "People would stop me in the hall and ask, 'Why are you here?' " she says. She became an aeronautical engineer and associate provost at M.I.T. Last month, President Clinton named the 54-year-old Dr. Widnall as Secretary of the Air Force, making her the first woman in charge of one of the military services.
Dr. Widnall has written and lectured extensively on women in engineering. She thinks that girls who show scientific promise in adolescence need a great deal of encouragement. If it doesn't come at that stage, "it takes you much, much longer to reach a level of autonomy and ability," she says.
Researchers who work with teachers to encourage girls to use computers have seen interest rise dramatically among the girls in those classes. "Even with small, haphazard programs there's a remarkable change," says Dr. Sadker of American University.
If the change proves sweeping enough, women like Stephanie Winner, Ellen Spertus and Megan Smith will someday be far from the only ones who consider it a compliment to be called a nerd.

HEADLINE: Profile: Jan Thompson;
Mazda's Hard-Driving Saleswoman

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif.

 BODY:
JAN THOMPSON created quite a stir on her first day of work at the Chrysler Corporation 20 years ago. She was the first female management trainee at the big auto maker's field services division, and the workers there almost tripped over each other to get the lowdown on her.
"I'll never forget that first day," she said. "People were staring at me, car dealers were calling, the regional managers were stopping by the office, all wanting to know what it was going to be like having a woman out in the field. At the time, I was oblivious to the whole thing. It was just a job to me." 
 Two decades later, all eyes are once again focused on the 43-year-old Detroit native, named vice president of sales last week by the Mazda Motor Corporation in a heavy reorganization of its troubled United States operations. The appointment followed the dismissal of five top executives and the announcement of plans to cut 175 employees from Mazda's 500-person headquarters staff here.
The appointment of a woman to such a high position was virtually unheard of among Japanese and even the Big Three auto makers until Ms. Thompson came along. Although she thinks such opportunities are expanding for women worldwide, she is, at the moment at least, arguably the most prominent female executive in the auto industry.
Ms. Thompson said that a ranking female executive is such a rarity in Japan that when she recently had tea with colleagues at a Tokyo coffee house, the waitresses pointed at her, whispering and giggling.
Industry executives and consultants who have worked with Ms. Thompson describe her as a tough, aggressive manager who has a proven track record in marketing, sales and advertising. She is credited with enhancing Mazda's image and with assembling the marketing team that devised the highly successful slogan, "Mazda. It just feels right."
"She's a capable individual who understands how to put together a winning product, and Mazda was very smart to hold onto her," said Christopher Cedergrem, senior vice president for the Auto Pacific Group, a consulting and market-research firm based in Santa Ana, Calif.
J. Ferron, senior partner for J. D. Power & Associates, the automobile consulting firm, called Ms. Thompson a "no-nonsense, extremely intelligent workaholic who has a lot of credibility with Mazda dealers."
"She is not afraid to tell it like it is, which appeals to dealers," he said. "I don't think she suffers fools."
In an interview last week at Mazda headquarters in this community south of Los Angeles, Ms. Thompson spoke about life as an executive for a Japanese company.
"The Japanese don't expect me to walk 10 paces behind them, and chances are that I would already be way ahead of them because I often run down the hallway in a hurry," she said. "These Japanese guys respect good analysis and good opinions and I don't think they really care anymore if it comes from a man or a woman."
But sometimes things can get a little awkward. In Tokyo recently, Ms. Thompson found herself the only woman in a karaoke bar full of auto executives. "I've got the microphone in my hand, and I'm singing in front of all these men, 'Love me tender, love me true,' and I'm thinking to myself this is really weird," she said. "But it's the sort of thing you have to do when in Rome."
In her new role at Mazda, Ms. Thompson will oversee United States sales operations, including marketing and distribution to dealers. "Essentially, her job will be to insure that the right products get to the right customers by coordinating and integrating marketing, ordering and production," Mr. Ferron of J. D. Power said.
This will be no easy task. Japanese auto makers are now facing very tough market conditions. For example, Mazda's United States sales are down 6 percent from last year, hurt by soft demand and a strong yen that makes Japanese cars and other exports more expensive here.
Mazda is taking several steps to deal with these difficult conditions. Besides the dismissals announced last week, Mazda cut 200 jobs last February, and it has initiated a number of cost-cutting measures.
These cutbacks are painful but necessary, Ms. Thompson believes. "Already we have seen that our communications are faster because the organization is streamlined, and that makes us more competitive."
On the sales side, Ms. Thompson said that a top priority will be to supply dealers with cars that are in high demand in order to reduce dealer carrying costs and to raise sales.
"The key to selling product quicker is getting the right product to the dealer, not necessarily a bigger rebate," she said. "We can't continue to afford bigger rebates, so I would like to saturate market demand first." To do so, she must identify which models are the hottest sellers in which regions, and then speed up production and delivery of those cars to the appropriate dealers.
Ms. Thompson will also place heavy emphasis on selling the 626 and Mx6 models, which are built in the United States and are not subject to the fluctuations of the yen.
ALTHOUGH she arrives at the office at 7 A.M. and does not leave until 12 hours later, Ms. Thompson denied that she is a workaholic, saying that work is just what she enjoys most.
Still, the executive finds time to jog three miles a day, and is an avid golfer and serves on the board of the Ladies Professional Golf Association.
Ms. Thompson said she picked up golf out of necessity as a young district manager for Chrysler in 1974. "I called on a dealer one day and he said, 'Girl, do you play golf?' I said that I could hit it, and he said, 'If you want to make it in this business you have to play golf.' So I learned."
Ms. Thompson began her career at Chrysler after receiving a B.A. in marketing from Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, and an M.B.A. from the University of Detroit.
She worked at Chrysler for 12 years in various field positions in Detroit, Denver and Los Angeles, leaving in 1984 for Toyota, where she held a number of marketing and advertising positions, the last as national marketing manager for the Lexus division. She has served as Mazda'svice president of marketing from 1988 until her recent promotion.
Ms. Thompson, who is single, said her favorite pastime is taking her white Miata convertible out for a spin on the Pacific Coast Highway, with her musician of choice playing on compact disk. Her current favorite: Kenny Loggins.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Will the Bulls of August Hibernate Come October? 

Anyone out there superstitious? Six Augusts ago, stock prices soared to record levels, and you know what happened two months later. Last week the Dow, like a sprinter on steroids, kept knocking off records, hitting 3,652.09 on Wednesday before retreating slightly by the end of the week. Why such bullishness? Interest rates, of course. With bond yields almost invisible, where else to put money besides stocks? But one investment strategist had another reason: "Congress and the President are on vacation, so they can't possibly do any damage until after Labor Day." Can't argue with that. Does this mean stocks are teetering on a cliff? Maybe. The worriers say that in search of yields, investors have taken on too much risk in stocks. But note that in 1987 the Dow rose 44 percent from Jan. 1 to its August peak, while this year it has crept ahead just 10 percent. So the answer is . . . well, check back in October.

Economy's Up, Economy's Down
 
Confused about the economy's health, as good news alternates maddeningly with bad? Take heart: clarity is on the way. "We'll have to wait until after Labor Day," a Treasury official said last week, "just to know what the economy is doing now." The official was commenting on the latest pair of seesaw numbers, a 5.4 percent jump in existing-home sales in July, balanced by a 3.8 percent drop in factory orders, the sharpest in 19 months. The rise in home sales is understandable, given bargain-basement mortgage rates, but factory orders show that manufacturing remains sickly.
 
Phone Concerns Win on TV . . .
 
Telecommunications. It's a household word, but it's certainly not spoken in many households. Not yet. In the home of the future, all our overlapping gadgets could be banished in favor of a "telecommunications set," used to make calls, get news, order pizza, watch movies, pay bills -- and do things not yet dreamt of. It's coming: Last week a Federal court ruled that phone companies could deliver their own television programming, paving the way for a pitched battle, or new cooperation, with the cable folks. The ruling was a victory for Bell Atlantic, which plans 384 channels in Alexandria, Va., and, some say, a victory for consumers: competition could mean lower prices. But 384 channels? It makes the head spin.
 
 . . . but Cable Wins One, Too
 
A high-stakes game of chicken between network television and cable operators ended as the last network gave in. Networks had the right to demand fees for the use of their signals, but cable said, "Forget it: we'll just drop the networks." So the choice would have been cable without networks or networks without cable, either one of which sounds vaguely un-American. But cable's bluff was apparently the more terrifying, for one by one the networks blinked, with CBS last week joining its colleagues in dropping demands for fees.
 
'Star Wars II': A Trip to Mars?
 
The apparent failure of the Mars Observer could put the Government in the recycling business. As hope dwindled last week for renewed contact with the wayward spacecraft, ideas started cropping up at NASA and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., about new, cheaper ways to get a peek at the elusive planet. One idea that will surely appeal to enemies of Government waste: modifying small, inexpensive "Star Wars" satellites and hurling them toward Mars. ("Inexpensive," of course, does not mean $29.95; more like $75 million, but that's a far cry from $1 billion for the Mars Observer.) And another idea would be closer collaboration with Europe and Russia. We're in this together, after all.
 
Wetlands: There's a Timely Topic
 
Wetlands are always a hot issue, especially in their role as wildlife habitats, but they also play a role in flood protection -- a timely topic. Last week, even as the boss was getting wet with the Kennedys, the Administration put its stamp on wetlands policy, and ended up in the soggy middle of the road. It did protect more Alaska wetlands and closed some loopholes for developers. But some environmentalists said it just opened other loopholes. One commitment remains, though: no further net loss of wetlands. The Government estimates that in the 48 states, wetlands have shrunk from 230 million acres to 100 million since the Europeans waded ashore.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
City Hall, Maybe, but Wal-Mart?
 
There was a certain tilting-at-windmills quality to a court battle joined last week in Arkansas. Local druggists say Wal-Mart tried to drive them out of business by selling goods below cost. But could the clock really be turned back? Much as one may lament the passing of "It's a Wonderful Life"-era druggists, the Wal-Mart Age is undeniably here. You can't keep 'em down on the farm once they've seen a superstore. And are "loss leaders" anything new? Groceries from Mom & Pop to Stop & Shop have used them for years.
 
You Don't Even Need a Ladder
 
Going to Toys "R" Us is, well, awesome. A stark warehouse with endless canyons stuffed ceiling-high with every toy imaginable -- and some beyond imagining. If parents think their children have a lot of toys, the staggering volume quickly trims those thoughts down to size. But wait -- does a restful oasis loom? Toys "R" Us said last week that by October, 170 of its stores will have Books "R" Us departments -- carpeted, low-rise pockets of child-friendliness that will even have (gasp!) salespeople. Since children "don't typically want to go to a bookstore," a company executive said, this was a perfect opportunity.
 
Lashing Out at Health Fraud
 
Health care fraud is definitely a big-ticket item on this nation's balance sheet; any tinkering with the system will mean little unless abuse can be tamed. Last week the Feds took on what they see as a prime culprit, raiding offices and hospitals run by National Medical Enterprises. Officials said National Medical had conspired to defraud patients and insurers, and the company is already being sued by a dozen insurers and 130 former patients. And they're not talking about painless number-juggling; many lawsuits contend the unthinkable: that patients were held in psychiatric hospitals unnecessarily.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Getting Tough With China
 
With China, politics and commerce often collide, and something's got to give. President Clinton, after promising toughness on human rights, extended China's most-favored-nation status. But last week, in American eyes, the offense was more severe. Accusing the Chinese of selling missile technology to Pakistan, the United States said it would ban almost $1 billion in high-tech exports to China. That, of course, hurts companies like Hughes Aircraft, which has contracted to sell China a satellite and a ground station for $80 million.
 
Japan's Humbled Auto Makers
 
Is mighty Japan really losing its magic on the world auto stage? Consider last week's news: Mazda dismissed its top American executive and said it would cut its headquarters staff in California by 35 percent. Honda continued its startling nosedive by posting quarterly earnings off 62 percent; it's got a lot riding on a new Accord to be unveiled this week. And Toyota, announcing a 26 percent profit drop for its fiscal year, suggested the unthinkable: a loss next year if the yen stays strong. It would be the first operating loss ever. And the exchange rate is not Toyota's only enemy: even in Japan sales were off 7.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Brick Sidewalks And the Test of Time

 BODY:
I was pleased to see the Aug. 1 article "Preservation Battle Over a Firehouse." While the Ridgewood Firehouse issue has many pros and cons, may I take a moment to refer to another aspect of Ridgewood that most people would probably feel is a positive step in the revitalization of downtown Ridgewood: new sidewalks.
The use of a red brick border motif gives a unique character to an otherwise prosaic project -- mundane sidewalks. While the laying of a concrete sidewalk exhibits a high level of industrial art, the proper placement of red bricks reflects pure artistry. 
 Others may only see the denotation of the red bricks in terms of their practicality: something to walk upon. I, however, see the connotation: the intregration of downtown Ridgewood into a unity of expression rather than a diverse assemblage of old "taxpayer" buildings.
Now comes the blow. The question may well be asked as to how long the red bricks will survive.
About five years ago, while visiting Salem, Mass., I walked about Pickering Wharf, where new red brick sidewalks had been hurriedly laid. Within a few years, they were already upheaving and cracking.
I also walked in the older area of Salem, where huge homes were set back from the curb, similar to what we see on many Ridgewood streets. The homes were lined up in a manner that reminds one of well-trained soldiers in serried, straight-as-an-arrow ranks. The unifying motif of these streets was the red brick sidewalks, which have lasted 200 years.
Will Ridgewood's red bricks also stand the test of time?

Failed Stores Now a Cabaret

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace

 BODY:
LATE next month, a 300-seat cabaret is scheduled to open here in what once was an 8,000-square-foot The Limited clothing store in a failed retail center known as Newmarket.
The first production by the cabaret's owners, Shelly Gross and Allen Shore (the latter was an original co-producer of "Driving Miss Daisy"), will be "Forever Plaid." Mr. Gross would discuss neither the terms of the five-year lease nor the cost of the renovations. 
 "There's been a need for a really nice off-Broadway kind of theater in Philadelphia for some time," said Mr. Gross, who owns the theaters in the Valley Forge Music Fair in suburban Philadelphia and the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island. "We'd like to see a series of art galleries, boutiques, and food there and redevelop the whole Newmarket property.'
Newmarket's owners, Gloria Levin and Michael diPaolo, spent about $8 million to acquire the three-acre site near the thriving Delaware River waterfront in 1986 and expect renovations to reach $7 million. Ms. Levin said the renovation financing would come from public and private sources.
The site was named in 1745 as the city's second open-air produce and food market. Several 18th-century structures were retained in a modern retail and restaurant project that opened there in 1975 with 50,000 square feet, 40 percent of which was devoted to restaurants.
The property covers Front Street to Head House Square -- which replaces Second Street -- between South and Lombard Streets.
Ms. Levin conceded that the image of Newmarket for many younger people was that of a dormant retail center.
"Whenever there's a project that's had problems, it's always a tough sell," she said. "But there's tremendous proximity to all the shops and restaurants in the South Street area and we're close to the waterfront."
A 500-seat theater is planned in a new 10,000-square-foot structure, contingent on getting a tenant, she said. Several restaurants, galleries and shops are proposed to serve both tourists and the dense residential population nearby.
Communty opposition to a parking garage, as well as the recession, delayed Newmarket's revival, she said. A 245-space parking lot proved the compromise.
Early this year, South Street merchants formed a special services district for street cleaning, security and joint promotions for the area. Property owners and commercial tenants will pay a 7 percent assessment this year to raise $256,000 for the group.
The district is bounded by Front Street on the east, 11th Street on the west, Lombard Street on the north and Bainbridge Street on the south.
"South Street stores are probably 95 percent full right now," said Harris Eckstut, chairman of the district and owner of the Montserrat restaurant there. "South Street's been here for nearly 300 years. We are looking forward to another 300 years."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Making Japan Cheaper For the Japanese

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
PRIME MINISTER MORIHIRO HOSOKAWA finally brought his campaign for sweeping change to Parliament last week, only to get heckled, then challenged for being vague in his prescriptions for giving the long-suffering consumer a break from Japan's famously high prices. But if there was a lesson in this bruising start, it was that the best place to watch for real reform may not be the imposing Parliament building but Yukio Higuchi's liquor stores.
Mr. Higuchi runs that rarest of Japanese companies, a discounter. He also relies heavily on imports, and so the soaring value of the yen recently has been a godsend, allowing him to undercut domestic spirits producers and the legions of stodgy retailers who refuse to pass along the benefits of the strong currency to their customers. 
 The price of a bottle of Chivas Regal scotch at his stores, Kawachiya Shuhan, has tumbled from 3,500 yen last September to 2,690 yen, or the current equivalent of $25.90, while Early Times bourbon now runs 1,490 yen a bottle, or $14.35, down from 1,980 last fall.
There are a growing number of such agents of change here these days, retailers trying to deliver what even American trade negotiators are demanding, a welcome for imports. They are also delivering the sort of savings Mr. Hosokawa and his new Government have advocated in their efforts to turn four decades of economic policy on its head; he wants the Government to favor corporate Japan less and its consumers more.
But Mr. Higuchi's entrepreneurial instincts have run smack into the most conservative force in Japan, the bureaucracy.
It is almost impossible to obtain new liquor licenses in Tokyo, so Mr. Higuchi has been purchasing small shops and expanding their premises to produce the sales volumes he needs to thrive. It seemed a clever way to build the business until the Finance Ministry's tax authorities laid a snare. Last month they issued a "guidance," an informal dictate restricting his ability to buy and expand stores. "This guidance is just intended to crush discounters," Mr. Higuchi howled. "But my hopes are high for Mr. Hosokawa."
Mr. Hosokawa's Government faces many tests, such as cleaning up the electoral system and meeting President Clinton's economic demands, but the most decisive may be whether it can deliver relief to a people who have started to realize that it may not be essential to the nation's health for its consumers to pay among the highest prices in the world.
As bad as price differentials have been in the past, they are worse now because the yen has risen to record levels on currency markets. (The dollar closed Friday in New York at $103.85 yen.) In dollar terms, many Japanese prices have gone from outrageous to ridiculous.
A movie ticket here costs the equivalent of more than $17, compared to $7.50 in New York. A Big Mac at McDonald's is $3.66, 20 percent more than the New York version. And the average price for an apartment -- whose average size in Tokyo is 680 square feet -- was an astounding 50.66 million yen, or $488,000.
Economists say that in most instances these differentials are a product of Government policies, such as tax laws, or a byzantine distribution system that inflates prices. And then there is the bureaucracy.
 
Protection or Intimidation?
 Toshio Miyaji, who owns several chains of stores that discount electronic appliances and other consumer products, said the Health and Welfare Ministry all but prohibited him recently from selling famous foreign brand name cosmetics because he refused to place a label on the goods identifying the importer. The ministry says the rule is for consumer protection. Mr. Miyaji suggested it was a ruse to flush out importers who defy the usual retail system by selling goods to discounters, and thus amounted to a subtle form of intimidation.
"This is like fighting against the Berlin Wall," he said. "I'm determined to keep up my efforts until it comes down."
One of the most telling aspects of Mr. Hosokawa's stated ambition to tear down this economic wall is that he had to mention the need to pass along the benefits of the stronger yen to consumers. In a market economy, the theory goes, clever businessmen will undercut retailers who refuse to reduce prices on imports. Open-minded consumers, of course, will flock to those stores.
The mind-set opposing such a tactic is so ingrained here, though, that it is taking an initiative from the nation's leader to spread the message that price competition is a good thing.
An important factor helping Mr. Hosokawa is that big corporations have started to jump on the deregulation bandwagon, even though they benefited from the Government's big-business orientation in the past. With the strong yen hurting exports and a recession stifling growth, companies are looking to a freeing up of domestic markets as a way to generate new sales.
"I think deregulation efforts haven't borne any fruit yet because the system remains stiff," Isao Ichikawa, vice chairman of the Nikon Corp., said in a newspaper interview. "I'm afraid the Japanese economy will sink unless we take more steps to decontrol and deregulate."
And the business establishment has been weighing in with reports to encourage the trend. The Japan Research Institute, which is affiliated with the Sumitomo Bank, said last week that a package of broad deregulation would create nearly 12 trillion yen of new economic activity, or the equivalent of $120 billion.
"The changes are already started," insisted Haruo Shimada, an economist at Keio University and an adviser to the new Government. "Each step may be small, but if you take 2,000 such steps things start to happen. The bottom line is that market forces are penetrating."
Even the Finance Ministry has responded to Mr. Hosokawa's call for each ministry to draw up a list of regulations it is willing to streamline quickly. The Finance Ministry thought it over and said that it had decided to relax the regulations on obtaining licenses to open liquor stores.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Legal Gambling Faces Higher Odds

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
STEP UP and bet those dollars. Roll the dice at the Indian casinos. Try the state lottery. Climb aboard the bobbing riverboats. Who cares what. Just gamble!
That seems to be the cry across the land as politicians embrace games of chance to prop up their economies and bring in more revenue. Ever since New Hampshire adopted the first state lottery in 1964, and especially in the last few years, legalized gambling has come increasingly into the mainstream of American leisure activity. In 1992, a record $329.9 billion was bet on all its forms. Once winnings were deducted, that left gross revenues of $29.9 billion for governments and gaming establishments, more than six times what people spent on movie tickets. 
 But often lost in the frenzied wagering is any sober analysis of whether gambling actually works magic on the economy and helps governments make ends meet, as sponsors of legalized gambling invariably promise. What public good, if any, does it accomplish?
Some experts who contemplate the public policy implications of gambling are dubious. While most observers of the phenomenon expect the surge to proceed with relentless fervor probably past the turn of the century, some think states and municipalities by then will begin to dissect the record of gambling and lots of them will find it even less attractive than the odds at a slot machine. These experts warn of gambling spreading itself too thinly, and of the hidden social and fiscal costs that make gambling revenues not quite the bonanza they might at first seem.
"There will be a realization that most gambling products don't benefit the economy," said William N. Thompson, professor of public administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. "There will be a weaning out. You'll have some casinos and some lotteries. A few riverboats will be around. A few horse tracks. All this will satisfy a certain unstimulated demand that, if there were no legal gambling, would turn to illegal gambling. But we'll say, let's not count on this to support our government."
 
In the Mainstream
 I. Nelson Rose, a gambling expert and law professor at the Whittier Law School in Los Angeles, is both bleaker and more precise. He predicts that all gambling -- every last roulette wheel -- will be outlawed by 2029. "It's better if you have an exact date," he said of his theory. "So that's my date."
Many scoff at this. Gambling flourishes in every state but Utah and Hawaii, and it is hard to imagine it all vanishing. "Commercial games have entered the mainstream of American life and I think they will stay there," said Eugene Christiansen, president of Christiansen/Cummings, a consulting firm with expertise in commercial gambling.
The boom in legal gambling is largely attributable to the fact that politicians have been unable or unwilling to pursue tax increases and have welcomed gambling as a seemingly painless way to raise money. "So there is this rush to pick the free dollars off the gambling tree," said Mr. Thompson. "But the dollars from gambling are not free."
They are free to one state when they come out of the pockets of tourists. Nevada lives bountifully off visitors, thanks to gambling. But when the dollars flow from residents, as the bulk of them do in state lotteries, then they really represent a tax, and generally a regressive and inefficient one.
Mr. Thompson is among the critics of the state lottery. "It's not stable, being subject to the whims of the public," he said. "It falls most heavily on poor people. It takes a commercial establishment to raise the money, which is expensive. And you have government promoting gambling, which is probably not a proper role."
Indeed, lottery directors have been moaning about disappointing growth and are scrambling to introduce new products. The latest craze is video lottery machines.
Casinos and other gaming establishments provide more in the way of economic development than lotteries do, since they create a considerable number of jobs. But increased competition creates losers, too. Horse tracks, buffeted by many factors, continue to wither and die with the spread of alternate forms of wagering. Seven of the 13 Atlantic City casinos have had to seek bankruptcy protection, and the town's most prominent proprietor, Donald Trump, has sued the Federal Government on the ground that it is giving unfair advantage to Indian tribes setting up casinos. Las Vegas, meanwhile, is feeling pressure from new casinos in states like Louisiana.
"With competition, you will see revenues flatten out pretty quickly," said Judy Cornelius, associate director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada, Reno. "We've seen this in Deadwood, South Dakota, now that every souvenir shop has become a casino of some sort."
Communities can pay dearly in the social costs of gambling. A certain percentage of people become compulsive gamblers. Since gambling is a cash business, it lures criminals. It is commonly thought that the poor are abused. "Lotteries are selling hope," Mr. Christiansen said. "It's the poor who hope the most."
Gambling is commonly held out as an elixir for a debilitated community. Fifteen years later, it has hardly been that for Atlantic City, despite some recent improvements.
Mr. Rose insists that while the public is more tolerant of gambling as an alternative to higher taxes, it has not truly accepted its morality. And thus he foresees a moral backlash. "People will say, 'We don't want our kids betting on sports machines produced by the state,' " he said.
he likes to portray the current infatuation with legalized gambling as a third wave in American history. The first encompassed the lotteries of colonial times and ended in the 1820's. The second ushered in the casinos of the Wild West and the lotteries in the South after the Civil War. The latest wave has its roots in the 1930's, when casinos were legalized in Nevada and 21 states opened horse tracks, and began its recent spurt with the New Hampshire lottery.
"We banned gambling 70 years ago," Mr. Rose said. "We will do it again."
Perhaps. And then on to the fourth wave.

HEADLINE: As Easterners Try to Save West, Westerners Blanch

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MISSOULA, Mont.

 BODY:
The West is crowded with vacationing Easterners this time of year, including a small posse of senators on horseback, members of Congress wading through trout streams and earnest young political aides sampling clean air and ungarnished food.
But when Eastern politicians take their holidays to the wide open spaces, many Western politicians tend to get nervous. To hear some senators from the West tell it, a visiting representative from an eastern state is held in about the same regard as a missionary by a defiant pagan.
 
Lifting the Drawbridge
 "They come to see the intrinsic beauty of Montana, but then they go home and want to save it all in perpetuity," said Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana. 
 Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, said, "They tend to go to the splendid watering holes and listen to people that aren't really natives who want to close the gate now that they're in." Most Westerners, he added, do not need outside help in deciding what is best for the land -- an assertion that is challenged by other residents here.
Every summer brings a fresh target. This year, the source of much Western political ridicule is Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a first-term Democrat from Manhattan. Earlier this summer, Ms. Maloney, who visited Yellowstone National Park as a tourist, introduced a bill that would prohibit any development on 16.3 million acres of Rocky Mountain high country in five states -- an area bigger than Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont combined.
The bill, the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act, was going to be introduced by Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts and a longtime backpacker in the West, who says he earned his stripes there guiding hikers in the Cascade Mountains and rafting dozens of swift-flowing rivers.
But Mr. Kennedy backed off after Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, threatened to use his Senate influence to block money for cleaning up Boston Harbor. Mr. Kennedy was furious. "We learned a cold, hard lesson in special-interest politics at their very worst," he said.
This tension goes back to the days of Teddy Roosevelt, a New York City native who spent many summers in the West and devoted a great deal of his political career to protecting forests and wildlife habitat from the excesses of civilization. His legacy is all over the map of the West, from national forests to parks and wildlife refuges.
 
Easterners' 'Guilt Complex'
 Roosevelt and his modern counterparts have long said their goal is to save for future generations land that is owned by all Americans. And indeed, most of the great natural-resources battles in the West are over Federal land. But the Western politicians said the Easterners would not apply the same standard to their own states.
"The East Coast establishment has this idea that they need to protect us from ourselves, and they feel that way because they have a guilt complex about what they did to their own land," said Lieut. Gov. Jack Coghill of Alaska. Mr. Coghill was particularly critical of Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, both of whom were in Alaska this month. And although neither man has emerged with any major policy initiatives, and despite the fact that Mr. Babbitt is a third-generation Westerner from Arizona, Mr. Coghill is leery.
"They've seen all this great beauty, and now you have to watch out for them," he said.
The Governor of Alaska, Walter J. Hickel, has sarcastically countered the well-meaning Easterners by suggesting that large sections of their territory be set aside as wilderness. "We could begin with a designation to clean up that eyesore corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C.," said Governor Hickel.
 
Allies Within
 Mr. Hickel, Mr. Wallop and others paint the vacationing Easterners as out of touch with the sentiments of those most affected by conditions in the West: the people who live here. But that argument ignores the numerous allies they have living in the region.
During the 1980's, for example, Representative Robert J. Mrazek, a Democrat from Long Island, was the chief proponent of a bill to protect forests in southeastern Alaska. Mr. Mrazek left Congress last year after an unsuccessful run for the Senate, but there are still cars in Sitka, Alaska, with bumper stickers that read, "Bob Mrazek is my Congressman."
Mr. Mrazek has since founded the Alaska Conservation League, in Washington.
Although no politicians in the Rocky Mountain West have signed on in support of the bill introduced by Ms. Maloney, several hundred small businesses and interest groups in Montana, most of them tied to the outdoor recreation industry, are backing it.
 
Upper East Side Preserve?
 But even though she has allies in the West, it is Ms. Maloney who has been the target of most of the criticism by the region's politicians. Senator Baucus said she should be more concerned about her constituents in Manhattan, N.Y., than the people of Manhattan, Mont.
Senator Wallop declared, "No set of damn fools, movie actors and representatives of silk stocking districts are going to take over the economy of the West as long as I'm around." He has suggested giving Ms. Maloney's district on the Upper East Side of Manhattan back to its original owners, the Indians.
Vacationing in Europe, Ms. Maloney was unavailable for comment. But an aide, Andrew Lowenthal, defended the right of Eastern lawmakers to protect the West. "These are Federal lands, the province of every American," he said. "A few windy press releases from Senator Wallop are not going to scare her."
He added that some of the West's most beautiful places had been set aside over objections from Western politicians. Montana's biggest outdoor playground, for example, is the Bob Marshall Wilderness, where Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, was hiking in mid-August -- a few ridges away from Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, a fisherman.
 
Risk-Free Environmentalism
 The Western politicians argue that because there are no big sections of Federal land to speak of in the East, it is a risk-free political move for the Easterners to advocate setting aside large tracts of the West.
"It's very easy to be an armchair environmentalist from the East Coast who says we have to save your state from the natives," said Mark Smith, an aide to Senator Baucus, who was touring China.
But for all his criticism of out-of-state environmental advocates, Mr. Baucus himself has come under fire for the same thing. Two years ago, he voted to set aside part of the Arctic coast in Alaska as formal wilderness, and as a result was blasted by Alaska's two Senators for meddling in their state's land affairs.
In his own territory, Senator Baucus has supported a wilderness bill, but a much smaller one. It would set aside about 1.5 million acres in Montana, less than half the area of the state called for by Ms. Maloney.
The Senator's critics in Montana question whether he can truly represent the interests of wilderness areas because of pressure from the timber and mining industries -- an argument Mr. Baucus disputes.
Dan Funsch, a leader of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies based here in Missoula, said environmentalists like his group "had no choice but to find out-of-state people to back our bill."
 
Vacation Inspiration
 "Some of these Western senators want the American taxpayers to subsidize logging and mining in this region but they don't want to let them participate in the discussion and decisions on what to do with these lands," Mr. Funsch said.
The big wilderness bill has attracted 24 co-sponsors -- Republicans, Democrats and the House's one independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont. Many of the co-sponsors said they decided to back the bill after vacationing in the area.
So it is little wonder then, that even a seemingly innocuous visit by someone like State Senator Roy Goodman from New York, who was seen in Jackson, Wyo., this summer sporting a bolo tie and a sunburn, can arouse some suspicion.
"I'm not saying they shouldn't visit our state," said Senator Wallop. "But they should try to understand that the gene pool out here is different."

HEADLINE: Clintons Go Putting At Miniature Golf On Vacation Outing

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Aug. 28

 BODY:
Vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, President Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, got in some old-fashioned family entertainment today with a round of miniature golf.
"This isn't fair!" Mrs. Clinton exclaimed when she missed her putt -- not for the first time -- and her ball rolled down an incline on the Island Cove Mini Golf course. 
 Thirteen-year-old Chelsea hit her ball where her father directed, but it went wide of the hole.
"I hit it right where you said, Dad," she protested.
 
Everyday Outing
 Chelsea told reporters that Mr. Clinton had won the match and that she came in second, leaving Mrs. Clinton in third place.
The outing at the miniature golf course showed the President and his family in a more populist light than sporadic visits to real golf courses in his 11-day vacation on the island off Massachusetts. The Clintons have spent much of their time taking part in more elite activities with some of the rich and famous people here.
The Clintons later attended a party at the residence of the singer Carly Simon. They had sailed with her ex-husband, the singer James Taylor, on Friday.
In his weekly radio broadcast, Mr. Clinton sent word today to a march in Washington commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech, pledging to work for that dream. Mr. Clinton taped the broadcast on Friday in the oceanfront home where he has been staying since Aug. 19.
He is to return to Washington on Sunday tp face a busy fall agenda that includes announcing a proposal for an overhaul of the nation's health care system and Congressional debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Associated Press reported that Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, who gave the Republican response to Mr. Clinton's radio address, praised the President's stepped-up effort to win approval of the trade agreement.
"Most Republicans understand that the best way to expand our economic growth is to expand foreign trade," she said. "We believe our workers and farmers and businesses need a chance to compete fairly and effectively in world markets. We believe Nafta is a significant step in that direction."

HEADLINE: King's Speech Commemerated by Thousands

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered today by tens of thousands of marchers who braved the grueling August heat to commemorate the day 30 years ago when "I have a dream" entered the nation's consciousness.
They gathered round the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where the minister from Georgia had sketched his vision of a truly integrated democracy and helped lay the groundwork for the civil rights laws of the 1960's. Marching under the banner of "Jobs, Justice and Peace," this was a varied crowd, ranging from veterans of the movement, like Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King, to leaders of organized labor, feminists and other causes that seek to capture the movement's spirit. 
 President Clinton, vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, paid tribute to Dr. King in a statement, and some members of his Administration showed up to march, including Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Attorney General Janet Reno, who walked arm-in-arm with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Also on hand were political luminaries like Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, the first black elected Governor; Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, the first black woman in the Senate, and Lani Guinier, who became a cause celebre in civil rights circles when she was nominated as assistant attorney general for civil rights only to see her nomination withdrawn by Mr. Clinton.
 
Comments for Clinton
 The gathering did not reflect the adversarial tone toward the White House that was often the norm for civil rights events in the Reagan and Bush years, but there were a few signs of strain, or at least high expectations. Several speakers reminded Mr. Clinton that he won the Presidency with the support of black and liberal voters, and they were counting on him to deliver, on issues from job creation to urban aid.
"The civil rights movement in the United States is alive, well, expanding, building and growing," asserted the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
He added, to the President, "When you come back from your vacation, we want you to know there's another vineyard, in the 'hood."
Mr. Jackson declared that while much had changed for the better in 30 years, much had not. "Thirty years later, there are more poor people," he said. "The ghettos and barrios of our cities are more abandoned, more endangered."
While the President was elected with a promise to "rebuild America," the Administration now pleads the primacy of the deficit, Mr. Jackson said, and what Dr. King referred to as a "promissory note" was bouncing once again.
The United States Park Police estimated at 3:30 P.M. that a crowd of 75,000 had gathered, which was more than the 55,000 the police estimated were at the 25th anniversary of the 1963 march. The original march drew an estimated 250,000.
Organizers of the march today claimed the crowd was much bigger than the police estimates.
 
'Job Has Just Begun'
 Mr. Clinton used his radio address today to praise the memory of the slain civil rights leader and to present his Administration's domestic agenda as a continuation of Dr. King's work.
"We owe it to him -- to his work, to his memory -- to rededicate ourselves today to the causes of civil rights, civic responsibility and economic opportunity for every American," the President said. "In the last seven months, we've made some great strides on that road."
Echoing the theme of many marchers today, Mr. Clinton added, "The job has just begun." Overhauling the health care system, he argued, would go far toward insuring many Americans of the economic security they seek.
But Mr. Clinton explicitly parted with many marchers today by calling once again for the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is bitterly opposed by organized labor.
The crowd that gathered in the unforgiving heat of the Washington Mall included a heavy representation from labor. There were busloads of United Auto Workers from the Midwest, including Bobbie Lee Turner, of Anderson, Ind., who said this was his first time in the nation's capital. There were steelworkers and teachers and members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 
Memories of King
 Hundreds of striking miners came from the Appalachian coal fields, cheering on Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers, when he declared, "Then as now, the issue is jobs; then as now, the issue is dignity; then as now, the issue is justice."
The cadence that dominated the day, however, was that of Dr. King. He was quoted by speakers, pictured on T-shirts and invoked on placards and banners. And he was remembered by the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement and the then-young lieutenants who were at his side for the struggles of the 1960's.
Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, was the 23-year-old chairman of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee when he spoke to the march in 1963. "It's important to say to the nation that if we're going to continue to move toward the beloved community, a truly biracial democracy, we're going to have to fight for it, to keep working for it," Mr. Lewis said in an interview before today's march.
Still, the march had its critics, who asserted that despite its theme of "passing the torch" of leadership, the event was too dominated by the old guard of the civil rights movement, and had too sprawling an agenda, given the acute problems of the inner cities. Much of that criticism was overshadowed, however, once the march began.
The Rev. Benjamin Hooks, who recently retired as executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., reflected this morning that the march had a long agenda, but also a simple purpose. "If we can commemorate the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, why can't black folk celebrate a date that represents a great victory?"

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Will Open Its Files On Cold War Operations

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency has decided to release thousands of files on its most politically charged cold war operations, including the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the overthrow of the President of Guatemala in 1954 and the 1953 coup that installed Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran, Government officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency would make public historically significant files on every major covert operation from 1950 through 1963. The files should be released by next year, they said. 
 They said that although the release of the files would hurt the agency, because of the nature of the information to be disclosed, it was necessary if the promises of openness the agency had been making since the end of the cold war were to be fulfilled.
 
Analyses of the Soviet Union
 "We have hidden those records," one official familiar with the process said. "That has to stop."
Also to be released in the coming year are C.I.A. analyses of the Soviet Union from 1950 to 1983. Prominent among them will be the annual report called the Soviet estimate, considered the most important product of American intelligence in that period. The estimate was the agency's opinion of the status and future direction of the military programs of the United States' main cold war adversary.
An official familiar with the files said they reflected the fear of the national security establishment in the 1950's that the United States was in imminent danger of being attacked by the Soviet Union.
The context is supplied by the top secret report of a 1954 Presidential commission, which called on the C.I.A. to be "an aggressive covert psychological, political and paramilitary organization more effective, more unique and, if necessary, more ruthless than that employed by the enemy."
The files to be released cover three of the most significant American foreign policy operations of the cold war, already documented in part by the 1976 report of a Congressional committee that investigated C.I.A. abuses. The files are expected to provide copious detail about the operations, although names of agents and information about intelligence-gathering methods will be kept secret by deletions.
In 1953, a covert action in Iran code-named Operation Ajax overthrew Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi was installed on the throne, insuring Western access to Iranian oil for the next 25 years. The Shah's regime grew increasingly repressive and was overthrown in 1979 by the radically anti-American followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
 
Guatemalan Overthrown
 In 1954, Operation Success overthrew President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman of Guatemala with psychological warfare, economic pressure and soldiers trained and armed by the C.I.A. President Arbenz had been democratically elected and never sought Soviet support. But he confiscated some of the land holdings of the United Fruit Company with the idea of transferring the land to peasants.
The coup was followed by nearly four decades of military rule. This year a human-rights lawyer became President of the Central American nation.
In early 1960, Allen Dulles, then Director of Central Intelligence, signed a memorandum advocating that "thorough consideration be given to the elimination of Fidel Castro," who had taken power in Cuba.
By September 1960, the agency had enlisted organized-crime bosses in the mission. The leaders of Operation Success regrouped and began training Cuban exiles in Guatemala for an invasion. The invasion collapsed after President Kennedy called off air support for the mission while it was in progress in April 1961. Its failure led to the death or capture of hundreds of Cuban exiles. The C.I.A. then made efforts to assassinate Mr. Castro, without success.
The secret agency's current "orgy of openness," as one official jokingly put it, has been awaited ever since Robert M. Gates vowed to make the agency more open and accountable during his Senate confirmation hearings as Director of Central Intelligence in the Bush Administration nearly two years ago.
 
Task Force Appointed
 After appointing an "Openness Task Force," Mr. Gates approved 18 of its 31 recommendations in April 1992. They included opening up some of the agency's archives, the occasional granting of on-the-record interviews by senior agency officials and allowing the agency to publish a handful of current assessments and analyses.
Openness has come hard to the agency. Mr. Gates and his successor, R. James Woolsey, appointed by President Clinton, have worked at public relations, testifying more frequently in public sessions and giving unclassified speeches to select audiences.
But the impending release of the covert-action files, along with last week's release of files on the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, are intended to be seen as concrete signs that the culture of the agency may be changing, officials said.

HEADLINE: Tennis and Queens: Uneasy Partnership

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD

 BODY:
When tennis officials first proposed a $172 million expansion of the site of the United States Open, they hoped the deal would sail through with the efficiency of a Steffi Graf straight-sets triumph.
Indeed, the proposal to add 25 acres to the site of the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park was embraced by city officials, including the chief negotiator of the accord, who called it "the best municipal sports deal in the country." 
 But instead, the deal has become the focal point for a complex, peculiarly New York debate. It has involved international sports priorities, aviation concerns, money, class, neighborhood grievances and now, city politics.
 
In City Council's Court
 The issue is now in front of the City Council, which has to decide whether to approve what some community leaders in Queens have called a land grab and a sweetheart deal for the United States Tennis Association, which runs and maintains the city-owned tennis center. A vote should come in the next few weeks, perhaps even before the end of this year's Open, which begins tomorrow.
The deal has gained an even higher profile in recent weeks, as Rudolph W. Giuliani, the mayoral candidate, has picked up the controversy, and as questions have been raised about the role of a City Hall staff member, Ellen Baer, in arranging the tennis center deal.
Ms. Baer, chief of staff to First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, is under fire in connection with the awarding of a Parking Violations Bureau contract to a company involved in an earlier city scandal. City officials insist she played only a peripheral role in the tennis negotiations, but Mr. Giuliani and opponents of the tennis center expansion have criticized Ms. Baer for her personal and professional ties to Sid Davidoff, a lobbyist for the Tennis Association.
A subcommittee of the City Council's Land Use Committee is to vote on the proposal Sept. 7, with a full committee vote possible the next day.
 
What's In It for Queens
 If the plan is approved without revision, a full Council vote could then occur within days; if it is approved with modifications, the Council could vote as early as Sept. 23.
The central tension is between the desire of Mayor David N. Dinkins -- an avid tennis fan -- to keep the Open in New York, and anxieties among some in the largely working-class neighborhoods surrounding the park about how much they benefit from the center and the tournament. Many find it inaccessible because of the price of tickets and their scarcity.
The debate has reflected the sometimes uneasy relationship between the tennis association and its neighbors. In interviews, Councilman John L. Sabini of Jackson Heights referred to the association's "arrogance"; Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Woodside called one of its key requests "obnoxious."
City officials said the Open provides about $112 million a year in economic benefits to the city, along with two weeks of favorable international exposure.
But to some Queens residents, the tournament means increased traffic congestion and more noise from planes that are diverted from normal takeoff patterns at nearby La Guardia Airport so as not to disrupt play.
John Procida of the Bowne Park Civic Association complained that the planes' alternative takeoff route over downtown Flushing was dangerous as well as annoying. "A couple of guys playing tennis doesn't balance people's lives," he said.
 
In Forest Hills Until 1978
 Backers of the plan have called such statements unduly alarmist and have accused opponents of deliberately misrepresenting facts. They say the plan was endorsed by four of the five community boards affected.
The open, the last of the four major Grand Slam tournaments each year, has been played at the tennis center since 1978, when it was relocated from the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills.
Even walking space is tight and parking is limited, especially when the Mets are playing at Shea Stadium, to the north. And the park's location under a principal takeoff route from La Guardia Airport has been a major concern for tournament organizers, players and fans.
The tennis association wants to more than double the size of the site, to around 46.5 acres. A 23,500-seat stadium would be built, and two others, including Louis Armstrong Stadium, would be renovated. The new center would have 47 tennis courts, an increase of 8. Eleven would be available free for holders of city parks tennis permits, which cost $50; currently, the public can play without a permit but must pay tennis association rates for court time.
There would be more parking, food stands and restrooms. Officials hope the expansion can be completed in time for the 1996 United States Open.
 
No Giveaway, Supporter Says
 Referring to criticism that the association was benefiting from a land giveaway, David Markin, the tennis association official in charge of the expansion effort, said: "The U.S.T.A. is going to spend between $180 million and $200 million of its own money for a facility the city is going to own. Yeah, it's a giveaway. The U.S.T.A. is doing the giving away."
Under the agreement, the association would pay the city $400,000 a year base rent, up from $280,000, and also pay 1 percent of all revenues over $25 million. The association's revenues this year are projected at $70 million. Using that figure, the extra amount above the base rent would be $450,000 if this year were included. The association would also pay $8 million into a trust fund for the park, and expand its public tennis programs.
The association would be bound to the agreement for 25 years, and could exercise a series of options that would extend the lease to 99 years.
For its part, the city is allowing the tennis association to finance the project through Industrial Development Agency bonds, which provide a tax break. The city has also agreed to spend $11 million for road improvements around the park, which it says are needed anyway.
 
Penalty for Aircraft Noise
 But the most controversial part of the agreement is a provision penalizing the city up to $325,000 if there are excessive flyovers from La Guardia during the Open. The association could also seize up to 6 of the 11 new permit courts and charge for court time as a penalty for too many flyovers. The agreement defines excessive flyovers as 4 during one hour of play or 12 during play in one day. The limits on flyovers are even stricter during the semifinals and finals: two in an hour or six in a day.
In recent years, at the request of city officials, the Federal Aviation Administration has diverted air traffic during the event, and has agreed to do so in the future. But a formal agreement was deemed crucial by the association because aircraft noise in 1989 provoked some players to threaten to boycott the Open.
Mr. Sabini, the Council member, called it "absurd" that the city could be financially penalized for something that was in Federal, not city, jurisdiction.
And some Queens residents were offended, said a city official who insisted on anonymity, thinking that airplane noise "is good enough for me every day, but not good enough for the rich people playing tennis, or the rich people who are watching them."

HEADLINE: JAPAN'S COMPANIES MOVING PRODUCTION TO SITES OVERSEAS

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Sanritsu Electric, a small electronics company, got the bad news earlier this month. Its largest customer, Sanyo Electric, canceled orders for portable cassette players.
"We were told by Sanyo that they cannot make a profit on products manufactured in Japan," said Hiroyuki Nakamura, the head of the Sanritsu factory in Tokushima. Sanyo is expected to procure the portable tape players in Southeast Asia, where labor costs are lower. And Sanritsu will close its factory, putting 168 people out of work. 
 Propelled by the recent sharp rise of Japan's currency, the yen, companies are shifting production out of Japan. Hardly a day goes by without at least one newspaper article about a company transferring manufacturing of camcorders or computer printers to China or Southeast Asia. The movement is spurring fears here that Japan's manufacturing base, the foundation of its economy, will be "hollowed out," leading to increasing unemployment.
 
 
Echoes of U.S. Transfers
 In the 1980's, Japanese executives looked on in disbelief as American companies began moving their manufacturing to Asia, or began selling products made by other companies rather than making them themselves. "The U.S. is abandoning its status as an industrial power," the chairman of the Sony Corporation, Akio Morita, said at the time.
Now Mr. Morita says it is Japanese industry that faces an "unprecedented challenge," which if not met "could lead to the shrinking of Japan's domestic manufacturing base."
Dr. Michiyuki Uenohara, senior adviser to the NEC Corporation, said, "It looks like we are following the United States."
One sign of the times: This year it is possible that Japan will import more color television sets than it exports, mainly from Japanese-owned plants elsewhere in Asia. That is a sharp reversal for a product that at one time was nearly synonymous with Japan's export drive.
 Others say, however, that it is only natural that Japan give up manufacturing low-technology products. Such a movement offshore has already occurred for products like textiles and chemicals, and it is not surprising that it occur now with electronics and automobiles.
"The gradual shifting of industrial structure of the Japanese economy is, in essence, good and inevitable," said Takeshi Kondo, the general manager of the office of political and economic research at the Itochu Corporation, a large trading company. "It will give the Japanese economy the opportunity to shift resources to more value-added sectors of the industry."
The move offshore began in the 1980's, particularly after the 1985 Plaza agreement among leading industrial nations eventually led to a doubling of the yen's value against the dollar. With Japanese workers paid in expensive yen, the goods they produced could not be competitive on world markets against similar products from countries with lower wages.
Already, almost 70 percent of the color televisions made by Japanese companies are made overseas. For VCR's, the figure is about 30 percent. There are even a few Japanese companies, like Uniden, the cordless telephone maker, that do all their manufacturing outside Japan.
 
 
Pace Is Picking Up
 But with the yen appreciating 15 percent this year against the dollar, to a level approaching 100 to $1, the pace of offshore expansion appears to be accelerating. The shift also comes at a time when Japanese manufacturing levels are weakened by a stubborn recession.
While most of the initial offshore production was meant to be sold only outside Japan, companies are starting to import products made overseas back into Japan. Just this week, for instance, the Nissan Motor Company said it would begin importing vans Honda have been increasing the number of cars they import into Japan from the United States.
The high yen is not the only reason Japanese manufacturing is shifting offshore. Another is to be closer to markets, like the fast-growing regions of Southeast Asia and China. Moving manufacturing to big markets like the United States also tends to calm the trade tensions caused by Japan's huge trade surplus.
Other factors are also leading the Japanese to worry that their days as a manufacturing powerhouse are on the wane. Japan's work force is aging and the younger people do not want to go into manufacturing jobs, which are considered dirty, dangerous and demanding. That could lead to a big worker shortage when the recession ends.
 
Most Production Remains
 To be sure, the threat to Japan's manufacturing base should not be exaggerated. Japanese companies still have a large percentage of their production at home, compared with American multinationals. A survey of companies by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry found that only about 6 percent of the total production of those surveyed was outside Japan in 1991.
In 1992, Toyota produced about 20 percent of its cars outside Japan, while 40 percent of General Motors cars were made outside North America. Hitachi has 8 percent of its production offshore. Sony produces 35 percent of its products offshore and aims to raise that to 50 percent in three years. For I.B.M., 46 percent of its manufacturing work force is outside the United States.
Moreover, while Japan is shifting the manufacturing of less expensive and simpler products offshore, it is retaining the manufacturing of products and key components that are more technologically advanced and more expensive. For some products, like liquid-crystal-display screens and robots, Japan faces little competition from other countries.
Canon Inc., for instance, now makes 70 percent of its cameras in Taiwan, Malaysia and China. But it can keep producing its most exclusive products, like color copiers, in Japan because it can more easily raise export prices to counter the yen's appreciation, said Fujio Mitarai, senior managing director.
 
Increases Trade Surpluses
 Indeed, even as Japan has shifted production of consumer electronics goods to Southeast Asia, its trade surplus with that region has mushroomed. That is because Japan ships components and production machinery to those countries for the manufacturing of the televisions and tape recorders.
Another key difference, some experts say, is that much of the offshore production of Japanese companies is done in the companies' own factories, allowing them to keep control of their technology. American companies have tended to buy finished products like VCR's and fax machines from other companies, becoming, in effect, only marketers.
"I don't think the Japanese are hell-bent on making the same mistakes," said Stephen S. Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy and co-author of "Manufacturing Matters," a book critical of American companies for abandoning production. "They are determined not to lose control of the key technologies."
Still, even that is changing a bit. The Nakamichi Corporation, an audio products company, is closing its factory in Fukushima, with a loss of 84 jobs, and contracting out its manufacturing to companies in China and Taiwan. In Japan, the company will do mainly research and product design, officials said.
Many executives here say Japan has more to lose than the United States does from a hollowing of its industry, because manufacturing is more important here. Manufacturing accounts for about 33 percent of the Japanese gross national product, compared with 24 percent in the United States.
"This economy is based on manufacturing," said Takeo Naruse, deputy director general of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations. "It is impossible to support this big population on just service industries."
 
 
Flabby Service Sector
 Japan's service sector is uncompetitive on the world market and is bloated with multiple layers of distribution and people who have jobs bowing at passengers on elevators in hotels. If anything, the service sector will have to be streamlined and cannot be counted on to soak up people who lose manufacturing jobs, said Jesper Koll, chief economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Japan, despite years of trying, has also not been able to spawn the entrepreneurial companies in software and biotechnology that have provided new jobs in the United States.
"Japan is not ready to shift its hollowing-out industries to new industry," said Mr. Mitarai of Canon.
To help cope with the situation, the trade ministry is considering helping small manufacturers move offshore or shift to new businesses.
Other than that, the Government has formed few policies that deal directly with the current spate of departures. But general steps aimed at helping the economy could help manufacturers. Deregulation of industry -- which the new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, has promised -- could make it easier for entrepreneurs to start new businesses that could employ people displaced from manufacturing companies.
 
 
A Lack of Flexibility
 A hollowing of industry could be a particular threat for the small metal-forging and die-casting shops that supply the big manufacturers. These small companies -- the unsung backbone of Japan's industry -- have aging work forces and do not guarantee lifetime employment. Even before the yen began rising, these companies were severely damaged by the economic slump, but many are too small to follow large Japanese companies overseas.
"We cannot go overseas unless the parent companies or trading companies help us," said Koji Yoshikawa, president of Osaki Metal, a small electroplating company in Tokyo. Recently, he said, one of his salesmen heard that a large customer wanted to move plating operations to Taiwan. "If that happens," he said, "we would lose half our business."
Already, there is a rising concern in Japan that lost manufacturing skills might be irretrievable.
"Technology, once lost, is extremely difficult or impossible to start again," said Katsunoke Maeda, the president of Toray Industries, a manufacturer of synthetic fibers and chemicals. Toray, which was originally named Toyo Rayon, no longer makes rayon. "We still have the theory but we have no engineers" who have the experience to do it, Mr. Maeda said.
In a factory outside Tokyo, Seiko Instruments has resumed the manufacture of mechanical watches by hand, after a hiatus of about a decade. One reason is that demand has emerged for mechanical watches. But Seiko executives say another reason is to preserve the technology.
Ultimately, the preservation of skills like watchmaking will not save Japan. "There's only one long-term solution," said Mr. Mitarai of Canon. "That is to evolve the industry itself from a low-value added industry to higher value added."

HEADLINE: 30-Year-Old Echoes From Slaying of 2

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
On the pleasant morning of Aug. 28, 1963, a cat burglar sprang through an open kitchen window into a third-floor apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. What began as a burglary erupted into a double murder, a vast manhunt, the imprisonment of an innocent man, and, ultimately, the conviction of the admitted killer.
That same August day, 30 years ago, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech at a mammoth civil rights rally in Washington -- an event that was pivotal in establishing the innocence of the black youth falsely accused of killing two young women, Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert. 
 Repercussions from the crime, known as the Career Girl Murders, are still felt today, for it led to abolition of New York's death penalty and helped prompt restrictions on police interrogations throughout the country. The killer, meanwhile, still sits behind bars.
 
Quest for Parole Fading
 Richard Robles, who eventually confessed to the killings, is reconciled to the fact that his quest for parole is fading. While claiming that he has atoned for the crime, he says that the notoriety of the case and a campaign by relatives of the victims have barred his release.
Michael Wylie Slater, a cousin of Miss Wylie, who has led the drive to deny Mr. Robles parole, vows that his opposition will never cease. Mr. Slater has previously appealed personally to the Parole Board and elicited support from politicians and prosecutors to keep Mr. Robles (pronounced ROW-bells) incarcerated.
"The anniversary is a painful, bitter reminder to our entire family," Mr. Slater, a Manhattan businessman, said in an interview. "We will always object to his release."
Mr. Robles, who is now 50 years old, has served 29 years in prison, one of the longest sentences in the state penal system. The Parole Board, citing "the seriousness of the crime," has denied him parole five times; he will be eligible again in May. Prison officials say that of the state's 65,000 inmates, only 20 have been imprisoned longer than Mr. Robles.
 
'My Time Never Comes'
 Mr. Robles, who is inmate 66A0003 at the Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch, declined to be interviewed. But replying in a letter to questions submitted by a reporter, he said he had earned parole by being a model prisoner.
"For years I have watched as people who committed far more brutal murders were released to parole supervision," Mr. Robles wrote. "I've seen serial killers, multiple murderers, even assassins and professional, paid murderers get released. But my time never comes."
Mr. Robles said his life was emotionally shattered in his early teens by the separation of his parents and the accidental death in the Army of his brother, who was his role model. At 14, Mr. Robles was injecting heroin, and soon began committing burglaries to pay for his drugs. By 17, he had committed about 100 burglaries, the police said.
For that wave of burglaries, he served a three-year sentence and was paroled in June 1963 at the age of 20. According to Mr. Robles, he had renounced crime and drugs but decided to pull one last burglary on that Wednesday morning in August to help support an unemployed girlfriend and the couple's 3-year-old daughter.
Miss Wylie, 21, was a researcher at Newsweeek magazine; Miss Hoffert, 23, was starting her first job as an elementary school teacher. Mr. Robles said he slipped into their apartment at 57 East 88th Street because it was in an affluent neighborhood and he believed no one was home.
Miss Wylie, however, was there, and at knifepoint he raped her. Mr. Robles claimed that he was preparing to leave when Miss Hoffert entered. As he tied up the roommates, Miss Hoffert vowed that she would remember his face and identify him to the police, he later admitted.
"I just went bananas," he said in an interview in 1988. "My head just exploded." He said he clubbed both women unconscious with soda bottles, then repeatedly slashed and stabbed them with kitchen knives.
The slayings spread fear among women in the city and the police assigned more than 100 detectives to the case. In April 1964, six months after the murders, detectives arrested George Whitmore Jr., then 19, in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and claimed he had given a detailed 63-page confession to the murders. The same detectives also said he confessed to an unrelated crime, an attempted rape in Brooklyn.
 
End to Capital Punishment
 It was not until January 1965 that Mr. Robles was arrested in the Wylie-Hoffert murders after two friends said he had confessed to them. He was convicted of the double murder and sentenced to 20 years to life.
Mr. Whitmore was eventually cleared of the murders through alibi witnesses in his hometown of Wildwood, N.J. They vividly recalled that on the day of the killings he was with them, 105 miles from midtown Manhattan, watching the civil rights rally on television.
But before the murder charges were dropped, Mr. Whitmore was convicted in 1964 on the attempted rape charge. He was imprisoned for four years before it was discovered that jurors at his trial had made racist remarks and believed that he had participated in the Wylie-Hoffert murders. Detectives also had withheld evidence beneficial to his defense. Eventually, the charges were dropped.
Mr. Whitmore's legal plight and potential brush with the electric chair was instrumental in the Legislature's decision to end capital punishment in 1965. The purported beatings and threats used by detectives to obtain a false confession from Mr. Whitmore were also extensively cited by the United States Supreme Court in its 1966 decision, in Miranda v. Arizona, that required the police to advise criminal suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during questioning.
 
'Appalling Emotional Impact'
 In his letter, Mr. Robles said he understood Mr. Slater's hatred, but appealed for understanding. "I would try to let him know," he wrote, "as a result of my experiences, I know the wrongful death of the young leaves behind a ghost that haunts the minds of people in the house -- a grief that lasts far beyond the norm and causes appalling emotional impact far more horrible than mere grief."
Asked about Mr. Robles's appeal, Mr. Slater was unswayed, saying that Miss Wylie's death had devastated her family and may have contributed to the 1975 suicide of her father Max, a writer and advertising executive.
"I do not see his remorse nor his activities in prison as a reason for his release," he said. "We don't have the death penalty partly because of what happened to Whitmore, and I am unalterably opposed to parole for murderers like Robles."

HEADLINE: East Europe Waits for the West's Welcome Wagon

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, many politicians in the region say they have been looking for Western Europe to fulfill promises they believe were made four years ago. The pledges, they say, were along the following lines: Get rid of the Communists and we will welcome you back to the fold.
The welcome had been less than was expected during those euphoric days. The Czech Prime Minister, Vaclav Klaus, had complained that Western Europe has put up a "Do Not Disturb" sign on its door. 
 But the visits to Poland and the Czech Republic this week by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia could give the West Europeans a new impetus, officials here and in Warsaw said.
Mr. Yeltsin, overruling objections by his Foreign and Defense Ministers, gave the green light to Poland and the Czech Republic to pursue membership in NATO. In Warsaw, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubisiewski said he was eager to see NATO move on the issue.
"NATO should not be so passive," he said. "They talk about transformation but they don't do it."
A leading United States supporter of the integration of Europe's two halves, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with President Lech Walesa of Poland before Mr. Yeltsin's visit and said the Russian President's trip offered a chance to reverse a growing disappointment with the West in Poland.
Much of the disillusionment appeared to rest with the European Community. The halting liberalization of trade by the community hampers the economic development of the old Eastern bloc countries as they struggle toward market economies.
Last year for example, the community's exports to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic grew by 31 percent. But exports by those countries to the community increased by only 10 percent, the Polish Foreign Ministry said.
While offering some concessions at its meeting in June, the community has raised trade barriers on goods ranging from cherries and lamb to the most competitive items, steel and textiles.
Similarly, many politicians in the region argue that while NATO has allowed 18 European countries -- as well as Russia -- to attend meetings of the NATO Cooperation Council, an auxiliary body that deals mainly in nonmilitary issues, there have not been enough concrete security benefits.
In Hungary, the Government has given NATO permission to use its air space for surveillance planes monitoring the no-flight zone in the Balkans. Because it borders both Croatia and Serbia, the Hungarians have expressed fears of cross-border punitive air raids by Serbian planes. When the Hungarian Foreign Minister went to NATO headquarters several months ago seeking assurances that the West would come to his country's help if it were attacked, he received much milder reassurances than he wanted.
The Polish Prime Minister, Hanna Suchocka, an unequivocal advocate for Poland joining the West, faces an election in three weeks in which NATO and the European Community could be an issue. Ms. Suchocka warned several months ago that unless the community was more consistently favorable to Poland then what she called a growing anti-European sentiment in Poland would strengthen.
The main challenge to Ms. Suchocka comes from former Communists who favor a more guarded approach to the European institutions. After Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged Poland's right to enter NATO, members of Ms. Suchocka's party said a positive signal from NATO would boost her campaign.
In the Czech Republic, where there is considerable pride in the country's economic progress -- including a budget surplus and a healthy export market to the West -- Government officials say they believe Prague will be ready to join the European Community before the timetable that Brussels had set.
"There can be no doubt about our political will to get into an integrated Europe," said Ivan Busniak, the head of the European-Atlantic section of the Foreign Ministry here. "There is a feeling from the economic point of view that our reforms are sufficiently good not to wait for 10 years as they say."

HEADLINE: English as a Precious Language

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
Riverside Church was packed with immigrants hoping their number was up. Hairdressers, plumbers and mathematicians from Russia, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, they formed lines that snaked through a cavernous assembly hall, 500 people desperate for the luck of the draw.
A lottery had drawn them to this spot beneath stained-glass windows, but it was no ordinary cash-prize game. This was a lottery to win one of 50 coveted spaces in the free intensive English classes offered at the Manhattan church. 
 In the years before the lottery, spaces were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, and the night before registration, immigrants would sneak into the church and sleep there, in line. Their passion to learn was that intense, and the opportunities to do so that rare.
At Wednesday's lottery, Bilga Abramova, a 35-year-old Russian refugee, tugged at the sleeve of a program administrator. "Please, madam, please help -- is not my first time at lottery, is my third time."
 
'I Need to Win'
 Ms. Abramova switched into Russian: "I need to win, I need it badly. My future is on hold. Without English, I cannot begin a new life. I do not want to depend on welfare. That is shameful."
Contrary to some native-born Americans' belief that immigrants no longer make a genuine effort to learn English, the demand for English lessons in New York City -- as in immigrant havens across the country -- far outpaces the supply. Very few immigrants who arrive with no knowledge of English can afford private tuition, and in New York City, immigrants must wait four months to three years, depending on the program, to get into free classes. For newcomers eager to move into American jobs and society, the wait can be unnerving.
Free English classes -- financed with Federal, state and local funds and offered by the Board of Education, the City University of New York, public libraries and community groups -- fill to capacity with about 30,000 students a year. But about 1.36 million New Yorkers may need them, a conservative estimate of city residents with limited proficiency in English, according to the 1990 Census. Most classes are open to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.
"There's not a single English-language program in the city that isn't inundated, and waiting lists go into years, not months," said Kay Sardo, assistant commissioner of the city's Community Development Agency.
In New York State, more immigrants languish on waiting lists for adult English classes than in any other state, according to a study by Beltway Associates, a Washington consulting firm. The study found about 17,000 New York immigrants on waiting lists in 1990, a conservative tally since the study dealt only with programs receiving Federal adult-education funds, and many programs, like Riverside, have abandoned waiting lists altogether.
To some experts, the shortage of English classes reflects a laissez-faire attitude by the Federal Government toward the needs of the 800,000 immigrants legally admitted each year. About half speak poor English or none at all, immigration experts say. But the United States Government, which has one of the most liberal admissions policies in the world, has traditionally left newcomers to fend for themselves -- or state and local governments to pay for their services.
"Unlike Canada, Israel and Australia, the United States has an immigration policy but no deliberate Federal immigrant policy, which is a mistake," said Michael Fix, an immigration expert for the Urban Institute in Washington. "We need to think of immigrants not just in terms of the costs and burdens they impose, but in terms of the investments that need to be made in them."
 
'People Do Want to Learn'
 As anti-immigrant sentiment built with the influx of immigrants during the recession, much hostility focused on what some perceived to be the threat to English as the nation's common language. But many experts say that immigrants' desire to retain their native tongue does not translate into an apathy about learning English.
"I've never run into a single person who said, 'I don't need English, I can just hide in my neighborhood and get along fine,' " said Heide Spruck Wrigley, who directs a research project on immigrant adults' English study for the Southport Institute for Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan group in Washington. "Instead, there is overwhelming evidence that people do want to learn English and either can't get into classes or have such complex lives that they can't fit in the time."
Juliana Loma, an accountant from Panama, applied to English classes in the Bronx when she arrived in this country. "It was the logical first step, and I didn't have anything else to do yet," she said in Spanish. Two years later, a place finally opened up for her in a community college class. By that time, however, she was working during the day at a garment factory, and at night and on weekends at a restaurant. The class was a luxury she could not afford, she said.
"It's frustrating," she said. "I'm stuck in menial work because I don't speak English, and I don't speak English because I can't afford to quit my menial jobs to take a class."
The Federal Government spends about $300 million each year, through a variety of financing mechanisms, on English programs for immigrants -- "a spit in the ocean," Mr. Fix said. In New York City, the combined Federal, state and city financing for general English classes for immigrants, which is renegotiated every year, is about $20 million. Some additional Federal money supports programs for political refugees only.
 
Shortage of Clout
 New immigrants, impotent politically, lack the clout to demand what they need.
"English as a second language, particularly for adults, is considered a marginalized field, a stepchild in all the various areas of funding and decision-making," Ms. Wrigley said. "And you're not likely to see a march on Washington by the students. They're just not in a position to make demands."
There is no typical immigrant student of English. Most believe that learning English will help them find a decent job. But some are grandparents who feel alienated from their English-speaking grandchildren, and some parents tired of the imbalance of power in their homes that results from relying on their children as interpreters. Still others want to learn English to negotiate with landlords, police officers or welfare officials, or to participate more fully in their new culture.
"Where I live, in Borough Park, nobody speak English, only Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian," Iana Skylarevich, a Russian immigrant, said in halting English. "I hear English only on TV, never in street. So I am not in America. Yet."
Aura Kevalier, a Dominican doctor, agreed. "I'm enjoying a mountain of things here, but without English, I'm trapped outside all the opportunities I came for," she said in Spanish. "I'm not going to stay here if I have to stand on a street corner and sell flowers. No way."
To avoid pandemonium, there was no public drawing at the Riverside Church lottery. Instead, winners were chosen privately and informed by postcard.
Ms. Abramova, on her third try, did not get lucky. And because in September she will have been in the United State for a year, she will no longer be eligible for the program, which serves only immigrants in their first year. She will now have to search elsewhere for language instruction. And she will have to delay, for the moment, her aspirations of a new career.
"I am a barber," she said. "But I truly want to go into medicine."

The U.S. Open: It's Not the Grandest, but the Gaudiest

BYLINE: By NEIL AMDUR; Neil Amdur is the sports editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
On the eve of the 25th United States Open tennis championships, Arthur Ashe is being honored at the National Tennis Center today and again tonight with a benefit for the Safe Passage Foundation. As the Open's first men's singles champion, Ashe established the spirit that has carried this tournament from the clubby confines in Forest Hills to the corporate carnival in Flushing Meadows.
Like it or loathe it, the Open dances to its own music as a sports event. It plays day, night and weekends, and is a survival test for players, officials, fans and, yes, even the news media. 
 The Open is not the world's most prestigious tournament (Wimbledon wins this honor). Nor is it the most well-run or respected of the Grand Slams. In fact, the Open's biggest lure is its brazen unpredictability and penchant for excess -- from the noise of crowds, trains and planes, to Super Saturday, when the men's semifinals and women's final converge in a staged-for-television orgy.
 
The Plot's the Thing
 Paris is the players' favorite because of its clay courts and continental charm. Wimbledon has tradition, and Melbourne is the sport's newest facility. But year after year, on and off the court, the Open provides the most intriguing plot lines.
The women's revolution in tennis -- and perhaps in sports -- began at the Open in 1970. Tie breakers and night play were legitimatized at the Open, although traditionalists will tell you that night programs still belong on the moon. The Open has been the scene of political defections and demonstrations, a spectator shot by a stray bullet, the "spaghetti" racquet, fights in the stands, Renee Richards and celebrity overkill, American-style, that rivals the royals in England.
Through all these bizarre sideline shots, tennis at the Open has achieved its own level of greatness, nothing to rival the majesty of Borg-McEnroe at Wimbledon, but dramatic enough: fifth-set tie breakers (an Open trademark), Grand Slam achievements by Rod Laver, Margaret Court and Steffi Graf and, of course, the 20-year Jimmy Connors saga as teen-age rebel, redoubtable champion and ageless house hero.
 
Open's Open Policy
 Why then is the Open so unpopular? European pros accustomed to being fawned over by fans and shielded from the media perceive a trip to New York City, and the ride to Queens, as a descent into hell. But players cannot run and hide at the Open; it is the only Grand Slam event where the locker rooms have remained open and accessible to the news media, a policy that has withstood strong challenges from the various players associations.
Pros complain about overcrowded locker rooms, spectator movement between points, smoke from concession stands and scheduling that caters to women (the men say), homeboys and a few select seeded players. But the Open is not meant to be quaint; Hilton Head and Monte Carlo are quaint. The Open is big, bold and raw, the last strokes of summer. You do not win the Open by waiting for an opponent to choke. You take the Open by the throat, as McEnroe did with Borg, as Connors did with Ivan Lendl in 1982 and 1983. It took Martina Navratilova a long time to learn to love the Open, but now she does. So do Europeans like Mats Wilander, Boris Becker and, more recently, Stefan Edberg.
When the Open first arrived at Forest Hills, sellout crowds were the exception rather than the rule. This year, in an attempt to placate fans who may have been shut out from buying tickets, the United States Tennis Association will sell 500 grounds passes a day for the first nine days ($17 per person for the first five days, $25 for the next four days) at the tennis center. The best solution, as the U.S.T.A. looks to the next 25 years and an expanded facility, is to create a lottery that would set aside a specific number of tickets to the public for each session of the tournament.
The problem for the Open is that it tries to be all things: an economic and political resource for the city, a lifeline for U.S.T.A. sectional associations who need the tournament's revenue, a corporate vehicle for the U.S.T.A. and its sponsors, and the promised land for American players.
 
The Field is Too Wide
 The Open cannot possibly satisfy the faithful. Yet it has grown in spite of shortcomings, just as the New York City Marathon increased from a largely ignored trek of a few thousand serious runners through Central Park to a five-borough communion involving millions of participants, spectators and TV viewers.
In the next 25 years, the character of the Open is certain to change even more. This year, electronic lines were supposed to move in. Who knows what lies beyond? Computerized balls?
Some of the enthusiasm from this year's anniversary celebration is drained by the absence of Ashe and another resourceful Southerner who died in February, Slew Hester, the U.S.T.A. president who orchestrated the move to Flushing Meadows. But if you feel depressed by the heat, a seeded player who tanked, night matches canceled by rain, over-priced T-shirts, or clammy sandwiches, hang around until play ends each late afternoon.
That's when a new gig, "Music Under New York," will cut loose daily at the Open with live blues, jazz, dixie, bluegrass, salsa or other sounds. You can't get your money back, but at least you'll leave the Open with a smile.

HEADLINE: The Real Losers of '93? Taxpayers, Of Course

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Winners as Well as Losers in the Great Flood of '93" (Aug. 15) conspicuously omitted a major loser: the taxpayers. Congress has already passed a $6 billion appropriation and more may be on the way. Since it is unlikely that other spending will be cut, the money will be borrowed, the taxpayers will be on the hook for more interest, and the economy will be further distorted. A 25-year "super-hurricane" cycle is just beginning, so in the coming years, taxpayer exposure for disaster could rival the savings and loan debacle. 
 Such highway robbery wouldn't happen if we freed the heavily regulated insurance industry to search for innovative ways to insure against natural disasters and if we forswore taxpayer bailouts, which, as James Madison pointed out long ago, are beyond the scope of the Federal powers enumerated in the Constitution. If we want to help the flood victim, why not just declare a tax holiday for them rather than compelling charity?

HEADLINE: AUGUST 22-28: High-Tech Exports Cut Off;
Washington Penalizes China For Missile Technology Sales

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
President Clinton is reluctant to use trade as a foreign policy lever, as he showed in May when he decided to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status in spite of concerns about human rights violations. But last week, citing evidence that the Chinese had violated an international arms control agreement by selling sensitive missile technology, the Administration imposed limited sanctions.
The State Department said it would ban $1 billion in American high-technology exports to China over the next two years to penalize Beijing for selling components to Pakistan that could be used to build a missile to carry nuclear warheads. Such sales are barred under the Missile Technology Control Regime, which China has not signed but has promised to follow. United States law requires trade sanctions against a country that violates the treaty. 
 The ban could cost about 10,000 American jobs. China, which has denied flouting the treaty, will keep its preferential trade status -- which is up for renewal next year.

HEADLINE: County's Anti-Gay Move Catches Few by Surprise

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga., Aug. 27

 BODY:
There are not many counties in America more conservative than this one, where the main stretch of interstate highway is named for a former John Birch Society president who represented the area in Congress and where the town of Kennesaw made national news a few years back by enacting an ordinance that required all residents to keep a firearm and ammunition at home.
So it was not entirely out of character when the Cobb County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution this month condemning homosexuality, and then decided to cut off all arts financing rather than have to decide what art offended community values. 
 But even those appalled by the emotional showdown over values that played out here say the dispute in this prosperous suburb, one of the fastest-growing counties in America, reflects a lot more than Cobb County's eccentricities. Cobb County may be more conservative than most places, many residents say, but both the suburban good life that draws people here and the economic and social unease in the air fit very much into the national mood.
 
'Fear and Frustration'
 "I don't think that Marietta, Ga., is so unlike the rest of the country," said Michael Horne, a co-founder of the local Theater in the Square, whose mainstream fare somehow set the flap in motion. "I think some well-meaning people have been incited by a few politicians nurtured by a fringe element of the population. But I think there's so much fear and frustration out there that no matter where you live this kind of thing could exist."
The five-member Board of Commissioners capped a month of controversy on Tuesday by unanimously deciding to cut out the $110,000 in arts financing in its 1994 budget, rather than decide which art was in keeping with community values.
Two weeks earlier, after one resident wrote a commissioner to complain about references to homosexuality in a play at Theater in the Square, the commissioners passed a resolution supporting "the traditional family structure" and condemning "the life styles advocated by the gay community" as incompatible with Cobb County standards.
The furor here partly reflected the desire of commissioners to make a statement in opposition to neighboring Atlanta, where officials recently agreed to grant domestic partnership status to the partners of gay city employees.
But Cobb County has a long tradition of vociferous conservatism and a climate in which those at the outer edge of right-wing politics have felt at home.
 
2 Cobb Counties
 This is where J. B. Stoner, convicted of the 1958 bombing of a black church in Alabama, mounted a white supremacist run for lieutenant governor in 1990.
But fringe extremists aside, for the most part there are two Cobb counties, both of them largely white and conservative and very much apart from Atlanta on the other side of the Chattahoochee River.
There are older towns like this one, with its rustic town square, proud Southern sensibilities and disdain for the more urban, largely black world in Atlanta. And there are newer generic subdivisions in East Cobb full of corporate transplants and suburbanites looking for cheaper housing, less crime and better schools than they expect to find in urban America.
The county has grown explosively in recent years, its population increasing by 50 percent between 1980 and 1990, to its current 470,000. In 1950, the population was only 61,830. The number of jobs in the county more than doubled between 1980 and 1990, in part because of the growth of the military industry. The largest employer is the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems plant, which is building F-22 fighter jets.
 
Little Gay Presence
 But Cobb's success has only heightened the desire of some leaders to differentiate the county from Atlanta. Gordon Wysong, the Commissioner who led the push for the two resolutions, said Cobb was standing up for the values of "ordinary citizens."
"People are fed up with having the gay agenda crammed down their throat and told that they can't articulate their position because it's not politically correct," he said.
There is very little visible gay presence in Cobb County, but Mr. Wysong and his supporters cited issues like homosexuals in the military and school curricula that they say is sympathetic to homosexuals as reasons to express their opposition.
He said calls to the county had been overwhelmingly supportive of both resolutions. Making a statement against homosexuality seems entirely natural and appropriate to many people here.
"I'm a Christian, and I don't want my children taught that homosexuality is an acceptable life style," said Letha Faulkner, who was watching her toddler play on the toy train on the square here.
 
'This Is a True Embarrassment'
 But many residents, particularly in East Cobb, think the last month has seen a sort of hysteria that was more representative of the views of religious extremists than of the community as a whole.
"This is a true embarrassment, because I know most of my friends don't feel this way," said Suzi Bass, an actress who moved to the county 15 years ago from Lexington, Ky. "You will find Cobb countians to be loving and giving, educated, feeling, sensitive people."
Still, the emotions are not the only muddled thing in Cobb County.
The cutoff of the tiny arts spending (the $123,000 being spent this year is part of a $142 million budget) was not a particular surprise in view of the anti-tax sentiments its residents share with people in many places in the country. On the other hand, Common Cause, the public interest group, reports that Cobb, largely because of aerospace spending, receives more Federal money than any other suburb except Arlington County, just outside Washington, and Brevard County, Fla., home of the Kennedy Space Center.
And despite the county's phenomenal growth, there is widespread concern about jobs and economic security, particularly with cuts in military spending.
 
'Lot of Insecurity'
 "Look at them," said Jack Landers, who owns a check-cashing business, pointing to a group of elderly people. "You know they're wondering about Social Security, will it be cut back or cut off? There's a lot of insecurity around. You wonder if you'll be able to afford the same life style in five years that you have now."
Just as Mr. Wysong has a Rush Limbaugh magnet on the light switch in his office, there is no question Cobb County is much closer to the national mainstream than it used to be. When the former John Birch Society leader, Larry McDonald, represented the area in Congress until his death in 1983, he was a fringe figure in Washington. Now 70 percent of the county is represented by Newt Gingrich, who is the House minority whip.
And, as a raft of resolutions and ballot proposals around the nation indicate, Cobb is not the only place where homosexuals have become a focus for powerful emotions.
"We no longer have to fear the Communists, we no longer have to fear Russia, but there's always got to be somebody to generate negative emotions toward," said Cherry Spencer-Stark, chairman of the Theater in the Square. "There's always got to be the low man on the totem pole. And right now, in this country, it happens to be lesbians and gays."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 31, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a resolution in Cobb County, Ga., condemning homosexuality referred incorrectly to findings of a study on the county's share of Federal spending. Common Cause magazine found that Cobb had received more Federal money than all but two suburban counties per capita, not in total.

HEADLINE: Football at Monmouth College: It's a Whole New Ball Game

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN

DATELINE: WEST LONG BRANCH

 BODY:
THE first game is not until Sept. 11, but the advent of intercollegiate football at 60-year-old Monmouth College has already gripped this picturesque 125-acre campus with an excitement seldom felt since the protest days of the 1960's or since the filming of "Annie" here in the early 1980's.
Since Aug. 15, 87 members of the Hawks, as the new team is known, have been hard at work in the shadow of a $250,000 stadium under construction. Their first opponent ever will be Stonehill College in North Easton, Mass. Four home games and two other away games will follow. 
 While the enthusiasm is palpable here, pigskin fever hardly erupted from unanimous love for the sport. Some early skeptics were concerned about the costs of starting a major program, and others wondered if it would send the wrong signals about the college's academic standards.
But Monmouth officials are blunt when they predict that football will help pad the college's $12.3 million endowment and add perhaps $500,000 to $750,000 to the college's annual fund drive, which usually brings in about $215,000.
"Football might just be the spark that we need," said Sara E. Smith, the vice president for institutional advancement.
Officials also suggest that their Division I-AA, nonscholarship team can help give their school a kind of brand-name recognition that is akin to buying prime-time advertising.
So no wonder that the cheerleading squad, a fixture at Monmouth's basketball games, has a new part-time director who is preparing the squad to lead football cheers. A pep band is being formed, and Monmouth fight songs are being written. Students are lining up for jobs as ushers, ticket and program sellers, food vendors and parking attendants.
The stadium, which will seat 3,000, is expected to be ready for the home opener against Sacred Heart University of Fairfield, Conn., on Sept. 25.
The alma mater, now played only at commencement and convocation ceremonies, is being dusted off to be sung at games. Mary Anne Nagy, the acting dean of campus life, said there would be practice sessions to teach students the words, which were written 10 years ago by a Monmouth music professor, Dr. William A. Wollman. "We need more school spirit," Ms. Nagy said.
Plenty of that certainly seems at hand: Monmouth's seven fraternities and five sororities are preparing to welcome alumni on homecoming weekend amid plans for a bonfire, a concert, a reception for parents and a student king and queen contest. The homecoming game, against Hartwick College of Oneonta, N.Y., will be on Oct. 23.
Thomas P. Zambrano, the college's 33-year-old police chief and a 1986 alumnus, is drawing up parking, traffic and crowd-control plans for all the games. He is also getting out the word that the local and campus police will be on the lookout for postgame drunkenness by fans either toasting victory or drowning their sorrows after defeat.
 
Opposition From Some
 Not everyone agreed from the start that football would be a good thing to add to college life here. The board of trustees approved a football program in June 1992 only after the Select Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics, which had studied the idea for nine months, recommended the program. It did so despite opposition from some faculty members, students and environmentalists who predicted that football would drain resources from already struggling academic programs.
An editorial in the student newspaper, The Outlook, said, "This school should embark on the longer road of building a reputation based upon scholarly achievements."
Even so, the board's approval put the football program on a lightning-fast track, and now there is hardly a corner of this campus that has not been touched.
 
16th Varsity Sport
 Monmouth, which had humble beginnings during the Depression as a junior college housed in nearby Long Branch High School, is now a private four-year, comprehensive regional college offering more than 45 degree programs and concentrations. Its student body has grown to 3,000 undergraduates and 1,500 graduate students. Football is its 16th varsity sport.
The team members -- 75 freshmen and 12 transfers and upperclassmen decked out in new gear -- are being guided by a new coach, an assistant coach and six part-time assistants. Their practice sessions are drawing visits by the new college president, Dr. Rebecca Stafford.
Dr. Stafford, the first woman to be Monmouth's president, took over on July 1. Although several college trustees recalled that she had some misgivings about the new program, they said she has became a strong supporter.
Dr. Stafford, a Radcliffe graduate who fondly recalls attending Harvard games, said that the program here would raise awareness of Monmouth's name and that football would "help create a greater sense of community" and involve alumni in new ways.
She also said she was impressed by the academic quality of many on the team. "They are going to add an important dimension as well to our student life program," she said. "I'd say it was courageous to start football at this time."
At the same time, she said she would be monitoring the program closely to make certain it "maintains high standards" and "pays its own way."
 
Players Called 'Pioneers'
Upholding those criteria will be the job of the program's new head coach, Kevin Callahan, 38, who arrived at Monmouth from Colgate University, where he had served as defensive coordinator for eight years.
"These players are pioneers," Coach Callahan said. "They're here because they want a good education and the thrill of being part of a program that is brand-new and started from scratch. We are beginning a new tradition."
Rich Bargloski, a 5-foot-11-inch, 180-pound quarterback who was an honor student at Lacey High School, agrees. He said he could have attended any of three other colleges but chose Monmouth because of its coach, its academic quality and its campus. In addition, he described the financial aid package the college put together for him as "the best of any school."
Chris Colon, a 5-foot-8-inch, 185-pound running back who earned a B-plus average at St. Joseph's of the Palisades High School in West New York, liked the idea of being close to home and part of a program that gave him an oportunity to play immediately as a freshman. Grants, loans and work-study aid will take care of most of his college costs. Because Monmouth football is a nonscholarship program, the financial aid packages are tied to need.
Tuition at Monmouth is $11,300 a year, with room and board at about $5,000 a year.
 
Increase in Enrollment
 The college expects a freshmen enrollment of about 495 this fall, about a seventh of whom will be on the team.Last year there were 434 freshmen.
"For a school that counts on and is driven by tuition revenue, this added enrollment is very important to us," said Robert J. Mika, executive director of enrollment management.
Ronald J. Wronko, the editor in chief of The Outlook, said he had been one of the first to voice skepticism about starting a football program in uncertain economic times. But he said the open campus dialogue on the issue had helped to sway him, as did a student referendum in which the program was supported by a 338-to-81 vote.
Richard M. Schwartz, the senior vice president for finance and administration, who is overseeing the program, said the program's startup costs were $130,000. This year $400,000 has been budgeted for football, including coaches' salaries and $35,000 in added insurance costs.
 
Donations Received
 Mr. Schwartz said $130,000 had been donated to the program by corporations, alumni and friends of the college, including an anonymous gift of $10,000.
The stadium is being paid for with a $250,000 donation from John H. Kessler, chairman of J.B. Hanauer & Company of Parsippany, a securities brokerage concern, and his wife, Henni Kantor Kessler, a former president of Shoes Plus. The donation includes money for an electronic scoreboard, a ticket gate, goalposts and field equipment. Not surprisingly, the new stadium will be called Kessler Field.
Mrs. Kessler, a 1968 graduate who was a cheerleading captain, is a college trustee. Mr. Kessler, who graduated in 1969, played baseball and is on the college's board of visitors. They live in Verona.
 
Benefit to Bookstore Seen
One of the first beneficiaries of the football program has been the college bookstore, which has gross sales of about $1.6 million a year. William T. Rainey, the store's manager, predicted an increase of about $30,000 to $40,000 in sales relating to football shirts, hats, banners and other regalia.
Last year, a hastily created Monmouth football polo shirt went on sale after the trustees made the football announcement, and the stock sold out in weeks, Mr. Rainey said. He plans to pitch a tent satellite store near the stadium during home games.
"I think we're going to do very well," Mr. Rainey said.
For the first home game, Prof. Lauren K. Woods, who teaches theater and speech, is trying to get Jeff Keller, an alumnus who is a member of the Broadway cast of "Phantom of the Opera," to sing the national anthem. Professor Woods said Mr. Keller was seeking to arrange his schedule to attend.
On Oct. 2 at home the Hawks will play their only New Jersey opponent, St. Peter's of Jersey City. Other games are on Oct. 16, in Loretto, Pa., against St. Francis College; Nov. 6 at home against Wagner of Staten Island and Nov. 13 in Reading, Pa., against Albright.
And thanks to football, no longer will there be any questions about what is the correct shade of school-color blue, Mr. Schwartz said. It's always been a guessing game.
From now on, there will be a Monmouth blue, a combination of navy and royal with a dab of gray to lighten it up. And the block M, used on shirts and book covers and notebooks, is also being standardized.

HEADLINE: The Hunt for the Tourist Dollar

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
THE firefighters' parade here had brought people onto the streets, so there was quite a crowd on hand last Sunday when four enormous air-conditioned tour buses wound through the downtown area. There were also a lot of surprised faces. The buses held more than 300 tourists from New York City and New Jersey who were being ferried through town as part of a daylong outing to two Historic Hudson Valley sites. They had taken a boat cruise up the Hudson River from Weehawken, N.J., and Manhattan to Tarrytown, and then boarded the buses for visits to Philipsburg Manor, a working Dutch Colonial farm, and Sunnyside, the home of Washington Irving.
"I noticed the local people were looking at us like 'Why are they here?' " said Christina Chiang, who with her husband, Matthew, came from North Bergen, N.J., to take the tour. "But I think it's very nice here, very romantic and natural. We like to travel, especially to places that have an interesting history."
 
One-Day Tourists to Conventions
 Increasingly, the county is being marketed as a tourist destination, surprising residents who see their communities as just places to live. The Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau, a partnership between the county and the Westchester Chamber of Commerce, coined the term "the Golden Apple" more than a decade ago to promote what they say is the county's unique charm: an appealing balance of bucolic countryside and suburban sophistication. 
 "I think we have to aim for everything from the one-day tourist to the convention visitor," said Andrew P. O'Rourke, the County Executive. "Money spent on tourism is well spent. There are a lot of advantages and truly no disadvantages, because the money that is spent comes from out of town."
The Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau, whose mission is to attract all kinds of visitors to the county, is financed by part of the 3 percent county hotel room tax. Mr. O'Rourke said he hoped to raise the hotel tax to 5 percent. The Visitors Bureau said it received $282,600 last year from the hotel tax. Mr. O'Rourke added that tourism also represented a "soft-sell economic development possibility" because visitors to Westchester are potential clients who might move into the county for housing or to set up a business.
 
The Dollars Add Up
 Eager as they are to show off Westchester's attractions, those active in promoting tourism here are primarily interested in the dollars it brings into the county. According to the Visitors Bureau, 72,000 tourists have been attracted here since its establishment in July 1990 until last June. The visitors spent $36 million while here, with $4.8 million spent on lodging and $31.2 million on meals. Those expenditures generated $1.6 million in hotel room and sales taxes.
The figures do not include tourists who arrived independently of the bureau's promotions, said Harold E. Vogt, the bureau's chairman and president and chief executive officer of the County Chamber of Commerce. Further, he said, the United States Travel Data Center estimates that for every dollar spent for lodging in the New York City area, an additional $1.80 will be spent for other items. Also, leisure or day visitors to the county will spend an average of $50.70 for meals, admissions to attractions, shopping and various other purchases.
In Westchester, tourists belong to two main groups: the leisure traveler -- in the county for a day or two to enjoy the local sights -- and the business visitor.
 
Going to the Beach Gets Old
 Those who took the Hudson cruise, basking in the sunlight as the boat navigated its way north, were thinking about escaping the city for the day or just doing something novel, not about the county's economy.
"Going to the beach gets old," said Kimberly Hull of Manhattan as the boat approached the George Washington Bridge. "We wanted to get out of the city for the day, but we didn't want to rent a car, so we did this. It was kind of spur-of-the-moment. It's nice to have something else to do."
Betsy Brody of Manhattan said: "This is something different instead of just going out and eating brunch and going to a movie. I love historic sites, and it's nice to get away from Manhattan. Westchester is so close but it's so pretty and different. It feels far away."
The boat tours, which are run by Port Imperial Ferry Service of Weehawken, began in June and will run through Oct. 9. Ferries leave from Weehawken, pick up more passengers at 38th Street and 12th Avenue in Manhattan and then travel up to Tarrytown on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The outing represents the kind of tourism that county officials say they hope will be a growing trend.
 
'They Are Going to Spend'
 "We have one of the most beautiful valleys in the world and promoting it and the Hudson River for tourism is the project of the future," said Evelyn Carnicelli, director of the county's Office of Tourism. "Tour boats dropping people off -- this is going to be one of the biggest economic home runs for Westchester County. Not only are we going to promote the idea of people visiting the river, but also going into those little towns. And you know what people are going to do when they get off the boat? They are going to spend money."
Other local historic sites being promoted for tourism include the Van Cortlandt Manor in Croton-on-Hudson, Teatown Lake Reservation in Ossining, Lyndhurst in Tarrytown and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah. The Visitors Bureau and the County Office of Tourism jointly issued a "Summer Fun Pack" book of discount coupons for all of those places, for museums like the Neuberger Museum of Art at the State University at Purchase and the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, and for attractions like Caramoor in Katonah, the North Salem Vineyard, and Playland in Rye.
The other half of the tourism equation -- business travel -- is the bread and butter of Westchester's recruitment efforts. The county has almost 5,000 hotel rooms, and one of the main goals of the Visitors Bureau is to fill them with people by booking meetings and conventions here.
"Suppose you have 300 dentists from Idaho and they want to go to New York City for their association meeting, they want to go to Broadway and they want to see a show," Ms. Carnicelli said. "This is where we come in and say: 'Look, we've got the best of both worlds. We're 30 minutes from Broadway, our hotels are half the price, we're safe, and we're clean. You can go into the city and come back here at night.' "
The next day, Ms. Carnicelli said, they might not want to return to the city but to tour the Hudson Valley instead. Either way, they've paid for a hotel room and breakfast in the county.
The difficulty is that few dentists in Idaho or visitors from other distant states have heard of Westchester, and this is where the Convention and Visitors Bureau does its work. Mr. Vogt, the bureau's chairman, said that the bureau has worked with 68 meeting and convention groups since July 1990. Competition from other areas for conventions and meetings is tough, and the bureau has developed package deals on hotel room charges, meeting rooms and activities for business visitors. From July last year to June this year, the county had 24,726 overnight convention visitors. They spent $2,472,600 on rooms and $4,450,680 on additional items.
 
'Nice Place to Visit'
 But the people who strolled leisurely on the grounds of Sunnyside on a beautiful afternoon recently did not have these facts and figures on their minds. Raquel Gray from Edgewater, N.J., had just finished touring Washington Irving's house.
"We're so close to Westchester and we'd never been up here," she said. "It's like living next to the Empire State Building and never going up it. Now that we're here it's really pleasant."
Rochelle Bronson, who lives in Short Hills, N.J., grew up in the Bronx. She said that when she was young her family used to visit Westchester to shop and get a change of scene.
"Even now, though I live out of the city, I've always maintained that feeling about Westchester -- the greenery, the houses, the peace," she said. "It's a nice place to visit."

HEADLINE: County Westchester Still a Destination

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
JOHN CONCANNON, the stocky, white-haired owner of Morley's Supermarket, points with pride to three large hand-colored photographs from 1962 that hang on a wall in his store -- long an institution on Yonkers Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares of this city. "That's my uncle, the original owner of Morley's," he said. "And that's me, the young man holding up the bananas."
Mr. Concannon's uncle has since died, and the years are beginning to show on the current proprietor's face. The market itself, though, looks much the same as it did 31 years ago -- the main difference being that a new generation of Irish immigrants is helping customers nowadays as they pick over bins of vegetables and fruit outside Morley's front door or order cold cuts and soda bread inside at the deli, where the affable Mr. Concannon presides. 
 It is a highly trafficked store, thick with the accents of customers and employees, who share a common heritage. Copies of the Irish Echo and Irish Voice, two large-circulation Irish-American weekly newspapers, sell briskly at the checkout counters.
Since immigrating to the United States from County Mayo in Ireland more than three decades ago, Mr. Concannon has married, raised a family and prospered in this city, becoming part of the fabric of a large and still growing Irish-American community in Westchester.
 
'The Great Assimilators'
 In the 1990 census, 62,402, or 7 percent, of the county's residents listed their major ancestry as Irish, with another 145,000 -- close to 17 percent -- saying that at least some of their forebears were Irish, said Mary R. Carlson, a research planner for the County Planning Department in White Plains. The Irish are second only in numbers to the Italians, the largest nationality represented in the county, she said.
Throughout two centuries, Irish immigrants have been "the great assimilators," said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, a second-generation Irish-American. Along with the Italians, the Irish have been part of every major building program in the county -- including construction of the Croton Dam in Ossining and the Kensico Dam in Valhalla. Their numbers have been represented on police forces countywide and they have "trickled into politics here," much the way they have in other parts of the United States, the County Executive said.
And since last year, Westchester, like others parts of the nation, has witnessed a relatively large, and legal, influx of Irish -- in contrast with the previous decade, when, according to immigration officials, many who settled here did so by slipping past the authorities, overextending the stays of their temporary visas and living as undocumented aliens.
Legally or without the proper immigration papers, most Irish come to Westchester for economic reasons. Like Michael J. Morley, 42, who owns the other Morley's Supermarket in this city, on Lake Avenue, , the Irish-Americans who were interviewed for this story said there was little opportunity for gainful employment back home, in a country where the unemployment rate has been 19 t0 20 percent for almost a decade.
 
In Ireland for the Weekend
 Mr. Morley was born in the same stone farmhouse as Mr. Concannon, his first cousin, on lush farmland near the Atlantic Ocean. But only one son in each generation -- usually the first born -- has been able to stay on to work the land, which is able to support just one family, Mr. Morley said.
"They would have a series of Irish 'wakes,' farewell parties, as each one left," Mr. Morley said. "Lots of stout, whisky, brown bread and tea, and then the final goodbye."
"Years ago, it really was goodbye forever," he said. "Now there's no such thing as leaving for good. Many of us fly back home even for a weekend, so we just say 'See ya' when we leave."
Mr. Morley came to America in 1973, obtained a green card and started working for his uncles at Morley's Supermarket on Yonkers Avenue. He then purchased his store in 1986 on Lake Avenue, in an area on the northwest side of the city that is still known as Irish Hill. He also owns a pub and restaurant next door, Morley's Steak and Seafood, where fresh pints of Guinness stout are served along with Irish music on some nights and traditional Irish dinners like corned beef and cabbage.
 
'Cream of the Crop'
 Not only in recent years, but also throughout a succession of immigration waves -- including an exodus in the 1840's after potato crop failures -- the overriding factor driving the Irish to American shores has always been economics, immigration officials for the New York City area said. They said that Ireland in the 1990's, which is still largely an agricultural country, continues to lose many of its young adults.
Mr. Morley described the young Irish who are immigrating today as "the cream of the crop, the very well educated with the best degrees who can't find a job."
And although the recession in the United States has driven some Irish home again, many have found Westchester's unemployment rates, which have hovered at less than 6 percent in recent months, not all that daunting by comparison.
Traditionally, Irish women entering the country take jobs as nannies and waitresses, and the men start businesses as painters, plasterers and movers, hoping eventually to find work in the professional fields for which they trained.
 
Adventure and Sunshine
 To a lesser degree, Irish immigration has also been motivated by what Edward A. Sheeran, a hotel and golf course developer in Yonkers, called "a matter of adventure and a desire to see the world in the land of the free and the home of the brave."
"America in the movies is the land of continuous sunshine, which is very appealing to people living in a country like Ireland," said Mr. Sheeran, who came to the United States in 1960 with little more than his identification papers and a promise of room, board and a job from an uncle.
The United States now allows 48,000 residents of Ireland to immigrate under a three-year program that began in 1992 and will continue through next year. Selection has been made on the basis of a lottery and in addition to allowing new Irish immigrants, the program was also designed to provide legal status for the many undocumented Irish aliens already living in the United States.
In the 26-year period from 1965 to 1991, the immigration laws gave preference to those with immediate family members in the United States who would sponsor the new arrivals. This worked against the Irish, who emigrated in fewer numbers and many of whom actually returned to their homeland during this period on hearing news of better economic times there. Many immigrants during this period came from countries like Pakistan, the Philippines and Mexico.
 
16,000 a Year
 Under the program, an Irish immigrant needs only a letter guaranteeing employment, in contrast with the normal procedure, which requires most immigrants to be sponsored by an immediate family member who already lives in the United States, explained Sean R. Benson, executive director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center in Woodside, Queens. Because Ireland's population is only about 3 million, Mr. Benson called the current Irish immigration wave "substantial."
The most recent immigration numbers, however -- about 16,000 a year -- pale in comparison with trends in the 19th century. From 1851 to 1860, for example -- during the years following the potato famine -- 914,119 Irish came to the United States, according to statistics from the Immigration Center.
About half of new Irish immigrants settle in the New York City area, where it is estimated that 5 million live. Others migrate to Florida, where the cost of living is lower and where there are more job opportunities in the construction industry.
 
Cultural and Sports Center
 For those who have settled in the New York City area, Mr. Sheeran is spearheading an effort to establish an Irish-American cultural and sports center in Briarcliff Manor, which would draw from surrounding communities in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
Mr. Sheeran, a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and Grand Marshal of the 1990 St. Patrick's Day Parade, is president of the proposed center, known as Tara Circle. Tara was the name of an ancient royal seat and a meeting place of scholars, poets, athletes and musicians.
Tara Circle, the founding organization, is negotiating to purchase the 58-acre King's College site in Briarcliff Manor, along with its seven buildings, a gymnasium and tennis courts, for $14 million.
Among other things, the center would offer hurling and Gaelic football games (similar to soccer) and classes in Irish heritage and dance. In addition, the center would house a library of Irish writings and a genealogy service.
"It is to mark and save what has gone before -- our roots," Mr. Sheeran said.
 
Opposition to Center
 Many of the newest immigrants, like 22-year-old Lorna King from Tipperary (a county in southern Ireland), who works in Mr. Morley's store, said they miss the culture of their homeland. They often have to travel to the Catskill Mountains to attend Gaelic festivals, where they can participate in traditional dances, games and singing. Ms. King, who is waiting to hear if she will be granted permanent status under the lottery system, said she would welcome an Irish center close to home, where she could meet friends and attend events.
But the future of the proposed center is uncertain, because it has generated stiff opposition from a group called the Residents for the Future of Briarcliff Manor. The group's 400 or so members say they are worried about traffic and noise and the increased demands on police and services, among other things.
Mr. Sheeran, who will present an environmental impact statement to officials in Briarcliff Manor, said he was concerned that some of the opposition might be from residents who see the Irish stereotypically as heavy drinkers and rowdy.
Niall O'Dowd, publisher of the 55,000-circulation Irish Voice, said, "That's like seeing Jews as being mean, or blacks as eating watermelon. It's all just stereotyping, like Irish getting drunk all the time and falling over."
Tara Circle has raised $1 million toward a down payment on the college property, through individual and organizational investors. It is also seeking financing from county and state agencies.

Antiques Shoppers or Corporate Development?

BYLINE: By GENE NEWMAN

DATELINE: BOONTON

 BODY:
PLANS to revitalize Main Street here to take advantage of a new stretch of highway that could speed antiques shoppers into town are facing an uncertain future under a new administration that will take office in January.
The opening of the final section of Interstate 287, which could come as early as November, will link this Morris County town of 8,300 with the New York Thruway. Community leaders say the opening will provide an important opportunity to attract new customers to the antiques stores and specialty shops along Main Street, a half-mile shopping district that winds up a hill past turn-of-the-century buildings. 
 Steps have been taken to retain the street's old-fashioned charm through the establishment of a historical commission and the efforts of a volunteer group that works to preserve and beautify the community.
"Main Street is the key to Boonton's future," said Mayor Robert Depue, who will leave office at the end of the year. "This is the last great chance for Boonton."
The town, he said, was an "isolated hamlet" before Route 287 reached it in the 70's, coming from its southern terminus at the Garden State Parkway near Perth Amboy. The highway now passes through Boonton and ends a mile away in Montville; its final section will connect it with the Thruway at Suffern, N.Y., 21 miles from Boonton.
"This is the end of the road if we can't find a way to take advantage of the completion of Route 287," said the Mayor, who did not seek re-election. "If Main Street dies, the town will not realize its potential."
 
'There Are Other Streets in Town'
 Daniel Gregory, who won the Republican mayoral primary in June and will run unopposed in November for a two-year term, said: "Main Street revitalization is fine. We need to do everything we can for Main Street, but there are other streets in town also."
Mr. Gregory, a land surveyor and planner, has held posts in town as an alderman and a member of the Planning Board and the Board of Education. During his successful primary race against Alderman Ronald Rubino, a political ally of the outgoing Mayor, Mr. Gregory spoke against the current administration's approach to enhancing the economy. All the town's aldermen are Republicans; the Democrats are offering no candidates in this year's election.
Mr. Gregory said that while he did not oppose revitalizing Main Street, he would place a high priority on reducing the property tax rate by attracting more commercial development. "I have to be cognizant of helping the whole town," he said. "The whole town elected me."
Mr. Gregory said he hoped to see development of the vacant tract where the Pacific Vegetable Oil Corporation had a factory that closed in 1987 because the company went bankrupt. But first the site's contaminated soil must be cleaned up.
Mayor Depue has argued that the cleanup faced an extensive delay because the company was bankrupt and involved in litigation with the state over the pollution.
The town cannot count on finding additions to the tax rolls, Mr. Depue said. "There are less than two and a half square miles in this town," he said. "So we should have found them by now."
In an effort to help Main Street, Alderman Rubino, whose term expires next year, said he was working on a plan to remove the street's parking meters for a six-month trial. Parking now costs 25 cents an hour there.
 
Free Parking With One-Hour Limit
 Under Mr. Rubino's plan, they would park free, but with a one-hour limit. Police officers would keep tabs on parkers, giving tickets to violators. The fine for overtime parking would remain at $7. In addition, 88 spaces in the nearby Plane Street lot would be available for 50 cents a day, Mr. Rubino said.
He said that it was impossible to tell how much of the town's annual meter income of $64,000 is from Main Street meters, but that with stepped-up enforcement he did not anticipate a revenue loss.
Some merchants say the one-hour parking limit is too short for antiques browsers. "Customers don't mind paying parking money, but they need at least two hours, " said Marjorie Tyndale, who owns a fine-arts and antiques store on Main Street with her husband, Hal.
More debate has been generated by the creation this year of the local Historic Preservation Commission, which will regulate architectural changes to 102 buildings, almost all of them on Main Street. The seven-member commission will enforce an ordinance that calls for preservation of the "original character" of the street.
The drive for the ordinance was "a holy war that went on for months," said the commission vice chairman, Mark Middleton. "And it affects mostly the store owners, 60 percent of whom are nonresidents."
"There is a real struggle in town," said Mr. Middleton, a computer software representative who moved to Boonton six years ago. The battle, he said, pits those who want to fix up Main Street to give it the elegant character of neighboring Chester against those who want to leave the street alone and seek tax-producing development elsewhere in town.
When the results of the June primary are verified in the November election, Mr. Middletown predicted, the governing body will be 6 to 3 against the type of changes sought by the present administration.
Louis J. Masterbone, an ally of Mr. Gregory who won nomination in the primary as an alderman, said, "I am going to go out and ask a lot of questions and then form an opinion" on the Main Street issue. Mr. Masterbone, a resident of Boonton for 18 years, is a detective sergeant in the Morris County Sheriff's office.
On Main Street, Mr. Tyndale, treasurer of Boonton U.S.A., an association of antiques dealers who pool advertising funds, said the group's membership has dwindled to 7 from 23 in recent years. He called the historic preservation ordinance "a step in the right direction," but said that a proposed ordinance to regulate the size, color and lighting of store signs was coming too late.
"A couple of years ago, a good salesman came here selling garish red and yellow signs," he said. He said the ordinance would probably allow existing signs to remain.
Elizabeth Lee of Elizabeth's Antiques and Fine Imports, a retailer in Boonton for 13 years, said ordinances to revitalize Main Street should have teeth in them. "If it's just rhetoric and political, what's the use?" she asked.
 
Doubts About Revitalization
 Felix Pagan, owner of Tiajuana Willie's restaurant, said: "Revitalization? I don't think it's working." He said there were more vacancies on Main Street than he had seen in his five years there.
Rona Jonnard, owner of Boonton Antiques for 21 years, said Route 287 would bring New York and Connecticut customers to Boonton in 45 minutes. The town, she said, is "one of the best-kept secrets" in the antiques world, with dealers from New York and Pennsylvania buying wares here by the vanload.
Several retailers spoke warmly about a volunteer group called Bounce (Boonton's United Community Effort) which has worked to improve parks and historic sites and has initiated flower and tree plantings, house tours and applications for community development grants.
"The main thing is to improve the quality of life in Boonton," said the group's president, Gail Yorkston, a teacher whose husband, David, chairman of the Historic Preservation Commission, ran unsuccessfully for an alderman nomination in June. "If that can be done with the revitalization of Main Street, we support it. If it can be done within increased ratables, we might support that, too."
Mrs. Yorkston said that 10 percent of the town's residents were contributing members to the 11-year-old organization. It is printing a directory of Main Street shops and restaurants and will distribute 10,000 copies to visitors' centers and hotels throughout the state, she said.
While calling her group apolitical, Mrs. Yorkston said, "Bounce has worked very closely with the current administration." She added: "Our plans mesh with theirs. I don't know if that will be true next year."

HEADLINE: Health Planners at White House Consider Lid on Medicare Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Less than a month before President Clinton is to unveil his proposal for a national health insurance program, disputes have broken out among Administration officials over how to finance it and how tightly to limit overall health spending.
Officials said that the White House, seeking to avoid new taxes, was seriously considering a proposal to squeeze more than $100 billion of additional savings from Medicare, the Federal health program for the elderly, by holding down increases in the program through the year 2000. The savings, along with a possible increase in the tax on cigarettes, would help pay for Mr. Clinton's promise of guaranteed coverage for all Americans. 
 In addition, some White House officials have proposed setting tight limits on the growth of all health spending, public and private, so that by 1997 it would grow no faster than the economy as a whole. Health spending is now growing more than twice that fast.
Under the Clinton plan, a new Government agency, the National Health Board, would establish a limit on the average yearly health insurance premium to be paid by employers and workers.
The proposals have provoked fierce debate inside the Administration, with some Presidential appointees arguing that the swift imposition of such limits is politically unrealistic and economically unfeasible.
"It's not an ideological argument," one Cabinet officer said. "We agree on Clinton's general approach to health care reform. It's an argument about what is possible -- how fast we can pound down the growth of health spending, how tight the caps on such spending should be, how big the cuts in Medicare will be. A hundred billion dollars in Medicare cuts are not politically possible."
 
Conclusion and Challenge
 Ira C. Magaziner, who has coordinated development of the health plan, argues that substantial cutbacks in Medicare and the proposed limits on health spending are feasible and realistic. But several Cabinet officials have challenged that conclusion, including Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services; Robert E. Rubin, assistant to the President for economic policy; Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr. Clinton has promised that his plan will not require any new broad-based tax. This vow has forced him to intensify his search for other ways to pay for his proposals, whose exact cost is not yet known.
Medicare finances health care for 36 million elderly and disabled people. The budget bill signed by Mr. Clinton on Aug. 10 cuts $55.8 billion from the projected growth of Medicare over the next five years, mainly by curbing payments to hospitals and doctors and increasing beneficiaries' premiums. Despite these cutbacks, which account for nearly one-fourth of all spending cuts in the budget bill, the cost of Medicare is expected to soar, to $239 billion in 1998 from $129 billion last year.
 
Fear of Unintended Effects?
 Health policy experts warn that further cutbacks could have unintended effects. Doctors and hospitals, they say, would try to offset the loss of Medicare income by raising prices to privately insured patients, thwarting Mr. Clinton's effort to restrain health spending -- unless the Government prevents such cost shifting by enforcing limits on all health spending.
Most of Medicaid, the Federal-state program for low-income people, would be folded into the new system under Mr. Clinton's plan.
The White House says Mr. Clinton intends to unveil his health plan before a joint session of Congress on Sept. 22 or a few days later.
Administration officials have said that under the plan all Americans will be entitled to a comprehensive package of health benefits. To help hold down costs, Mr. Clinton will propose a nationwide system of health insurance purchasing groups to bargain with doctors, hospitals and insurance companies for the best coverage.
 
The Basic Questions
 But interviews with Administration officials suggest that some basic questions remain in dispute.
The President's plan would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of the cost of health premiums for their employees. Workers would generally be expected to pay the remainder, up to 20 percent of the premium; the money would be withheld from their pay.
Employers could pay part or all of the employee share. The Government would still incur heavy costs because it would subsidize insurance for low-wage workers and for small businesses that employ such workers.
White House documents show that subsidies would be available to employers with fewer than 50 workers if their average wage was less than than $24,000 a year.
Subsidies would also be available to families with incomes up to 50 percent above the official poverty level (up to $21,514 for a family of four) to help pay the patients' share of medical bills, including deductibles.
As a Presidential candidate, Mr. Clinton said he would set "a national health budget" to impose an overall limit on costs. He now proposes to do that by limiting the annual increase in health insurance premiums and health spending by corporations for their employees.
 
Equal Cost Controls
 The White House documents say that Mr. Clinton's proposal, the American Health Security Act, would bring "projected growth in health-care costs in line with growth in gross domestic product by 1997." Kevin Anderson, a White House spokesman, said "cost controls will be applied equally" to private health spending and public programs.
Initially, under the Clinton plan, premiums could increase no more than the average of the increase in gross domestic product for the three previous years, White House documents say.
Mr. Clinton would impose stricter limits on medical spending after the first two years of the new health system.
"Thereafter," the documents say, "the inflation factor equals the three-year average of the increase in the per capita G.D.P." The increase in the per capita figure is smaller because it takes no account of economic growth attributable to the increase in population.
Over the last four years, health care spending grew an average of 11 percent a year. The gross domestic product grew 5 percent a year, while per capita G.D.P. rose 4 percent a year.
 
'Smells Like Big Government'
 The Administration is shying from explicit price controls on doctors and hospitals. But some Administration officials say the limits on health spending may be so strict that the effect is almost the same.
"Ira would like the caps to be very tight," one Cabinet officer said. "When you go to tight caps, you are going to something like price controls."
The Cabinet officer, a lifelong Democrat, called the plan is "heavily regulatory -- it smells like big government."
The National Health Board, to be composed of seven Presidential appointees, would compute the cost of the package of health benefits to be guaranteed to all Americans and would calculate the "national per capita premium" needed to cover the cost.
Using this number as a reference point and adjusting it for regional variations in health spending, the board would calculate a "per capita premium target" for each of the health insurance purchasing groups set up across the country through which most Americans would get their insurance coverage. In this way, the board would set a yearly budget for each such group.
Here are other details of the Clinton plan, as described in documents from the White House and the National Economic Council:
BIG CORPORATIONS. By Jan. 1, 1996, each state must establish one or more of the large purchasing groups, known as regional health alliances, for its residents. All Federal, state and local government employees must obtain coverage through the purchasing group in the area where they live. People who are self-employed or unemployed will also get coverage through regional alliances unless they qualify for Medicare.
But big corporations with more than 5,000 employees may run their own health plans, serving as their own insurers or buying coverage from a private insurance company.
These corporate health plans, to be known as corporate alliances, would have to meet Federal standards regulating the scope of benefits, financial reserves and the prudent use of money held in trust for workers. "Employees in corporate alliances are not eligible for public subsidies," the document said.
Employers operating their own health plans would have to pay "a premium surcharge of 1 percent of payroll" to help cover the cost of the new health-care system.
Corporate health plans would have to comply with "cost-containment goals" set by the National Health Board. These limits would be slightly stricter than those for the regional health alliances. Large employers that exceed these spending limits would lose the privilege of running their own health plans and would be "required to purchase coverage through regional alliances."
FEE SCHEDULES. Most consumers would get care from health maintenance organizations and other networks of doctors and hospitals. But each insurance purchasing group would also have to offer a traditional health plan, under which consumers could consult any doctor and doctors could charge a fee for each service.
Each state would establish a fee schedule for doctors serving these patients. A doctor "may not charge or collect from a patient a fee in excess of the rate schedule." This prohibition represents a big change. Under current law, the Government generally does not regulate doctors' charges to their privately insured patients.
ENFORCEMENT. The Treasury Secretary could impose a monetary penalty on anyone who failed to enroll in a health plan by a specified date. The documents do not say how severe such a penalty would be.
The Federal Government would enforce health-care budgets for three years, from 1996 to 1998. Regional health alliances must submit proposed premiums to the National Health Board for approval. States would be responsible for enforcement after 1998.


GRAPHIC: President Clinton's health plan would provide Government assistance to low-wage workers and to small businesses that employ such workers to help them buy health insurance. Employers would be eligible if they have fewer than 50 employees and if the average wage is less than $24,000 a year. These examples show how it might work.

HEADLINE: Long Island Drive-In May Play Its Last Reels

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTBURY, L.I., Aug. 26

 BODY:
At one time, it was just another outdoor movie theater in suburbia, a vast, bumpy blacktop where children snoozed through the second feature in the backs of their parents' station wagons, and animated hot dogs danced with hamburgers across a screen 80 feet high.
In those days, there was not much to distinguish the Westbury Drive-In from the dozens of others that were a mainstay of cinematic life in New York's suburbs. But today, the Westbury, with its marquee missing light bulbs and its asphalt scarred by potholes, is distinctive in one respect: It is the last of the great outdoor picture shows in the metropolitan region. 
 And now it, too, may go dark. The company that has run the drive-in for 40 years wants to close it and replace it with a multiplex, a type of moviehouse the company says is far more in tune with the times and the wide range of entertainment choices available to the public.
It would not be the first time that a drive-in would be supplanted by a multiscreen theater: movie exhibitors learned long ago that outdoor theaters took up too much space and had too few screens to justify the expensive tracts they occupied.
But the plan to transform the Westbury -- which town officials in Oyster Bay are expected to vote on in the fall -- is more than a commentary on the economics of the entertainment industry. As a relic of the postwar boom in the suburbs, where the landscape was re-imagined with the automobile in mind, Long Island's last drive-in is a symbol of the passing of an era.
"We have to grow with the times and accept the fact that Long Island is changing," said Howard Hogan, a town councilman in Oyster Bay whose family co-owns the land under the Westbury. He is embroiled in a battle with residents of the area who oppose the multiplex, chiefly on the ground of the additional traffic that they say would be generated by the theater and a wholesale shopping club also planned for the site. "The habits of people change, and the forms of public entertainment have changed, and we have to be prepared to meet that," Mr. Hogan added.
Although the drive-in era is fading fast all across America -- from a peak of more than 4,000 outdoor movie screens in the 1950's, there were just 899 remaining in 1991, according to the most recent survey by the National Association of Theater Owners -- the drive-in experience has not changed all that much over the years. And neither has the Westbury. The posts with the soundboxes that motorists draped over their windows to hear the movies are gone, replaced by sound systems broadcast to car radios; the playgrounds have been dismantled and the theater charges by the person, not the carload.
But children still arrive at the Westbury in pajamas, and teen-agers still arrive in pairs.
On a recent weekday evening, a steady stream of cars passed through the old tollbooths at the entrance to the drive-in. By the light of a shimmering half-moon, the moviegoers maneuvered their vehicles over the rutted blacktop, on the prowl for the perfect place for a night of film-watching al fresco.
Among them were Michael and Mary Stein of New Hyde Park, who backed their van onto one of the bumps and off-loaded chaise longues, crayons and children. The Steins are drive-in sentimentalists: Mr. Stein came to the Westbury as a boy, took his future wife here on dates when they were teen-agers, and now brings the whole family, including daughters Kerianne, 6, and Kimberly, 3, each year to celebrate the couple's wedding anniversary.
This evening, to mark the anniversary, they were all here to see "The Fugitive," although Mrs. Stein predicted that Kimberly would be fast asleep in no time. "We come on our anniversary and at least one other time each summer," Mrs. Stein said, as her daughters colored in the moonlight on a table that her husband, a New York City firefighter, had set up at the edge of the van. "It would be a shame if they shut this place down."
The operators of the Westbury, United Artists Theater Circuit Inc., once had a string of drive-ins from one end of Long Island to the other. One by one they flickered out. But no one at the company, which also operates 17 indoor theaters on Long Island, could explain precisely why the Westbury has endured the longest. It may have been a case of survival of the fittest, for on summer nights when it shows blockbuster flicks like "Jurassic Park," the Westbury packs them in as tightly as any viewing chamber in the cinema 1-2-3-4-5.
 
Three Screens on 24 Acres
 It is a sign of how irrelevant an artifact the theater has become that the fight over the site has little to do with drive-in nostalgia. Still, it is a well-known landmark on Brush Hollow Road, next to a bowling alley and down the street from the Westbury Music Fair. "It's been a good neighbor," said Leonard Gutterman, president of the West Birchwood Civic Association in nearby Jericho and a leader of the opposition to the multiplex. "It has not been a problem."
The Westbury, built in 1953, occupies 24 acres and can handle a total of about 1,000 cars at its three screens, which form a semicircle around a brightly lighted concession stand. It is open 365 days a year, and nothing short of an act of God stops the show. On the day a hurricane passed through several years back, the Westbury was up and running that evening. "Rain, fog, wind, you name it, we're here," said the Westbury's manager, Stanley Friedman, who pointed to a sign near his desk: "No Refunds Due to Weather."
There are many, of course, who do not mourn the passing of the drive-in, moviegoers who prefer the reclining seats and Dolby sound and sleek efficiency of the airport terminal-style multiscreen complexes of the 1990's. The drive-in, after all, was marketed in its heyday as a practical, if less than ideal, alternative to indoor theaters: "Come as you are in your family car," went the slogan.
"In the early days, if a family wanted to get out of the city and see a movie in the suburbs, about the only place they could go was a drive-in. And they'd put up with a lot of inconveniences: the mosquitoes, the heat," said Sumner Redstone, whose father was a pioneer in the business, running some of the most successful drive-ins in the country, outdoor movie meccas like the Whitestone in the Bronx and the Sunrise in Valley Stream.
 
'Passion Pits'
 But the drive-in still has its constituency, a small, devoted assortment of nostalgia buffs, fresh-air enthusiasts and baby boomers-turned-parents who come to expose a new generation to a type of entertainment that might not be around much longer. There are the regulars, said Mr. Friedman's assistant, Daniel Boyd, like the old couple that parks their Hyundai at the tollbooths one night each weekend at around 6 P.M., assuring that they will be the first ones in for the movies that typically begin two hours later.
"I used to live down the block," said Mr. Boyd, a movie fan who has worked at the Westbury since 1986. "I remember seeing 'The Swiss Family Robinson' here when I was 10."
 
Something to Remember
 And it remains a magnet for teen-age and other surreptitious lovers, a reminder of the time not too long ago when drive-ins were referred to with a snicker as "passion pits." On a recent evening in the concession area, Mr. Friedman recalled, "a guy walked up to me and asked me if we sold condoms." (They don't.)
As the sun dipped below the Long Island Expressway, and the sky faded to magenta and black, the last cars took their places for the start of the movie on Screen 2.
In one of the rows closest to the screen, Stanley and Elizabeth Olenyk of Levittown sat on lawn chairs with their 9-year-old son, James. Longtime fans of drive-ins, the Olenyks, too, had been going to outdoor movies for years, and wanted James to share their pleasure.
"We wanted him to experience it before they close it down," Mr. Olenyk explained. "It's something from the past that is an important, tangible thing to remember."
United Artists officials say they are not sure what they will do with the Westbury if the multiplex proposal is not approved. There is some talk, in the interim, of trying to cash in on drive-in nostalgia by staging marathon horror movie festivals.
Gail McCaffrey, the company's regional division manager for Long Island, says that would be fine with her. Having got her start in movie exhibition working at the renovated vaudeville houses and vast drive-ins of the Midwest, she has a soft spot for the weather-beaten old dinosaur on Brush Hollow Road.
"On the last day," she said, "I couldn't stand to be here."

HEADLINE: Small-Time Gold Miners Scrape By

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEAVERVILLE, Calif.

 BODY:
Mickey Rees, an independent gold miner working on the Trinity River, ignores the people who lean out of their speeding cars to shout mockingly, "Get a job."
But when tourists pull over to photograph him, shirtless and smoking on a floating dredge the size of a limousine, the 43-year-old miner and Vietnam veteran takes out binoculars and stares back. Though he may seem like an anachronism, Mr. Rees says he is not ready to become a souvenir. 
 Since 1979, when he quit his job as a foreman at a Long Beach construction company, Mr. Rees has made a living "taking money out of the river," as he and others call gold mining. But now small-time miners say they fear it is only a matter of time before they become extinct.
Ever since gold was first discovered here in 1848, it has been part of the state's folklore, the unofficial natural lottery that people play while on vacation in Northern California. Those who fall for the grungy romance of a miner's life and try to eke out a living in the rivers say the pleasure is in the pursuit, when an ore streak glimmers in the water after a series of barren days.
 
Life Style Vanishing
 But independent gold miners may be a dying breed. One reason is economics. The price of gold has gone from above $800 an ounce in 1981 to less than $400 this year. And although there is still gold to be had by panning and suction-dredge mining, it becomes more difficult to find as miners move from claim to claim.
What will probably deliver the death blow to the miners' endeavor, however, are pending changes in state and Federal regulations. State wildlife officials, concerned about the declining numbers of salmon and steelhead fish in the rivers of Northern California, may close off portions of the rivers to the miners and restrict the kinds of machinery they use.
And on the Federal level, legislation has been introduced by Representative Nick J. Rahall 2d, Democrat of West Virginia, that would force all miners, big and small, to pay the Government an 8 percent royalty on all the gold they find; now they only pay taxes on their profits.
Although Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt supports stringent controls of mining, "he is aware of small miners and wants to take care of them so they are not made extinct," said Stephanie Hanna, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department.
But as he took a break after a day of work, Mr. Rees said he held out little hope. "This kind of life is being phased out," he said. "Most of us are broke. We don't lobby. We don't make money. We don't make anyone else money. We're an easy target."
Since California's first gold rush, when miners settled counties like Trinity, the five major rivers and their tributaries in the north have been picked over twice more, first by Chinese laborers at the turn of the century and then by people out of work during the Depression.
Since then miners have developed high-tech gold panning methods. Wearing heated wet suits with sot masks and 60-pound belts, they dive under water and sweep the river's bedrock with devices called suction dredges. With an eight-inch nozzle like an underwater vacuum cleaner, they suck up riverbed gravel, which is flushed over a large grate to separate the gold.
Gold fever usually begins on vacations, and minor successes with a spoon and a pan can lead to purchases like a small suction dredge, which costs $800. The bigger dredges, used by the serious miners, cost $10,000.
The number of people mining has declined from 13,000 in 1980 to 5,000 this year. Some are recreational miners but one-third are working alone or with a partner trying to make a living finding gold, said Hal Cribbs, a political consultant working on mining issues in Sacramento. Mr. Cribbs said about 1,500 work on the rivers year-round.
The serious say river mining is not an easy way to get rich. On good days, a suction dredger can pull an ounce out of the river, which can get a miner anywhere from $270 to $370 either at a jewelry store or at a smelting operation. But weeks can go by when the miner does not hit any gold.
But the miners say the appeal is not the money, but being their own boss and living with the unexpected.
"There are no assurances," said Mr. Rees, who lives in a 37-foot Ford bus and earns an average of $10,000 a year. "Your wife has left you, you have lost your home, your body hurts, all for the hope of finding something."
"It's not the gold," said Lynn Gunn, 38, who has mined for 10 years with her husband, Dan Morrison. "It's finding the gold."
 
Rallying Support
 Over the past year, Ms. Gunn, who worked as an electrician in Silicon Valley before mining, has tried to bring the miners' concerns to state and Federal officials. But she has had little luck in organizing the miners. Spread throughout Northern California, miners by nature are loners who distrust government, she said, making it hard to inspire them to come to meetings.
She has produced a pamphlet, The Miners Survival Kit, which recommends greeting rafters, kayakers and fishermen because "these people vote, and there's more of them than us." It also asks miners to collect lead, copper and mercury accumulated in the dredge to present at local public hearings as proof that dredging actually picks up pollutants from the rivers.
Some miners have decided to stay out of the conflict, hoping that it will go away. But if it does not, what the miners will do next is unclear. Trinity County already has 14.7 percent unemployment, five percentage points higher than the state rate. Many miners talk about leaving the country for South America, where they say the gold is more plentiful and the regulations are few. Others, like Mr. Rees, plan to return to the blue-collar jobs they had before they got gold fever.
Charlie Fitch, who as a ranger for the Forest Service must enforce Federal rules dealing with issues like the equipment miners can use, says he has found his job difficult.
 
'Taking Away Their Dreams'
 "Miners are dreamers," Mr. Fitch said. "Those are a tough people to work with because you are taking away their dreams."
Joe Valdez, 43, who has also been mining in Trinity County for 10 years, said he got gold fever after panning on weekends while working in Sacramento doing odd jobs.
"You go in the water, and you don't know if you will come out with $6,000 or nothing," Mr. Valdez said. Yet, once he finds gold, it loses its appeal. "When you are in gold, it becomes just a job," he said.
Todd Steele is one of those miners who is resigned to making a career change. This summer, he and his wife, Jeanne, an artist, are making jewelry with gold they have already mined instead of looking for more.
"There's something unbeatable about going to a river in the morning and that is your office," Mr. Steele said. "You fight the weather, you don't know where the gold is but it is you against yourself and Mother Nature. And that's enough. But when you have bureaucracies breathing down your neck, that's too much."

HEADLINE: Health Care Quandary: Will Coverage Cut Jobs?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The Clinton aides finishing up his health plan are wrestling with a devilish quandary: how to keep the creation of universal coverage from costing low-wage workers a pay cut or even their jobs.
At first glance, it would seem that these workers would be the plan's biggest winners. Domestics, farm workers, sales clerks and others with modest earnings account for most of today's 16.3 million uninsured workers. 
 A policy paid by employers that is as good as that offered by Fortune 500 companies would be the equivalent of a raise of several thousand dollars, seemingly just what is needed for workers who, as a group, have seen their pay and benefits shrink for nearly two decades.
But labor economists in the Administration and academia are acutely aware that unless the requirement for employers is balanced by potentially large Government subsidies, it is those low-wage workers, not businesses, who are likely to wind up footing the bill as employers seek to compensate for increased costs.
 
Lost Jobs or Wage Cuts
 "You'd expect to see fewer low-wage jobs because it would be more expensive to hire less-skilled workers," said Barbara Wolfe, a labor economist at the University of Wisconsin. "There's reason to be very concerned and very cautious."
Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the University of Texas, said: "Either there are going to job cuts or wage cuts or, more likely, a combination of both. It's got to be one or the other."
Ira C. Magaziner, the President's top health care adviser, recently called worries about job losses "crazy." But economists involved in the planning process have been raising the issue all along.
Administration officials are aware of the problem, although they are under strict orders not to discuss estimates of potential job losses. "We're studying the issue intensively so that our plan has the largest possible job creation impact," said Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy.
 
Estimates Vary Widely
 Potential job losses depend, among many other things, on the cost of coverage and how much of the direct cost of employing low-wage workers would increase. Administration officials say potential job losses for low-wage workers, in the absence of a subsidy, is likely to be 200,000 to 700,000.
Some academics outside the Administration, maintaining that universal coverage is likely to cost more than the Administration now realizes, believe the potential lost jobs could be two or three times that large, ranging up to three million.
Labor economists say that when the Government requires employers to provide a benefit, most of its cost is eventually shifted to workers, through cuts in their cash wages or other benefits. But since it is difficult to squeeze the pay of workers who earn close to the minimum wage, employers have often cut jobs, substituting machines for people and, more often, more skilled workers for less skilled ones.
"Many workers will be totally unaffected, but it will have a serious effect on low-wage workers," said June O'Neill, a labor economist at Baruch College who says job losses are potentially very large.
 
Effect Is Concentrated
 The overwhelming majority of the uninsured are low-wage workers in a handful of industries like restaurant service, retail sales, construction and farming. Because they are not scattered throughout the economy, their employers face potentially large increases -- in the double digits -- in payroll costs.
Some Administration officials say they are confident that new hiring by high-wage companies like auto makers, which are expected to see a decline in health care costs, will offset losses, if any, at the bottom of the job ladder. Thus, the Administration's plan could reinforce a host of trends that have been bearing down on the least-skilled, least-educated Americans for the last two decades and add to the schism between the fortunes of low-wage and high-wage workers.
To limit the impact on low-wage workers, health care planners have suggested that the requirement be phased in over five to seven years and that the amount small businesses would have to pay be limited to 3.5 percent of payrolls, about half what larger companies pay. They have also recommended that employees' contributions be capped based on their income and that the Government provide subsidies.
Subsidies to business would grow or shrink with the actual number of jobs lost, but they are very difficult to design and could wind up stimulating accounting games if not outright deceptions by businesses. That could swell the Federal budget deficit, a very risky step given the public focus on it, not to mention the Administration's own push to cut its growth. The official line is that the subsidies will be small and can be financed by "administrative savings" or, at most, a tax on smokers, but most economists are highly skeptical.
 
Heavy Burdens Seen
 In a study released recently by the Employment Policies Institute, a research organization backed by business, Professor O'Neill and her husband, Dave M. O'Neill at Baruch College, both highly regarded labor economists, concluded that the problem was potentially far bigger than the Administration has been saying.
The O'Neill study assumed that the average cost of a policy for a single worker would be $2,400 and the average cost of a family policy would be $5,900, about the average cost of covering workers today, and that because of seniority considerations, employers would not be able to cut pay below $8.50 an hour. From this they calculated that, while overall labor costs in the entire economy might rise just 2.5 percent, certain industries, restaurants, for example, would face potential increases in their labor costs of 16 percent.
Economists involved in the health care planning process, on the other hand, assume that the plan will cost roughly $2,000 for each worker, far less than the average businesses pay now -- and that businesses will be able to cut more from low-wage workers' pay and wind up cutting fewer jobs.
Other labor economists consider the O'Neills' estimates credible.
"I think her estimates could be fairly conservative," said Finis Welch, a labor economist at Texas A&M University.
"The reason people are uninsured in the first place is that they were unwilling to have their wages cut and they wanted their jobs," Professor June O'Neill said. "It seems fairer for the public to pay for the poor than for the poor to pay in the form of lost jobs."

HEADLINE: A School Board and State

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MERIDEN, Conn., Aug. 27

 BODY:
In four separate votes, the Board of Education in this blue-collar town has refused to institute a state-mandated free-breakfast program at one of its elementary schools.
Cost is not the issue because the state and Federal governments say they will pay for the program. Instead, the board says it is standing on principle, fighting state mandates, the intrusion of big government and the ever-expanding welfare state. 
 "The feeling I get is they're fed up with all these mandates, and enough is enough," Mayor Angelo R. D'Agostino said, adding, "I think people have had it."
The board seems unwilling to change its mind, even in the face of a threat by the State Attorney General to take Meriden to court.
Robert E. Kosinski Jr., who, at 23, is Meriden's youngest school board member, says the issue symbolizes the problems he sees in society today.
"I was brought up in a Catholic family," Mr. Kosinski said. "My parents worked very hard to provide for their family. Young parents look for the freebies. It's too easy for them to not want to take the responsibility."
Gerald I. Adelman, a board member who supports the breakfast program, said everyone agrees that parents should be feeding their children at home. But children do come to school hungry, and he said board members should have chosen another issue to take a stand on.
"It's awful that the children are the ones who suffer, that people decide to draw the line in the sand over feeding young kids," Mr. Adelman said. "This debate has done nothing to help the education system in Meriden, nor to promote the public image of the town."
 
Improved Attendance
 Nutritionists and educators say research has shown that children who begin participating in a school breakfast program may improve their attendance and their academice performance.
As of last year, 14 states -- including New York and Massachusetts -- had laws requiring that school breakfasts be offered in schools that have large numbers of students from poor families. New York, which had mandated school breakfasts in its five largest cities in 1976, this year expanded its law to all districts that have schools with needy children. In Connecticut, 102 schools, including John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, fall under the state's 1993school-breakfast law, which applies to elementary schools where at least 80 percent of students enrolled in the lunch program received a free or reduced-price lunch.
The Connecticut Anti-Hunger Coalition started pushing for a mandate after many districts remained reluctant to begin breakfast programs, even though Connecticut began offering grants to supplement Federal subsidies in 1986, said Laura I. Cohen, the group's director.
But school districts also worry that breakfast will cost money, disrupt bus schedules and cut into classroom time, Ms. Cohen said. "Somehow those issues seem to miraculously disappear a month after the program takes effect," Ms. Cohen said.
Bridgeport, which began offering school breakfasts in January 1992, was among the last districts to adopt a program -- and only started it because of the 1991 state law. Michael C. Bisciglia, president of the Bridgeport school board, had vehemently opposed the program, yet now admits many of his fears never came true.
A study of 2,400 children participating in the Bridgeport breakfast program shows that their attendance improved over the previous year -- to 95.3 percent, from 92.7. While academic achievement did not go up enough to be considered statistically significant, school leaders say it may be too soon to know.
Meriden first fell under the state mandate in September 1992, when John Barry Elementary School, with about 600 students, reached the 80 percent eligibility level.
The city successfully challenged a glitch in the initial law, which based its mandate on the percentage of students in the entire school rather than on those enrolled in the lunch program. The measure was revised this year to its current language. Meriden now threatens to challenge the law again, although Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said they have no basis for a challenge.
"If there's no compliance with the law," he said, "we will seek a court order telling the Meriden Board of Education to start a breakfast program." He has asked for an answer by Tuesday.
Mayor D'Agostino, though he is sympathetic to the school board's stance, said he thought that because the state is pressing the matter, the board should comply with the law.
 
A Working-Class Backlash
 Those on both sides of the issue in Meriden say that the outrage against the program is a backlash against state mandates at a time when a poor economy continues to hurt the working-class people who make up so much of Meriden's population.
Frank R. Kogut, school board president, said residents are tired of expensive mandates that they don't agree with. And the state and Federal grants that proponents say will cover all the costs of the program -- an assertion that Mr. Kogut challenges -- is still taxpayer money, he said.
This sentiment, Mr. Adelman said, is aggravated by the recession.
"I've talked to a lot of hard-working people, who aren't ones to write letters to the editor, who feel, this is one too many," Mr. Adelman said.
Ms. Cohen of the anti-hunger coalition understands those sentiments.
"No one disagrees that the ideal situation is to have kids eat at home," she said. "But while we adults debate the root causes and solutions to the problem, a whole generation of kids is slipping away, and we're all going to pay for that in the end."

HEADLINE: Leading Contender for a Schools Job Few Want

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
A continent away from the bustle of New York City, where the months-long search for a schools chancellor may soon be over, Ramon C. Cortines enjoyed the simple pleasures of a weekend by the bay and pondered the ultimate question:
Why would a man who has already run three school districts, who quit his job as head of the San Francisco schools last year because of a grinding work schedule and a painful ulcer, eagerly await a summons to New York and a thankless job that has bowed several distinguished educators before him?
 
'I'm Not Willing to Give Up'
 "Attempting to make urban school districts work challenges me," said Mr. Cortines, a 61-year-old Mexican-American who is now the top choice of the four-member majority on New York's Board of Education. "People say New York can't be done. Well, I'm not willing to give up on our big cities." 
 Mr. Cortines emerged as the top contender for the New York job at a private closed meeting of the Board of Education on Friday. He won the support of the faction that forced the ouster of Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez earlier this year. The board is to begin final deliberations on its choice on Monday.
Despite his optimism, nothing in Mr. Cortines's background could truly prepare him for running a system the size of New York's, with its $7 billion budget, its enrollment of nearly a million students and its recent history of brutal political battles over teaching about homosexuality and distribution of condoms in the schools.
"I recognize that and it scares me a little," he said. "I'm so results-oriented and I know there will be no instant Cream of Wheat with this job."
But he says he has solved complex problems at each stop in his career, and his middle-of-the-road attitudes about education will most likely hold him in good stead with the majority on New York's Board of Education, who represent a more conservative constituency in the boroughs outside Manhattan.
In Pasadena, with 24,000 students, where Mr. Cortines was hired, fired and rehired over the course of 12 years by a fractious board, he carried out a court-ordered desegregation plan. In San Jose, with 30,000 students, he was again the architect of a desegregation plan, and also restored solvency to a district that had declared bankrupcy under the previous administration.
In San Francisco, as the state slid into financial crisis, Mr. Cortines's primary task was cutting $50 million in costs. During his tenure here, from 1986 to 1992, he was widely credited with trimming staff and reducing programs while raising test scores and improving attendance in the 62,000-student district. At the same time, he led a successful ballot campaign for a half-cent sales tax dedicated to the city's schools and attracted thousands of dollars of corporate money to classrooms.
 
'He Actually Delivered'
 "It wasn't promises, promises; he actually delivered," said Libby Denebeim, who retired as a school board member in January. "In a budget-cutting time, it was simply remarkable."
Several of Mr. Cortines's pitched battles were with San Francisco's strong gay community. He objected to a plan for a school-based counseling program for gay and lesbian youth, saying at first that the district had to be "careful about enticing young people as it relates to their sexual orientation." Later, he said the word "entice" had been a poor choice. Mr. Cortines designed an alternative program that included a half-time counselor, a phone line and staff training.
Mr. Cortines also offended many gay advocates by his intial objections to the distribution of condoms in high schools. Again, Mr. Cortines said, it was the details of the plan that bothered him, not the concept. He insisted on a way for parents to keep their children from participating and a plank about abstinence. Then condom distribution began.
The current president of the school board, Tom Ammiano, said that Mr. Cortines is "definitely more conservative than San Francisco is" and said he doubted the Superintendent felt real commitment to either condom distribution or gay counseling.
 
'Gimmicks of the Year'
 "If there was enough pressure, he would accede," said Mr. Ammiano, who is gay. "Ray thought schools were for reading, writing and arithmetic, and maybe that philosophy was good for the 50's. But we need to expand what a school does in the community."
Mr. Cortines agreed that he was usually more conservative than the left-leaning constituency here and not much interested in the "gimmicks of the year" that he said were popular with liberal educators.
"I'm a product of my middle-class value system," he said.
Ms. Denebeim said that San Francisco's "ingrown" politics left Mr. Cortines exasperated. "He thought special interests got in the way of running the district," she said. "Groups based on ethnic background, groups based on life-style choices."
Mr. Cortines is now awaiting confirmation as the assistant secretary of education for intergovernmental affairs, but he has made it clear he would take the New York job if it were offered to him. After his nomination he stirred a brief controversy by endorsing the concept of government subsidies of private education through school vouchers, a politically charged idea that the Clinton Administration opposes.
 
European Surroundings
 Mr. Cortines is a man who defies easy categorization. He is a Mexican-American, but he speaks no Spanish and was raised in the European surroundings of the couple who adopted him from his unwed mother.
In an interview in his Pacific Heights apartment, stacked with books about art and architecture and decked with bold modern paintings and delicate potted orchids, Mr. Cortines talked about his family and upbringing. His adoptive father, once the salad chef at the Plaza Hotel on Union Square here, came from Castilian Spanish roots. His adoptive mother was of English ancestry, with a compound name. They were not well-educated, Mr. Cortines said of his parents, who are both dead, but they dragged him "kicking and screaming" most weekends to museums and concerts.
"That's the kind of world I grew up in, and that's the kind of world I want these children to have," Mr. Cortines said.
As such, Mr. Cortines is impatient with educators who want to make excuses for poor and immigrant children. "You can't drag your cross around forever," he said. "Instead of using the straw men of poverty, family situation, linguistic ability and immigrant status, let's do something about it."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Aides Ask U.S. Guarantee As Peace Talks Are Set to Resume

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 29

 BODY:
As Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim negotiators prepared to resume peace talks in Geneva on Monday, the leaders of Bosnia's Parliament called today on the United States and NATO to enforce any peace agreement that might come from the negotiations.
Late Saturday, the mostly Muslim Bosnian Parliament rejected the latest United Nations peace proposal, which calls for reorganizing this country into a loose union of three ethnic republics. They said the plan would legitimize the takeover of more than half of Bosnia's territory by the nationalist Serbs' militia. 
 Parliament demanded that the peace plan be amended to provide for the return from Serbian military control of at least eight districts that had Muslim-majority populations before the Serbs forcibly expelled them and for the attachment of these districts to a proposed Muslim-dominated republic. Parliament also demanded, among other things, an outlet to the Adriatic Sea at the town of Neum as well as international guarantees that the plan would actually be carried out.
"We are asking for firm guarantees that a final agreement will be respected and implemented, and there can be no such agreement without the participation of the United States and NATO," said the President of Bosnia's Parliament, Miro Lazovic. "We are asking for both their political and military support if necessary."
 
Serbs Want Sanctions Lifted
 The Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament agreed to the peace plan on condition that the United Nations lift economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, news reports from Belgrade said.
The Bosnian Croat parliament in effect rejected the peace plan, demanding that additional territories be attached to a proposed Croatian republic.
The Bosnian Serbs in May rejected the original United Nations peace proposal, known as the Vance-Owen plan, because, among other reasons, it would have required them to hand back a larger amount of territory.
The co-chairmen of the United Nations peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen of Britain and Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway, backed away from the original plan within a matter of days and supported a Serbian and Croatian proposal for partitioning Bosnia, which was a multi-ethnic patchwork before the Serbs, and later the Croats and Muslims, began ethnic-cleansing operations.
Bosnian leaders acknowledged there was almost no chance that the international community was prepared to force the nationalist Serbs to surrender the formerly Muslim-majority districts, and they privately expressed fear that the 17-month-old war, which has already claimed more than 150,000 lives, will take on a new momentum.
 
Serbs' Aggression Condemned
 Despite United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning the Serbs' aggression against Bosnia, the United Nations has maintained an arms embargo against Bosnia's Government as well as the other factions, guaranteeing the Serbs a vast weapons' superiority.
The Belgrade newspaper Politika today reported that the Bosnian Serb parliament had linked acceptance of the peace plan with the lifting of the United Nations sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia, which comprises only Serbia and Montenegro.
The Security Council 15 months ago imposed economic sanctions on Yugoslavia and tightened them this year because of Belgrade's support for the Bosnian Serb nationalists.
Mr. Lazovic said at a news conference today that Bosnian leaders had not decided on the composition of the negotiating team that is scheduled to be in Geneva on Monday for the resumption of the peace talks.
While fighting has remained on a low level in Bosnia for the last three weeks, United Nations military officials said fierce fighting is continuing in the towns of Tarcin and Gornji Vakuf between mostly Bosnian Army forces and Croatian militiamen.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tries to Restore the Once-Friendly Skies

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
German and United States officials will meet today in Bonn to begin talks that they hope will salvage their threatened aviation agreement. This is the first of many tests in coming months for the Clinton Administration as it contends with a growing list of countries that believe American airlines carry more than their fair share of international traffic.
It is widely believed that the outcome of the talks will set a precedent for those with other countries -- including Japan, France and Australia -- that have signaled a desire to slow the rapid expansion overseas by United States airlines like American, Delta, United and Northwest. 
 "The manner in which these talks are resolved will have some impact on some other bilateral discussions we are having," said Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena.
If negotiators for the United States do not find common ground with those countries, American travelers may face less frequent flights and higher fares to some overseas destinations.
 
Defining the U.S. Strategy
 Airline officials and aviation analysts are also watching Bonn closely for a clearer sense of the Clinton Administration's strategy for dealing with these recent objections to long-standing aviation agreements, which have been reached with one country at a time.
The national commission appointed by President Clinton to study the airline industry has recommended that the United States pursue so-called multilateral agreements with groups of countries. Groupings by trading blocs are a popular notion, and that idea appears increasingly ripe for the airline business, particularly in light of a proposal by KLM, Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines to explore a merger.
Any movement toward multilateral agreements, however, would require that the participants not feel threatened, as many do now, by the United States. Thus, industry experts suggest that the United States balance firmness in maintaining short-term access to countries for American carriers, while resolving current disputes diplomatically with an eye to the future.
"It's a bit of a tightrope walk," said Jon F. Ash, a managing director of Global Aviation Associates, a Washington consulting firm.
 
Bilateral Accords Questioned
 The talks now pending between the United States and other countries underscore why bilateral agreements are becoming obsolete. Roughly 1,200 international agreements dating from 1944 dictate where and how often airlines can fly to foreign countries. But the rise of international marketing alliances, like the one between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and the potential for multinational mergers, has complicated the issue.
"Pretty soon we won't know who we're negotiating for," said Patrick V. Murphy, Acting Assistant Secretary of Transportation.
Bilateral agreements have also come under fire in many countries because the global aviation recession has prompted all but a few carriers to look for ways to stem heavy losses. One way to do that is to fight for a larger share of the many passengers flying to and from the United States. By the end of the year, the losses since 1990 of the world's major airlines -- many of them state-owned or supported -- are expected to total $13.5 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade group.
Despite their own losses in recent years, the largest United States airlines continue to push into international markets to position themselves for a global economic recovery. Even though American carriers are being drubbed domestically by smaller carriers like Southwest Airlines, they are feared abroad because deregulation has forced them to pare operating costs to 30 to 50 percent below those of most European and Japanese carriers, according to a study by Mercer Management Consulting.
"There is a growing realization that the success of U.S. carriers is threatening their continued success," said Kenneth P. Quinn, a Washington lawyer and former chief counsel to the Federal Aviation Administration.
 
Shift in Traffic
 Officials at foreign airlines note that when the bilateral agreements were written, most international passengers were American. That is no longer true, so the agreements are not relevant, they say.
When the United States signed its bilateral agreement with occupied Japan in 1952, for example, there was no Japanese airline that flew international routes. Now the number of Japanese flying to the United States is more than three times the number of Americans flying to Japan, but American carriers lay claim to 69 percent of the traffic.
Susumu Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines, traveled to Washington in May to lobby for a new accord with Japan that offered 50-50 sharing of routes. The two countries' relationship is likely to be further strained by what American officials say is a Japanese effort to limit access by United States carriers to a new airport in Japan scheduled to open in 1994.
A similar market-share imbalance prompted France to renounce its 46-year-old pact with the United States in May. The United States airlines share of flights to France has grown from about 45 percent in 1978 to about two-thirds now.
 
Germany Opposes Added Flights
 Relations with Germany were strained earlier this year when Northwest Airlines added flights from the United States to Germany through Amsterdam on planes operated with Northwest's partner, KLM.
The German Government decided that Northwest-KLM flights represented additional United States traffic that was not authorized by the two countries' agreement. Lufthansa, a carrier that is majority-owned by the German Government, won an order from a Frankfurt court demanding that Northwest stop advertising the connecting flights as seamless trips from the United States to Germany.
The dispute turned on a technical point. The German Government argued that Northwest did not have formal approval to operate the shared flights; Northwest contended that nothing in the agreement required it to get approval.
This argument has resulted in two letters from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to President Clinton insisting on a new agreement that would limit the growth of American carriers' access to German cities and beyond. Lufthansa, a high-cost carrier, would benefit from such limits.
But many industry analysts say a marketing alliance between Lufthansa and either United or American Airlines is imminent, and that could broadly influence the German Government's negotiating stance. Such alliances generally push negotiators to pursue a more open agreement.
If no progress is made in the current talks, Germany may renounce its bilateral agreement. Should that occur, both sides would have a year to work out a new agreement. Failing that, they would be expected to negotiate on a flight-for-flight basis so that service was not halted.
 
British Talks Considered Crucial
 In contrast to the talks with Germany, in which American officials worry that they will be asked to cede ground, the United States is expecting to plow new territory with British officials in talks in October.
With British Airways' investment of $400 million in USAir earlier this year, and its desire to invest another $450 million, British officials are seeking a relaxation of rules that limit foreign carriers' investment in American airlines to 25 percent voting equity and 49 percent total equity.
In return, British aviation officials have said they will discuss a more open aviation agreement when negotiators meet.
Secretary Pena said that the message the United States wanted to send other countries as it pursued multilateral agreements would emerge from its talks with the British Government. That message will undoubtedly be aimed at European Community officials, who have adopted measures this year that limit air fare cuts and access by United States carriers.
"What we do now will set the stage for what I hope wil be multilateral dicussions in the future," Secretary Pena said. "Our job is to convince all governments that what is best for consumers is to have competition."

HEADLINE: Religious Leaders Hold A 2d World Parliament

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 29

 BODY:
With two hours of invocations and blessings that should have roused the heavens -- or possibly created stupor there -- religious leaders from every corner of the globe and virtually every imaginable faith opened a once-in-a-century Parliament of the World's Religions this weekend.
On Saturday, Buddhist monks, Hindu swamis and Muslim imams, along with Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Bahais, Theosophists and goddess worshipers, joined more familiar religious figures like Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Chicago, to begin eight days of prayer, meditation and dialogue with 6,000 participants at the Palmer House Hilton Hotel. 
 Among the world's ills that the international Who's Who of religious leaders in attendance hope to heal are some, including violence, caused by religion itself. The leaders are also asking whether their religions can unite to deal with issues like AIDS and violence against children.
The meeting is the centennial of the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions, held as part of the Columbian Exposition here. That first gathering, held on the site of what is now the Art Institute of Chicago, was a landmark in American religious history.
 
Swami as Star of 1893
 Besides signaling a place for Catholicism and Judaism in the American religious mainstream, the 1893 Parliament introduced Eastern religions like Hinduism, Buddhism and Bahai to a wide public, aiding their growth on these shores.
Thousands of fascinated Midwesterners observed a crimson-robed James Cardinal Gibbons, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, offer an opening prayer amid Eastern Orthodox prelates in unfamiliar black robes, a Shinto high priest in flowing white, a turbaned Hindu in saffron, and Confucian and Buddhist leaders in Chinese and Japanese dress.
It was a scene somewhat like this weekend's but startling to a public that like the great majority of the 400 official delegates, was overwhelmingly Christian. The star of the 1893 assembly was Swami Vivekananda, a 30-year-old spokesman for Hinduism.
"Do not care for dogmas, or sects, or churches, or temples," he preached. "They count for little compared with the essence of existence in each man which is spirituality." It was a message that struck chords in an America where schoolchildren encountered similar thoughts in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thomas Jefferson.
 
Gloomy Prospects
 Swami Vivekananda denounced the sectarianism that "has filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood," and he called for "the death knell to all fanaticism."
This week, too, appeals for an end of religious warfare are present and have become a virtual litany, while major sessions are also devoted to environmental issues and political and economic injustices.
Today, participants heard a report arguing that the "old dream had failed" and that the earth could not sustain unlimited economic growth. The report was delivered by Dr. Gerald O. Barney, a physicist who directed a similarly gloomy "Global 2000 Report" for President Jimmy Carter in 1980.
"We are now a species without a vision," Dr. Barney said, appealing to the religious leaders to grapple with the scientific and economic realities and "dream a new dream" for the planet.
 
'A Global Ethic'
 The Parliament will close next Saturday when the Dalai Lama speaks in Grant Park and a group of religious leaders meeting here issue a "Declaration of a Global Ethic." The Rev. Hans Kung, a Swiss Catholic theologian and frequent object of Vatican censure, oversaw the drafting of the 5,000-word document.
The Vatican itself is represented here by Archbishop Francesco Gioia of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.
Other participants in the Parliament include Russell M. Nelson, one of the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, and Imam Mustafa Ceric, a leader of Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Two prominent black American Muslims, the Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, a Sunni, and Louis Farrakhan of the separatist Nation of Islam will make presentations.
So will major Jewish leaders, including Sir Sigmund Sternberg of England and Rabbi Emil Fackenheim of Israel.
 
Wide Participation
 The National Council of Churches will be represented by its president, the Rev. Syngman Rhee, and its executive director, the Rev. Joan B. Campbell. Homi Dhalla, world leader of Zoroastrians, has come from India, and Abdullah Omar Nasseef, secretary general of the World Muslim League, from Saudi Arabia.
Feminist spiritual movements centered on goddess worship will be represented by writers like Riane Eisler and Charlene Spretnak, among others.
Mother Teresa canceled her scheduled appearance because she is recovering from malaria.
But even within the religious world, there is disagreement about the Parliament's merits. The Southern Baptist Convention, for instance, is among groups that declined to send a representative. Many evangelical and fundamentalist Christians believe that such gatherings are at best a distraction from spreading the Gospel and at worst a confusing compromise of their belief that Christianity is the only way to salvation. Conservative and fundamentalist believers in many other religions hold similar positions.
 
'Same Desire for Peace'
 "We have the same desire for peace and reconciliation as 100 years ago," said Dr. Daniel Gomez-Ibanez, the executive director of the group that organized this year's Parliament. "But then there was a mood of optimism in the United States. Today there is a mood of anxiety all around the world."
Besides the change in mood, a comparison of the two Parliaments reveal other telling changes in the United States. The handful of people representing Hinduism and Buddhism in 1893 or the sole Muslim -- an American convert -- would today find at least tens of thousands of fellow believers in the Chicago area alone.
There are more than a dozen Hindu places of worship around the city and suburbs, 28 Buddhist organizations and scores of mosques.
Leadership in organizing the current Parliament was taken five years by local Hindus, Buddhists, Bahais and Zoroastrians as well as some sympathetic Christians. For several years it continued on a shoestring budget, almost collapsing entirely in 1991.
Eventually more than 125 religious groups joined in the group that organized the Parliament, which is financed by grants from foundations and donors and registration fees. The overflow number of registrants will have a choice of more than 700 lectures, panel discussions, workshops and exhibits of religious art, music and dance.

HEADLINE: Development Bank Shifts on Hungary

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
When the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development started doing business in Hungary two years ago, privatization was humming along and the bankers who were sent to make investment deals thought their task would be relatively easy. It has not worked out that way.
Begun by Western countries as a way of helping Eastern Europe convert to a market economy, the development bank has had difficulty finding large private companies to support. This has been the case even in Hungary, where foreign investment came early and strong and where the Government was eager to sell off business assets. 
 "It's one of our frustrations," said Paul Dax, the bank's representative here. "Our opportunities are limited in the private sector. Privatization is going haltingly. It is more difficult than everyone expected."
The bank, which is owned by 56 countries and international agencies, began with the premise that 60 percent of its investments in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union would be in private enterprises, with the remainder in public projects.
 
Loans in Public-Sector Areas
 But in Hungary, a country that many called the showcase of privatization, the largest loans and investments have been in four public-sector areas: roads, urban transportation, agriculture and phones.
The bank has committed a total of $627 million to Hungary so far, the most it has invested in a single country, with $454 million in the public sector and $187 million in the private sector. The bank's investments are made in European Currency Units, a weighted basket of 12 European currencies.
By comparison, the development bank has committed $590 million to Poland, a country with 40 million people, four times the population of Hungary, and $93 million to the Czech Republic, a country with a population about the same size as Hungary's.
In investments in 11 private Hungarian concerns, the amounts have been small by the bank's standards. Indeed, in one of its earliest Hungarian investments, a computer company, Microsystem, the bank decided to break its minimum exposure rule of 5 million ECU's (or about $6 million) and invested 2.4 million ECU's ($2.8 million).
But the bank's biggest investment in the private sector has been a loan of $72 million to a joint venture by General Motors with Hungarian partners, an investment that posed questions about why a big American company needed such a loan.
After a fast start in 1990, the pace of large-scale privatization in Hungary has slowed. About 20 percent of state-owned enterprises have been sold since 1990, but relatively few companies have been sold since the first half of last year, Hungarian and Western economists said.
A number of factors have contributed to the decline, economists said. The collapse of Hungary's markets in the former Soviet Union occurred much faster than expected. At the same time, Western Europe moved into a recession as Hungary -- along with Poland and the Czech Republic -- was trying to develop markets in the West. Hungary's exports were down 27 percent for the first five months of 1993, compared with the period a year earlier.
At home, the State Property Agency, the institution created by Hungary to sell the state's companies, is short of workers and has been overwhelmed by the number of transactions it must handle, local and foreign investors say.
And as Hungarian nationalism has increased, right-wing political parties have been questioning why Hungarian assets should be sold to foreigners.
"Two years ago, I would have said pharmaceutical companies, the tourist industry and banks would have been our clients," said Peter Reiniger, a senior banker who specializes in Hungary at the bank's London headquarters. One plan to enter the tourist sector -- the reconstruction of the 19th-century Grand Royal in Budapest into a four-star hotel -- has been held up because of a dispute over property ownership.
In the pharmaceutical business, one of Hungary's strengths, only one of the five state-owned companies has attracted foreign investment -- from France.
Bank officials said they were trying different approaches to Hungary. The bank board recently approved involvement in a state holding company that would take over a portfolio of Hungary's big troubled companies -- particularly in pharmaceuticals and chemicals -- and try to turn them around in three or four years.
"We would be working with the public agencies, but the aim would be privatization with the objective to sell," Mr. Dax said.
Mr. Reiniger said he hoped that by being more flexible, the bank would have greater success in Hungary.
"Maybe we were in a euphoric mood when we started and the politics had changed," Mr. Reiniger said. "But in the economy, a revolution is unacceptable; evolution is acceptable."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Down for July

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
The machine tool industry learned again last month that what Detroit giveth, it can also taketh away.
Machine tool orders slid for the third straight month in July as large automotive orders continued to level off, the Association for Manufacturing Technology reported yesterday. 
 Net new orders reached $250.8 million in July, down 20.1 percent from June's $313.7 million, which was a smidgeon lower than May's $315.8 million. The July figure is 28 percent lower than the $348.3 million reported in April. Until May, the industry was enjoying a banner year.
Some analysts cautioned against jumping to conclusions because summer is traditionally slow for manufacturers who buy machine tools. They note, for instance, that the July figure was still 22.1 percent higher than the $205.4 million of July 1992.
"Your next real window into what is taking place inside Corporate America won't take place till the fall," said Eli S. Lustgarten, Paine Webber's machinery analyst.
 
Slower Gains Foreseen
 He nonetheless agrees with others that the bulge of automotive orders has run its course. "You're beginning to see a normal level of business," he said. "The rate of gain that we saw in the first six months was not sustainable and is expected to slow in the second half."
Machine tools, the cutting and forming devices that enable manufacturers to make metal products, are ordered months before they are actually put to use and are sometimes followed as a barometer of the nation's manufacturing sector.
Auto makers, by far the largest buyers of machine tools, often account for one- to two-thirds of all purchases, according to William G. Copeland, a Stamford, Conn., economist who tracks the business.
In its press release, the association, which releases monthly statistics, chose to stress that orders were running at $2.02 billion, up 37 percent for the year. All the big gains were posted in February, March and April; the last three months have worked to whittle down the percentage rise.
Moreover, July's decline occurred despite a 39.9 percent spike in exports, partly a result of a weak dollar that makes American products more attractive abroad, and despite a 43.9 percent gain in metal-forming devices. Both exports and metal-forming tools make up relatively small fractions of the total industry.
Dale Norton, vice president of planning and business development for Giddings & Lewis, a large supplier to the automotive industry, called July "a reasonably decent month for us" and said the company was encouraged by activity "in the automated technology area where we are selling large machine tools."
But Christopher Cole, vice president for machine tool products for Cincinnati Milacron, said there had been "a major downturn in commercial sales and military programs, and it's a worldwide problem."
 
Outlook Held Bright
 Over all, many analysts say the industry's outlook remains bright. While labor talks this fall may encourage car makers to put their capital plans on hold, they are eager to use the lull in capital spending by Japan to improve their own products and pick up share.
"There is still a gap there," Mr. Copeland said. "So we would anticipate that Detroit's relative success this year will allow them to continue to be a big machine tool buyer in 1994 and 1995 as they continue to recapture market share."
Plus, other manufacturers like Caterpillar and Deere are still talking about making big investments in their plant and equipment, as are some energy companies, a factor that might offset the slowdown in automotive orders.
Caterpillar, for instance, had said it would spend about $485 million in 1993. It has since lowered that estimate a bit, but still has a long way to go to reach anything close to that figure, according to Mr. Lustgarten of Paine Webber.
"If you believe their capital spending budgets," he said, these cautious spenders may be stepping up their orders soon.

HEADLINE: Job-Market Gains Found

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
While the job market remains far from robust, there are signs that it will continue inching back to health in the fourth quarter, according to a survey of American employers released yesterday.
Manpower Inc., the big temporary-help concern, said 22 percent of the nearly 15,000 businesses it had polled planned to add employees in the last three months of the year. About 11 percent said they planned to cut jobs, 3 percent said they were not sure about their job plans and the rest indicated that employment would remain the same. 
 "Hiring strength is running behind the comparable periods of the 1983-84 recovery period, but it is making progress," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, president of Milwaukee-based Manpower, which conducts the quarterly employment outlook survey.
Prospects were brighter for job seekers in the July-September period this year. About 25 percent of the companies expected to add jobs and 8 percent were eliminating them, Manpower reported. Economic activity usually slows at year-end, the company noted.
The Manpower survey indicated that hiring would be below the national average in the Northeast and West, about average for the Midwest and sharply above average in the South.

HEADLINE: Somalia: Time to Leave?

 BODY:
A humanitarian mission to deliver food to millions of starving Somalis is degenerating into an obsessive search-and-destroy operation against supporters of a single warlord, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid. U.S. soldiers, once welcomed with smiles, now worry about snipers and booby traps.
Americans have not just a right but an obligation to demand that the Clinton Administration explain what compelling national purpose justifies such risk to the lives of U.S. soldiers and Somali civilians caught in the crossfire. 
 Senator Bob Dole and Representative Ron Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, have tried, responsibly, to press for answers. But until last week, the Administration deflected all challenges with stale cold war rhetoric about resolve, credibility and tests of will.
In a speech on Friday, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin at last offered a serious response. He spelled out the goals that the Administration seeks to achieve before withdrawing U.S. forces.
Secretary Aspin's speech is a step toward more reasoned debate. But military developments in Somalia, especially the disturbing dispatch of a U.S. military hit team to Mogadishu, threaten to overwhelm Mr. Aspin's theoretical exercise.
The humanitarian mission that President Bush announced to popular acclaim last November was largely accomplished by the first months of this year. The Clinton Administration then moved to turn the Somalia operation back to the United Nations. An ambitious Security Council resolution in March defined long-term objectives of restoring order and rebuilding Somalia's economic and political structure.
For the first time, Washington agreed to put U.S. troops under U.N. command. Hopes ran high for a path-breaking experiment in collective security. But the U.N. has made some bad mistakes.
The worst came after a June 5 ambush and killing of Pakistani peacekeepers. The U.N.'s top man on the scene, Adm. Jonathan Howe, posted a price on the head of the ambush's presumed author, General Aidid, thereby shutting him out of political negotiations. Until then the general's participation had been considered crucial to a settlement.
Admiral Howe's misjudgment quickly changed the character of the U.N. mission. U.N. forces continue to do much good in other areas of the country. But in south Mogadishu, General Aidid's stronghold, casualties have mounted and relief efforts have been set back.
America's role has been particularly distorted. In addition to the 3,100 U.S. troops under U.N. command, a smaller U.S.-commanded contingent of quick-reaction forces bears the brunt of anti-Aidid combat. It was to sharpen the urban commando capabilities of this contingent that the Pentagon dispatched 400 Army Rangers last week.
Secretary Aspin tried to soften the focus on these anti-Aidid operations. His criteria for declaring victory and withdrawing included establishing "reasonable security in south Mogadishu." But he put his main emphasis elsewhere, on generalized reductions in heavy weaponry and the early creation of a Somali police force that could reduce clashes between U.N. forces and civilians.
Even better would be a renewed effort to engage General Aidid or other members of his clan. The Clinton Administration stiffly asserts that the U.N. can't talk to people who kill peacekeepers. But of course the U.N. does just that all the time, from Cambodia to Bosnia.
U.N. reconstruction is very different from classic warfare. But more than 40 years of cold war thinking has traumatized official Washington. Military and foreign policy professionals sometimes have trouble distinguishing between bush-league bandits and real threats. Today's local warlords no longer serve as proxies in some larger competition. The only way General Aidid could damage important U.S. interests would be for America to let itself be obsessed by him.
The present U.N. mandate in Somalia expires Oct. 31. Perhaps, in the intervening two months, U.N. leaders can find their way back to the constructive course they slipped from in June. If not, then it may be time for Americans to leave.

The U.N. Entraps Clinton

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
More than 10,000 American troops, drawn mainly from the First Armored Division in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, were on the verge of being sent as part of a NATO force to Bosnia to impose the wrong peace in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Had the Bosnian Muslims bowed to Western pressure to accept the latest surrender terms proposed by the U.N. -- a humiliation that Bosnia's Parliament unanimously rejected over the weekend -- American forces would have become guarantors of a Munich-style sellout that would have created a gulag of ghettos and encouraged future ethnic cleansing. 
 How did the Clinton Administration stumble to this brink?
First, by cravenly caving in to the French and British reluctance to arm the Muslims and to suppress Serbian-Croatian firepower from the air.
Second, by reacting to this allied rebuff with a foolish commitment to use our forces in NATO to support any surrender terms that the U.N. could work out.
Third, by abdicating operational authority to the U.N., thereby undermining our threats to use air power to stop the Serbian shelling of civilians -- at a moment when the only incentive to negotiate came from the possibility of our air attacks.
Fourth, by limiting our involvement in the peace negotiations to occasional expressions of distaste, as if to dissociate the U.S. in advance from betrayal of principle -- and then, behind the scenes, to urge the Muslim Bosnians to swallow the repugnant terms because American protection would not be forthcoming until they gave up.
No doubt the Bush acquiescence two years ago in the U.N. cutoff of arms to the Bosnian Muslims was a diplomatic blunder. But this year's false starts belong on Bill Clinton's doorstep, and his apparent willingness to use American troops to enforce a U.N.-sponsored surrender will lead to Clinton's Balkan Mess.
People of my strategic persuasion favored a hunkering-down of U.N. humanitarians on the scene while Western powers gave Serbian irregulars a taste of their own medicine. Such sustained bombing of artillery positions, supplies and bridges, combined with an increased blockade of Serbia and Croatia, would have set the stage for a partition that would not have left Bosnia an economic basket case, its survivors the world's wards.
Instead, what we have now is the undenied appearance of the promise of American ground troop involvement in the American-led policing of a surrender that the American people had no say in and want no part of. American lives would be at risk in a protracted entanglement where American policy never came into play and American diplomatic muscle was never applied.
No, thanks. The inept Clinton Secretary of State has given a blank check to the U.N.'s Boutros Boutros-Ghali: You decide what the policy is to be and how much it will cost in lives and treasure, and the U.S. will obey. Is America to be a payer but not a player? Even unreconstructed hawks get off the train at that stop.
When Mr. Clinton finally gives a speech wrapping himself in the glories of multilateralism, he will not be able to sell the U.N.-brokered surrender as remotely honorable, especially considering the U.N.'s one-sided disarmament. If he continues tacitly to endorse the U.N. deal, he could only plead that slow strangulation in ghettos would be better than quick death in war.
Such argument would draw derision from across the spectrum because America will not defend with its lives what it cannot defend with its conscience. The problem is not the Bosnian unwillingness to submit to hopelessness, like good victims; the problem is the Serbo-Croat demand for Muslim humiliation and the Western powers' lack of backbone.
What can Mr. Clinton do now? He can get on the hook to Mitterrand and Major with changes of the U.N. terms to give Muslim Bosnia some territorial contiguity and undisputed control of its capital of Sarajevo. He should arrange swift, certain NATO retaliation for any aggression during negotiations. He should set the terms for the participation of American forces in NATO peacemaking, not make our troops pawns in U.N. hand wringing.
Time is running out, Mr. Clinton. Avoid the U.N. trap. Send Europe the message: Bosnia alive or NATO dead.

HEADLINE: Anyone Could See Japan's Steady Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"For Japan, the Old Slurs Are the New Party Line" (The Week in Review, Aug. 15) shows little historical perspective and considerable condescension in reporting "a complex about-face" in Japan in recent weeks. 
 The kind of about-face you attribute to Japan -- denial followed by admission, "speaking frankly about the terrible mistakes of World War II and about the dynamics of its economy" -- is observed with distressing frequency in the United States (and most likely elsewhere) as well.
Aside from that, to suggest there was no debate in Japan on the business-Government relationship -- "this collusive structure" -- is absurd. For nearly two decades prominent Japanese businessmen have questioned Japan's approach to the trade surplus, and a call for change in international business practices began more than a dozen years ago.
Your observation that "change in Japan often seems glacial" -- now a cliche among some Americans -- is fallacious and condescending, based on the notion that society must always change or else deserve sneering condemnation. It also assumes that the United States changes all the time, but Japan doesn't.
True, calls for "change" are now as deafening in Japan as they were in the 1992 United States Presidential campaign. But this by no means proves that Japan has remained stagnant. Even during the 38-year sway of the Liberal Democratic Party the country more than once changed course abruptly and thoroughly in both Government policy and national life.

 BODY:
In celebration of this week's beginning of the United States Open tennis championship at Flushing Meadows, Queens, the Women's Tennis Association is honoring its founder, Billie Jean King, at a benefit dinner tonight at the Marriott Marquis Hotel.
The organizers of the honor say it is supposed to be a surprise -- as long as Ms. King does not read the newspaper, and as long as Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who are scheduled to join the festivities, do not tell her either, all of which appears to be a long shot. 
 Ms. King, 49 years old, founded the association 20 years ago to make careers in professional tennis economically feasible for the ever increasing number of women players. The dinner will benefit the New York Special Olympics.
The association's president, Pam Shriver, said the proceeds from the benefit will "encourage more athletes with mental retardation to train and compete in tennis." The Special Olympics president, Anthony Adamo, said the money "will go far to help us reach out to even more people with development disabilities and enrich their lives."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Young Perspective on Management

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 27

 BODY:
When Alan Webber and William Taylor were editors at the widely respected but staid Harvard Business Review, they thought of the publication as the "bran muffin of magazines: good for you but hard to swallow."
So Mr. Webber, 44, and Mr. Taylor, 34, decided to create a new business magazine that would combine the managerial insights of the Harvard publication with the writing and jazzy graphics of Rolling Stone. 
 The result is Fast Company, a publication aimed at a new generation of business people in what the editors call the new economy, where the competition is global and work processes are constantly changing. The magazine begins publishing in October as a bimonthly with a goal of becoming a monthly.
Most successful in this new economy, Mr. Webber said, are senior managers who are often younger, better educated and more knowledgeable about information technology than those "even in their 40's, who are dead from the neck up." Many of these managers have not embraced such publications as Fortune, Business Week or Forbes, he said.
"There's a generational power shift going on in big companies," Mr. Webber said. "These people are affecting the substance of business and managing."
The magazine's target audience would be in their late 20's to late 40's. However, Mr. Taylor added, "It's partly demographic and partly attitudinal -- if Sam Walton were alive, for example, he'd get this magazine."
Fast Company has an eclectic group of a dozen investors from the United States, Canada and Japan. They include Tom Peters, a management consultant and co-author of "In Search of Excellence"; Regis McKenna, a Silicon Valley publicist and venture capitalist, and John Doerr, a partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, an investor in high-technology start-ups.
"It's hardly a breakthrough idea to say something phenomenally new is happening in the world economy," Mr. Peters said. "But who is covering this transition? The Harvard Business Review is seldom out in front of the power curve. Inc. focuses on start-ups, and you get bits and pieces of management coverage in Fortune and Business Week. But nowhere do you have a place focusing on the intriguing people doing interesting things from a management perspective."
Roger Black, a magazine designer who has worked for The New York Times, Newsweek, Esquire and Rolling Stone, is designing the publication. Mr. Taylor said each issue would offer a lengthy piece on management, called "The Big Idea," along with interviews, photo essays, profiles of individuals and companies, and regular columns. Mr. Webber said the publication would strive to offer "articles that start conversations."
The first issue will feature a "Big Idea" essay called "Business as War," in which Mark B. Fuller, chief executive of the Monitor Company, a management consulting firm, describes the new rules of doing battle. The issue will also have a humor column by Karen Karbo, a novelist in Portland, Ore., and a profile of Tommy Boy Records, a rising rap label.
Initially, Fast Company will be distributed free to 30,000 targeted readers from a data base the editors created themselves. The first issue's 35 ad pages were also given out free.
Mr. Taylor said the magazine's eventual cover price had not been determined, but that he hoped to reach profitability, and a paid circulation of 100,000, in three years. The magazine will soon begin a direct mail campaign to draw subscribers.
 
A Hot Market
 Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune, said the business magazine market was hot, and "there's always room for a new magazine with a compelling idea behind it." But he said he believed that Fortune already covered the subject area well.
Rich Karlgaard, editor of a new Forbes business publication called ASAP and the founding editor of Upside, a high-technology business magazine, said Fast Company's premise sounded "fuzzy."
"The idea of HBR meets Rolling Stone doesn't tell me what the focus is," Mr. Karlgaard said. "Crucial to making a new magazine work is having a focus and a clear position. They can easily consume $5 million to $10 million in the first year just building circulation."
Mr. Webber said the magazine's name reflected both "business dynamism and a certain attitude."
"The notion that you are in fast company," he said, "is both a business term and an old notion about people who are racy, willing to take risks."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Clinton's September Agenda: A Month of Policy Overload?

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Nobody expects the health care overhaul to be easy. Nobody expects the struggle over the North American Free Trade Agreement to be neat. Both measures require an enormous amount of public education, some delicate coalition-building and a hard and complicated sales job in Congress.
Now, a capital that has barely recovered from the battle over President Clinton's economic plan is watching with some wonderment as the Administration begins to tackle both these issues in a single month. Plus, by the way, Vice President Al Gore's proposals to "reinvent Government." September, in short, may be the quintessential Clinton experience, the month of policy overload. 
 Administration officials say they have little choice in the matter. They say they must begin the push for the free trade agreement now for it to stand a chance of passage before the end of the year. At the same time, they are adamant about not postponing the unveiling of the health care plan once again, although actual votes on it are not expected until next year.
 
Communications Strategy
 Moreover, aides say, the President is intent on moving ahead with both measures, as well as with Mr. Gore's proposals to make the Government more efficient, while also responding to an ever-present Ross Perot and a Congress supposedly still hungry for budget cuts.
As a result, after much jockeying in the Administration between the forces of health care and the champions of free trade, the White House has developed a carefully sequenced -- and jam-packed -- communications strategy for September.
Mr. Gore's drive to streamline the Government will be highlighted the week after Labor Day, the push for the free trade pact will take the Presidential spotlight soon thereafter, and the Clinton health plan will probably be presented to the nation on Sept. 22, with a flurry of health-related events before and after.
This is a great deal to ask of the body politic, a number of officials acknowledge.
"We learned in the budget debate that it is hard for the country to take on more than one debate and issue at a time," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader. "You lose the edge and the focus. But we don't live in a perfect world, and it's not always possible to get the big debates isolated."
The fear, of course, is that the early days of the health care campaign will be forced to compete with a messy, bitter fight over free trade.
The synergy between the two issues could be particularly complex because in some important respects they have cross-cutting constituencies. Organized labor, for example, will be leading the opposition to the trade agreement, but is expected to be among the principal advocates for overhauling the health care system.
"It's not a pleasant feeling, going in one door and fighting on the one hand, walking in the other and saying this is what we're for," said Robert M. McGlotten, legislative director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 
Signs of Tensions
 There was no clearer sign of the tensions in this Democratic base constituency than in the commemoration on Saturday of the 30th anniversary of the march on Washington and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech. The crowd, which was heavily drawn from the ranks of organized labor, was a sea of anti-Nafta signs, interrupted by placards calling for changes in the health care system.
The Congressional maneuvering is equally Byzantine. Much of the House Democratic caucus, including many of its leaders, will be working against the free trade agreement. At the same time, the Administration will be counting on those same Democrats to begin selling the health care plan. Most professional politicians are accustomed to shifting between coalitions as they move from one issue to another, but neither health care nor Nafta falls under the category of business as usual. Both issues are extremely emotional.
"There's just so much angst that the country and political people will be willing to deal with at one time, having just come over a very high hurdle on the budget," said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House majority whip who is an opponent of the trade agreement.
"Health care is what he got elected on," Mr. Bonior said, referring to Mr. Clinton. "It certainly wasn't Nafta. And that ought to be the focus in the fall."
Much of the complaining over the timing of these proposals has been considered somewhat suspect, since it often comes from opponents of the trade agreement. Postponing consideration of Nafta could help build opposition to it. But other analysts, particularly advocates of overhauling the health care system, worry about overloading the public agenda.
It is axiomatic that the early weeks of presenting the health care plan will be crucial if the plan is to pass. By the rules of modern politics, and by the grim lessons for the Administration from the budget battle, he who defines a proposal first may not necessarily prevail but will certainly have the upper hand.
Many political analysts agree that making the case for overhauling health care, which accounts for a seventh of the nation's economy, will be one of the great challenges of modern politics.
"The policy networks have been chewing on health care for years, and the options are clearly understood by the people focusing on that," said Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas. "But the people who are not brought up to speed are the ones who will have to support it and finance it, and that is the voters. It took the policy networks years to get to this point, and now the public's supposed to absorb it immediately."
 
Connecting the Issues
 Administration officials respond that the President sees all three of these issues as connected: making the Government more efficient; revising the health care system to provide more personal security and to make the economy more competitive by controlling the growth of health costs; and opening up new markets through the free trade agreement.
It is also possible that Nafta, which will require the Administration to rely heavily on the Republicans, will set the stage for bipartisanship on the health care plan. And such bipartisanship could foster a public education process that could lead to a slow building of consensus, as was the case with the tax overhaul in 1986.
But it is just as plausible that Mr. Clinton could end up in a two-front war -- on one side accused of costing America jobs because of the free trade pact, and on the other, accused of costing America jobs because of new requirements that small businesses provide health insurance for their employees.
Even within the White House there are doubters. "It's going to be a terrible mess," one White House official said. "And we've all told him that." But Mr. Clinton, refreshed by the ocean breezes of Martha's Vineyard, was back in Washington today, prepared to plunge ahead.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: The First Step;
More Realism Will Be Needed Before Pact Between Israelis and P.L.O. Is a Done Deal

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The draft agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization is the Middle East equivalent of the fall of the Berlin wall -- seemingly irreconcilable foes, who demonized one another for decades, suddenly breaking down a barrier to peace few thought would ever be breached.
But as with the fall of the Berlin wall, this agreement is just the beginning of the reconciliation process, not the end of it. It is a triumph of realism over fanaticism and political courage over political cowardice, but it cannot stand on its own. Even more realism and courage will be required to translate this agreement in principle into a detailed and sustainable structure. 
 This is not a done deal yet. The big question is whether this delicate Israeli-P.L.O. understanding, reached secretly in the serenity of Norway, can survive the light of day and the political heat of the Middle East.
 
Culmination of Pressures
 The reason it might succeed is that this accord was no fluke. In many ways it was the culmination of a series of international, regional and domestic pressures, which have forced Israeli and P.L.O. leaders to do the unthinkable.
For the P.L.O., the end of the cold war and the crumbling of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact deprived Yasir Arafat of the international diplomatic support, the military aid and the training grounds for Palestinian students and guerrillas that had been a key prop for his leadership and influence on the world stage. At the same time, his miscalculation in supporting Iraq against Kuwait in the Persian Gulf war has led to the impoverishment of the P.L.O. as an organization, as all the Arab gulf governments withdrew their financial support.
Additionally, the slump in oil prices made even the P.L.O.'s few remaining Arab friends less able to pay it the tithe of old that had enabled the P.L.O. to reject Israel in comfort. The P.L.O.'s backing for Saddam Hussein also cost it politically and morally in the West. It was no longer the darling of many Western liberals, and with the emergence of Bosnia on the world stage the Palestinians were replaced by the Muslims of Sarajevo as the preferred underdogs.
All of these factors forced Mr. Arafat to deal on Israel's terms -- agreeing to start with autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, postponing the issue of who controls Jerusalem and accepting a continued Israeli security presence.
For the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the decision also grew from a variety of pressures: the inability of the Government to provide internal security for its citizens without some progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front, the conviction of Israeli leaders that Israel could never play the economic and political role it aspires to in the post-cold war world without some kind of understanding with the Palestinians, and the sheer exhaustion of an Israeli public too long at the barricades and desperate for some normalcy in their lives.
Finally, there was the rise of a much more dangerous alternative to the P.L.O. in the occupied territories -- Hamas, the Palestinians' Islamic militant movement. Hamas, with its commitment to the destruction of Israel, made the more secular P.L.O. look moderate by comparison.
 
A Seat at the Table
 All of this forced Mr. Rabin to dispense with the long-held Israeli notion that they could negotiate a settlement with "good" local Palestinians and without the involvement of the "bad" P.L.O.
In return for P.L.O. concessions, Mr. Rabin had to offer Mr. Arafat the one thing that he had long been denied and wanted more than anything else: a formal, acknowledged role in the process. What drove the P.L.O. over the years more than any single factor was its organizational imperative -- the desire to be accepted and recognized by Israel and Washington.
Pressures also forced Mr. Rabin to accede to Mr. Arafat's demand that as part of any transition agreement Palestinians had to be given political authority not simply over such matters as health care and education but over actual territory.
Even with all these pressures and incentives, however, this accord will not go down easily in the Middle East. Israel's opposition to dealing with the P.L.O. in any way has been a cornerstone of Middle East politics since the 1960's. As a result, many key actors in the region have built their politics on the assumption that Israel and the P.L.O. would never reconcile.
 
The New Reality
 Syria, which always wants to speak for the Palestinians and spearhead any peace effort, counted on this fact; Jordan, which always assumed it would be called in to deal with Israel on the P.L.O.'s behalf, also counted on it; Israeli settlers, who always assumed that the P.L.O. would never accept any sort of compromise with Israel, counted on it, and Israeli and Palestinian hard-liners, opposed to any peace settlement, counted on it.
Now all of them must adjust to this new reality, and these are not the sort of parties that adjust to fundamental changes easily -- or nonviolently. They toss grenades, not leaflets; they write death warrants, not Op-Ed pieces. If this accord moves ahead, the potential for civil war in both the Palestinian and Israeli camps is very real.
Already Ahmed Jabril, the Syrian-sponsored radical Palestinian guerrilla leader, has issued a statement threatening Mr. Arafat with the same fate as Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, who was felled by an assassin's bullet. Unidentified Israeli hard-liners threw a grenade Sunday night at the home of a Cabinet minister. American Jewish groups, which for years have made opposition to American talks with the P.L.O. one of their central preoccupations, are now struggling to figure out what their public positions should be.
These are just the tremors; earthquakes to follow.
Clinton Administration officials acknowledge privately that they were taken by surprise by this understanding and are also trying to figure out how to adjust to it. Top Administration officials were aware of the secret Israeli-P.L.O. talks, but they tended to dismiss their potential. In part this was because of they tended to dismiss the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, as a grandstanding statesman, and in part it was because of their even lower regard for Mr. Arafat.
On the one hand, American officials do not want to pour cold water on the accord, since, in principle, this concept of quickly empowering the Palestinians by giving them a real, but limited, opportunity for self-rule, is something Washington has been pushing for. But at the same time, American officials are clearly wary of throwing their support behind a concept that might not be fully baked. "It is too soon to be overly euphoric," said a senior American official who has been through the Middle East peace process.
Prime Minister Rabin asked Mr. Peres to fly to California and brief Secretary of State Warren Christopher, say Israeli officials, because Mr. Rabin wants American endorsement of the plan in order to help him sell it at home and because he wanted a "reality check" from Mr. Christopher about what Mr. Peres had produced.
The Palestinians and Israelis also want American backing because only Washington has the money, and the influence with wealthy Arab oil states, to produce the money that will be required to sustain an autonomous Palestinian entity in Gaza and Jericho. Both sides also feel that they need the Americans to be the guarantors of any understanding they reach -- guarantors of both its substance and its timetable.
American officials say their general view is that the Washington-based peace talks, which resume on Tuesday, should be the vehicle through which the parties try to translate their agreement in principle into an agreement in reality -- a process that will take some time.
"The Americans should greet this with enthusiasm and now assert leadership, in two ways," said Stephen Cohen, of the Center for Middle East Peace, a group based in Montreal.
"One is through direct contact with all the parties, including the P.L.O." The other, Mr. Cohen said, is by promoting a similar breakthrough on the Israeli-Syrian front.
There is a simple three-way equation at the core of the Middle East peace process. If Israel and Syria are making progress, the Palestinians will try to scuttle it in order not to be left behind. If Israel and the Palestinians are making progress, the Syrians will try to scuttle it in order not to be left behind.
"Middle East peace cannot stand on two legs," Mr. Cohen said. "It must have three. That is the American role, to make sure the third leg is there. Without it, this Israeli-Palestinian understanding won't survive."

NEW YORK CITY
 
CORTINES IS CHOSEN TO HEAD SCHOOLS
The Board of Education, divided 4-3, decided to appoint Ramon C. Cortines, the former Schools Superintendent in San Francisco, as the city's next Schools Chancellor. Mr. Cortines is planning to fly to New York today. A1.
Six months after a bitterly divided Board of Education ousted Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, the chief policymaking body for the nation's largest school system seems as divided as ever. B3.
 
TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON TEACHERS' PACT
Mayor Dinkins and the leaders of the union representing 65,000 teachers said that they had reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year contract calling for raises averaging 9 percent over the length of the deal. The tentative settlement, reached on the eve of both a new school year and the general election campaign, could help Mr. Dinkins win the endorsement of the powerful union, the United Federation of Teachers. B3.
 

A TOUGH TIME IN SLOGANEERING
New York is a tough town, and it takes a tough media strategy to win a mayoral race in it -- so tough, apparently, that even your campaign slogan can be turned against you. Mayor Dinkins took to the airwaves Friday with commercials portraying him as a caring steward of a troubled city and ending with the tag line: "It takes more than tough talk to run a tough city." Within 24 hours his opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, agreed. B2.
 
2 VIEWS OF TAPES IN TERRORIST CASE
At a bail hearing for one of the defendants in the case of the foiled plot to terrorize New York City, defense lawyers and prosecutors offered a prelude to the kind of battle that is likely to rage throughout the trial: scrapping over the meaning locked in transcripts of secretly recorded and sometimes elliptical conversations between defendants and a Government informer. B4.
 
RIDING A BEAT, TALL IN THE SADDLE
As a girl in Brooklyn, Kathy E. Ryan loved anything and everything having to do with horses. Now, when she can leave her office at 621 West 42d Street, she rides the streets of Manhattan. She is the commanding officer of the New York City Police Department's mounted unit. B4.
 
A 10-YEAR-OLD IS SHOT IN THE BRONX
A 10-year-old boy, sitting outside a restaurant with his sister across from his home in the Melrose area of the Bronx, was hit in the head by a stray bullet when two gunmen opened fire in what was believed to be a drug-related shooting. B4.

New York State will ask the United States Supreme Court to decide whether the state can tax cigarette sales on Indian reservations, a move the Indians say would violate their treaties. B5.

HEADLINE: The N.A.A.C.P. Means Business

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Officials of Hughes Aircraft were stunned this month when the N.A.A.C.P. publicly lambasted the aerospace contractor for what the group called a dismal record of hiring members of minorities.
But more shocking than the accusations, Hughes officials said, was the way the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People made them: at a news conference, without first giving the company a chance to defend itself. 
 And despite an informal agreement between the two parties to work together, the N.A.A.C.P. has continued to berate Hughes in the press for what it says is widespread mistreatment of minorities.
Such hard-nosed tactics are part of a decade-old expanding agenda by the nation's largest civil rights organization to provide new economic opportunity for members of minorities by pressing Corporate America to hire more of them.
 
A New Battle Plan
 Under the Rev. Dr. Benjamin J. Chavis, who became executive director last year, the N.A.C.C.P. has pursued that agenda with new aggressiveness in recent months. The civil rights group has held demonstrations on Capitol Hill, picketed the headquarters of Government contractors it says do not comply with affirmative-action requirements and negotiated a $1 billion agreement with the parent of the Denny's restaurant chain to increase black employment, management and equity.
While the N.A.A.C.P. had persuaded 70 companies to sign similar agreements -- including McDonald's, General Motors, Pacific Bell, Safeway, Walt Disney, United Airlines and Coors -- none have reached the scope and magnitude of the Denny's pact, which has set the tone for such agreements in the future.
"Our approach to Corporate America is not so much to ask for special compensation or for entitlement," Dr. Chavis said. "But we want to raise the question: Does it not make good business sense for companies to redefine their relationship with a multiracial society?"
Dr. Chavis said that black Americans spent about $380 billion on goods and services in the United States last year and that companies that were the beneficiaries of black consumerism had a responsibility to address the needs of that community.
Officials of the association say they are closely scrutinizing other companies, particularly those that do business with the Government or that have a large number of customers who are members of minorities, including aerospace and other military contractors and the entertainment industry. The group says it will take action against companies that have poor affirmative-action records.
Asked whether the N.A.A.C.P. risked alienation by employing such tough tactics, Dr. Chavis responded: "We are not trying to stage a media stunt here. We are taking something that is potentially polarizing and negative for these companies and using it to build bridges."
Behind the association's new emphasis on economic empowerment are growing concerns in the black community that despite decades of civil rights gains and increasing black political power, blacks still remain outside the economic mainstream and under-represented in the work force and management of large corporations.
Another motivating factor, N.A.A.C.P. officials said, was lax enforcement of the Federal diversity policies through 12 years of the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Clinton Administration officials said they were reviewing the policies of the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which is responsible for enforcing affirmative-action guidelines for Government contractors and that they believed some changes were in order.
Over all, the N.A.A.C.P. said it was seeking to negotiate so-called fair-share agreements, in which companies promise to hire more members of minorities as employees and contractors and to foster management and ownership among minorities within these companies.
 
Agreement Over Denny's
 Last month, the association announced the largest such fair-share accord of its kind with the Flagstar Companies, the parent of Denny's. The pact provides for an increase in black employees at Denny's and black ownership and management of restaurants and use of black subcontractors. The benefits of the agreement for black Americans have been put at $1 billion.
Jerry J. Richardson, Flagstar's chief executive, said the N.A.A.C.P. did not put pressure on him to sign the fair-share agreement and that ultimately the pact made good business sense because it would result in new customers and new ideas.
To be sure, the fair-share agreement was a marketing coup for Flagstar. The move was intended to salvage the company's already fragile image after being hit by a flood of lawsuits, charging that several Denny's restaurants had refused to serve black customers, required some to pay a cover charge or insisted that they pay for their meals in advance.
Mr. Richardson said that he became convinced that the fair-share agreement was appropriate after spending several hours with Dr. Chavis. "I think that over all Ben Chavis is a man of courage and conviction and that he wants to create a harmonious atmosphere not one of confrontation," Mr. Richardson said.
The chief executive said he hoped Flagstar's agreement with the association might serve as a model for other corporations.
"Signing a billion-dollar agreement with Flagstar sent reverberations throughout the business community," Dr. Chavis said. "Some people thought that it would jar other companies from talking with the N.A.A.C.P., but the opposite has happened. We are getting calls from corporate leaders in the oil industry, autos and high-tech who are seeking to make changes."
Dr. Chavis, 45, is seen as a radical departure from the traditional N.A.A.C.P. leadership, which used the courts and pressed legislation to address the problems of black America. A veteran of the civil rights movement, Dr. Chavis is known for his activism.
Dr. Chavis was one of the so-called Wilmington 10, who were arrested and convicted in 1972 of charges of conspiracy and inciting a mob to fire-bomb a white-owned grocery store in North Carolina. After four years in prison, the protesters were freed when an appeals court ruled that the evidence against them had been falsified.
A ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, he has a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of North Carolina, a Master of Divinity degree from Duke University and Doctor of Ministry from Howard University.
 
Five Goals
 The fair-share pacts have five basic goals: aggressive affirmative action, advancement of minorities into management, utilization of companies owned by members of minorities, philanthropic support for minorities' causes and minorities' participation on corporate boards.
Fred Rasheed, the association's national director of economic development, said most companies that the N.A.A.C.P. focused on were very receptive to the idea of fair-share agreements.
The agreements often provide companies with added benefits, like a strong political ally in Washington, where the N.A.A.C.P. is likely to pursue legislative agendas that are in the companies' interest, Mr. Rasheed said.
The N.A.A.C.P. estimates that between 1986 and 1990 fair-share agreements generated about $47 billion in economic benefits to the black community, including entrepreneurs, professionals and employees who benefited from upward mobility at the companies.
Safeway Inc. said that a 1984 fair-share pact, which required the supermarket chain to substantially increase the number of minority suppliers, has provided the Oakland, Calif., company with a variety of new business opportunities.
"It's been good for minority suppliers, the N.A.A.C.P. and for Safeway," said Brian Dowling, a Safeway spokesman. "We have gained access to new products and new ways of doing business."
 
Seeks Improvement
 In the case of Hughes Aircraft, company officials say they have one of the best records of work force diversity in the aerospace industry and that they are in full compliance with affirmative-action guidelines.
Nonetheless, Hughes Aircraft officials are negotiating with the association and a meeting is being arranged between Dr. Chavis and Hughes Aircraft's chief executive, C. Michael Armstrong.
"The N.A.A.C.P. is an important organization in this country," said Dave Barclay, Hughes's vice president for work force diversity. "Even though we are in compliance with Government regulations, we are interested in knowing how we might improve."

HEADLINE: Global Mutual Funds Set Sales Record in July

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Foreign stock mutual funds are all the rage, but the domestic variety seems to be attracting less money, according to figures released yesterday. And while bond funds are taking in record amounts of money, market timers appear to be growing worried that interest rates may begin to rise.
"Investors are on vacation from U.S. equities and are traveling abroad," said Bruce Speca, a spokesman for the TNE Fund Group. "The international equity market is just exploding." 
 At T. Rowe Price, the net cash flow into foreign stock funds in August is up 84 percent from July, said Rowena Itchon, a spokeswoman. But she added that sales of equity funds that invest in the United States were about even with July's level.
 
Heavy Flow of Cash
 Those observations came as the Investment Company Institute reported that foreign-oriented stock funds took in $3.1 billion in July, the largest ever for the category. But funds that invest primarily in the United States took in a net $6.6 billion in the month, down from $6.9 billion in June and the lowest for any month since October.
Bond funds took in a record $12.95 billion in July, breaking the old mark of $10.7 billion set in January. Part of that rise was a surge in global bond fund sales, to $891 million, or the largest since late 1991. But domestic bond funds also set records.
There was a sign that some who time markets are doubting that rates will keep falling, pushing bond prices higher: investors who move money among different types of funds were net sellers of bond funds in July, taking out $464 million. It was the third month in the last five that they took money out. With bond rates continuing to fall, the timers have so far not been proved right.
Fund groups without a strong foreign presence generally have seen net sales rise only a little or even dip. At the Janus Group, whose best products are domestic stock funds, "it was the slowest month of the year," Chrissy Snyder, a spokeswoman, said about August.
At Fidelity Investments, the largest fund organization, however, August has been the best month ever, with a net $2 billion pouring in, said Neal Litvack, an executive vice president. He said that most of the money had gone into relatively conservative domestic stock funds, but that the money that went overseas tended to concentrate on volatile areas like Latin America and Southeast Asia.
Some fund groups, among them State Street Research and Putnam Investments, reported gains in all categories in August. "People are just looking for a place to park their money in this low-interest-rate environment," said Don Webber of State Street.
The cash flow figures include new sales less redemptions, as well as money transferred among funds, but do not include reinvested dividends.

Guess Names Specialty-Store Chief to Lead Its Retail Unit

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Guess Inc., the apparel company that brought fashion to the jeans business, said yesterday that Bernard Zeichner, president and chief executive of the specialty store chain Contempo Casuals, would join the company to oversee retail operations.
Mr. Zeichner will join Guess on Sept. 13 as president of the retailing division, the first such formally designated head for the unit. 
 "His job is going to be to run the entire retail business," Maurice Marciano, chairman and chief executive of Guess, said. "The retail business is part of our growth strategy, and it needs full attention and he has the experience it takes."
Maurice Marciano took the helm of the company last week, after he and his brothers Paul and Armand bought the 40 percent stake held by their brother Georges.
Mr. Zeichner, whose background is in store operations, has more than a decade's experience in running a specialty-store chain. He joined Contempo in 1982 after working in various jobs at Joske's, a Texas department-store chain.
He built Contempo into a 300-store chain with revenues of $323.4 million last year, catering to the same young fashion-conscious customers who buy Guess clothing. Contempo has prospered despite the weak economy in California, its home state, by increasing private-label sales.
"He is a retailer first, but he also understands manufacturing because such a big part of their business is private-label," Mr. Marciano said.
Guess is planning to expand its retail business, which accounted for about 19 percent of its sales in 1992, and Mr. Zeichner would oversee that growth. Mr. Marciano said the chain, now at 38 stores, would probably not grow beyond 100 outlets.
Sales to the department stores that are the major buyers of Guess products have declined slightly during the last two years, since the stores have striven to keep inventories lean.
Deciding how to offset its dependence on department stores split the family that built Guess into a marketing and sales phenomenon. Georges Marciano, the former chairman and chief executive who founded Guess in 1981 with Maurice, believed the company's potential was limited by slow growth in department-store sales. He felt the company should begin making products for discount stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart, where sales of apparel are increasing.
But Maurice and the two other Marciano brothers, Armand and Paul, wanted to keep distribution limited to department stores while increasing the company's own retail operations. Unable to resolve their differences, the company and Maurice, Paul and Armand raised $220 million privately and through a bridge loan to buy Georges's stake.
Maurice Marciano said yesterday that the brothers were also considering a public stock offering.
Presumably, Mr. Zeichner would also attempt to reverse the sales slide at Guess's retail stores, which are mostly in California, Arizona and Texas. Sales per square foot in Guess retail stores have slipped from $550 in 1990 to $385 last year. "Twenty-six of our stores are in Southern California, which had an impact on business over the last two years," Mr. Marciano said. "But we are finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Sales were up 5 percent in July."

HEADLINE: New York Seeks Ruling On Taxes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Aug. 30

 BODY:
New York State will ask the United States Supreme Court to decide whether the state can tax cigarette sales on Indian reservations, a move the Indians say would violate their treaties.
The State Department of Taxation and Finance has asked Attorney General Robert Abrams to petition the nation's highest court to hear the case, officials said today. 
 In June, the State Court of Appeals outlawed a state plan intended to help the state collect taxes on the sale of gasoline and cigarettes by Indian retailers to non-Indian customers. The state would be asking the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling.
A similar dispute has been going on in Connecticut, where state officials have been trying to shut down a tobacco shop run by members of the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe on a reservation in Colchester.
A New York State Tax Department spokesman, Paul Rickard, said New York only wants to tax sales by Indian retailers to non-Indians, who save as much as 25 percent by buying gas and cigarettes on reservations.
 
$90 Million in Lost Taxes
 Sales to non-Indians on reservations cost New York $60 million a year in lost taxes on cigarettes and $30 million a year on gasoline, Mr. Rickard said.
Larry Ballagh, a member of the tribal council of the Seneca Nation of Indians on the Cattaraugus and Allegany reservations south of Buffalo, said New York's efforts to tax Indians have repeatedly been struck down by the courts.
"The courts keep saying 'no.' I really can't understand what part of 'no' they don't understand," Mr. Ballagh said. "Either they are awfully slow or their education is sadly lacking or they just outright do not believe in the rule of law."
Tax officials said they would like to negotiate a settlement in which taxes would be collected but the money would remain with the Indian tribes. The Indians say they will not negotiate.
Joseph Crangle, a lawyer for the Senecas, said any tax would destroy business for Indian retailers.
"What they're asking for is the Indians to sign their own economic death warrant," Mr. Crangle said. "I don't care if you call it a Seneca tax or a New York tax. Why would anyone go to the reservations if the Indians are no longer competitive?"
 
An Unfair Advantage?
 Non-Indian retailers, who say their business has been devastated by Indian competitors, have been lobbying the state to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
Robert Reid, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Marketers of New York, said the Indians' tax-exempt status gives them an unfair advantage over non-Indian businesses. Many of those are small, family-owned shops that have lost most of their customers to Indian businesses, Mr. Reid said.
"We don't believe that a small group of individuals should bear the entire burden for what the white man collectively has done to the Indians over the years," Mr. Reid said.
New York tried to begin the cigarette taxes in 1989. Milhem Attea and Brothers, which supplies cigarettes to Indian retailers, sued to block the taxes.
Joseph Zdarsky, a lawyer for Attea Brothers, said most of the company's business comes from sales to Indian retailers. If taxes were imposed, it could put Attea Brothers out of business, he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
$725 Million Merger for 2 H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Health Net, the largest for-profit health maintenance organization in California, said yesterday that it had agreed to merge with Qual Med Inc., a Colorado-based H.M.O., in a deal that analysts valued at $500 million in stock plus $225 million in debt.
Roger F. Greaves, chairman of HN Management Holdings Inc., Health Net's parent company, will share chief executive duties in the merged company with Dr. Malik M. Hasan, a London-trained neurologist from Pakistan who is Qual Med's chairman. 
 Mr. Greaves heads a group of 38 Health Net executives who paid $2 million for all the voting stock and 20 percent ownership last year, when the company was taken private.
The new company will have 1.2 million H.M.O. members in the hotly contested California market, which one analyst called "the Vietnam of American health care" because of the bloody battles for market share.
 
 
A 50-to-1 Windfall
 Analysts estimated the Health Net executives' stake would be worth $100 million. But they cannot pocket their 50-to-1 windfall until 1997, under restrictions imposed last year by the California Commissioner of Corporations.
Dr. Hasan owns 30 percent of Qual Med, which he started in 1985, and will have 10.5 percent of the new company.
Under the merger, which is subject to approval by Federal and California regulators, each Health Net common share will be exchanged for 3.34 shares of the new company. Qual Med shares will be exchanged on a 1-for-1 basis.
Qual Med, which is based in Pueblo, Colo., closed yesterday at $15.50, up $1.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 
Lawsuit Is Withdrawn
 In a related action yesterday, Qual Med withdrew lawsuits against Health Net's top executives, whom it had accused of taking the Los Angeles-based company private last year "at a price below its fair market value" to realize personal gain.
Health Net "basically said they'd rather switch than fight," said Thomas E. Hoddap, an analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company.
Qual Med, which owns H.M.O.'s in six Western states and has managed health care discount networks in 16 states, had accused Health Net of reneging on a $400 million purchase agreement in July 1992. In a deal approved by the state, Health Net instead awarded 80 percent ownership, without voting rights, to a new foundation headed by Mr. Greaves. The Health Net management group obtained 20 percent and all the voting stock.
Because of California restrictions on nonprofit entities converting to for-profit companies, Health Net endowed the Wellness Foundation with $75 million in cash and $225 million in i.o.u.'s, or $100 million less than what Qual Med said it had bid.
Mr. Greaves, who declined to confirm analysts' valuations, said Health Net's customers included "the biggest companies in California."
Many of the accounts are shared with the nonprofit Kaiser health plans, the country's largest H.M.O., which has five million California members.
Mr. Greaves said the merger would help Health Net follow its customers, many of whom are fleeing the California recession, to neighboring states where Qual Med already operates. "With health reform, we have to be bigger and more visible and multi-state," he said.
Michael M. LeConey, an analyst at RAS Securities, said the merger was "a major event in the industry." He said Qual Med shareholders were acquiring a company that had had "pretty uneven earnings" and had been accused of being "a price cutter." California is "a very tough market," he said.
But Dr. Hasan said that "most of our profits have been coming from California," where Qual Med had acquired three Northern California H.M.O.'s.

Bond Prices Jump on Housing Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday as yields flirted with new lows after an unexpectedly sharp decline in housing sales contributed to evidence that the economy remained stuck in low gear.
The report added to the optimism among investors in fixed-income securities ahead of key economic reports this week, including employment statistics for August due out Friday. 
 Investors, who have recently poured money into bonds, are betting that a slow-growth economy will dissuade the Federal Reserve from pushing interest rates higher. Higher rates hurt the value of investments with a fixed rate of return.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond, which dropped 3/4 point Friday, rose 3/8 point yesterday, or $3.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.11 percent, from 6.14 percent Friday.
The bond's record low yield of 6.09 percent was set last Thursday. It was the lowest since the Treasury began regularly selling 30-year bonds in 1977.
 
 
Light Volumn
 Yesterday's price rise came on light volume as many investors took a long vacation ahead of the Labor Day weekend. Many traders adjusted their positions to weed out riskier moves in anticipation that reports this week might generate price volatility.
But the market's dominant tone was bullish as investors remained confident that interest rates generally were headed lower in the current economic climate of slow inflation and anemic growth.
"We have a lot of data this week that could show pockets of adjustment," John Costas, head of government securities trading at First Boston, said. "But at the end of the day, the migration to lower yields will continue."
The Government is scheduled to revise its second-quarter gross domestic product figures today, the National Association of Purchasing Management will issue its report on industrial activity tomorrow, and the employment report will be released Friday.
 
 
New-Home Sales
 Yesterday, the Government reported new-home sales fell 5 percent in July to the lowest level since March, prompting investors to buy bonds and pushing their prices higher. Many economists expected a smaller decline in housing.
"The market seems to be driven by the perspective that the Fed will never move to raise the Federal funds rate, and this data helped to fuel that kind of thinking," Alan Levenson, money-market economist at UBS Securities, said.
In the Government's weekly bill auction, the Treasury sold $12 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.02 percent and a yield of 3.08 percent.
An additional $11.9 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.11 percent and a yield of 3.20 percent.
Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are sold.
Short-term Treasuries rose 1/8 to 5/32 of a point, and intermediate maturities rose 9/32 to 7/16 of a point, according to the Telerate financial information service.
Lehman Brothers' daily Treasury bond index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.99, to 1,328.62.
 
 
Secondary Trading
 In secondary trading, yields on three-month Treasury bills were lower at 3.07 percent as the discount dropped 0.02 percentage point, to 3.01 percent. Six-month yields were down at 3.18 percent as the discount fell 0.02 point, to 3.10 percent. One-year yields were lower at 3.35 percent as the discount fell 0.03 point, to 3.23 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 31/16 percent, up from 3 percent late Friday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 1043/32 , up 1/8 from late Friday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.61 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.237	98.428	Discounted Rate	3.02%	3.11%	Coupon Yield	3.08%	3.20%	High Price	99.242	98.438	Discounted Rate	3.00%	3.09%	Coupon Yield	3.06%	3.18%	Low Price	99.237	98.428	Discounted Rate	3.02%	3.11%	Coupon Yield	3.08%	3.20%	Accepted at low price	15%	17%	Total applied for	$58,864,619	$51,736,236	Accepted	$11,968,971	$11,895,388	N.Y. applied for	$54,353,891	$48,335,582	N.Y. accepted	$10,765,693	$10,902,262	Noncompetitive	$1,202,854	$944,513

Limited Inc. to Close and Scale Back Stores

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Limited Inc. has had enviable success building specialty-apparel chains -- so successful that the chains eventually began competing for the same customers.
Yesterday, moving to address those problems, the Limited announced that it would close as many as 100 Lerner New York stores and shut, scale down or remodel 260 of its Limited stores. 
 It also said it had re-evaluated the earnings and sales potential of some Limited, Lerner and Henri Bendel stores and other assets, and would record a charge against earnings to reduce their value to "an amount considered realizable in future periods." The company said it would take a $200 million pretax charge this year for the closings, remodeling and revaluation.
That charge will be offset by the sale of a 60 percent interest in the company's Brylane mail-order catalogue division, for $285 million. The Limited will realize a $203 million pretax gain from that sale to Freeman Spogli & Company, a Los Angeles-based merchant banker.
The Limited, with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, operates 12 specialty-store chains and the mail-order business. It said yesterday that it also planned to buy back as much as $500 million worth of its stock as market conditions warranted.
"Going forward, we believe this effort will bear fruit as we emphasize our best-performing stores and shed those assets that do not perform to our expectations and standards," Kenneth B. Gilman, Limited's vice chairman, said in a statement.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Gilman said the company would only close stores that were operating at a loss and were in locations unlikely to recover from the economic slump. There are more than 900 Lerner stores and about 650 Limited stores nationwide.
He said that as much as possible, employees affected would be offered jobs elsewhere in the company. The Limited plans to have 110,000 employees by the end of the year, compared with 100,000 at the end of 1992, and Mr. Gilman emphasized that its restructuring was not the usual kind -- that after it was done, the company would have more people, not fewer.
Analysts agreed that the move to eliminate stores showing poor financial performance was a positive step.
Heidi R. Steinberg, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, commented: "They're over-stored in the women's specialty-store business, and the divisions aren't differentiated enough. This is a move to correct some of that. In a time when the apparel business is especially competitive, I think it's positive that they're rethinking their strategy."
Another analyst, Jennifer Black Groves of Black & Company in Portland, Ore., said: "It shows they're putting an emphasis on their new businesses and slowly, gradually, closing the businesses that aren't performing well. It's an excellent move."
She added that the company now expects its square footage to increase about 7 percent this year instead of the 10 percent increase it had tentatively projected. She expected most of the new space to be given to fledgling businesses like Limited Too, which sells girls' clothes, and Bath & Body Works, a toiletries and cosmetics business.
The company made the announcement yesterday after the close of stock trading, in which its shares gained $1.375, to $23.675.
Both the Limited and Lerner New York chains have struggled in recent years, and to some extent the company's success has been its problem as well. The Limited lost many of its fashion-conscious younger customers to Express, another of its divisions, and has never quite succeeded in repositioning itself as a specialty store catering to career women. Lerner New York, once the specialty store of choice for women seeking inexpensive clothes to wear to the office, has tried with little success to reach out to shoppers with higher disposable incomes.
Structure, a young men's store, also took sales away from the older divisions.
Adding to the Limited's woes has been a broader decline in apparel sales, which has hurt many specialty-store chains.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Mixed Showing; Gold Prices Move Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted against other currencies in quiet trading yesterday as investors awaited several Government reports on the American economy.
In New York, the dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, ending trading at 103.80 yen, down from 103.85 yen on Friday. But the dollar rose to 1.6719 German marks, up from 1.6640 marks. It also posted gains against the British pound. 
 Gold prices rose yesterday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery, the active near-term futures contract, gained $1.20 an ounce, to $371.50. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $370.25 an ounce, up $1.
Currency traders said activity was limited since markets in Britain and Hong Kong were closed for holidays and many brokers were finishing their vacations. Dealers said trading was in a narrow range, mostly set off by technical factors.
"People are sitting back and waiting for the numbers at the end of the week," said David Durst, assistant vice president of Credit Lyonnais in New York.
Among the economic reports this week are the statistics on second-quarter gross domestic product, due out today, and the August employment figures, coming out on Friday.
Dealers said Japan's central bank bought dollars to support the American currency during Asian trading yesterday, as it has done repeatedly in recent weeks.
The British pound was quoted at $1.4930 in New York, down from $1.5035 on Friday.
Lisa Pazer, a currency specialist at MMS International in New York, said the pound retreated on expectations that British interest rates were about to drop. Declining interest rates usually weaken a currency, since investments in that currency earn less.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with those on Friday, included: 1.4725 Swiss francs, up from 1.4668; 5.8480 French francs, up from 5.8255; 1,600.75 Italian lire, up from 1,594.00, and 1.3218 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3183.

3 Japan Auto Makers' Debt on Credit Watch

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 30

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation placed more than $25 billion of debt of the top three Japanese auto makers on credit watch with negative implications today, in a move that could eventually raise the borrowing costs for the Japanese automobile industry.
S.& P.'s move was further verification of the deteriorating financial position of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Company, which have been hurt by the soaring value of the yen and sharper competition from Detroit's Big Three auto makers. 
 Moreover, the agency's action was a stunning turnaround for an industry that has been dominated for several years by negative ratings for Big Three debt securities. The ratings of Big Three auto makers, though not completely restored, have improved in recent months.
Japan's auto makers could decide to raise more capital in equity markets if the interest rate for future borrowing rises too high or if the ratings agencies put pressure on them to strengthen their balance sheets. But so far, the review is in an early phase and the companies' financial conditions, though diminished, are not in critical condition.
The stronger yen, which has risen about 17 percent in value over the last few months, has forced the Japanese auto makers to raise prices or suffer losses of market share. Last week, Toyota said it could suffer its first operating loss in the current fiscal year if the yen stays strong; Nissan posted a loss in its 1993 fiscal year ended in March, and Honda's profit in its first fiscal quarter ended in June was off 62 percent.
S.& P.'s credit watch covers $19 billion of Toyota's long-term debt and $6.5 billion of Nissan's long-term debt. The credit watch also covers the short-term obligations of all three auto makers, though the amount was not specified.
Besides losing ground in the United States, Japanese auto makers are facing weak demand in Japan and in Europe.
Seth Petok, a spokesman for Nissan, said. "While we are disappointed, our liquidity and ability to fund operations should not be affected negatively." Nissan's senior debt is rated A; the company's short-term rating for various financial subsidiaries is A-1.
James Olson, a Toyota spokesman, said the action would "have negligible effect on our cost of borrowings." Mr. Olson said he "presumed the credit watch is because of the projection of an operating loss." Toyota's long-term debt is rated AAA; the company's short-term debt is rated A-1-plus.
Honda, whose short-term debt is rated A-1, did not respond immediately to S.& P.'s announcement.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Drop Unexpectedly Steep 5%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes declined an unexpectedly steep 5 percent in July, the Government reported today, as the housing industry continued to perplex analysts with its erratic moves despite the lowest mortgage rates in more than two decades.
Some analysts contend that low consumer confidence in the economy and uncertainty over Federal policies are curbing housing activity, which otherwise might be stimulated by the low rates. 
 "It's not as if these numbers are weak, but they just don't have the snap one would like." said Robert G. Dederick, economist of the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "People continue to be concerned about whether they can meet their financial obligations."
Sales totaled 629,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, down from a revised 662,000 a month earlier, the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said. Activity declined in every region.
 
Lowest Since March
 Many analysts had predicted a dip of just 1 percent, saying the 3.3 percent jump in June could not be sustained. The decline, the fourth this year, pushed sales to the lowest level since they stood at 602,000 in March.
But Leonard Miller, chairman and president of the Lennar Corporation, a large home builder with headquarters in Miami, noted that even with the drop, sales during the first seven months of 1993 were 6.8 percent higher than those of the corresponding period last year.
He also said the inventory level of new homes for sale -- a 5.5-month supply at the current sales pace -- is historically low for this time of the housing cycle and should spur both sales and housing starts. Starts fell in both June and July.
And, Mr. Miller contended, sales of previously owned homes, which rose in July for the fourth straight month, "typically are a leading indicator of what's to be expected in the new-home market."
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.21 percent in July, down from 7.42 percent in June and the lowest since the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation began tracking rates in 1971.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Trade Deficit Widens
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 (AP) -- The United States trade deficit widened to $34.4 billion in the April-June quarter, the largest in five and a half years, as exports were swamped by record-high imports, the Commerce Department said today.
The gap was 17.3 percent bigger than the first-quarter deficit and marked the fourth deterioration in five quarters.
If the trade gap continues to widen at the pace of the first half, it will total $127.4 billion for the full year. That would be up sharply from $96.1 billion last year and the worst performance since 1987, when the trade gap peaked at $159.6 billion.
Analysts said growth in exports had virtually stalled because two prime markets for American goods -- Western Europe and Japan -- were in recession. At the same time, productivity-minded United States businesses have been turning abroad to buy computers and other equipment to hold down costs.

Broken Ankle in Final-Day Saratoga Spill Ends Krone's Year

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 30

 BODY:
Julie Krone suffered multiple fractures of the right ankle today during a violent spill on the final day of Saratoga's racing season and was not expected to ride again for the rest of this year and possibly longer.
The 30-year-old jockey, a tiny dynamo who has won riding titles at Belmont Park, Monmouth Park, Atlantic City and the Meadowlands, also suffered severe cuts and bruises on her left elbow. She underwent surgery at Saratoga Hospital to stabilize the ankle joint and will undergo more surgery in New York City to repair the fracture. 
 Krone was injured in the third race on the last day of the five-week season at Saratoga Race Course, a season that reached record levels of attendance and betting and saw the rise of new standout horses. One of them, the 2-year-old filly Strategic Maneuver, won her third straight race today when she took the Spinaway Stakes for juveniles. Meanwhile, Mike Smith won the riding title, beating Krone by four races, 40 to 36. And Bill Mott trained the most winners, 12, edging Leo O'Brien by 1.
But the festive mood of closing day at the 126-year-old country track was darkened by the injury to Krone, the 4-foot-10-inch, 100-pounder who has become the most successful female jockey in racing history and a national star. In June, she became the first woman to win a Triple Crown race when she captured the Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair.
It was her second spill of the season here, and the worst she had suffered since she fractured her left arm four years ago at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. After that accident, she needed eight months to recuperate before resuming her career with seven aluminum screws and a metal plate in her forearm.
She tumbled this time while riding the filly Seattle Way as they were rounding the turn into the homestretch on the outer grass course. Another filly crossed into their path, and Seattle Way clipped her heels and buckled, flinging Krone to the ground. Seattle Way then regained her balance, but lurched to the left and collided with Holly North, turning her into the hedge and throwing Jean-Luc Samyn onto the turf.
Samyn rolled to his feet and was unhurt, and the two fillies continued running with empty saddles. But Krone lay on the ground complaining of pain in her left arm and right leg, and then was taken to the hospital.
Dr. James Gallagher, the surgeon who performed the initial surgery, reported later: "She suffered a severely fractured right ankle, with fractures of both the tibia and fibula involving the ankle joint. She also has severe contusions and lacerations of the left elbow."
Neither he nor racing officials here would speculate on the damage to Krone's career. But she seemed certain to miss several months, with the likelihood that she would not return to racing before early next year.
 
$3.7 Million a Day Bet
 The injury overshadowed the booming business report issued as the curtain fell at Saratoga. On-track attendance rose by 3 percent and on-track betting by 8.7 percent, while the total betting handle at simulcast sites across the state soared by 9.2 percent.
During the 30 days of racing here, attendance averaged 26,176 at Saratoga and 7,145 at Aqueduct in Queens, where the upstate races were relayed by television. More than $3.7 million a day was bet at Saratoga, and more than $112 million for the five weeks. And the Saratoga races generated $322 million in bets on Saratoga races both at the track and elsewhere.
The star of the season, the juvenile colt Dehere, who swept three major stakes here in 32 days, was joined in the spotlight today by Strategic Maneuver, who won the opening-day Schuylerville Stakes to go along with the closing-day Spinaway and left town as the queen of the young fillies.
Strategic Maneuver, who is undefeated in her young career, was kept back in fifth place today by Jose Santos for half a mile but then kicked into gear as they turned into the stretch. She outran Astas Foxy Lady to the wire by 1 1/2 lengths, with Delta Lady nearly a length back in third. The 6-5 favorite, the previously unbeaten Cat Attack, retreated in the stretch and faded to fifth.
The winner, owned by Phil Teinowitz of Chicago and trained by Scotty Schulhofer, ran the six furlongs in 1:10 1/5 and paid $14 for every $2 bet. And she banked $120,000 of the purse of $200,000.
Schulhofer said that he would aim his prize filly for the Matron Stakes at Belmont on Sept. 18, a race that would extend her range to seven furlongs.
"She's got stamina," he said, "and she can go far, hopefully as far as a mile and a sixteenth."
 
FINISH LINES
 If five weeks is so successful, why not six? JERRY LAWRENCE, executive vice president of New York's major tracks, said that he doubted the Saratoga season would be expanded. "My gut feeling is we'll stay with five weeks next year," he said. "Why tamper with a good thing?" He also said that the business records set this summer were "tremendous," especially "with the unemployment in the Hudson Valley and with Indian-reservation gaming only 90 miles away."

HEADLINE: Science Takes a Lesson From Nature, Imitating Abalone and Spider Silk

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

 BODY:
INCREASINGLY, scientists designing new materials are looking to nature as a source of inspiration. In their search for ways to make substances that are harder, stronger, lighter and more durable, they are mimicking nature and enhancing it.
Some scientists have discovered how to "petrify" wood to make it more resistant to pests, while others are duplicating the multilayered structure of seashells to make new ceramics that are tough without being brittle. Still other researchers have recently made fundamental discoveries about spider web silk, capping decades of study and raising the hope of mass-producing threads stronger than Kevlar, the substance used to make bulletproof vests. And scientists have begun studies of reindeer antlers to see why this tough, light material absorbs shock so well. 
 The use of natural materials as models for new ones is revolutionizing material science itself, many researchers say, and expanding interest in the field among scientists in previously unrelated specialties like genetics, geology, botany and biochemistry.
"Material science has expanded in the last 10 years to become a cross-disciplinary area, with many specialties that you normally wouldn't think of merging into making new materials," said Dr. Ilhan A. Aksay, a professor of chemical engineering at the Materials Institute at Princeton University. "This collaboration will become more common in the next decade." The institute, he noted, now includes eight departments at the university.
A growing number of materials scientists are becoming involved in the field of biomimetics, the study of the structure and function of biological materials as models for artificially created ones. Researchers are taking two approaches to borrowing nature's designs. Either they want to understand the underlying biological processes in order to artificially re-create or improve them using other materials and techniques, or they want to duplicate the techniques organisms use to make desired substances.
Despite years of work and numerous recent advances, proponents of biomimetics caution that most practical applications may not come soon. The Federal Government has made materials science a priority, as part of its plan to bolster the country's economic competitiveness, but even though more money is becoming available for research, most of it is going to traditional endeavors, like producing new substances from exotic chemical mixtures or forging materials under high heat and pressure. Dr. Aksay and others said most of the fruits of biomimetics could be years, even decades, away and cautioned against unrealistic expectations.
The military, with its interest in developing tough but light materials for armor, clothing and other uses, has supported studies on biological materials for many years. Early this year, for example, the Defense Department agreed to spend up to $2 million over five years on ceramics and polymer research at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Princeton University and the University of Washington in Seattle. Their work will include studies of seashells and reindeer antlers.
"Nature has taken millions of years, producing literally millions of prototypes, to develop optimized structures with unusual characteristics," said Dr. Wilbur C. Simmons, a materials scientist at the Army Research Office in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which commissioned the new studies. "We need strong, lightweight, thin materials, and it makes sense to sponsor basic research that includes looking at natural materials."
Dr. Eric Baer, a professor of micromolecular science at Case Western Reserve University who heads a team that has begun examining reindeer antlers, said the material had the stiffness of bone but was tougher and more shock-resistant. Scientists say that antlers, which can grow an inch a day, get their unique properties from a complex layering of proteins and minerals. The researchers have an agreement with the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo to obtain antlers from its reindeer colony as they are shed.
"By studying the composite structure of antlers, we are trying to create synthetic material that is even better," Dr. Baer said. Antlers are prone to drying out and becoming brittle, so just reproducing antler material is not the goal of the research. "We can use synthetic components that are both water-insensitive and thermally more stable than the materials found in nature," he said.
Dr. Baer said natural materials exemplified an extremely precise control over their structure and composition at every scale, from the molecular level to the level that people can see and feel. He added that researchers must learn to understand this complex, hierarchical system of various-sized components, in which different characteristics relate to one another, if they hope to improve upon nature.
"We have to look at it from a systems point of view and not just look at individual components or characteristics," Dr. Baer said. "Then we will have more opportunities to make smart materials that have the desired properties we want."
 
From Shells to Advanced Ceramics
 Understanding materials formation at the microscopic level and below has enabled researchers to study the shells of sea animals and begin to make copies of these unusually tough structures. Dr. Aksay at Princeton and Dr. Mehmet Sarikaya, a visiting professor there, have found that abalone shell is made of micro-thin plates of calcium carbonate, the powdery component of chalk and antacid tablets, held together by a mortar of protein and sugars.
Using powerful transmission electron microscopes to study the structure in detail, the researchers found that the inner part of the shell -- the shiny mother-of-pearl section called nacre -- was made up of extremely thin layers of laminate. Microscopic stacks of overlapping, six-sided calcium carbonate bricks bound by an organic glue make the nacre as strong a material as the most advanced synthetic ceramics, Dr. Sarikaya said.
"Here we have chalk, but it is highly organized," Dr. Sarikaya said, noting that the shell's structure is 30 times stronger and tougher than the ordinary calcium carbonate made in the laboratory. Using the shell structure as a guide, the researchers said, they made layered materials using carbon, boron and aluminum mixtures that are 1.3 to 1.5 times as tough and strong as other ceramics made of these components. "We know we can do better than this, but we don't have the technology to make the layers of material as thin as they are in a sea shell," Dr. Sarikaya said.
Dr. Clement E. Furlong, a medical geneticist at the University of Washington, is working with the Princeton researchers on the protein "glue" that binds layers in abalone and nautilus shells together to form ceramic-polymer composite materials. Dr. Furlong is attempting to identify the proteins in the mortar and their structure, work that could lead to cloning the protein and making bacteria that could produce it in quantity. "We would also like to make antibody to the protein to see how the protein is organized in the shell matrix," he said. "You could do this by tagging the antibody with gold particles and when it attached to the protein, the gold particles would show up in the electron microscope and reveal the protein's structure."
Dr. Furlong said one reason he had started to collaborate with materials scientists was that their work with shells and other materials could increase the understanding of how human bone, a composite of organic and inorganic materials, is mineralized. "Not only are there potential applications to physiology and medicine, but some of the imaging equipment used in materials work might be adapted for human research," he said.
Another area of materials science that originated with nature is research into wood-ceramic composites, which are made by incorporating minerals into the structure of wood to impart hardness, strength or durability. The initial models for this research proved to be petrified wood and teak.
 
Making Stronger Wood
 Scientists, including some at the University of Washington and at Princeton, have been looking at ways to strengthen poor-quality woods to make them usable in areas of construction requiring durability or strength. Many new woods, genetically engineered to grow fast, are good only for pulp because their larger-than-normal cell sizes reduce their strength, researchers said.
Teak, long recognized for standing up well under saltwater and for its resistance to wood-eating organisms, has been known for centuries to contain silica and other minerals, which it absorbs through its roots and deposits in the walls of its cells. Silica, the main ingredient in beach sand, is one of the world's most common minerals.
"A number of trees and grasses, including teak and bamboo, have silica particles in them naturally," said Dr. Daniel M. Dabbs, a research scientist in chemical engineering at Princeton. "Teak and petrified wood gave us ideas about what could be done." Although petrified wood is mineralized, he said, researchers had not explored it extensively because the process of forming it took too long and they were looking for something that would work quickly.
The researchers tried feeding trees and grasses different mineral solutions to see if they would absorb them, but they also developed a more direct way to make wood tougher. They put it into a pressurized container and injected it with mixture of silica and alcohol. Many wood preservatives coat the surface of cellulose cells in wood, but the scientists found that their process forced the silica into the cell walls and hardened the wood throughout. The reinforced wood is up to 120 percent stronger than the original, scientists said. In addition, they said, tests show that if the wood was used for flooring, it did not dimple under foot traffic like the original soft wood.
"We also found that if we remove the organic component of this composite by burning away the wood at high temperatures, we get a ceramic skeleton left behind that has the structure and appearance of wood, except that it's bone white," Dr. Dabbs said. This ceramic "wood," which, he said, has the grain pattern of the original and can be stained and worked much like the original organic material, might be developed into fire-resistant building material or used to make dock or pier pilings that would resist water rot and the pests that bore into wood.
One of the most extensively studied natural materials has been spider silk. Researchers worldwide, including Dr. David Kaplan and his colleagues at the Natick Research, Development and Engineering Center of the Army in Massachusetts, where the gene for producing spider silk was cloned, have shown that the web threads are stronger than steel and more durable than nylon. For years, scientists have known the ingredients and composition of the water-soluble web fluid produced by spiders, but they say many mysteries remain to be solved before this knowledge can be translated into new materials.
 
Lessons From Silk
 "We are still in a fundamental stage of research and haven't learned to translate what we know into an artificial material yet," said Dr. Christopher Viney, a materials scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, "but the silks are teaching us about the molecular architecture needed for attaining strength and toughness in a material."
Dr. Viney, working with Dr. Kaplan and others, recently discovered that silk secreted by silkworms and spiders gains its unusual strength by temporarily becoming a liquid crystal. After spiders squirt their water-based web solution through a hole in their back, the researchers found, the liquid goes through a crystalline phase in which its molecules are pulled into rod-like shapes that point in the same direction. This molecular alignment continues as the silk dries and the material solidifies into a water-insoluble fiber.
"Spiders produce silk using water as a solvent in the open air, at ambient temperatures and pressure, and it goes through all these stages to become a stable, water-resistant web of great strength," Dr. Viney said. "Yet to produce a tough fiber like Kevlar, you have to make it under high pressure using concentrated sulfuric acid. We have a lot to learn."

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
And Reeves Re-created the Giants in His Image

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 30

 BODY:
Talk about shaking things up. Dan Reeves took hold of the Giants today, turned the team upside down and inside out, and when the smoke cleared a few notable veterans were packing their bags. The biggest name was Pepper Johnson, a Pro Bowler who has been to two Super Bowls. He found out today that when you battle the coach, the coach pretty much always wins. He is no longer a Giant and almost surely will never be again.
Today was cutdown day as the Giants trimmed their roster to 47 players. But this was actually more than a trimming of the roster, this was Reeves beginning to shape the team in his own image. It was simply one of the most amazing and stunning days in recent Giants history. 
 Said Johnson: "Everything has changed. It's the New Jersey Broncos."
Well, not quite. But Reeves definitely made some drastic changes today. In all the Giants cut 12 players, some of whom will be back when the roster, trimmed to 47 today, expands to 53 Tuesday. The players released were: running back O. J. Anderson, center Bart Oates, offensive tackle Jeff Novak, kicker Matt Bahr, wide receivers Joey Smith and Eric Weir, defensive linemen Eric Dorsey and Mark Flythe, Johnson, safety Lamar McGriggs, tight end John Brandes and cornerback Perry Williams.
 
'We Never Talked'
 The biggest shock was Johnson. "I felt it kind of building up," said Johnson, who has been with the Giants for eight seasons. "I read stuff in the paper about how Coach Reeves and I weren't getting along. I don't know if we didn't get along because we never talked.
"So I guess they just said, 'Let's kill the headache right now.' "
And that's apparently what the coaching staff thought Johnson was -- a migraine. So rather than ingesting Extra-Strength Tylenol they cut the ties -- and made a former Buffalo linebacker, Carlton Bailey, the starter in Johnson's place. A smart move? Certainly a gutsy one by Reeves, who doesn't like selfish players and apparently believed Johnson to be just that. Recently, Johnson had criticized the coaching staff for taking him out on passing situations.
"You have to make decisions based on what you think is best for your football team," said Reeves when asked about Johnson. "These 12 decisions are based on what we think is best. Certainly that decision was one of the ones along with six or seven other ones that were really more difficult because of the contributions they made here in the past and because of their ability to still play in the league. In order to move forward we have to make some of those types of decisions."
Reeves said he was sure that some of the cuts came as surprises to the players involved. "They wouldn't be the players that they have been if they didn't have a great deal of confidence in their own abilities," the coach said. "That's what makes it difficult and also doesn't make it right. For our sake, hopefully we are making the right decisions."
"You could tell they were down on me," said Johnson. "Watching film in the meetings, I would get criticized more for petty stuff." About some of his more flamboyant comments regarding the coaching staff, Johnson said: "I felt like no one knew what Pepper Johnson was capable of. So I certainly stayed in the coaches ears. Maybe I just complained too much."
 
Overrated and Critical
 The coaching staff believed that Johnson was not only overrated as a player but also overly critical of some of the staff's decisions. The team had attempted to trade Johnson all preseason -- with talks picking up last week -- but Johnson's contractual situation was holding up any possible deal. He was scheduled to make $1.2 million this year, but the sticking point was that he was going to be an unrestricted free agent after this season. Teams were afraid of picking him up and then having to negotiate with him next year; Johnson is also his own agent, which doesn't help.
"Coach Reeves said he tried to trade me but no one really wanted to take me because I'm in the last year of my contract," said Johnson.
Johnson is not likely to remain unemployed for long. One of the teams the Giants were talking trade with was Cleveland. He could well end up there with former Giants defensive coordinator and current Browns coach, Bill Belichick. The Browns' owner, Art Modell, said today that acquiring Johnson was something they were considering.
There is also the possibility of Bill Parcells and the New England Patriots picking him up, or even the Washington Redskins.
"If you were to tell me a month ago that I'd be here and Pepper wouldn't," said linebacker Steve DeOssie, who made it, "you'd have to check me into an asylum."
 
Others Will Return
 Some of the other players cut today are likely to be back with the Giants, and that's where it gets complicated. In addition to their 47-man rosters, all National Football League teams will get an additional six spots on Tuesday for a total roster of 53 players. Teams will also have a five-player developmental squad consisting of rookies and first-year players.
One player who definitely will be back is Oates. Williams will likely be back as well. The chances of both Anderson and Bahr returning are about 50-50. But Johnson, Dorsey, and McGriggs are done as Giants.
Since Anderson, Bahr, Williams, Oates, Dorsey, Johnson and Brandes all have at least four years in the league they are all unrestricted free agents and free to negotiate with any team.
"Talk to me tomorrow," said Bahr. "I'll either be putting my shoes on or packing them up."
"Surprised, yeah I was surprised," Oates said of being released. "I didn't expect it. I was playing pretty well. We had a discussion. I was encouraged by it. There's a legitimate shot at me being back. Then again, there are no guarantees in life."
Dorsey has been sidelined with hip problems for most of camp and has done next to nothing. A first-round draft choice in 1986, Dorsey started all 16 games last year but, again, the past means little to this administration. McGriggs, who appeared to have tears in his eyes as he walked to the parking lot after being informed, mysteriously went from competing with Myron Guyton for one of the safety spots to no job at all.
"He just said it was a tough decision and he hoped it didn't come back to haunt him," McGriggs said of Reeves. "He just wants everything brand new, I guess."
Johnson's tenure has been a rocky one under Reeves, but he has been a great player for the Giants, leading them in tackles four of the past five seasons. But Johnson feels his dismissal has as much to do with Bailey's three-year, $5.2 million salary (Bailey will get $3 million this year) as his outspokenness.
"They don't want to look bad," said Johnson. "If they pick up Bailey for all that money he's got to play."


GRAPHIC: Pepper Johnson, below, leads the list of giants who were released yesterday to get the team to the 47-player limit. Teams can expand their rosters to 53 today and some players are likely to re-sign with their respective teams after clearing waivers or as free agents, depending on years of service. Pepper Johnson won't be one of them. Comments by Mike Freeman. (Photograph by Ben Van Hook for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Air Force Drawing Flak Over 'SWAT Team' Plan

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN HOME AIR FORCE BASE, Idaho

 BODY:
As part of its reorganization after the cold war, the Air Force is creating a set of quick-response wings to dispatch to world crises on a moment's notice.
But Congressional auditors say the new units will cost $200 million to field and add little in combat ability. They have called on Defense Secretary Les Aspin to halt the plan until the Air Force conducts more studies. 
 At issue is how the Air Force can reorganize its warplanes to respond to emergencies faster and with more firepower. In the past, the Air Force has assigned one or two types of aircraft to a base to achieve economies of scale. Fighters were assigned to one base, bombers to another, and all were pulled together from around the country to form a composite wing when a crisis arose.
 
An Airborne SWAT Team
 But at this base on the high-desert plateau 50 miles southeast of Boise, the Air Force has permanently assigned a total of 55 planes -- F-15 and F-16 fighters, B-52 bombers and KC-135 refueling planes -- in an experiment that planners envision as an airborne SWAT team.
"Our mission will be to get in place fast, deter an attack or be prepared to fight for about seven days," said Brig. Gen. David J. McCloud, commander of the 366th Wing here.
As United States forces withdraw from overseas bases as part of the overall reduction in troops, commanders are reorganizing air and ground forces in particular to respond more quickly to crises around the world from bases in the United States.
The Air Force is planning three composite wings made up of dissimilar aircraft: the "air intervention" wing here and two others that would be coordinated with Army troops, one at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina and the other at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.
 
More Analysis Urged
 But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, says Air Force fighters, bombers and refueling planes already practice fighting together in regular exercises. In a report last May, the auditors contended that the Air Force "did not conduct sufficient analysis" before deciding to create the composite wings.
The idea of composite wings is not new. The Navy stations fighters and bombers aboard aircraft carriers. The Air Force had a composite strike force from 1955 to 1973 and sent it to Lebanon in 1958 to help preserve Lebanese independence. The strike force was discontinued because of budget pressures and opposition within the Air Force.
The latest version is the brainchild of Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, the Air Force Chief of Staff. General McPeak has shaken up the Air Force in several ways, from redesigning its uniforms to pushing generals out of Pentagon desk jobs and back into the field.
"There is a complex set of things going on in the Air Force to make it more relevant to new security challenges, and composite wings are only one such change," General McPeak said in a recent interview in Washington.
The General conceded that the composite wings might require some initial construction and equipment expenses, but he disputed the Congressional auditors charges that they would cost more to operate than a conventional wing. While he was careful not to claim too much credit for the combat abilities of the composite wings over conventional wings, he said their value might be even greater as training devices.
The wing here assembles a group of planes with disparate abilities. One type of fighter plane, the F-15C, for example, is a dogfighter, engaging enemy fighter planes at close quarters. The F-15E is typically used to drop laser-guided bombs at night, and the F-16 to bomb by day. The wing's B-52's, which train with the wing but are based at Castle Air Force Base in California, are even bigger bombers.
On a clear day recently over the bleak, wind-carved high desert of southern Idaho, eastern Oregon and northern Nevada, the fighters teamed up with a KC-135 to practice refueling.
In the back of the KC-135, a military version of a Boeing 707, Staff Sgt. Opie Flax lay flat on his stomach and peered out a triple-paned window to guide a 40-foot-long fuel boom nozzle into the open gas tank of a F-15E keeping pace just below him. The KC-135 can carry 23,000 gallons of jet fuel and pumps about 312 gallons a minute.
During combat missions the unarmed KC-135's fly on the outer edge of hostilities, acting as a flying gas station for the fighters, which typically carry about a two-hour supply of fuel.
In good weather, refueling at 330 miles an hour some 22,000 feet above the earth is a gracefully choreographed procedure. But at night, in stormy skies, the task can be grueling. Typically, tanker planes do not train regularly with the same group of fighters or bombers.
"We fly day to day like we'd fight in a war," said Sergeant Flax, a 27-year-old native of Turin, Iowa, as a topped-off F-15E peeled away from the tanker's disengaged boom.
Nonetheless, the composite wing still has shortcomings and extra costs. Maintenance buildings here for the new aircraft have had to be renovated. The one squadron of F-16's has the same advanced testing equipment that three squadrons would share in a conventional F-16 wing elsewhere.
The wing is also experiencing growing pains. It held its first major training exercise in June in Wisconsin, but the biggest test will be a four-week exercise in November. About 30 planes and more than 1,000 troops here will fly to an undisclosed Middle East country to deal with a mock crisis.
"Our biggest challenge is determining what we need to take with us," said Col. Robert L. Hart, the wing's logistics commander.

As a boom in legalized gambling rolls across America, no politician has stepped up to the table with more prescience and gusto than Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, a rather fabulous crapshooter who likes to risk $5,000 a roll in the casino and far more in the statehouse.
"Sounds like I won again," the gray-haired Governor declared with Cajun ease in his office this week. He had just learned that his threat to throw the gambling issue back to the machinations of the Legislature had prodded an end to a profit-sharing dispute among gambling entrepreneurs, clearing the way for the world's biggest casino to be built in New Orleans. 
 It will be a high-rise casino with 200,000 square feet of gambling space. Even more, it will serve as Mr. Edwards's personal monument and as a beacon for the future of urban American casinos as legislatures across the country feel the pressure to tap into the flow of gaming revenue by legalizing high-volume casinos before neighboring states do.
Legalized gambling has been feasting on the nation's hard economic times. Revenues tripled in the last decade and grew 12 percent last year to $29.9 billion. The New Orleans venture brings a new level to the competition, in which casinos on riverboats and Indian reservations have been spreading and putting pressure on state and city officials to open gaming halls.
"In my opinion, in the next 20 years every major metropolitan area in America with a population of a million or more will have some form of a casino," Governor Edwards, part seer, part crapshooter, declared in an interview during his jockeying to complete the New Orleans profit-sharing agreement. It calls for a temporary hall to be open for gambling by January while the high rise is being built.
The Governor's casino expertise is not easily doubted. For not only did his last tax return list three days' winnings of $185,000 from playing craps at Nevada casinos, but Mr. Edwards also shocked the state in broaching the New Orleans casino proposal seven years ago. That was a time when few politicians would take aim at the traditional American taboo against gambling.
But Mr. Edwards is a scarred, swashbuckling politician in the tradition of Louisiana's populist Long dynasty. He is silvery and courtly at wheeling and dealing, liltingly announcing, "A casino agreement has been confected," as if he were discussing a praline recipe.
At the age of 65, he has been such a hard-eyed victor in bare-fisted political showdowns and in racketeering trials of his own integrity that after 40 years of being on the stump and in the dock, he seems to exult in taking on "the drum beaters and the Bible thumpers," as he terms the opposition.
"I bet as much as $5,000 on a roll of the dice," said Mr. Edwards, speaking of his personal gambling habits that greatly fuel the opposition's warnings that the New Orleans project will cause new refinements in Louisiana's political corruption.
The Governor insists that it is illegal gambling that can corrupt politicians and that New Orleans's depressed economy will rebound with the help of the jobs at the casino, whose games, he says, will be well run -- of the sort he has patronized for decades in Nevada and, he boasts, has won at.
 
A Way With the Dice
 "I'm comfortable with telling you that if I put every nickel I lost in one tub and every nickel I won in another, the winning tub would be fuller than the losing tub," the Governor said. Yet he also cautions that his success is the exception in gambling and that he would not consider gambling a positive form of economic production if it were not for the state's need for revenue.
His two tubs of nickels would be huge. The Governor's way with dice was detailed in trials six years ago in which Mr. Edwards was twice accused but not convicted of racketeering. Federal prosecutors sought to show he owed $2 million in gambling debts, but casino officials testified that Mr. Edwards was a successful crapshooter who averaged $50,000 in winnings a night in 10 trips to one casino.
The Governor has vowed never to shoot craps at the New Orleans casino. "If I lost, people would think I was an idiot," he explained. "If I won, they'd think it was fixed."
Fool and fixer were some of the kinder criticisms heard last year when Mr. Edwards, out of office after three earlier terms, returned from political oblivion to defeat David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who polarized the state. Flush with fresh political chips, the Governor quickly revived the casino proposal, and his timing was perfect as neighboring states were busily launching a flotilla of riverboat casinos that have alarmed New Orleans tourist officials.
 
Counting the Money
 Under the approved plan, New Orleans is to get an annual rent of $30 million to $50 million from the casino, which is to be built in three years on the 6.5-acre site of the sparsely used Rivergate convention hall on the waterfront. The state is guaranteed a minimum of $100 million a year, but the Governor hopes the true value could exceed $300 million a year when sales and hotel taxes are figured in.
A high-stakes stalemate among the city, an independent state casino board and rival developers was settled this week when the Governor finally stepped in. The agreed-upon split of ownership was one he had previously advocated -- a one-third share each for Harrah's Casino Management, for the developer, Christopher B. Hemmeter, and for a group of city and state business leaders.
Until the agreement, the dice-loving Governor, bombarded in editorials, had made such a good-government show of standing aloof from the final selection of casino managers that some citizens got restless as the stalemate grew. "Well, if this is what we get when Edwards embraces good government, let us bring back the crook," wrote James Gill in The New Orleans Times-Picayune. "It's important."
Bluenoses were scandalized when Mr. Edwards showed up at the Nevada craps tables weeks after campaigning on self-reform promises. But to his fans, Fast Eddie remains admirably unapologetic about his taste for risk and his respect for money. "Money is money, and whether you lose it in a craps game or it falls out of your pocket, it's gone. It's not a good idea to lose money."
He remembers his first killing at craps in Las Vegas, Nev., in 1957. "I won $35," he said with a faint smile and steady gaze that might do well at a poker table. "I thought I was a king, and I've gone at least once a year ever since and my level of gaming has gone up consistent with my personal assets. I no longer get any enjoyment in winning $35, but I would be hurt if I lost $35.
"My father was a stern Presbyterian who hated tobacco, alcohol and gambling. And I took his advice on two of them. My mother's a Catholic girl and enjoys a drink or two, although she's 86 years old. She smoked when she was a younger woman and loves to play bouree, a Cajun card game similar to bridge, a trump game, at two cents, a nickel, something like that," he added, looking proud that she appreciates cash stakes.
He describes himself as a very disciplined gambler. He shoots craps perhaps four or five times a day for no more than 30 minutes a sitting during Nevada visits that are now limited to New Year's vacation time.
Looking delighted with life's many turns of chance, Mr. Edwards invites others to try their luck soon at the New Orleans tables that he first envisioned. "It was one of the many times I was able see things that were unfolding in advance," the Governor said with the immodesty of a gambler on a roll.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I would like to amplify the observations of Lee van Laer in "Computers Alter the Job Market Forever" (letter, Aug. 16) about computers and their impact on publishing.
Twenty years ago I worked at a typesetting house just as "cold type" was vanquishing legions of linotype operators using the "hot type" method. At our house, a typewritten manuscript from a publisher's editorial department would pass through an assembly line of typists, proofreaders, page makers and camera operators. About 50 people, including management and secretarial staff, were churning out a much larger volume of type at a much lower cost than a similar-size staff using hot type. 
 A few years later, electromechanical phototypesetters automatically set type in place on the page. Now a few programmers could do tasks that had required dozens of page makers working at drafting tables. The higher speed and improved automation of the machines meant that only one or two operators were needed to run several machines to set the type that just a few years earlier had required many times the equipment, time, floor space and staff.
In the last decade, rapid advances in personal computer hardware, desktop publishing software and telecommunications have reduced staff needs even more dramatically. In other words, the number of people involved in transforming a manuscript into typeset pages ready for the printer has gone from scores of employees working in a small- to medium-size production facility, to a single freelancer working at home with a personal computer.
This one person can match all the services, if not the volume, of a large operation. Capable of receiving manuscripts electronically over the phone from book publishers, the freelancer can edit and typeset the manuscript, then forward the final pages, again electronically, to a printer. And the future? If authors are computer-literate and use increasingly sophisticated software that checks spelling and grammar, why send the manuscript through the extra step of the freelance copy editor-typesetter?
To go a step further, if authors are someday aided, as I am certain that they will be, by expert system software that offers editorial, business and marketing advice, why go through a publisher?
Finally, if the electronic superhighway becomes an easily accessible link to millions of others worldwide, why go through a printer, distributer and bookstore?
We are in the midst of a revolution no less historic -- economically, socially and politically -- than the one Gutenberg started when he worked out the major bugs in movable type 500 years ago.

HEADLINE: Take Firmer Line With China on Missiles

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"U.S. Determines China Violated Pact on Missiles"(front page, Aug. 25) details the impending imposition of United States sanctions on China for its sale of M-11 missile technology to Pakistan. Your report refers three times to the Missile Technology Control Regime as a "treaty," although it is actually an agreement that is not legally binding upon the nations that subscribe to its terms. 
 Because of the Missile Technology Control Regime's odd legal status, each participant to the agreement makes its own determination about what constitutes a violation.
Whereas the M-11 does not violate the Missile Technology Control Regime's restrictions on payload and range (a missile cannot be transferred if it can carry a warhead with a payload of 1,340 pounds a distance of at least 186 miles), the M-11 could be armed with a nuclear warhead, thus bringing it under the scope of the technology agreement.
In contrast to the business-as-usual posture the Bush Administration took toward China, the Clinton Administration has acted aggressively to discourage the proliferaton of Chinese missiles. However, by failing to impose the harshest sanctions because "the Chinese had not shipped actual missiles, but rather technology that would allow Pakistan to build M-11 missiles," the Clinton Administration exhibits the same shortsightedness as its predecessor did.
Technology transfers such as these will in the long run do more damage to United States security interests by increasing the number of proliferaters. Of course, to echo John Maynard Keynes, in the long run we'll all be dead anyway.

HEADLINE: Teachers Approve a Tentative Contract

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins and the leaders of the union representing 65,000 public-school teachers said yesterday that they had reached a tentative agreement on a new four-year contract calling for raises averaging 9 percent over the length of the deal.
The tentative settlement, reached on the eve of both a new school year and the general election campaign, could help Mr. Dinkins win the endorsement of the powerful union, the United Federation of Teachers. Mr. Dinkins was elected four years ago with the enthusiastic support of the union, which also represents 20,000 guidance counselors, teachers' aides, secretaries and other employees of the New York City school system. 
 Sandra Feldman, the president of the union, which spent $1 million on television commercials last winter and spring that were very critical of the Mayor, said there was no political quid pro quo with Mr. Dinkins on the tentative labor accord.
But the contract would end more than two years of difficult and sometimes bitter negotiations -- the teachers' last contract expired on Oct. 1, 1991 -- and if the rank and file ratify it, the union leadership is likely to feel more inclined to support Mr. Dinkins.
 
Ratification Expected
 The proposed contract will go to the union's delegate assembly for a vote tomorrow, said Ron Davis, a union spokesman. A vote by the union's full membership has not yet been scheduled, but will take place after the start of school, Mr. Davis said.
"I believe the contract will be accepted and will be ratified," Ms. Feldman said at a City Hall news conference.
Despite occasional efforts by union leaders over the last year to suggest that they were considering endorsing the Mayor's Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, many politicians have speculated that the teachers' union would withhold an endorsement in the mayoral race if its disappointment over the stalled contract talks prevented it from supporting Mr. Dinkins again.
The tentative agreement announced at midday yesterday at City Hall is similar to other recent municipal labor contracts, particularly one reached last January with a coalition of 19 unions that represents most of the city's civilian employees other than the teachers.
That settlement called for a raise of 8.25 percent over 39 months for about 180,000 workers. The teachers' contract would be for a longer time -- 48 and a half months -- and provide a raise averaging 9 percent.
By tentatively accepting a longer contract and by agreeing not to have all teachers share equally in the raise over the contract's final nine and a half months, the teachers' union won a long-sought concession from the Dinkins administration: The top scale for the most experienced teachers would rise much more quickly than average teacher salaries.
 
Top Salaries at Issue
 The union has argued for the last few years that the top teachers' salary -- now $52,750 a year -- was much smaller than top salaries for teachers in many other school districts in the metropolitan region. The maximum salary would rise to $60,000 a year in April 1995 under the proposed contract. By comparison, the top teacher salary in Yonkers was $60,000 for the 1992-93 school year, and will rise to $63,000 this year.
Starting salaries in New York, which increased sharply in the last few teachers' contracts, would rise much more slowly. The beginning salary, which is now $26,375, would increase to $28,749 in 1995.
To qualify for the top salary, teachers must have 20 years' experience, a master's degree, and have earned 30 additional credits beyond a master's. City officials estimated that about 14,000 to 15,000 teachers would qualify for the $60,000 maximum salary.
The tentative contract has other features similar to those in the contract reached with the coalition of civilian unions. The teachers' contract, which would be retroactive to October 1991, would contain no raise for the first 18 months, a concession to the city's difficult fiscal condition.
The teachers would then receive a series of raises, the first of which would be retroactive to last April. The contract would expire on Oct. 15, 1995.
Senior mayoral advisers said that the accord would not have an immediate effect on the current year's city budget, which already anticipates a teachers' contract similar to the other contracts negotiated this year.
"This agreement," Mr. Dinkins said, "is a responsible economic settlement both in terms of fairly compensating public school teachers for the important work they do and remaining within the fiscal parameters we have established for all recent labor settlements."
 
'Not a Bad Settlement'
 Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the city's fiscal affairs, called the accord "not a bad settlement," one that on average would likely be close to the rate of inflation.
"It's reasonable fiscally," Mr. Horton said. "It doesn't get to the key issue of labor productivity, but neither have any of the other labor settlements."
The talks had been stalled for months, eventually going to mediation and then nonbinding arbitration, because the United Federation of Teachers had sought a better financial package than the one accepted by the other civilian unions.
The city had sought to reduce the number of preparation periods allotted to teachers, to increase teaching time and to eliminate sabbatical leaves. The union had sought salary increases significantly higher than those won by other municipal unions.
The agreement would give teachers in about 200 elementary schools five preparation periods a week, two more than they have now. The union also agreed to join the city in supporting proposed state legislation to extend the statue of limitations for disciplinary cases involving elementary and junior high school teachers to three years from the current six months. The limit is now three years in the city's high schools.
The accord also would eliminate the accrual of sick leave by teacherson sabbatical and allow for more involvement by parents in school-based management teams. Under the previous contract, the majority of the team members had to be teachers.
 
Pressure for a Deal
 There was considerable pressure on the Mayor and union leaders to reach the tentative agreement. Mr. Dinkins, of course, hoped to settle with the union in time to win their endorsement for his re-election, and Ms. Feldman and other union leaders did not want to start another school year without a contract. The union's members voted last June to authorize a strike at an unspecified time after school resumed in September.
The Mayor denied that politics had motivated the timing of the accord. "If it had been politically motivated, I certainly would have agreed to it long before the U.F.T. spent $1 million in a month of ads against me," he said. "Sandy Feldman and her people did what they thought was best for the teachers, and I respect them for it. And I did what I thought was best for the seven and a half to eight million people of New York."

HEADLINE: The President of Visa U.S.A. Resigns in a Surprise Move

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
In a surprise move, the president and chief executive of Visa U.S.A., H. Robert Heller, said yesterday that he had resigned from the credit card organization.
Mr. Heller, 53, had been widely seen as the successor to Charles T. Russell, the president and chief executive of Visa International, who is 63. Visa U.S.A. is one of the five regional organizations under Visa International, which is based in San Mateo, Calif. 
 Visa said yesterday that Carl Pascarella, the president of its Asia-Pacific region, would take over Mr. Heller's post at Visa U.S.A. The changes followed a meeting of Visa U.S.A.'s board in Dallas.
Mr. Heller said in a statement that he was leaving to pursue other interests, but several credit card industry experts said it was more likely that Mr. Heller was forced out because the board of Visa was dissatisfied with his leadership.
"Bob Heller didn't do the wrong thing; he just didn't act," said Allen DeCotiis, president of Payment Systems Inc., a Tampa, Fla., research company. "Visa was concerned they were losing position in the marketplace. Mastercard was taking the initiative, and Visa didn't want to stand by and let them catch up."
Mr. Heller was a governor of the Federal Reserve Board until he joined Visa in 1989. Before that, he was chief economist for the BankAmerica Corporation.
Visa is an association that allows its member banks to issue credit cards with its name on them, and it runs a vast electronic network to process credit card transactions.
Visa has long been the leading brand of credit cards in the United States, but recently it has lost some market share to Mastercard International, which is also an association of banks.
Mastercard has been eager to work with nonbanking companies like A.T.& T. and General Motors that want to offer credit cards tied to their other products. Visa, which is more closely aligned with the big banks, at first fought this trend, but has recently done an embarrassing about-face.
Visa, however, has significantly outpaced Mastercard in getting banks to offer its version of a debit card, which enables customers to make purchases with money drawn from their checking accounts.
Some bankers thought Mr. Heller did not have the leadership skill to draw together the fractious association that, after all, is made up of banks that compete with one another.
"It's never been more important for Visa to communicate with its membership in a warm yet strong manner, and there is a feeling that some other executive might better serve the association," said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card newsletter.
In particular, the emergence of debit cards puts a premium on salesmanship, because banks generally will pick the debit card program of one of the two associations. In credit cards, most banks issue both Visa and Mastercard cards.
Mr. Pascarella, 50, is widely considered one of Visa's ablest managers, managing rapid growth of its Asian card base.
"When he started, Visa was behind Mastercard in Asia," Mr. Robertson said. "By the time he left, it was ahead. He was able to find ways to keep the membership happy and to pump out the Visa cards." Indeed, he pushed Visa into linking up with merchants in Asia even as the association was fighting that trend in the United States.
Mr. Pascarella was considered to be a leading candidate for the Visa U.S.A. job several years ago, but he was passed over for Mr. Heller, an outsider who was seen as having greater stature. But Mr. Heller kept the detachment of an economist, in the view of many Visa members, and he did not exhibit a passion for the marketing or other details of the payment business.
The move back to the United States makes Mr. Pascarella the leading candidate to replace Mr. Russell, industry experts said.
Before Mr. Pascarella joined Visa in 1983, he was vice president of the international division of Crocker National Bank of San Francisco.
A Visa spokesman said that Mr. Heller, Mr. Pascarella and Mr. Russell were not available to comment last evening.

HEADLINE: Where Politics and Poverty Intersect In Nicaragua, Signposts Are Missing

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA ESPERANZA, Nicaragua, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Like any Nicaraguan who is 73 years old, Juan Mayrena has known an unusual amount of revolution and war. He says it is always the same.
"They kill the boys, then they come and dump their bodies here," he said.
But Mr. Mayrena says he has never seen things as cruel as they have gotten on the sprawling hacienda that gives this hamlet its name, which means hope. 
 The cotton crops have disappeared as prices have dropped below the costs of production. There is no work in the nearby city of Leon, because tens of thousands of people have already been laid off by failing companies and the shrinking state bureaucracy. Mr. Mayrena and his large family now eat little more than sorghum tortillas, and the children look skeletal.
 
The People Are Tired
 After the 1979 Sandinista revolution against the dictator Anastasio Somoza and the Sandinistas' electoral defeat by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in 1990, many people here are weary of turmoil and conclude that kicking out another government will not necessarily help.
But Mr. Mayrena suspects that men with guns will come around again, perhaps soon, and that the choice of whether to join them will not be easy.
"We cannot tolerate this anymore," he said.
In Nicaragua, as elsewhere in Central America, the problems that fueled years of civil war -- implacable poverty, political intolerance, feeble state institutions -- have easily survived the cold war.
 
The People Are Armed
 But the new cycle of political instability and economic decline here has taken hold of a country far more politicized and full of guns than the one that existed before the Sandinista revolution. And that has led many people to fear renewed conflict on a much wider, less ideological scale.
"This is not a Sandinista thing," said Porfirio Gamez, 35, a former Sandinista official who has organized a group in Leon that represents former combatants on both sides of the war and tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs. "This is the poor people coming together against the rich."
President Chamorro's term expires in 1996, and her political future may depend on her ability to negotiate with both the Sandinistas and the center-right parties. Bitter differences among the three sides have paralyzed politics for months, aggravating the polarization and uncertainty that have discouraged the investment that Nicaragua badly needs.
"I feel like we are on the edge of the cliff," said the former Sandinista Vice President, Sergio Ramirez Mercado. "If there is no understanding here, the next step is down."
 
The Prosperity Is Deceptive
 Managua in particular shows some signs of flourishing. With more wealthy Nicaraguans drawing on their bank accounts overseas and sinking their money into the local economy, and with new credits from the Government, shops selling everything from frozen yogurt to cellular telephones have begun to fill the vast empty spaces left by the devastating earthquake that struck the capital in 1972. New Toyota Land Cruisers seem to outnumber the old Soviet-built Ladas.
But a deepening poverty is also more and more visible. Beggars work the intersections, jostling for attention with candy vendors, windshield washers and people selling any item of possible value. Street crime is rising. Squatter settlements have proliferated, and in the evenings they disgorge young women in party dresses, off to join a flourishing trade in prostitution.
"War, hurricane, earthquake, tidal wave -- Nicaragua has suffered all of that," said Rosa Mercedes Lopez, 28, who lives with her husband and four children in a slum on the edge of Managua. "Now there is real hunger."
After 10 years of a government that seized power in the name of social justice and tried to achieve it by confiscating thousands of properties from the wealthy, subsidizing the poor with foreign aid and virtually eliminating imports of luxury goods, the change under President Chamorro has left many angry.
"There is an incredible resentment here," said Omar Estrada, 32, an official of the telephone workers' union in Leon. "When we see all of these cars and these bourgeois people, it bothers us like hell."
Following deep cuts in Government spending, the privatization of 300 state-owned companies and the closing of scores more, unemployment and underemployment afflict 60 percent of the work force. Per-capita income was $459 last year, less than a third what it was in the mid-1970's.
Teachers, who earn about $70 a month, say more and more children are dropping out to help support their families. Because of sweeping cuts in the health budget, even the most indigent are being asked to contribute to the cost of their care.
 
The Medical Care Is Faltering
 Maria Auxiliadora Morales, 24, told of an all-night standoff in a Government hospital this month as she pleaded for medicine for her screaming 9-month-old son, who had bronchitis.
"They told me, 'You are going to let that kid die if you don't pay for the shots,' but I didn't have any money," she recalled.
Finally, the next morning, two injections were given free. But she had to pay about $1.40 each for five others. On a good day, her husband earns $3 or $4 selling visa-request forms outside the United States Embassy.
At another Government pediatric hospital in the city, the director, Julio J. Otero, said that his modest budget had been cut by nearly two-thirds over the last few years, and that many nurses, who earned about $65 a month, had quit to sell chewing gum and other items on the street.
 
The Accusations Are Flying
 Leaders of the Sandinista Front argue that Mrs. Chamorro's Government has been intimidated into unrealistic austerity policies by the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. Other critics accuse the Government of mismanaging more than $2 billion in foreign aid and forgiven loans.
Defending their record, Government officials point to the obstacles they inherited.
"People in Nicaragua have gotten it confused," said the Finance Minister, Emilio A. Pereira. "They think it is the economic policy that is tough. It is the reality that is tough."
Having taken over a foreign debt that had swelled to $10.8 billion from $1.6 billion under the Sandinistas and an economy that had contracted steadily for six years, the Chamorro Government undertook radical restructuring. Arrears were cleared up with foreign banks, the budget deficit was eliminated and inflation was cut to 3.5 percent last year.
Most state-owned companies have been sold to private investors, trade barriers are lower and credits are available for imports, but only about $400 million in private investment has flowed into the economy.
The newly private industries have found themselves saddled with far more debts than expected. Market prices for key exports like cotton and coffee have fallen steadily. Mr. Pereira, the Finance Minister, estimated that $100 million was squandered in bad loans by state banks.
There is wide agreement that the greatest impediments to investment have been the Government's inability to resolve more than a fraction of the hundreds of ownership claims on property that the Sandinistas confiscated, and the deepening political strife that the property question, among other issues, has brought on.
"I think we were somewhat naive in thinking that with a change in Government, things would pick up more easily than they have," said the Inter-American Development Bank's representative in Managua, Joel A. Riley. "There has to be a major sign of some sort -- political or other -- to turn around Nicaragua's image abroad, because private investment is the only way to put this back together again."
 
U.S. Aid Is in Jeopardy
 Adding to the uncertainty is a threat that $98 million in United States aid might be cut off because of concern that the Sandinista leaders of the Army might have helped foreign terrorists. The Senate voted to halt the aid after the discovery of a weapons cache in Managua in May that seemed to link the Sandinistas to various terrorist groups; a House vote is expected soon.
The Government hopes to start talks in early September on a new consensus on economic policy. But there are serious questions about whether President Chamorro's leadership is strong enough to bring her opponents together for measures as drastic as many economists say she must take.
Sandinista and conservative leaders say they will push for more loans for businesses and farms, and the left has insisted on emergency social spending. But Mr. Pereira said he hoped to convince the Government's opponents of the need for further budget cuts.
But on Hacienda La Esperanza, the perception is that in so many years of violence and revolution, the political leaders had learned nothing about the need for everyone to live decently.
 
The Man Who Did Not Suffer
 But the peasants reserve most of their bitterness for the new manager of the hacienda, Oscar Galo, a 28-year-old with an M.B.A., who they said did not seem to care if they lived or died.
"The revolution's over," Mr. Galo said in English. "We can't pay people to sit around."
He admitted that he didn't pay much mind to how the laid-off workers were doing. But he added that he felt things around the farm had calmed down.
Ofelia Mungia, 35, one of Mr. Mayrena's neighbors, did not think so.
"The rich people used to make big, big money," she said. "They know that's not going to happen anymore, so they are just squeezing us out. That kid -- they have put him here to punish us. The problem is, he has never suffered like this."

 CORRECTION:
A map on Aug. 31 with an article about politics and poverty in Nicaragua showed an incorrect location for La Esperanza, one site of desperation. As noted in the article, it is just outside Leon, about 20 miles northeast of that city (not 200 miles).
